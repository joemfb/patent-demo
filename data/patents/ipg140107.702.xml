<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method to control environmental parameters of pre-defined zones within an environment using an electronic controller. An electronic controller monitors a loop temperature of a loop field of a geo-thermal heat pump as detected by a temperature sensor connected to the loop field. The electronic controller selects a staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and an auxiliary HVAC equipment based on at least the loop temperature. The electronic controller activates the selected staging combination, to modify at least a portion of the environmental parameters, using non-proprietary activating signals provided by the electronic controller.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Certain embodiments of the present invention relate to zoned control of an environment. More particularly, certain embodiments of the present invention relate to a system and method to control environmental parameters of pre-defined zones within an environment using an electronic controller and weighted zones.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The cooling and heating of commercial buildings and residential homes is typically accomplished via forced air and forced hot or cooled water distribution systems. A furnace, heat pump, other fossil fuel furnace, and/or air conditioner are typically used to supply heated air or cooled air to areas of the building or home via ducts. Such distribution systems are often controlled by a single thermostat which is centrally located within the building or home. A person sets the thermostat to a particular temperature setting. When the temperature measured by the thermostat deviates a pre-defined amount from the set temperature, a furnace, heat pump, other fossil fuel furnace, or air conditioner is turned on to provide heated or cooled air to the various regions of the building or home via the duct work or water lines.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Even though the desired temperature may be achieved at the location of the thermostat, the resultant temperatures in the various other regions of the building or home may still deviate quite a bit from this desired temperature. Therefore, a single centrally located thermostat likely will not provide adequate temperature control for individual rooms and areas. In an attempt to address this problem, duct work and valves throughout the building or home are fitted with manually adjustable registers or dampers which help to control the flow of air to the various regions. The dampers and valves are typically each adjusted to a single position and left in that state. Such an adjustment may be fine for a particular time of year, outside temperature level, and humidity level, but is likely not optimal for most other times of the year and other temperature and humidity levels. Furthermore, such an adjustment may only be fine for a particular time of day due to the internal and external daily load variances that occur depending on, for example, the position of the sun, whether or not lights are on, and how many people are in a particular area. It is often time consuming and difficult to re-adjust the dampers and valves for optimal comfort level.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The industry has developed multi-zone control systems in an attempt to better control the environmental parameters in each room or region of a home or building, for example, by placing thermostats in each larger room or groups of rooms. However, such systems to date have not been flexible enough to be entirely successful. For example, if a thermostat in a first room calls for heat, a furnace may be turned on to provide the heat. However, some of this heat may still be getting distributed to other rooms which do not presently require heat. As a result, these other rooms may become uncomfortably warm. Having multiple furnaces, air conditioners, and/or heat pumps which are connected to different thermostats and service only certain rooms may help this problem, however, this tends to be an expensive solution due to the extra equipment required and resulting service charges.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Heat pumps are relatively inexpensive to operate and can both heat air and cool air. Heat pumps use a refrigeration system to cool air and use the same refrigeration system run in reverse to heat air. Environmental control of several zones via heat pumps typically calls for a separate heat pump and thermostat for each zone or installation of a multi-zone system as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing discussion, it is apparent that there is a need for a more efficient way of controlling the distribution of air and environmental parameters for several zones in a building or home.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional, traditional, and proposed approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems and methods with the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An embodiment of the present invention comprises a method to control environmental parameters of pre-defined zones within a first environment using an electronic controller. The environmental parameters may include, for example, temperature, humidity, and air flow. The method includes the electronic controller monitoring a loop temperature of a loop field of a geo-thermal heat pump detected by a temperature sensor operatively connected to the loop field. The method further includes the electronic controller selecting a staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and an auxiliary HVAC equipment based on at least the loop temperature. The auxiliary HVAC equipment may include a gas furnace, a propane heater, an oil furnace, a resistive heating strip, an air conditioning unit, a humidifier, and a de-humidifier, for example. The method also includes the electronic controller activating the selected staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment, to modify at least a portion of the environmental parameters, using non-proprietary activating signals provided by the electronic controller. Each of the pre-defined zones may have an associated duct work capacity, where the electronic controller stores a weighting value for each of the pre-defined zones representative of the associated duct work capacity of each of the pre-defined zones. The method may further include the electronic controller detecting any zone service calls from sensor devices associated with each of the pre-defined zones. The zone service calls may include, for example, a heating call, a cooling call, a humidification call, a de-humidification call, and a fan-only call. The sensor devices associated with each of the pre-defined zones may include, for example, at least one of a thermostat, a humidistat, and a de-humidistat. The method may also include the electronic controller transforming the detected zone service calls and the weighting value of each of the pre-defined zones associated with the detected zone service calls into a cumulative zone weighting value representative of a cumulative duct work capacity of the pre-defined zones associated with the detected zone service calls. The method may further include the electronic controller selecting an air handler stage of an air handler from at least two air handler stages in response to at least the cumulative zone weighting value, and activating the selected air handler stage. The method may also include the electronic controller activating at least one duct work air damper device of the pre-defined zones associated with the detected zone service calls. The method may further include the electronic controller selecting the staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment based further on a change (&#x394;T) in a leaving air temperature (LAT) of an air handler. The method may also include the electronic controller selecting the staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment based further on an outside air temperature (OAT) of a second environment which is external to the first environment. The method may further include the electronic controller selecting the staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment based further on the cumulative zone weighting value. The method may further include the electronic controller selecting the staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment based further on a time-out signal derived from a clock of the electronic controller.</p>

The electronic controller is also configured for activating the selected staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment, to modify at least a portion of the environmental parameters, using non-proprietary activating signals provided by the electronic controller. Each of the pre-defined zones has an associated duct work capacity. A weighting value is assigned and stored on the electronic controller for each of the pre-defined zones representative of the associated duct work capacity of each of the pre-defined zones. The electronic controller is further configured for detecting any zone service calls from sensor devices associated with each of the pre-defined zones. The zone service calls may include, for example, a heating call, a cooling call, a humidification call, a de-humidification call, and a fan-only call. The sensor devices associated with each of the pre-defined zones may include, for example, at least one of a thermostat, a humidistat, and a de-humidistat. The electronic controller is also configured for transforming the detected zone service calls and the weighting value of each of the pre-defined zones associated with the detected zone service calls into a cumulative zone weighting value representative of a cumulative duct work capacity of the pre-defined zones associated with the detected zone service calls. The electronic controller is further configured for selecting an air handler stage from at least two air handler stages of an air handler in response to at least the cumulative zone weighting value, and activating the selected air handler stage. The electronic controller may also be configured for activating at least one duct work air damper device of the pre-defined zones associated with the detected zone service calls. The electronic controller may further include a real-time clock providing for the logging of data and time duration monitoring. The electronic controller may also include at least one programmable dry contact relay providing interaction with a non-HVAC system. The electronic controller may further include a USB port interface providing flash drive reading/writing capability. The electronic controller may also be configured for selecting the staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment based further on a change (&#x394;T) in a leaving air temperature (LAT) of the air handler. The electronic controller may also be configured for selecting the staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment based further on an outside air temperature (OAT) of a second environment which is external to the first environment. The electronic controller may also be configured for selecting the staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment based further on the cumulative zone weighting value. The electronic controller may also be configured for selecting the staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment based further on a time-out signal derived from a clock of the electronic controller.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an electronic controller has been designed to optimize the operation of heating and air conditioning equipment. The electronic controller refines control of the equipment by bringing on only specific subsystem stages of the heating and cooling equipment, depending on the demand from the environmental sensors, the loop temperature, the outside air temperature, the temperature of the air leaving the equipment, and the electric utility efficiency programs. The electronic controller allows the available airflow to be concentrated to the areas where there is a current demand for heating, cooling, or ventilation by controlling a set of air-driven zone dampers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of the present invention provide the ability to choose between more distinct operating modes for the heating and cooling equipment than has typically been contemplated in the past. Embodiments of the present invention provide algorithms to incorporate humidification and dehumidification equipment and techniques that have not typically been a part of a zoning system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a plain English &#x201c;setup wizard&#x201d; is provided as part of the controller which allows HVAC installers to configure the system quickly and easily for any system. That is, the controller is a non-proprietary controller that is designed to be configured for and useable with any standard forced air system. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, simple and inexpensive standard heat/cool thermostats are used on predefined zones <b>2</b> through <b>4</b> to make installation easier (e.g., single stage thermostats). Zones <b>2</b>-<b>4</b>, using simple thermostats, depend more on the controller for zone control. That is, the simple single stage thermostats can only tell the controller if its zone needs heating or cooling. The simple thermostats cannot tell the controller how much heating or cooling is needed or that a zone still needs more heating or cooling. Embodiments of the present invention allow installers to use any thermostat, either heat pump or heat/cool on a predefined zone <b>1</b> (e.g., a smarter more complex multi-stage thermostat with emergency or auxiliary heat capability, or a simple thermostat as used on zones <b>2</b>-<b>4</b>). As a result, the installer is able to take advantage of certain advanced features built into today's modern thermostats. Installers may also use wireless, auto changeover, single- or two-stage thermostats, or any thermostat that provides installer with the level of control which they desire.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As used herein, the term &#x201c;non-proprietary&#x201d; means useable with any standard commercial forced air system (e.g., any standard commercial heat pump system). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a schematic block diagram of an example embodiment of a system <b>100</b> to control environmental parameters of pre-defined zones within a first environment, in accordance with various aspects of the present invention. The system <b>100</b> includes a control panel <b>110</b>, at the heart of the system <b>100</b>, which includes an electronic controller <b>115</b>. The system <b>100</b> further includes a heat pump <b>120</b> and an air handler <b>130</b> both operationally connected to the control panel <b>110</b> such that the operation of the heat pump <b>120</b> and the air handler <b>130</b> may be controlled by the electronic controller <b>115</b> of the control panel <b>110</b>. The system <b>100</b> also includes auxiliary equipment <b>140</b> operationally connected to the control panel <b>110</b> such that the operation of the auxiliary equipment <b>140</b> may be controlled by the electronic controller <b>115</b> of the control panel <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The system <b>100</b> further comprises sensor devices <b>151</b>-<b>154</b> each operationally connected to the electronic controller <b>115</b> with each one of the sensor devices occupying a zone (<b>161</b>-<b>164</b>) of an environment to be environmentally controlled. The sensor devices are used to call for service. The system <b>100</b> also includes at least one air pump device <b>170</b> operationally connected to the control panel <b>110</b> such that the distribution of air may be controlled by the electronic controller <b>115</b> of the control panel <b>110</b>. The system <b>100</b> further includes at least one air damper <b>181</b>-<b>184</b> associated with each of the zones <b>161</b>-<b>164</b> and being operationally connected to the air pump device <b>170</b>. In accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the dampers <b>181</b>-<b>184</b> may be electromechanical dampers or any other type of damper. The system also includes an outside air temperature (OAT) sensor <b>191</b> and a leaving air temperature (LAT) sensor <b>192</b> each operationally connected to the electronic controller <b>115</b> of the control panel <b>110</b>. The OAT sensor measures the temperature of the outside air in a second external environment which is external to the first indoor environment. Each zone may comprise a separate room or connected areas in a house or other building, for example. Zones may also be defined by a time of day. For example, a bedroom zone may only be dynamically controlled at night when the bedroom is in use, and left closed off during the day when the bedroom is not in use. Similarly, an office building or restaurant not used at night may be closed off at certain hours of the night and dynamically controlled during the day.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the control panel <b>110</b> includes not only the electronic controller <b>115</b> but other components, as well, such as solenoids, relays, and a power supply for providing power and/or control air to the various system elements (i.e., the heat pump <b>120</b>, the air handler <b>130</b>, the air dampers <b>181</b>-<b>184</b>, etc.) through activation by the electronic controller <b>115</b>. For example, to turn on the heat pump <b>120</b>, the electronic controller <b>115</b> activates relays in the control panel <b>110</b> to switch electrical power to the heat pump <b>120</b>. As another example, to provide air from the air pump device <b>170</b> to one of the air dampers <b>181</b>-<b>186</b>, the electronic controller <b>115</b> activates (via an activation signal) a solenoid on the control panel <b>110</b> to switch air to an air damper (e.g., <b>181</b>). In general, the electronic controller <b>115</b> is a non-proprietary controller and independently controls activation of the heat pump <b>120</b>, air handler <b>130</b>, auxiliary equipment <b>140</b>, and the air dampers <b>181</b>-<b>184</b> when properly configured to a particular forced air system having such components.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electronic controller <b>115</b> also receives input signals from the various sensor devices <b>151</b>-<b>154</b>, <b>191</b>, and <b>192</b>. The sensor devices <b>151</b>-<b>154</b> may include, for example, thermostats and/or humidistats for monitoring temperature and/or humidity of the corresponding zones <b>161</b>-<b>164</b>. The electronic controller <b>115</b> uses these input signals to determine when and how to activate the various equipment (<b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>170</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The auxiliary equipment <b>140</b> may include an auxiliary heating source such as a fossil fuel system. Such an auxiliary heating source may include a gas, propane, or oil furnace, or a resistive heat strip, for example. Other auxiliary equipment such as, for example, auxiliary cooling equipment (e.g., an air conditioner) and a humidifier are possible as well, in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In general, the heat pump <b>120</b>, air handler <b>130</b>, and auxiliary equipment <b>140</b> may include one or more stages of operation. Since, the controller <b>115</b> is non-proprietary, the controller <b>115</b> may be configured to work with any standard forced air system having any standard number of stages. For example, the heat pump <b>120</b> may include two compressor stages of operation where either only the first compressor stage is activated, or both the first and second compressor stages are activated (e.g., when more cooling is needed). The air handler <b>130</b> may include two stages or speeds of operation such as, for example, a low fan speed stage and a high fan speed stage. The auxiliary equipment <b>140</b> may include, for example, two heat strip stages of operation where either only the first heat strip stage is activated, or both the first and second heat strip stages are activated (e.g., when more heat is needed). In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the activation of the various stages of the equipment may be controlled independently by the electronic controller <b>115</b> based on the determined need for heating, cooling, humidification, dehumidification, and/or air capacity (air volume).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a first example embodiment of a schematic wiring diagram of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in accordance with various aspects of the present invention. For example, the connections are shown for how to wire a sensor <b>151</b> for zone <b>1</b>, which may be a complex heat pump thermostat or a heating/cooling thermostat (single stage or two-stage), to the controller <b>115</b>. Also, the connections are shown for how to wire the OAT sensor <b>191</b> and the LAT sensor <b>192</b> to the controller <b>115</b>. Further, the connections are shown for how to wire a sensor <b>152</b> for zone <b>2</b>, which may be a simple thermostat, to the controller <b>115</b>. Also, the connections are shown for how to wire a combination of a heat pump <b>120</b> and an air handler <b>130</b>, which may break down into an outdoor unit and an indoor unit, to the controller <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates a second example embodiment of a schematic wiring diagram of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in accordance with various aspects of the present invention. For example, the connections are shown for how to wire a sensor <b>151</b> for zone <b>1</b>, which may be a complex heat pump thermostat or a humidistat or a de-humidistat, to the controller <b>115</b>. Also, the connections are shown for how to wire the OAT sensor <b>191</b> and the LAT sensor <b>192</b> to the controller <b>115</b>. Further, the connections are shown for how to wire a sensor <b>154</b> for zone <b>4</b>, which may be a simple thermostat, to the controller <b>115</b>. Also, the connections are shown for how to wire a combination of a heat pump <b>120</b> and an air handler <b>130</b>, which may break down into an outdoor unit and an indoor unit, to the controller <b>115</b>. Further, the connections are shown for how to wire a humidifier <b>140</b> to the controller <b>115</b>. A solenoid <b>199</b> may also be wired and is dedicated to automatically operating a damper for the humidifier, as will be explained later herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a first illustration of an example embodiment of an electronic controller <b>115</b> used in the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in accordance with various aspects of the present invention. The electronic controller <b>115</b> comprises a circuit board <b>200</b> with various components and devices mounted to the circuit board <b>200</b> including terminals (e.g., <b>210</b>), switches (e.g., <b>220</b>), a microprocessor, an LCD display device <b>230</b>, resistors, capacitors (e.g., <b>240</b>), integrated circuit chips (e.g., <b>250</b>), as well as other components.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the display device <b>230</b> may be used by an operator to aid the operator in manually selecting setting options (a first, a second, a third set of options, etc.) which are pre-programmed into the electronic controller <b>115</b>. Such manual selecting includes the steps of powering up the electronic controller <b>115</b>, displaying a first set of options on the display device <b>230</b>, selecting at least one of the options from the first set of options using at least one switching device on the electronic controller <b>115</b>, displaying a second set of options on the display device <b>230</b>, and selecting at least one of the options from the second set of options using at least one switching device on the electronic controller <b>115</b>. The process of displaying a next set of options and selecting from the next set of options may continue until all available selections are made. A list of selections and associated setting options are presented later herein. Also, the LCD display device <b>230</b> functions as an input/output indicator by displaying each thermostat call and the service currently being provided, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The electronic controller <b>115</b> further includes a USB (universal serial bus) port <b>260</b>. The USB port <b>260</b> allows a personal computer (PC), for example, to interface to the electronic controller <b>115</b>. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the electronic controller <b>115</b> stores a history of operational data (a data log) which may be read out of the electronic controller <b>115</b> by the PC via the USB port <b>260</b>. The history of operational data may include, for example, a listing of zone service calls that occurred over the last 24 hours or more, and a listing of stage activations initiated by the electronic controller <b>115</b> over the last 24 hours or more. Such historical information may be used by a technician to trouble-shoot the system <b>100</b>. Also, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a set of default options may be reloaded from the PC into the electronic controller <b>115</b> via the USB port <b>260</b>. Reloading the set of default options overrides any manual option selections that were previously made via the display device <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Also, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the USB port <b>260</b> may be used to allow the electronic controller <b>115</b> to interface with home automation equipment (e.g., a home automation device). The software of the electronic controller <b>115</b> is designed with &#x201c;hooks&#x201d; for integration with home automation packages. Data that may be output via the USB port to a home automation package include the last five events, the current damper states, the current service being provided, the current LAT, the current OAT, and any current thermostat or sensor requests. The home automation equipment may include a separate device with software that takes the data provided by the controller <b>115</b> and reports the data to a remote user via a dialer capability, email, or a web-based interface, for example.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of a circuit board layout <b>400</b> of the electronic controller <b>115</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, in accordance with various aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates a flowchart of an embodiment of a method <b>500</b> to control environmental parameters of pre-defined zones within a first environment using the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> which includes the electronic controller <b>115</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, in accordance with various aspects of the present invention. In step <b>510</b>, a weighting value is assigned to each of the pre-defined zones within a first environment using an electronic controller. In step <b>520</b>, any zone service calls from sensor devices associated with each of the pre-defined zones are detected using the electronic controller. In step <b>530</b>, a cumulative weighting value is determined in response to the detected zone service calls using the electronic controller. In step <b>540</b>, an equipment staging combination is selected from at least two possible equipment staging combinations in response to at least the cumulative zone weighting value using the electronic controller. In step <b>550</b>, the stages defined by the selected equipment staging combination are activated using the electronic controller.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As an example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, zone <b>1</b> <b>161</b> may be assigned a weighting value of 35%, zone <b>2</b> <b>162</b> may be assigned a weighting value of 10%, zone <b>3</b> <b>163</b> may be assigned a weighting value of 20%, and zone <b>4</b> <b>164</b> may be assigned a weighting value of 45%. These weighting values may be assigned based on the square footage area (i.e., floor space) of the zones or the separate spatial volumes of the zones, for example. In general, a larger zone may receive a higher weighting value. Also, weighting values may be based on the criticality of protecting equipment or produce in a zone (e.g., protecting expensive computer equipment or perishable food).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The weighting values for the various zones are programmed into the electronic controller <b>115</b> by an operator using the LCD display <b>230</b> and associated switches as a user interface. Next, zone service calls are detected by the electronic controller <b>115</b> from thermostat <b>151</b> in zone <b>1</b> <b>161</b> and thermostat <b>154</b> in zone <b>4</b> <b>164</b>. Both zones are calling for heat. Since the weighting value associated with zone <b>1</b> <b>161</b> is 35% and the weighting value associated with zone <b>4</b> <b>164</b> is 45%, the cumulative weighting value is the sum of the two which is 80%, which is a fairly high cumulative weighting value, and is higher than a pre-defined zone weighting threshold of, for example, 60%.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As a result, the electronic controller <b>115</b> selects an equipment staging combination which includes two or more compressor stages of the heat pump <b>120</b> and a second higher air blower speed of the air handler <b>130</b>. The selected stages are activated by the electronic controller <b>115</b> via the control panel <b>110</b>, and the electronic controller <b>115</b> directs air from the air pump device <b>170</b> to the air dampers <b>181</b> and <b>184</b> in zone <b>1</b> <b>161</b> and zone <b>4</b> <b>164</b> in order to open these air dampers. As a result, the heat pump <b>120</b> provides heat to the air handler <b>130</b> which blows heated air to zone <b>1</b> <b>161</b> and zone <b>4</b> <b>164</b>. The dampers <b>182</b> and <b>183</b> in zone <b>2</b> <b>162</b> and zone <b>3</b> <b>163</b> remain closed. Once the servicing of the zones is completed, the air dampers may be closed by the electronic controller <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A zone service call may include any of a heating call, a cooling call, a humidification call, a de-humidification call, and a fan-only call, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Continuing with the example, once zone <b>1</b> <b>161</b> and zone <b>4</b> <b>164</b> are properly heated, the electronic controller <b>115</b> closes the dampers <b>181</b> and <b>184</b> and de-activates the two stages of the heat pump <b>120</b> and the air handler <b>130</b>. Next, the electronic controller <b>115</b> receives and detects a new zone service call from the thermostat <b>152</b> of zone <b>2</b> <b>162</b>. The weighting value associated with zone <b>2</b> <b>162</b> is 10%. Since zone <b>2</b> <b>162</b> is the only zone calling, the cumulative weighting value is also 10% which is below the threshold of 60%. As a result, the electronic controller <b>115</b> selects a new equipment staging combination which includes a first compressor stage of the heat pump <b>120</b> and a first lower air blower speed of the air handler <b>130</b>. The selected stages are activated by the electronic controller <b>115</b> via the control panel <b>110</b>, and the electronic controller <b>115</b> directs air from the air pump device <b>170</b> to the air dampers <b>182</b> in zone <b>2</b> <b>162</b> in order to open this air damper. As a result, the heat pump <b>120</b> provides heat to the air handler <b>130</b> which blows heated air to zone <b>2</b> <b>162</b>. The dampers <b>181</b>, <b>183</b> and <b>184</b> in zone <b>1</b> <b>161</b>, zone <b>3</b> <b>163</b>, and zone <b>4</b> <b>164</b> remain closed.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As may be seen from the previous example, the weighting of the zones, the determination of a cumulative weighting value, and the independent control and activation of the heat pump stages and the air handler stages allow the system <b>100</b> to select the best combination of equipment stages to be activated in order to properly heat the calling zones in a more efficient manner. Similarly, other types of zone service calls such as cooling, humidification, dehumidification, and fan-only may be effected in the same way by allowing the system <b>100</b> to select, via the electronic controller <b>115</b>, the best combination of stages of the heat pump <b>120</b>, the auxiliary equipment <b>140</b>, and the air handler <b>130</b>. For example, for certain applications, it has been found that the best staging combination involves using the zone weighting values only to stage the air handler <b>130</b>, independent of the staging of the other equipment. The controller <b>115</b> allows the air handler and the other equipment to be controlled and staged independently. For example, the heat pump may be staged based on LAT and OAT, but not zone weightings, and the air handler is staged based on the zone weightings. That is, the air handler staging, in this embodiment, is based strictly on zone weighting and not temperature. In this way, airflow may be better matched to duct capacity. The zone weightings for the air handler are based on the amount of ductwork being served at any one time for the calling zones.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, one or more of the sensors <b>151</b>-<b>154</b> may include a humidistat for measuring a humidity level in a zone, or may be a combination thermostat/humidistat for measuring temperature and humidity level in a zone. When a zone calls for lowering the humidity level, two or more stages of the heat pump may be employed to provide maximum cooling capacity but only the first stage (i.e., lower speed) of the air handler may be activated such that the lower speed of the air passing over the cooling coils in the heat pump will allow more moisture to condense out of the air, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Various staging combinations are provided by the electronic controller <b>115</b> in an attempt to better control the environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, air flow) within the various zones. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the allowable staging combinations may be as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">1) a first stage of a heat pump and a first stage (low speed) of an air handler;</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">2) a first stage and a second stage of a heat pump and a first stage (low speed) of an air handler;</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">3) a first stage and a second stage of a heat pump and a second stage (high speed) of an air handler;</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">4) a first stage and a second stage of a heat pump, a second stage (high speed) of an air handler, and a first stage of an auxiliary heat source;</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">5) a first stage and a second stage of a heat pump, a second stage (high speed) of an air handler, and a first stage and a second stage of an auxiliary heat source.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Each of the staging combinations includes a unique, pre-defined combination of heat pump and/or auxiliary equipment stages that may be activated by the electronic controller along with different air handler stages that may be activated by the electronic controller for servicing the calling zones. Other staging combinations are possible as well, in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. For example, a staging combination may include turning on a fan of the air handler <b>130</b> without activating any stages of the heat pump <b>120</b> or auxiliary equipment <b>140</b>. This may be desirable simply to move air around a zone or zones, or to bring outside air in from outside of the house or building (i.e., from an external environment), for example. Again, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, only the air handler may be staged based on zone weighting, as will be elaborated upon later herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The outside-air-temperature (OAT) sensor <b>191</b> may be used to report a temperature of the outside (i.e., external) environment to the electronic controller <b>115</b>. As a result, the electronic controller <b>115</b> may use the outside-air-temperature as another input in the process to decide which stages to activate when a zone or zones is calling for service. For example, if it is the middle of winter and a user of the system <b>100</b> is entertaining a large number of people within a building such as, for example, a home, a restaurant, or a hotel, the temperature within the building may start to increase to an uncomfortable level. The outside-air-temperature as measured by the OAT sensor <b>191</b> and reported to the electronic controller <b>115</b> may be, for example, 40 degrees F. When the temperature inside a zone of the building reaches an uncomfortably warm level, the electronic controller <b>115</b> may open a damper to the outside and activate the air handler <b>130</b> to allow the cool outside air to be brought into the building instead of turning on an air conditioner or activating the heat pump <b>120</b> for cooling. Furthermore, the measured OAT may be used to determine whether or not any auxiliary equipment is allowed to be activated.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, if the OAT is below a balance point threshold value, then any backup auxiliary heating will be used. If the OAT is below a low ambient threshold value, then cooling calls are served with the fan only. If the OAT is above a high ambient threshold value, then heating calls are served with the fan only. If the OAT is above an auxiliary heat lockout threshold value, then auxiliary heat is not allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The leaving-air-temperature (LAT) sensor <b>192</b> may be used to report a temperature of the air leaving the air handler <b>130</b> to the electronic controller <b>115</b>. As a result, the electronic controller <b>115</b> may use the leaving-air-temperature as another input in the process of deciding which stages to activate when a zone or zones is calling for service. That is, the system stages on thermal capacity, not just demand from one or more zones. The system does not have to wait for a thermostat to fall below or rise above a set temperature within a zone and call for more heating or cooling before reacting by changing the staging. For example, a first stage of the heat pump <b>120</b> may be used to cool zones within a house when the outside-air-temperature is around 80 degrees F. In such a scenario, the leaving-air-temperature from the air handler <b>130</b> may typically be around 70 degrees F. and does a fine job of cooling the calling zones to 74 degrees F. within a reasonable period of time. However, on a very hot day when the outside-air-temperature is above 95 degrees F., with only the first stage of the heat pump <b>120</b> activated, the leaving-air-temperature may only cool down to 75 degrees F., which is not suitable if the desired zone temperature is 74 degrees F. Therefore, under such conditions, the electronic controller <b>115</b> would detect that the leaving-air-temperature was too high and would activate both the first and second stages of the heat pump <b>120</b> in an attempt to reduce the leaving-air-temperature. Many other scenarios are possible as well which may be handled by embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Whenever one or more of the sensed parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity), from a sensor sensing a present status of at least one of the environmental parameters, changes within a zone, or OAT or LAT changes, the electronic controller <b>115</b> may select a new staging combination which is more appropriate for the new conditions. The electronic controller <b>115</b> provides the flexibility needed to better control environmental parameters within a home, building, or other environment, for example. That is, multiple controls (functions) are built into the controller <b>115</b>, eliminating the need for separate control devices. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the controller <b>115</b> includes built-in controls for resistance heat lock-out capability, outdoor reset capability, outdoor temperature balance point capability, discharge temperature (LAT) controls (two independent high limits and one low limit), and selectable O/B outputs. As a result, the controller <b>115</b> could be used simply as, for example, a heat pump controller and not a zone controller. The two independent LAT high limits include a first limit for setting the maximum allowable temperature for heat-pump only operation, and a second limit for setting the maximum temperature for heat-pump plus some form of backup or auxiliary heat. The low LAT limit is for setting the minimum allowable temperature across the coil for cooling. Staging decisions are made based on these limits being exceeded or not, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In general, the various methods described herein with reference to the various flow charts are performed by the electronic controller <b>115</b>. The electronic controller <b>115</b> accepts various input signals, performs various logic functions and calculations based on, at least in part, those input signals, and outputs various output signals to control the various equipment of the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the zone weighting values are used only to stage the air handler <b>130</b>. The staging of the heating and cooling equipment is done based on capacity and/or demand.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a second embodiment of a method <b>555</b> to control environmental parameters of pre-defined zones within a first environment using the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> which includes the electronic controller <b>115</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, in accordance with various aspects of the present invention. In step <b>560</b>, a weighting value is assigned to each of the pre-defined zones within the environment, using the non-proprietary electronic controller, based on at least duct work capacity for each pre-defined zone. In step <b>570</b>, the non-proprietary electronic controller detects any zone service calls from sensor devices associated with each of the pre-defined zones. In step <b>580</b>, the non-proprietary electronic controller determines a cumulative zone weighting value in response to the detected zone service calls. In step <b>590</b>, the non-proprietary electronic controller selects an air handler stage from at least two possible air handler stages in response to at least the cumulative zone weighting value.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>100</b> may presently be servicing only a previous heating call from zone <b>1</b> <b>161</b>. The weighting of zone <b>1</b> is 35 percent and is based on the ductwork capacity associated with zone <b>1</b>. The air handler weighting threshold is currently set to 50%. Since only zone <b>1</b> has called for service, the cumulative zone weighting value is 35 percent which is below the 50% threshold. As a result, the selected air handler stage is the first lower speed stage, which is adequate to handle the zone <b>1</b> heating call.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">During the servicing of zone <b>1</b> <b>161</b>, zone <b>3</b> <b>163</b> calls to the non-proprietary electronic controller <b>115</b> for heat (a new zone service call). The weighting for zone <b>3</b> is 20% and is based on the ductwork capacity associated with zone <b>3</b>. Since both zone <b>1</b> and zone <b>3</b> are to be serviced, the cumulative zone weighting value is now 35%+20%, or 55%, which is above the 50% threshold. As a result, the selected air handler stage is the different second higher speed stage, which is adequate to handle the zone <b>1</b> and zone <b>3</b> heating calls. Based on the 50% threshold setting, the first lower speed stage of the air handler is no longer adequate to handle both calls. The particular equipment staging combination (e.g., staging of the heat pump <b>120</b>) is selected independently of the air handler staging and zone weightings (e.g., selected based on LAT and/or OAT).</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> illustrates graphs of heating temperature profiles <b>900</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Once a sensor (e.g., a thermostat) calls for heat, the equipment (e.g., heat pump) is activated and begins to warm up. The leaving air temperature (LAT) increases and then levels off at some point. The change in LAT over a given unit of time is defined as &#x394;T. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the LAT sensor <b>192</b> is used to determine &#x394;T. &#x394;T indicates the change in temperature from one unit of time to the next and indicates whether or not the heat pump is keeping up with demand. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, &#x394;T is the basis of all equipment staging decisions. That is, the system stages, at least in part, based on thermal capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">&#x394;T starts out small as the coil and condenser of the heat pump start to work. Then &#x394;T increases as the equipment gets up to speed. Finally, &#x394;T decreases and eventually goes to zero as the temperature levels out. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, &#x394;T is used as a flag for making staging decisions. That is, the system stages, at least in part, based on thermal capacity. It is typically known, apriori, how the equipment has been designed to operate with respect to equipment profiles. Therefore, a decision can be made as to when the current operating mode of the equipment is sufficient or when heating capacity should be increased. A minimum desired temperature is also known. If &#x394;T goes to zero but is still below the desired temperature, then the equipment is not generating enough heat to get the job done. As a result, the equipment will be upstaged to provide the additional heat. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the electronic controller <b>115</b> checks to ensure that &#x394;T starts out with a strong magnitude to prove that the heat pump is operating.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> illustrates a graph of a cooling temperature profile <b>910</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Cooling works in a similar manner to heating, except in the opposite direction. As the coolant reaches its most efficient speed for heat transfer, the temperature starts to fall more quickly. Therefore |&#x394;T| reaches its highest point. Once the temperature profile proceeds below the point of diminishing marginal returns, the |&#x394;T| starts to decrease. As the equipment continues to run and remove all the heat it can, the leaving air temperature (LAT) reading stabilizes and &#x394;T becomes very close to zero. Such temperature characteristics may be monitored and used to stage at the appropriate time (i.e., staging based on thermal capacity).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the system <b>100</b> provides four stages for heating and two stages for cooling. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates two example graphs <b>1010</b> and <b>1020</b> of temperature vs. time for heating capacity staging and cooling capacity staging. The two graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrate how capacity is staged up for heating or cooling if needed, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>

The method <b>1100</b> includes running a &#x201c;Setup Wizard&#x201d; which includes selecting the various setting options displayed to an operator on the display device <b>230</b>. The method <b>1100</b> also includes monitoring sensor (e.g., a thermostat and/or a humidistat) inputs and selecting an appropriate service routine to run (e.g., heating, cooling, fan-only).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In general, the electronic controller <b>115</b> monitors the progress of the heating or cooling process and adjusts the staging to produce enough heat transfer to get the job done in an efficient manner while minimizing airflow when only small zones are calling. &#x394;T is the difference between two temperature readings over a given time increment and is the basis for monitoring system performance. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when the electronic controller <b>115</b> starts to service a call, the electronic controller <b>115</b> will wait approximately one minute and then start to take temperature readings (LAT readings). The electronic controller <b>115</b> averages enough readings to effectively filter out any anomalous readings.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The process is monitored in three ways, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. First, the rate at which the temperature is rising or falling during the initial heating or cooling process is monitored. Second, the final temperature is recorded when &#x394;T decreases to nearly zero. The final recorded temperature value should be above (for heating) or below (for cooling) a minimum setting which should feel comfortable to end users. Third, if &#x394;T changes from a positive value to a negative value, then this means that the heat pump, for example, is not keeping up with demand and the thermostat will soon start to move away from setpoint rather than toward it. &#x394;T is monitored to see if it changes sign and this information is also used to decide whether or not to stage up.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The decision to stage up is checked against the cumulative zone weighting value. If the cumulative zone weighting value does not exceed a zone weight threshold, the staging up is delayed until the LAT has drifted 5 degrees F. below (for heating) or above (for cooling) the minimum heat or maximum cooling settings. The decision to stage up is also checked against the OAT, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For heating, if the OAT is above 45 degrees F., for example, then the system is not allowed to stage up until the LAT has drifted 5 degrees F. below the minimum heat settings. For cooling, if the OAT is below 75 degrees F., then the system is not allowed to stage up until the LAT has drifted 5 degrees F. above the maximum cooling settings.</p>

The priority select function determines the priority given to heating, cooling, and fan-only calls based on the current circumstances (e.g., current zone service calls). For example, when &#x201c;heating&#x201d; has priority, heating calls have priority over cooling and fan calls. Heating calls interrupt any lower priority calls and a purge cycle commences immediately (as described later herein). Upon completion of the purge cycle, the electronic controller <b>115</b> serves the heating call. Any other zone that calls for heating may have it. When &#x201c;cooling&#x201d; has priority, cooling calls have priority over heating and fan calls. Cooling calls interrupt any lower priority calls and the purge cycle commences immediately. Upon completion of the purge cycle, the electronic controller serves the cooling call. Any other zone that calls for cooling may have it. In the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; or &#x201c;First Come, First Served&#x201d; mode, the call (either heating or cooling) currently being served has priority over any other calls. The current call is not interrupted. The fan is always a lower priority than heating or cooling. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, if a non-priority call (heating or cooling) waits for 20 minutes, this call will take control and serve itself for up to 20 minutes. This is to preclude orphan zones (i.e., some zones never being served).</p>

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, zone <b>1</b> will have an &#x201c;H&#x201d; terminal on the electronic controller <b>115</b> for humidification calls which is for powered humidifiers. Any time there is an &#x201c;H&#x201d; call, it will pass directly to the &#x201c;H&#x201d; output relay regardless of anything else that is happening on the electronic controller <b>115</b>. There is also an &#x201c;H&#x201d; 24 VDS terminal that goes hot when the &#x201c;H&#x201d; output terminal goes hot. This allows humidify calls to be handled from any source. A DC terminal provides for a humidifier damper and also provides a flexible built-in auxiliary relay for use in custom operations sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an automatic humidification mode is provided. A humidifier is integrated into the HVAC system (i.e., the indoor air quality comfort system) such that a damper is automatically opened when the controller <b>115</b> receives a humidification call. An additional solenoid is provided on the control panel <b>110</b> to operate the damper via the controller <b>115</b> (e.g., see the wiring of solenoid <b>199</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). The humidifier is typically located, for example, on the forced air system (e.g., at a furnace) and the damper is located between the humidifier and the ductwork to the forced air system. The open damper allows humidified air to pass into the forced air system such that the humidified air may be distributed to calling zones. The non-proprietary electronic controller automatically closes the humidifier damper when servicing of the zone associated with the humidification zone service call is complete. In this way, a home owner does not have to remember to manually open the damper in the Winter and close the damper in the Spring, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">For a de-humidification call, if the electronic controller <b>115</b> is currently serving a cooling call, then the electronic controller will turn off the highest stage of the air handler <b>130</b>. If the electronic controller is idle (not presently serving a call), then when a de-humidification call is received, the electronic controller <b>115</b> will activate a first cooling stage of the heat pump <b>120</b> and a first stage of the air handler <b>130</b> with all dampers open and run for X minutes on and X minutes off where X is pre-defined during setup. In general, the humidity in the air may be decreased by slowing down the fan speed of the air handler <b>130</b> on a call for dehumidification from a thermidistat or other humidity monitoring controls. By slowing down the fan, the air is given more contact time with the coil allowing more water to be condensed out of the air.</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0118">A geo-thermal heat pump (also known as a ground source heat pump) is a heating and/or cooling system that transfers heat to and/or from the ground. The ground is used as a source of heat in the cold weather months and as a heat sink in the warm weather months. In general, fluid-filled geo-thermal field loop piping (also known as a loop field) is buried in the ground having fluid input and output connections to the geo-thermal heat pump equipment. The geo-thermal heat pump equipment pumps fluid (e.g., a refrigerant) through the loop field such that heat may be exchanged between the loop field and the ground. The geo-thermal heat pump system may extract heat from an internal environment (e.g., a house) to cool the internal environment and dissipate the extracted heat into the ground via the loop field. Similarly, the geo-thermal heat pump system may extract heat from the ground via the loop field and pump the heat into the internal environment to heat the internal environment. In general, the loop field is installed deep enough in the ground where the ground temperature is fairly stable at a temperature somewhere between, typically, 50&#xb0; F. and 60&#xb0; F. (e.g., 55&#xb0; F.).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In general, for geo-thermal heat pump systems, as long as enough time has elapsed for heat exchange to occur between the loop field and the ground during operation, then the loop temperature stays relatively constant (e.g., at about 55&#xb0; F.). However, if the internal environment (e.g., a house) or the external environment (outdoors) is very hot (or cold), it can take a long time to bring the zone temperatures within the internal environment to a desired comfort level. This can cause the loop temperature to deviate significantly from 55&#xb0; F., for example, resulting in the heating (or cooling) process becoming considerably less efficient. In such a situation, it may be desirable to activate auxiliary HVAC equipment to help compensate. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the loop temperature is monitored, allowing HVAC staging decisions to be made based, at least in part, on loop temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates a schematic block diagram of a second example embodiment of a system <b>2500</b> to control environmental parameters of pre-defined zones within a first environment using a geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b>.

The electronic controller <b>2515</b> is configured to interface with a control panel <b>110</b> as discussed previously herein, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. However, for purposes of discussion herein, when the electronic controller <b>2515</b> is discussed, it may be assumed that the electronic controller <b>2515</b> interfaces to other parts of the system <b>2500</b> through the control panel <b>110</b>. However, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the control panel <b>110</b> and the electronic controller <b>2515</b> are integrated and form a single device.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The system <b>2500</b> includes a geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> operatively connected to the electronic controller <b>2515</b>, and an air-handler <b>2520</b> operatively connected to the electronic controller <b>2515</b>. The geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> has at least two stages, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Also, the air handler has at least two stages (e.g., at least two fan speeds), in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The air handler may be multi-speed or variable speed.

Such auxiliary HVAC equipment is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The system <b>2500</b> also includes environmental zone sensor devices (e.g., a thermostat, a humidistat, and a de-humidistat) <b>2550</b> located within zones to be heated and/or cooled. The zone sensor devices <b>2550</b> are operatively connected to the electronic controller <b>2515</b> such that the electronic controller <b>2515</b> may electronically read the sensor measurements provided by the zone sensor devices <b>2550</b>. The system also includes duct work air (pneumatic) dampers <b>2560</b> which are operatively connected to the electronic controller <b>2515</b> via an air pump <b>2570</b> and are associated with the duct work leading to the various zones. The electronic controller <b>2515</b> controls the opening and closing of the air dampers <b>2560</b> in dependence on zones that are calling for heating or cooling. In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the dampers may be of a different type such as, for example, an electric damper driven by an electric motor where the electronic controller is configured to activate the electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The system <b>2500</b> further includes several temperature sensors including a loop temperature (LPT) sensor <b>2580</b>, an outdoor air temperature (OAT) sensor <b>2581</b>, and a leaving air temperature (LAT) sensor <b>2582</b> which are operatively connected to the electronic controller <b>2515</b>. The LPT sensor <b>2580</b> measures the loop temperature of the loop field of the geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> and reports the loop temperature to the electronic controller <b>2515</b>.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates an example embodiment of an electronic controller <b>2515</b> used in the system <b>2500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The electronic controller <b>2515</b> is similar to the electronic controller <b>115</b> described previously herein, but includes some differences. The electronic controller <b>2515</b> comprises a circuit board <b>2600</b> with various components and devices mounted to the circuit board <b>2600</b> including terminals (e.g., <b>210</b>), switches (e.g., <b>220</b>), a programmable microprocessor <b>2610</b>, an LCD display device <b>230</b>, resistors, capacitors (e.g., <b>240</b>), integrated circuit chips (e.g., <b>250</b>), as well as other components.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The power switch <b>265</b> is used to control 24 VAC power to the control panel <b>110</b>. The HVAC outputs <b>270</b> are the dry contacts to control the HVAC equipment (e.g., both the geo-thermal heat pump and the auxiliary HVAC equipment). The terminals <b>210</b>, <b>211</b>, and <b>212</b> are the thermostat inputs for zone #<b>4</b>, zone #<b>3</b>, and zone #<b>2</b>, respectively. The sensor inputs <b>275</b> are the inputs for the LAT sensor and OAT sensor. The sensor inputs <b>2615</b> are the inputs for the LPT sensor. Control buttons <b>280</b> provide a programming interface with components of the controller <b>2515</b>. The switch <b>220</b> is used to control power for the micro pump (air pump device <b>2570</b>). The zone #<b>1</b> input terminal <b>285</b> accepts inputs from any 24 VAC thermostats (heat pump or heat/cool). The 24 VAC power input <b>290</b> is provided via transformer connections &#x201c;R&#x201d; and &#x201c;C&#x201d;. The 2-amp fuse <b>295</b> protects the board <b>2600</b> against thermostat shorts.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The electronic controller <b>2515</b> also includes a real-time clock <b>2630</b>. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the clock <b>2630</b> is used by the electronic controller <b>2515</b> to keep track of a total service time and the service times associated with each zone. The electronic controller <b>2515</b> is configured to derive a time-out signal from the clock <b>2630</b> whenever a calling zone exceeds a pre-defined service time. The time-out signal may be used to make staging decisions by the electronic controller <b>2515</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">For example, a time-out threshold of 15 minutes is set in the electronic controller <b>2515</b>. The electronic controller <b>2515</b> is configured to track not only the total servicing time, but also the servicing time of each individual zone. At time zero, the system <b>2500</b> begins servicing zone #<b>1</b> in response to a service call from zone #<b>1</b> and the servicing time is tracked by the electronic controller <b>2515</b> using the clock <b>2630</b>. After 10 minutes, a service call is received by the electronic controller <b>2515</b> from zone #<b>2</b>, and the system <b>2500</b> begins servicing zone #<b>2</b> in addition to zone #<b>1</b>. After 13 minutes, the servicing of zone #<b>1</b> is completed. After 17 minutes, the servicing of zone #<b>2</b> is completed. Therefore, zone #<b>1</b> was serviced for 13 minutes and zone #<b>2</b> was serviced for 7 minutes. The total servicing time was 17 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">If, after 15 minutes (the time-out threshold) zone #<b>1</b> and zone #<b>2</b> were not yet finished being serviced, then the electronic controller <b>2515</b> would have generated a time-out signal and the electronic controller <b>2515</b> would command the system <b>2500</b> to stage up in response to the time-out signal in order to finish servicing zone #<b>1</b> and zone #<b>2</b> in a timely manner. However, in the example above, the servicing of zone #<b>1</b> was completed in 13 minutes (before the 15 minute threshold was reached) and the servicing of zone #<b>2</b> was completed in 7 minutes (before the 15 minute threshold was reached), even though the total continuous servicing time was 17 minutes. Therefore, a time-out signal was not generated and the system <b>2500</b> was not commanded to stage up. That is, the present staging was adequate to finish servicing zone #<b>2</b> in a timely manner. As such, the system <b>2500</b> is commanded to stage up only when extra heating or cooling capacity is truly needed based on the set time-out threshold. Also, the real-time clock <b>2630</b> is used to facilitate the logging of data in an easy to access format.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The electronic controller <b>2515</b> further includes a USB (universal serial bus) port <b>260</b>. The USB port <b>260</b> allows a personal computer (PC), for example, to interface to the electronic controller <b>2515</b> as described previously herein. Furthermore, the USB port <b>260</b> allows communication with a flash drive plugged into the USB port <b>260</b>. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when a flash drive is plugged into the USB port <b>260</b>, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> will look for an updated hex file on the flash drive. Upon finding an updated hex file, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> will ask (e.g., via the LCD display device <b>230</b>) if the user wants to upgrade the software of the electronic controller <b>2515</b> and allow the user to respond. If a hex file is not found on the flash drive, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> will ask if the user wants to download the data log.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The electronic controller <b>2515</b> further includes non-HVAC dry contacts <b>2620</b> which allow interfacing to at least one dry contract relay on the control panel <b>110</b>. The relay on the control panel <b>110</b> has associated normally open (NO)/normally closed (NC) and common terminals and may be used to provide the system <b>2500</b> with the ability to interact with non-HVAC systems outside of the system <b>2500</b>. The operation of the relay is programmable during the set up process. Software on the electronic controller <b>2515</b> allows monitoring of various parameters, allowing the relay to be switched or activated on any of, for example, a particular call or any call from any zone, any particular output from the system <b>2500</b>, loop temperature (LPT), outside air temperature (OAT), leaving air temperature (LAT), a particular zone being served, a time of day (e.g., 2 &#x3bc;m to 4 &#x3bc;m), or any particular time parameter (e.g., 5 minutes per hour).</p>

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">For example, a user may want to have the window blinds of a particular zone automatically close whenever that zone is being serviced for cooling. Similarly, a user may want to have the window blinds automatically close whenever two or more zones are being served. To accomplish the automatic operation of the blinds, the signals that drive the blinds are simply fed to the input of the non-HVAC relay on the control panel <b>110</b> which is operatively connected to the electronic controller <b>2515</b> via the non-HVAC contacts <b>2620</b>. Whenever the electronic controller <b>2515</b> senses the pre-programmed triggering condition, the electronic controller activates the non-HVAC relay such that the signals to drive the window blinds are passed through the non-HVAC relay to the window blind motor, for example.</p>

In step <b>2710</b> of the method <b>2700</b>, an electronic controller <b>2515</b> monitors a loop temperature (LPT) of a loop field of a geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> detected by a temperature sensor <b>2580</b> operatively connected to the loop field. In step <b>2720</b>, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> selects a staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> and an auxiliary HVAC equipment <b>2530</b> or <b>2540</b> based on at least the loop temperature. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, selecting a staging combination in step <b>2720</b> of the method <b>2700</b> may include selecting one or more stages of the geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> along with no stage, one stage, or more than one stage of the auxiliary HVAC equipment <b>2530</b> or <b>2540</b>. Furthermore, situations may arise where one or more stages of the auxiliary HVAC equipment is selected, but not any stages of the geo-thermal heat pump. For example, such a situation may arise when it is determined by the electronic controller <b>2515</b> that the geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> is not functioning correctly.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In step <b>2730</b>, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> activates the selected staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> and the auxiliary HVAC equipment <b>2530</b> or <b>2540</b> using non-proprietary activating signals provided by the electronic controller <b>2515</b>. The non-proprietary activating signals from the electronic controller <b>2515</b> are generated to be able to operate with standard geo-thermal heat pump equipment and standard auxiliary HVAC equipment. As a result, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> is compatible with standard HVAC equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, each of the pre-defined zones has an associated duct work capacity and the electronic controller <b>2515</b> stores a weighting value for each of the pre-defined zones which is representative of the associated duct work capacity of each of the pre-defined zones. In step <b>2740</b>, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> transforms detected zone service calls and associated weighting values into a cumulative zone weighting value being representative of a cumulative duct work capacity of the calling zones. A zone service call may include any of a heating call, a cooling call, a humidification call, a de-humidification call, and a fan-only call. The zone service calls originate from zone sensor devices <b>2550</b> (e.g., a thermostat, a humidistat, a de-humidistat) associated with the various zones and are detected by the electronic controller <b>2515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In step <b>2750</b>, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> selects an air handler stage of an air handler <b>2520</b> from at least two air handler stages in response to at least the cumulative zone weighting value. In step <b>2760</b>, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> activates the selected air handler stage of the air handler <b>2520</b>. Furthermore, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> may activate at least one duct work air damper device <b>2560</b> associated with each zone of the detected zone service calls.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> may select a staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> and the auxiliary HVAC equipment <b>2530</b> or <b>2540</b> based not just on loop temperature (LPT), but also on other parameters such as at least one of a change (&#x394;T) in the LAT, the OAT, the cumulative zone weighting value, or a time-out signal derived from the real-time clock <b>2630</b>. Again, the electronic controller is configured to allow an HVAC contractor/practitioner to set threshold values (high or low) to which the parameters can be compared to trigger staging decisions.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A-28B</figref> illustrate a functional block diagram of an embodiment of a process <b>2800</b> for controlling environmental parameters of pre-defined zones within a first environment using the system <b>2500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> having the electronic controller <b>2515</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> which embodies the method <b>2700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref> shows N sensor devices (#<b>1</b> to #N) corresponding to a sensor device in each of N zones. The electronic controller <b>2515</b> monitors the sensor devices and reads any zone service calls from the sensor devices. In response to reading the zone service calls, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> determines which service to provide.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref>, three services are shown being that of heating, cooling, and ventilation. If one or more zones call for heating, for example, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> will activate at least stage <b>1</b> of the geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> and at least a first stage of the air handler <b>2520</b>. The electronic controller <b>2515</b> will further determine if stage <b>2</b> of the geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> should be activated, if a further stage of the air handler should be activated, and if the auxiliary HVAC heating equipment <b>2530</b> should be activated. Again, such staging decisions are based on programmable combinations of loop temperature (LPT), leaving air temperature (LAT), outdoor air temperature (OAT), cumulative zone weighting value, and time as described previously herein. Similarly, if one or more zones call for cooling, the electronic controller <b>2515</b> will react in a similar manner, activating appropriate stages of the geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b>, the auxiliary HVAC cooling equipment <b>2540</b>, and the air handler <b>2520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">If one or more zones call for ventilation, then the electronic controller <b>2515</b> activates a fan-only speed of the air handler <b>2520</b> to provide ventilation to the calling zones. Similarly, if one or more zones call for humidification or de-humidification, one or more stages of the geo-thermal heat pump <b>2510</b> may be activated along with an auxiliary HVAC humidifier or an auxiliary HVAC de-humidifier.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In summary, a method and system to control environmental parameters of pre-defined zones within an environment using an electronic controller are disclosed. An electronic controller monitors a loop temperature of a loop field of a geo-thermal heat pump as detected by a temperature sensor connected to the loop field. The electronic controller selects a staging combination of the geo-thermal heat pump and an auxiliary HVAC equipment based on at least the loop temperature. The electronic controller activates the selected staging combination, to modify at least a portion of the environmental parameters, using non-proprietary activating signals provided by the electronic controller.</p>
