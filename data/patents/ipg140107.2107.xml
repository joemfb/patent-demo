<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to methods and devices for assaying biological fluid samples. More particularly the invention relates to methods and devices for detecting analytes, such as drugs, in urine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. History of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In their most simple form, chromatographic analyte devices permit an assay to be performed in a single step (application of an analyte sample to the device) to producer visually observable assay results (such as those indicated by colored bars on the test strip). However a common limitation of such devices is that they can only be used to detect a single analyte, requiring that serial assay procedures be performed to detect additional analytes (for example to test a sample for the presence of a panel of narcotics). Multiple dipping steps such as are commonly used when multiple dipstick assays are separately performed, present not only possible loss of sensitivity of the assay (through reagent mixing or possible loss reagent solutions) but also an esthetic and hygienic problem for the analyst. Repetitive performance of assay procedures is also tedious, which increases the risk that assays will be performed improperly or the results misinterpreted.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides an assay device, device for separating a fluid analyte sample for use in multiple assay procedures and methods for performing multiple analyte assays. In one embodiment of the assay device, the assay device is a dipstick having multiple analyte test strips, each of which includes a test zone and a control zone. The test strips are enclosed in a housing having an open side through which an end of each test strip protrudes to form a sample loading zone. A protective cap is provided to seal the protruding ends of the test strips from exposure while not in use. Each test strip is separated from the next within the housing by a raised spacer. The portion of the housing which overlies the test and control zones is transparent to permit visually observible results shown in each zone to be viewed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In cassette form, the assay device has the same structure described above, but the protruding test strips are inserted into a cap which has a sample port for application of sample to the test strips. The cap is retained on the assay device by a close fit over the device housing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each test strip provides binders and assay reagents for detection of a different analyte in the sample fluid. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the assay device, the housing may be opened to permit substitution of different test strips to allow each device to be customized for detection of specific analytes of interest. Assay sample integrity determinants consisting of test strips which allow measurement of parameters such as specific gravity and pH may also be included in each device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention also provides a separator device for dividing a fluid assay sample into portions for use in multiple assays without need for contact between the assay operator and the fluid sample. This latter feature of the device increases operator safety and avoids inadvertent contamination of the assay sample. The separator device may be used to separate any fluid assay sample, but is especially useful in assaying samples for the presence of narcotics, where a positive result on first testing of the sample may necessarily be followed by additional testing of the sample to confirm the result and the identity of the detected narcotic. To this end, the separator device is adapted particularly well to use with the assay device of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The assay device of the invention makes specimen analysis easier because an analyte sample need only to be applied once to the assay device for testing. In addition, the replaceable nature of the analyte test strips allows the analyst to customize the array of assays to the testing situation. Because the customization can be performed before adding the test sample (e.g., urine), fewer manipulations with the analyte sample are needed to obtain the desired information. In addition, use of the separator device permits further testing of the sample to be performed without risk of adultering the sample in a preliminary assay performed according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention also provides a method for assaying one or more analytes of interest. The protruding ends of the device are dipped into a fluid analyte sample. Binding of an analyte present in the sample with one or more specific ligands causes formation of specific visual pattern in the test and control zones indicative of the test result. The assay results performed according to the invention may be read visually without use of separate measuring equipment. Thus, performance of assays according to the invention requires only that the user introduce the requisite amount of test sample into the device of the invention, then observe any color changes which appear shortly thereafter in a detection zone of an analyte strip. The method of the invention is especially useful for screening fluid analyte samples (e.g., urine) for the presence or absence of drugs of abuse.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">A. Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For ease of understanding, the following definitions will apply throughout this description:</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">1. The term &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; as used herein refers to any analyte which is capable of binding antibodies. Antigens may comprise, without limitation, chemical compounds, polypeptides, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, and the like, including viral particles, viral subunits, bacterial and parasite surface antigens, and host proteins that may be diagnostic of the subject's condition.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">2. A &#x201c;binder&#x201d; refers to a ligand for the analyte as in the format of a sandwich assay, or a ligand for both the analyte and the tracer as in the format of a competitive assay. A binder can be chosen from a group of molecules or compounds capable of binding the analyte, such as an antigen to the antibody analyte, or an antibody to the antigen analyte.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">3. A &#x201c;test zone&#x201d; refers to an area in which a binder or the analyte is attached, movably or immovably, to the test strip portion of an assay device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">4. A &#x201c;tracer&#x201d; refers to a ligand for the analyte or the binder labeled with a detectable label, preferably a visually readable particulate label, such as colloidal gold, latex and liposomes including dye, carbon black, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">5. A &#x201c;sample loading zone&#x201d; refers to an area of a test strip on which a fluid analyte sample is applied for migration to the test zone.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">6. A &#x201c;test strip&#x201d; of the invention consists of, collectively, all of the zone supporting membranes and any filters of the assay device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">7. A &#x201c;fluid analyte sample&#x201d; can be any fluid suspected of containing analyte of interest for which a particular assay is specific. Test sample may represent any body fluid, including urine, blood, sweat, lymph, intraperitoneal fluid, crude tissue extract or homogenate, derived from a fetus, neonate, juvenile or adult subject; a non-biological fluid such as water from some ecological niche, e.g., a river or a lake; or a solution used in a laboratory.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">8. A &#x201c;label&#x201d; is a molecule or compound which directly or indirectly mediates the formation of a signal (such as a color change) which is used in assay to indicate the presence, absence or concentration range of analyte of interest in a test sample. Labels may include enzymes, fluorescers, liposomes, erythrocyte ghosts, polymer microcapsules, color polymer particles (latex), and preferably includes sols of metal-containing compounds. A wide variety of patents and patent applications provide an extensive literature of different techniques for producing detectible signals in immunoassays. The following list of United States patents is merely illustrative of the type of label which can find application in this invention: U.S. Pat. No. 3,646,346 discloses radioactive label; U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,654,090, 3,791,932, and 3,817,838 disclose enzyme labels; U.S. Pat. No. 3,996,345 discloses fluorescer-quencher labels; U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,733 discloses radioactive label; U.S. Pat. No. 4,067,959 discloses fluorescer or enzyme label; U.S. Pat. No. 4,104,099 discloses chemiluminescent label; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,160,645 discloses non-enzymatic catalyst label. U.S. Pat. No. 3,966,879 discloses an electrophoretic technique employing an antibody zone and U.S. Pat. No. 4,120,945 discloses a radioimmune assay (RIA) where labeled analyte is initially bound to a solid support through antibody. U.S. Pat. No. 4,233,402 discloses enzyme pair labels; U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,450 discloses chemically induced fluorescent labels; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,287,300 discloses enzyme anionic charge labels.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Labels can also be metal-containing sols; i.e., metal or metal compounds such as metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal salts, metals or metal-containing compounds mixed with polymers or coated onto polymer nuclei. These metal labels may include dry forms of any of the above-named metal or metal compound sols, and preferably includes colloidal gold in dry form.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">9. A &#x201c;complex&#x201d; means (depending on the context) any multimolecular complex formed by analyte and one or more ligands, or by labeled ligand and immobilized ligand. In a sandwich-type immunoassay, e.g., the following complexes occur: analyte/labeled ligand duplex first produced in the assay (first complex) and analyte/labeled ligand/immobilized ligand triplex formed second in the assay (second complex).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">10. &#x201c;Fluid communication&#x201d; refers to structures which are in contact with, but not necessarily affixed to, one another.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">11. &#x201c;Assay&#x201d; refers to several different types of assay formats in which an analyte of interest can be detected using an assay test strip. For example, in a sandwich-type immunoassay, analytes of interest in the analyte sample, when present, bind a labeled tracer movably incorporated in the test strip (consisting of a porous membrane) at the tracer zone to form a first complex. The tracer is a molecule which binds the analyte of interest and is conjugated to a label, preferably a metal label, and most preferably colloidal gold.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A second immobilized ligand corresponding to the analyte of interest is coupled to the test strip at the test zone. First complex and unbound labeled ligand mix with the test sample and be carried along therewith by capillary action (wicking) through the test zone. Analyte sample passes through the test strip bringing the first complexes, if any, into contact with the unlabeled ligand immobilized in the test zone to form a second complex of labeled ligand-analyte-immobilized ligand. The first immobilized ligand is immobilized in the test zone by means known in the art, including covalent bonding or attachment to an insoluble protein-coated surface (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,200,690 and 5,075,078). When the second complex is formed, a visible color pattern appears in the test zone. Labeled ligand not bound to analyte in the test sample continue migration by wicking into the control zone to contact the ligand immobilized there. The labeled ligand can bind the immobilized ligand in the control zone to form a third complex, and thus be captured in the control zone.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Within the scope of this invention, the labeled ligand forming the complex in the control zone may be the same as the tracer forming the first and second complexes, or it may be a different labeled ligand. The ligand immobilized in the control zone should have specific affinity for the labeled ligand intended to form the third complex. Formation of the third complex is indicated by a visible pattern in the control zone.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Besides sandwich immunoassay method, other assay methods may be implemented in the devices of the invention. These methods may include competition and inhibition assays. In a competition assay, the analyte and tracer have similar affinity properties and compete for binding with immobilized ligand. Thus, in absence of analyte, the pattern (e.g., band) in the test zone is of maximum intensity. When present, the analyte binds to immobilized ligand to prevent the tracer from getting captured in the test zone. Thus, the intensity of the test band is reduced, depending on the concentration of analyte in the test sample.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an inhibition assay, the analyte and immobilized ligand in the test zone each have affinity for the tracer. In the absence of analyte in the analyte sample, the tracer is captured by immobilized ligand, and a visible pattern forms in the test zone. When present, the analyte binds the tracer, thereby preventing it from binding to the immobilized ligand in the test zone. The resulting intensity of the test band is reduced depending on the concentration of analyte in the test sample.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">B. Dipstick Assay Device</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a dipstick form of the assay device is shown in exploded view. The device consists of a housing <b>100</b>, which is defined by base <b>101</b> and cover <b>110</b>. Base <b>101</b> can be constructed of any sterilizable material, such as a nonporous plastic (e.g., the commercially available plastic &#x201c;ABS&#x201d; supplied by the Monsanto Company of St. Louis, Mo.). Base <b>101</b> having a closed end <b>104</b> and an open end <b>106</b>, slots <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, <b>102</b>D and <b>102</b>E separated by rails <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B, <b>103</b>C and <b>103</b>D for insertion of test strips <b>105</b>A, <b>105</b>B, <b>105</b>C, <b>105</b>D and <b>105</b>E. A particular advantage of this embodiment of the assay device is its customizability in that test strips specific for different analytes of interest to the user may be inserted into base <b>101</b> and that the number of test strips employed may vary (e.g., base <b>101</b> may have any number of slots from two upward to accomodate as many test strips as the user may desire).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when inserted into slots <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, <b>102</b>D and <b>102</b>E, the test strips extend out of base <b>101</b> beyond open end <b>106</b>. The length to which the test strips protrude from base <b>101</b> must be sufficient to allow the test strips to contact a fluid analyte sample, preferably by immersion, and most preferably without allowing the fluid to contact housing <b>100</b>. The test strips are conventional in form; therefore, because those of ordinary skill in the art will be abundantly familiar with the design of such test strips, they will not be described in detail here. However, each test strip will have a test zone <b>112</b> for binding of analyte (to indicate a positive test result for the presence of analyte in the analyte sample) and a control zone <b>113</b> for binding of tracer (to indicate correct operation of the assay). Preferably, the test zones and control zones of each test strip lie in the same location on each test strip so each can be viewed in side-by-side fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each test strip is typically constructed of a porous membrane which is substantially inert with respect to the analyte and must be porous or absorbent relative to the analyte sample to be tested, e.g., urine. The substance can be either bibulous matrices or nonbibulous matrices that are insoluble in, and maintain their structural integrity when exposed to aqueous solutions or physiological fluids. Bibulous matrices that can be useful for the devices of the present invention include but are not limited to, paper, sponge materials, cellulose, hydrophilic inorganic powders, wood, synthetic resin fleeces, woven and nonwoven fabrics and like materials. Nonlimiting examples of nonbibulous matrices include glass fiber, permeable polymer films and preformed or microporous membranes. The absorbent material is preferably absorbent paper. The absorbent material can be affixed by a double sided adhesive (e.g., two sided adhesive tape) to a solid moisture impervious support. This support can be constructed from, for example, hydrophobic plastic, cellulose acetate, polyethylene, terephthalate, polycarbonate, or polystyrene.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The tracer is prepared according to the means known in the art. For purposes of producing a clearly visible reaction, labels of metal-containing sols are preferred, with labels of colloidal gold or selenium being most preferred. An example of a suitable product is colloidal gold available from Janssen Life Sciences Products. These colloidal metals produce distinctive visual patterns without addition of further reagents; however, fluorescers (such as fluorescein) and enzymes (such as those identified in U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149), may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Selections and choices for test binders (e.g., immobilized antigens, antibodies and other test and control binders), as well as suitable means for their attachment to porous test strip membranes, are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art and will not be stated in detail here. To maximize contact of test sample with the tracer and all test binders, the area occupied by each reagent on the test strip preferably extends from one side of the membrane to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For further review concerning test strip construction, including selection and preparation of test reagents, the following references provide a representative sample of test strip designs known in the art: U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,264 (commonly owned); U.S. Pat. No. 4,491,645; U.S. Pat. No. 4,943,522; U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,496; U.S. Pat. No. 5,714,389 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,040, the disclosures of which are incorporated for purposes of reference.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Test strips <b>105</b>A, <b>105</b>B, <b>105</b>C, <b>105</b>D and <b>105</b>E may be secured within slots <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, <b>102</b>D and <b>102</b>E by adhesion to the floor of each slot; however, the placement of cover <b>110</b> onto base <b>101</b> is sufficient to retain the test strips within the base slots. To this end, cover <b>110</b> is conveniently constructed of an opaque tape having at least one transparent window <b>111</b> formed therein for viewing of test results along test zone <b>112</b> and control zone <b>113</b>. To secure cover <b>110</b> onto base <b>101</b>, as well as to secure test strips <b>105</b>A, <b>105</b>B, <b>105</b>C, <b>105</b>D and <b>105</b>E within slots <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, <b>102</b>D and <b>102</b>E, cover <b>110</b> is pressed into place to form an adhesive attachment between cover <b>110</b> and the upper edges of rails <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B, <b>103</b>C, and <b>103</b>D. To provide additional surface area for adhesion of cover <b>110</b> to base <b>101</b>, bar <b>107</b> separates closed end wall <b>104</b> of base <b>101</b> from rails <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B, <b>103</b>C, and <b>103</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Conveniently, cover <b>110</b> is also provided with transparent windows <b>115</b>A, <b>115</b>B, <b>115</b>C, <b>115</b>D and <b>115</b>E through which labels on test strips <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, <b>102</b>D and <b>102</b>E can be viewed. The labels (not shown) may be printed with information of use in performing the assay, such as the identity of analyte detectible with each test strip.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In certain instances, it may be desirable to store the assay device after test results are obtained for later viewing. To that end, a five-sided cap <b>120</b> is provided for insertion over open end <b>106</b> of base <b>101</b> (with cover <b>110</b> in place) to protect the protruding ends of test strips <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, <b>102</b>D and <b>102</b>E from contact with other materials, from dessication and from contact with the assay operator. Cap <b>120</b> is easily secured onto the assay device by a close fit, such as a friction fit or snap-fit.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">C. Cassette Assay Device</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some instances (e.g., where the analyte sample is believed to contain pathogenic organisms) it is desirable to protect the assay operator from contact with analyte sample after its application to an assay device. To this end, the dipstick assay device may be conveniently modified for use in closed cassette form.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">More specifically, cap <b>220</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>) is adapted to convert the dipstick assay device into a cassette. Cap <b>220</b> is similar in design to cap <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), except that sample application slot <b>221</b> is formed therein to permit analyte sample to be applied to test strips <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, <b>202</b>C, <b>202</b>D and <b>202</b>E dropwise; e.g., by pipetting the sample through slot <b>221</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, only strip <b>202</b>A is visible from the side view and the device housing is not shown). To avoid sample overflow, a reservoir <b>222</b> may be provided in the inner floor <b>223</b> of cap <b>220</b> by, for example, providing raised bar <b>226</b> on floor <b>223</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, floor <b>223</b> is shown as if split from roof <b>225</b> of the cap only for the purpose of permitting reservoir <b>222</b> to be viewed in the drawing). A downwardly protruding bar <b>224</b> is provided from the inner surface of roof <b>225</b> of cap <b>220</b> to depress the test strips into reservoir <b>222</b> so each test strip has equal access to the analyte sample. After performance of the assay, cap <b>220</b> remains in place on the assay device to protect the protruding ends of the test strips from contact with other materials, from dessication and from contact with the assay operator.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">D. Separator Device for Division of Analyte Sample</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">If a positive result is obtained from use of the assay device of the invention, it is usually necessary to further characterize the detected compound to better enable its identification; e.g., by mass spectrometry. However, it is rarely practical to ask that more than one assay sample be obtained from a subject. As such, any assay sample which is obtained must be divided into portions of sufficient volume for repeated testing, for example by pouring the original sample into separate specimen containers (at the risk of operator contamination and sample loss). Even where the sample is only to be assayed once, the tendency of subjects to provide abundant urine samples poses a different problem in that too much sample can saturate a test strip and overwhelm the assay reagents. Again, division of the sample is required.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The separator device of the invention provides simple means for dividing a sample while protecting the sample from contamination and the operator from the sample. To these ends, the separator device consists of a ring which is just smaller in diameter than the inner diameter of the open end of a specimen collection cup so, when pressed inside of the open end of the cup, the ring will remain seated there. A collection chamber (for example, a &#x201c;V&#x201d; shaped well) extends across the ring and is attached thereto so the ends of the collection chamber are closed by the inner walls of the ring.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In use, an assay fluid is placed within the specimen collection cup to a level below the point where the separator device will be seated. The assay operator presses the separator device into place and seals the specimen collection cup with a cap. The operator inverts the specimen collection cup several times so fluid pours into the collection chamber of the separator device. The balance of the fluid assay remains below the level of the separator device and is therefore protected from contact with reagents or other material placed therein. A test strip (such as the assay device of the invention) is placed into contact with the portion of the assay sample contained within the collection chamber of the separator device; e.g., by dipping an end of the test strip into the collection chamber. After the assay sample is loaded from the collection chamber onto the test strip, the latter is removed and the separator device is carefully lifted from the specimen collection cup for disposal.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Use of the separator device provides the assay operator with a volume of assay sample fluid which is sufficiently limited to avoid saturation of the test strip. For example, where the assay device utilized is the device of this invention, the collection chamber is of a depth and length sufficiently limited so the maximum fluid level achievable in the collection chamber is lower than the level of the assay device housing. The uncontaminated balance of the assay sample still in the specimen collection cup is available for further testing; e.g., for mass spectrometry to determine the identity of any compounds detected in the initial assay of the portion of the sample separated in the separator device. Conveniently, the separator device may be provided in the form of a kit, including the separator device, a sterilized specimen collection cup with cap and forceps for removal of the separator device from the cup after performance of the assay. Such a kit may also be provided with the assay device of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An example of a separator device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref>. Although the separator device shown is in the shape of a ring (to correspond to the common cup-like shape of urine collection cups), those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the separator device may be of any shape which conforms to a specimen collection container having at least one open end into which the separator device may be seated.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a top view of separator device <b>400</b> is provided. Ring <b>401</b> has an OD of slightly less than the ID of the specimen collection cup into which the separator device is to be placed. Collection chamber <b>402</b> spans ring <b>401</b> and is defined by walls <b>403</b> and <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Looking through separator device <b>400</b> along line A-A from cut-away point B-B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), it is seen that walls <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> meet at point <b>405</b> to form a V-shaped well. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that collection chamber <b>402</b> may take the form of a half-circular, squared or other shaped well, but a V-shape is a convenient well form to manufacture. Collection chamber <b>402</b> is closed at both ends of the well by inner surface <b>406</b> of ring <b>401</b>. Also, it will be appreciated that separator device <b>400</b> may be provided with more than one collection chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows separator device <b>400</b> in place within specimen collection cup <b>410</b>. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> that the height of ring <b>401</b> is restricted so neither it nor collection chamber <b>402</b> extend above the level of the open mouth <b>411</b> of cup <b>410</b> (to avoid interfering with closure of cup <b>410</b> by its cap [not shown]). Assay sample fluid <b>412</b> remains below separator device <b>400</b> in cup <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Separator device <b>400</b> may be constructed of any sterilizable material which is acceptable for use with fluid assay samples, the identity of which will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., plastics such as polycarbonate and glass). Preferably, the material will be non-porous and hydrophobic.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">E. Methods for Use of the Assay Devices</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The method of the invention may be used to detect any analyte present in fluid sample. The invention is especially useful for detection of monoepitopic and polyepitopic antigens and antibodies associated with pathologies, as well as physiological compounds and drugs.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The assay devices of the invention are particularly well suited for use in drug screening assays and for diagnostic testing of organisms. In the former respect, a five drug panel of assay tests is recommended by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which includes tests for tetrahydrocannabinol and other marijuana metabolites, cocaine metabolites, opiate metabolites, phencyclidine (PCP, Angel Dust), and amphetamines. For a more extensive substance abuse testing panel, the choice of analytes tested can include marijuana metabolites; tetrahydrocannabinol and other marijuana metabolites, cocaine metabolites, opiate metabolites, phencyclidine (PCP, Angel Dust), amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methaqualone, and propoxyphene. The analyte test strips for drug tests preferably have the sensitivity equal to the cutoffs recommended by Substance Abuse Mental Health Service Administration (SAMSHA) and NIDA, which most employers use. Binders and reagents for use in constructing test strips for use in detecting drugs of abuse are well-known in the art and will not be described in detail here; however, representative sources of such materials are described in the Examples below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Subjects undergoing drug tests are often creative in their attempts to adulterate the analyte samples to evade detection of drugs of abuse likely to be present in the sample. To minimize the effects of such evasion efforts on results obtainable with the assay devices of the invention, test strips may be provided in the devices which indicate the integrity and condition of the analyte sample. For example, test strips may be provided to simultaneously assay the analyte sample for for pH, osmolality (the total concentration of solutes in urine, expressed as mOsm/kg and measured as a function of fluid specific gravity), or the presence of albumin.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In test strips for pH, the strip is impregnated with various dyes that respond with different color changes to a pH in the range of 5 to 9. Depending on the acid-base status, urinary pH may range from as low as 4.5 to as high as 8.0. Although this test is done routinely, it neither identifies nor excludes patients with urinary system disease. The test can, however, indicate that the condition of the urine sample has deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">To test the specific gravity (which is directly proportional to urine osmolality) of an analyte test fluid, analyte test strips are available that measure specific gravity in approximations. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,318,709, to Falb et al., issued Mar. 9, 1982, provides a test means for determining the ionic strength or specific gravity of an aqueous test sample, the test means comprising a weakly acidic or weakly basic polyelectrolyte which is at least partially neutralized, and an indicator means capable of producing a detectable response to ion exchange between the polyelectrolyte and the sample. The test device is a carrier matrix incorporated with the test means, and the method for its use involves contacting an aqueous test sample with the device and observing a detectable response. The disclosure of the '709 Patent is incorporated for reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Normal urine osmolality varies between 50 and 1200 mOsm/kg (specific gravity between 1.002 and 1.035). Any urine having a specific gravity over 1.035 is either contaminated, contains very high levels of glucose, or the patient may have recently received high density radiopaque dyes intravenously for radiographic studies or low molecular weight dextran solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Commercially available analyte test strips also permit simple and rapid testing for protein. Methods based on dye binding techniques have proven especially useful because dye binding methods are readily automated and provide reproducible and accurate results. In general, dye binding techniques use pH indicator dyes that are capable of interacting with a protein, such as albumin, and that are capable of changing color upon interaction with a protein absent any change in pH. When a pH indicator dye interacts with, or binds to, a protein, the apparent pKa (acid dissociation constant) of the indicator dye is altered and the dye undergoes a color transition, producing the so-called &#x201c;protein-error&#x201d; phenomenon. In methods utilizing the dye binding technique, an appropriate buffer maintains the pH indicator even at a constant pH to prevent a color transition of the pH indicator dye due to a substantial shift in pH. Due to the &#x201c;protein-error&#x201d; phenomena, upon interaction with the protein, the pH indicator dyes undergoes a color transition that is identical to the color change arising because of a change in the pH. Examples of pH indicator dyes used in the dry phase assay of proteins that are capable of interacting with or binding to proteins and exhibiting &#x201c;protein-error&#x201d; color transitions include tetrabromophenol blue and tetrachlorophenol-3,4,5,6-tetrabromosulfophthalein. Simple, accurate and inexpensive protein detection assays have been developed for the detection or measurement of protein in urine and serum (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,096,833 to Lau et al., incorporated herein for reference).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The method of the invention is performed by applying analyte sample to test strips by immersion (dipstick forms of the device) or by applying the sample dropwise through slot <b>221</b> in cap <b>220</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; representing cassette forms of the device). After waiting a predetermined time, such as from about 15 seconds to about 60 seconds, test results are viewed through window <b>111</b> or <b>211</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), either visually or by an instrument. A color change in test zone <b>112</b> or <b>212</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) indicates the presence or concentration of analyte in the sample. When no band appears in test zones, or if the control band is neither distinct nor fully formed, the assay is regarded as incompetent to indicate the presence or absence of analyte in the test samples and may be performed again. In addition, the assay can be made quantitative by employing spectrophotometric or calorimetric techniques, as opposed to visual techniques, in order to more reliably and more accurately measure the degree of color transition, and therefore more accurately measure the concentration of analyte in the test sample.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">F. Kits</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The invention provides a kit useful for the detection of analytes of interest, having a carrier compartmentalized to receive one or more containers holding the multianalyte assay device of the invention or parts thereof. Preferably, the multianalyte assay device is part of a kit which may be composed of the device, instructions for its use, a sample collection cup, a capillary device for measuring test sample, a pipette for introduction of sample to the device, and a desiccant packet.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Desiccant provides low humidity conditions necessary for preservation of reagents during the shelf life of the device. Alternatively, a desiccant tablet or a desiccant packet may be included in an air-tight protective pouch with the device. Instructions for use of the multianalyte assay device may be printed onto the cover or onto the packaging of the multianalyte assay device or may be printed in literature to be packaged with the multianalyte assay device. The kit may additionally include an attached temperature strip, lids for the specimen cup, and the literature. Components of such a kit for use in performing an assay procedure (e.g., excluding printed instructions) are preferably to be sealed in one or more air-tight packages, such as foil packets.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Assay for Six Drugs of Abuse</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Six chromatographic strips for detecting drugs of abuse (methamphetamine, opiates/morphine, marijuana/tetrahydrocannabinol, amphetamine, cocaine/benzoylecgonine, benzodiazepine) each of a size of 5 mm&#xd7;73 mm were placed in slots of the device of the invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each strip consisted of a colloidal gold-labeled antibody (specific to the target drug) incorporated into the upstream end of the strip (tracer zone) in the middle of a 30 mm fiberglass matrix, and an antigen-BSA binder immobilized in the center (binder zone) of a 22 mm nitrocellulose membrane lying downstream of, and in fluid communication with, the fiberglass matrix (wherein the antigen is either the drug of interest or an analog thereof having the same immunogenicity). Downstream to the nitrocellulose membrane was a 26 mm long filter paper. The matrix, membrane and filter paper were attached on a vinyl sheet so each was in fluid communication, by overlapping 2 mm of each of their ends.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">15 drops (0.7 ml each) of analyte sample (human urine) were applied to the sample port. Results were read after 10 minutes. The presence or absence of a pink-rose color band in the binder zone indicated negative or positive results for the presence of each drug of interest in the analyte sample.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For comparison, additional aliquots of the analyte samples were separately tested for the presence of the same drugs of abuse by a commercial assay (Syva EMIT EIA II). The second panel of test results correlated with the results obtained according to the invention.</p>
