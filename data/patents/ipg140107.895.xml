<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring in more details to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> illustrate a fuel tank <b>10</b> such as may be used to retain a supply of fuel for a vehicle, like a car, truck, bus, van, SUV, and the like, although other types of tanks and vehicles (boats, motorcycles, ATV's, etc) may be used. Liquid fuel within the fuel tank <b>10</b> may be pumped from the tank and delivered under pressure to an engine of the vehicle to support operation of the engine. The fuel tank <b>10</b> may be formed of any suitable material (such as plastic and/or metal) and in any suitable way. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, the fuel tank <b>10</b> may have an internal barrier <b>12</b>, such as a hump, baffle, wall or other body formed in one-piece with or separately from the tank <b>10</b>. The internal barrier <b>12</b> may define more than one internal volume or section <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the fuel tank <b>10</b>, wherein at least at certain levels of fuel in the tank, the fuel may be divided into one or more of the sections and not generally free to flow between the sections (e.g. when the level of fuel is below the minimum height of the barrier <b>12</b>). In the implementation shown, the tank is a so-called &#x201c;saddle tank&#x201d; where the barrier <b>12</b> is a saddle shaped portion of the tank that provides clearance for adjacent components of the vehicle, such as, for example, an exhaust pipe or drive shaft. Of course, other shapes and configurations of the fuel tank <b>10</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition to liquid fuel, air and fuel vapors may be present within the interior volume of the fuel tank <b>10</b>. Current governmental regulations limit the emissions of fuel vapor from the fuel tank <b>10</b> and/or emissions of hydrocarbons from the vehicle in general. To reduce the emission of hydrocarbon fuel vapors from the tank <b>10</b>, a venting system <b>20</b> may be used. The venting system <b>20</b> may include one or more components within the fuel tank <b>10</b> and/or one or more components outside of the fuel tank. In the implementation shown, the venting system <b>20</b> includes two vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> interconnected by a support <b>26</b>, and a vapor canister <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that is communicated with the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to receive fuel vapor that flows from the vent valves. The vapor canister <b>28</b> may be located inside or outside of the fuel tank <b>10</b>, and is shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as being outside of the fuel tank. The vapor canister <b>28</b> may be of conventional construction and operation. The vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may communicate with the vapor canister through one or more vent lines <b>29</b> so that fuel vapor may flow from within the tank <b>10</b>, through the vent valve(s) <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and to the vapor canister <b>28</b> during at least certain fuel level conditions within the fuel tank.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may each include a housing <b>30</b> having a first inlet <b>32</b> at a lower end of the housing, a second inlet <b>34</b> spaced above the first inlet, an outlet <b>36</b> through which gaseous matter (referred to hereafter as fuel vapor) may be vented, and a valve <b>38</b> carried by the housing and operable to selectively close the outlet <b>36</b>. Gaseous matter (e.g. air and fuel vapor) may enter at least the second inlet <b>34</b> whereupon it flows through or past the valve <b>38</b>, when the valve is open, and out of the fuel tank <b>10</b> to the vapor canister <b>28</b>. Liquid fuel may enter the first inlet <b>32</b> and, when the level of fuel in the tank <b>10</b> is high enough, may close the valve <b>38</b> within the housing <b>30</b> to prevent further venting through that vent valve <b>22</b> or <b>24</b>. In this way, the valve <b>38</b> is responsive to and actuated by liquid fuel to move from an open position to a closed position and provide a mechanical closure of the vent valve. The valve <b>38</b> may include a float or buoyant body that is responsive to the level of fuel in the tank at least when a portion of the float is acted upon (e.g. immersed) in liquid fuel. The vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may include a baffle or other shield that prevents or inhibits liquid fuel from exiting the valve <b>38</b> through the outlet <b>36</b> even if liquid fuel enters the vent valve housing <b>30</b> through the second inlet <b>34</b>. The vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may function and be constructed as shown in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0000542A1, or U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2001/0011538A1, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein, by reference, in its entirety. Of course, the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> could be constructed in a different manner, and more than two vent valves may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be mounted within the tank by the support <b>26</b>. The support <b>26</b> may include a body <b>39</b> having main passage <b>40</b> through which the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> communicate with each other. The body <b>39</b> may be a rigid and may fully support the vent valves and hold them in position within the fuel tank <b>10</b>, if desired. The support <b>26</b> may have a separate inlet <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> each associated with a separate one of the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, respectively, and at least one outlet <b>46</b> through which fuel vapor is routed from the main passage <b>40</b> to, for example, a vapor canister <b>28</b>. The inlets <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may be defined at opposed ends of the support <b>26</b> and may include connection features <b>47</b> adapted to receive and retain outlet connectors or conduits <b>49</b> of the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The outlet <b>46</b> may include one or more barbs <b>48</b> or other feature(s) adapted to receive a conduit <b>29</b> communicating the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> with the vapor canister <b>28</b>. The support <b>26</b> may be rigid, and may couple the valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> together. The support <b>26</b> may be carried by or held in position relative to the fuel tank <b>10</b>, and may retain the position of the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> within the fuel tank. The vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be spaced apart so that at least one vent valve <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> is located on either side of the central saddle or barrier <b>12</b> of the tank <b>10</b>. In other words, one vent valve <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be located in each chamber <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the tank <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the support <b>26</b> may be long enough to span the saddle portion of the tank. The support may also be bent or contoured to locate the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> at a desired height relative to the tank and each other. The support <b>26</b> may include a mounting feature, such as a stem <b>50</b>. In the implementation shown, the outlet <b>36</b> and stem <b>50</b> extend generally perpendicularly to the main passage <b>40</b>, and in opposite directions, but other arrangements and implementations may be used. The stem <b>50</b> may be adapted to be coupled to a connector <b>52</b> and may include an outwardly extending flange <b>54</b> spaced from a free end <b>56</b> of the stem <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The connector <b>52</b> may be formed integrally with the fuel tank <b>10</b> (e.g. from the same piece of material as at least part of the tank) or it may be a separate component carried by or coupled to the fuel tank either while or after the tank is formed. When it is formed separately from the tank, the connector <b>52</b> may include a flange <b>58</b> adapted to be coupled to the tank <b>10</b> and a stem passage <b>62</b> in which the stem <b>50</b> of the support <b>26</b> is received, in assembly. The stem <b>50</b> and stem passage <b>62</b> may each be generally cylindrical and the stem may be rotatable relative to the connector <b>52</b> and about an axis <b>64</b> of the stem and stem passage. In this way, the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may rotate or pivot about the stem <b>50</b>. A retention feature may be provided on or carried by the connector <b>52</b> to retain the stem <b>50</b> within the stem passage <b>62</b>. In the implementation shown, and as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the retention finger may include a finger <b>66</b> with a catch or hook <b>68</b>. The finger <b>66</b> may also include a ramp <b>70</b> adapted to engage the flange <b>58</b> as the stem <b>50</b> is inserted into the stem passage <b>62</b>, and the finger <b>66</b> may be flexible so that it may bend away from the axis <b>64</b> of the stem passage <b>62</b> as the ramp <b>70</b> passes over the flange <b>58</b>. After the ramp <b>70</b> passes the flange <b>58</b>, the resilient nature of the finger <b>66</b> causes it to return towards its unbent position wherein the hook <b>68</b> overlaps the flange <b>58</b> to retain the position of the support <b>26</b> relative to the connector <b>52</b> and prevent unintended removal of the stem <b>50</b> from the stem passage <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the implementation shown, the support <b>26</b> is coupled to the tank <b>10</b> in the area of and above the saddle portion <b>12</b> of the tank <b>10</b>, and the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are located on opposite sides of the stem <b>50</b> and on opposite sides of a highest point of the saddle portion <b>12</b> of the tank <b>10</b>. The highest point of the saddle portion <b>12</b> of the tank <b>10</b> defines the minimum fuel level at which fuel in the tank may flow into either chamber <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the tank <b>10</b>, or in other words, the highest barrier between the tank chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be raised or lowered depending on the level of fuel within the tank chambers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a situation when the level of fuel is equal in each tank chamber <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and the tank <b>10</b> may be full (the tank <b>10</b> may be considered full when no further liquid fuel is to be added to the tank even though some interior volume of the tank may not be filled with fuel, as will be discussed further below). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a situation when the level of fuel (denoted by line <b>75</b>) in the chamber <b>16</b> shown on the right-hand side of that view is higher than the level of fuel (denoted by line <b>77</b>) in the other tank chamber <b>14</b>. And <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a situation when the level of fuel <b>77</b> in the chamber <b>14</b> shown on the left-hand side of that view is higher than the level of fuel <b>75</b> in the other tank chamber <b>16</b>. Hence, the rotation or pivoted movement of the support <b>26</b> and valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> about the stem <b>50</b> and relative to the tank <b>10</b> is shown in these different drawings. The rotation of the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and support <b>26</b> is driven by liquid fuel acting on the vent valves as the level of fuel in either chamber reaches a level sufficient to displace the valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Due to fuel sloshing, inclination of the vehicle (and hence, its fuel tank), the level of fuel in one chamber <b>14</b> or <b>16</b> of the tank <b>10</b> may be different from the other chamber <b>14</b> or <b>16</b>. Also, fuel may primarily be pumped from one chamber (shown as chamber <b>16</b>) to support engine operation, and/or fuel may also primarily be added to one chamber (e.g. chamber <b>16</b>) of the tank <b>10</b> during refilling of the tank with liquid fuel. Therefore, in use, as fuel is pumped from the tank <b>10</b> or added into the tank, the level of fuel in the tank chambers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be uneven.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Some fuel tank systems include a siphon or transfer pump that transfers fuel from a secondary chamber (e.g. chamber <b>14</b>) to a primary chamber (e.g. chamber <b>16</b>) in which the main fuel pump is located. This may help even out differences in fuel level between different portions or chambers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of a tank <b>10</b>, or ensure that fuel in a secondary chamber <b>14</b> (where the main fuel pump is not located) is made available to the main fuel pump and engine. The transfer pump, in at least some implementations, may only be active when the main fuel pump is operating. Hence, when the vehicle is off and fuel is being added to the tank <b>10</b>, the transfer pump might not operate and the level of fuel in the chambers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the tank <b>10</b> may be uneven.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">During refilling of the fuel tank <b>10</b>, liquid fuel is discharged from a refueling nozzle of a refueling station (i.e. &#x201c;gas station&#x201d;) and into the fuel tank through a fill tube <b>72</b> (shown only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) connected to the fuel tank <b>10</b>. The liquid fuel level rises within the tank <b>10</b> until the liquid fuel causes liquid actuated or responsive valves <b>38</b> (which may include a buoyant member or float) within the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to close. Prior to the vent valves closing, gasses (fuel vapor, air) were displaced by the incoming fuel and vented from the tank <b>10</b> through the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. When the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> close, fuel vapor is no longer vented from the fuel tank <b>10</b> and the pressure within the fuel tank increases as still further fuel is added to the fuel tank. Fuel can be added to the fuel tank <b>10</b> until fuel backs up within the fill tube <b>72</b> and liquid fuel is sensed by a sensor on the refueling nozzle which shuts off the refueling nozzle to terminate the refilling event.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some fuel tanks, due to the size and shape requirements of the fuel tank, one portion or chamber of the tank may be filled to a maximum level wherein its vent valve is closed by the liquid fuel in that chamber. This may occur, for example, where the height of the saddle portion is higher than the maximum fill level in a given portion of the tank so that fuel does not flow from one chamber to the other chamber over the saddle portion even when one chamber is full enough to close the vent valve. When this happens, because the vent valve is closed, it may be impossible to add additional fuel to the fuel tank, even though there is room for fuel in another chamber or portion of the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">This situation can be avoided by the pivoted support <b>26</b> and pivoted vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> described herein. Because the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> can move within the chambers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the fuel tank <b>10</b>, one of the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> can remain open even when the other vent valve is closed. This maintains a vent path for fuel vapor to be displaced from the fuel tank <b>10</b> so that additional fuel can be added to the fuel tank <b>10</b> without increasing the pressure within the tank <b>10</b> to the point that the refueling nozzle is shut off. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, even though the chamber <b>14</b> shown on the left-hand side of that drawing may contain fuel at a level wherein the vent valve <b>22</b> would normally be closed, the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and support <b>26</b> may rotate (clockwise as shown in this view) so that at least the vent valve <b>24</b> remains open. The opposite situation is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> wherein the vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and support <b>26</b> are rotated counterclockwise (compared to the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the fuel level in the right-hand tank chamber <b>16</b> is full or nearly so while the left hand tank chamber <b>14</b> is not full. In this way, premature closing of the vent path from the fuel tank <b>10</b> may be avoided to permit fuel to be added to the fuel tank <b>10</b> even when one or more chambers of the fuel tank are full, but one or more other chambers are not. Rotation or pivoted movement of the support <b>26</b> and vent valves <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be limited by engagement of either the support or valves with the fuel tank <b>10</b>, or with one or more stop surfaces or other components within the fuel tank.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, alternate first and second vent valves <b>22</b>&#x2032;, <b>24</b>&#x2032; may be defined by one or openings in a support <b>26</b>&#x2032;. For example, a first valve <b>22</b>&#x2032; may be defined by a first open end of the <b>26</b>&#x2032; and a second valve <b>24</b>&#x2032; may be defined by a second open end of the support <b>26</b>&#x2032;. The vent valves <b>22</b>&#x2032; and <b>24</b>&#x2032; are responsive to the level of liquid fuel in the tank at least because they are open when not immersed in liquid, and closed when immersed in liquid. Accordingly, the vent valves could comprise mechanical closures as discussed with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, or more simply, openings closed by liquid (hydraulic closures) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The support <b>26</b>&#x2032; may be pivoted within the fuel tank, as discussed above with regard to the support <b>26</b> and provide a similar operation and functionality as discussed with regard to the devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. While the openings defining the first and second vent valves are shown as opening in the support, the support may include or be associated with vent tubes having the openings, such as open ends, that extend from or are otherwise carried by the support. The remainder of the system may be constructed as shown and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, with the same reference numbers applied to the same or similar components.</p>
