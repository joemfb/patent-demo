<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a light emitting diode (LED) and a method of fabricating the same, and more particularly, to an LED to which a substrate separating process is applied, and a method of fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A light emitting diode (LED), which is a semiconductor device having a structure in which an N-type semiconductor and a P-type semiconductor are joined together, emits light through the recombination of electrons and holes. LEDs have been widely used as display devices and backlights. Further, LEDs have lower electric power consumption and a longer lifespan as compared with conventional light bulbs or fluorescent lamps, so that their application areas have been expanded to the use for general illumination while substituting for conventional incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, alternating current (AC) LEDs that continuously emit light by being directly connected to an AC power source have been commercialized. For example, an LED that may be directly connected to a high-voltage AC power source is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,417,259, issued to Sakai, et al.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to Sakai, et al., LED elements (i.e., light emitting cells) are two-dimensionally connected in series on a single insulating substrate such as a sapphire substrate to form LED arrays. Such LED arrays are connected in reverse parallel to one another on the sapphire substrate. As a result, there is provided a single-chip LED which may be driven by an AC power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the AC LED as described above, light emitting cells are formed on a substrate used as a growth substrate, e.g., a sapphire substrate. Therefore, the structure of the light emitting cells may be restricted, so that there may be a limitation in improving the light extraction efficiency. In order to solve such a problem, a method of fabricating an AC LED to which a substrate separating process is applied has been disclosed in U.S. Application Publication No. 2009/0166645, applied for by Lee.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> are sectional views illustrating a method of fabricating an LED according to a related art.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, semiconductor layers including a buffer layer <b>23</b>, an N-type semiconductor layer <b>25</b>, an active layer <b>27</b> and a P-type semiconductor layer <b>29</b> are formed on a sacrificial substrate <b>21</b>. A first metal layer <b>31</b> is formed on the semiconductor layers, and a second metal layer <b>53</b> is formed on a substrate <b>51</b> which is discrete from the sacrificial substrate <b>21</b>. The first metal layer <b>31</b> may include a reflective metal layer. The second metal layer <b>53</b> is joined with the first metal layer <b>31</b> so that the substrate <b>51</b> is bonded on the semiconductor layers <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, and <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, after the substrate <b>51</b> is bonded, the sacrificial substrate <b>21</b> is separated using a laser lift-off process. After the sacrificial substrate <b>21</b> is separated, the remaining buffer layer <b>23</b> is removed so that a surface of the N-type semiconductor layer <b>25</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a photolithography and etching technique is used to pattern the semiconductor layers <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, and <b>29</b> and the metal layers <b>31</b> and <b>53</b>, so that metal patterns <b>40</b> spaced apart from each other and light emitting cells <b>30</b> positioned on partial regions of the respective metal patterns are formed. Each of the light emitting cells <b>30</b> includes a patterned P-type semiconductor layer <b>29</b><i>a</i>, a patterned active layer <b>27</b><i>a </i>and a patterned N-type semiconductor layer <b>25</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, metal wires <b>57</b> are formed to electrically connect upper surfaces of the light emitting cells <b>30</b> to the metal patterns <b>40</b> adjacent to the light emitting cells <b>30</b>, respectively. The metal wires <b>57</b> connect the light emitting cells <b>30</b> to each other, thereby forming a serial array of light emitting cells <b>30</b>. In order to be connected with the metal wire <b>57</b>, an electrode pad <b>55</b> may be formed on the N-type semiconductor layer <b>25</b><i>a</i>, and another electrode pad may be formed on the metal pattern <b>40</b>. Two or more arrays may be formed, and these arrays are connected in reverse parallel, thereby providing an LED capable of being driven under AC power.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the related art as described above, the material comprising the substrate <b>51</b> may be variously selected to improve the heat dissipation performance of the LED, and a surface of the N-type semiconductor layer <b>25</b><i>a </i>may be treated to enhance the light extraction efficiency of the LED. Further, since a first metal layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>includes a reflective metal layer to reflect the light which runs from the light emitting cells <b>30</b> toward the substrate <b>51</b>, the light emitting efficiency may be further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, while the semiconductor layers <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>29</b> and the metal layers <b>31</b> and <b>53</b> in the related art are patterned, etching by-products of metal materials may be stuck to sidewalls of the light emitting cell <b>30</b>, so that an electrical short circuit may be caused between the N-type and P-type semiconductor layers <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>a</i>. Further, a surface of the first metal layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>exposed during the etching of the semiconductor layers <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>29</b> may be easily damaged by plasma. If the first metal layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>includes a reflective metal layer such as Ag or Al, such etching damage may increase, causing the LED to deteriorate. The damage of the surface of the metal layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>caused by plasma may decrease the adhesion of the wires <b>57</b> or the electrode pads <b>55</b> which are formed on the surface thereof, and may thereby result in a device failure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Meanwhile, according to the related art, since the first metal layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>may include a reflective metal layer, light emitted from the active layers <b>27</b><i>a </i>toward the substrate <b>51</b> from the light emitting cells <b>30</b> may be reflected away from the substrate <b>51</b>. However, light may not be reflected in spaces between the light emitting cells <b>30</b> due to etching damage or oxidation of the reflective metal layer. Further, because the reflective metal layer may have a maximum reflectance of about 90%, there may be a limitation in improving the reflectance. Furthermore, since the substrate <b>51</b> is exposed in regions between the metal patterns <b>40</b>, light may be absorbed by the substrate <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, since the wires <b>57</b> are connected onto upper surfaces, i.e., light emitting surfaces, of the N-type semiconductor layers <b>25</b><i>a</i>, respectively, the light generated in the active layers <b>27</b><i>a </i>may be absorbed by the wires <b>57</b> and/or the electrode pads <b>55</b> on the light emitting surfaces, so that light loss may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view illustrating an LED having light emitting cells connected in series according to the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the LED includes a substrate <b>51</b>, a bonding metal <b>41</b>, an adhesive layer <b>39</b>, an intermediate insulating layer <b>37</b>, a barrier metal layer <b>35</b>, a reflective metal layer <b>33</b>, light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, an insulating layer <b>63</b>, and a connector <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The substrate <b>51</b> is distinguished from a growth substrate (not shown), and is a secondary substrate bonded to nitride semiconductor layers <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, and <b>29</b> through the bonding metal <b>41</b> after the nitride semiconductor layers <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, and <b>29</b> are grown on the growth substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Meanwhile, each of the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> includes an n-type nitride semiconductor layer <b>25</b>, an active layer <b>27</b>, and a p-type nitride semiconductor layer <b>29</b>, and an upper surface of the n-type nitride semiconductor layer <b>25</b> may be configured to be a roughened surface R.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The intermediate insulating layer <b>37</b> is interposed between the substrate <b>51</b> and the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> so that the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are electrically insulated from the substrate <b>51</b>. The reflective metal layer <b>33</b> and the barrier metal layer <b>35</b> are also interposed between the intermediate insulating layer <b>37</b> and the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. The reflective metal layer <b>33</b> reflects light which is generated in the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> and is emitted towards the substrate <b>51</b>, thereby improving the light emitting efficiency. The barrier metal layer <b>35</b> covers the reflective metal layer <b>33</b> so that the barrier metal layer <b>35</b> may prevent the diffusion of the reflective metal layer <b>33</b> and the oxidation of the reflective metal layer <b>33</b>. Further, a portion of the barrier metal layer <b>35</b> is exposed by being extended from a region below the light emitting cell S<b>2</b> to a cell separation region.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The connector <b>65</b> connects the n-type semiconductor layer <b>25</b> of the light emitting cell S<b>1</b> to the barrier metal layer <b>35</b> so that the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are connected in series. The insulating layer <b>63</b> is interposed between the connector <b>65</b> and the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> to prevent the n-type and p-type semiconductor layers <b>25</b> and <b>29</b> from being electrically short-circuited by the connector <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Silver (Ag) may be used as the reflective metal layer <b>33</b>. Ag may be easily oxidized and diffused by heat. Further, an etching gas, e.g., BCl<sub>3</sub>/Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas, used to separate the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> may easily produce etching by-products through chemical reaction with the Ag. The etching by-products may be stuck to side surfaces of the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, and therefore, an electric short circuit may be caused. In order to prevent the electric short circuit in the related art, the reflective metal layer <b>33</b> is covered with the barrier metal layer <b>35</b>, and then the barrier metal layer <b>35</b> is configured to be exposed in a separation process of the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, since the barrier metal layer <b>35</b> is added to protect the reflective metal layer <b>33</b> according to the related art, a metal layer deposition process may be complicated. Further, since the reflective metal layer <b>33</b> is formed and the barrier metal layer <b>35</b> then covers the reflective metal layer <b>33</b>, a step occurs in a side surface of the reflective metal layer <b>33</b>. The step increases as the thickness of the reflective metal layer <b>33</b> increases. Particularly, if a plurality of metal layers is deposited to form the barrier metal layer <b>35</b>, stresses may be concentrated around the step, so that cracks may be produced in the barrier metal layer <b>35</b>. Particularly, since the substrate <b>51</b> is bonded at a relatively high temperature, cracks may be produced at the step during the bonding of the substrate <b>51</b>, so that a device failure may be caused.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Meanwhile, if the reflective metal layer <b>33</b> is formed of Ag, the reflectance of the reflective metal layer <b>33</b> may be increased compared with forming the reflective metal layer <b>33</b> of other metals.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these exemplary embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the size and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on or directly connected to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>is a plan view illustrating an LED according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>b </i>and <b>6</b><i>c </i>are sectional views respectively taken along lines A-A and B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, for illustrating the LED according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d </i>is an equivalent circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>. In the present exemplary embodiment, an LED with a mirror symmetric structure has been described, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>, <b>6</b><i>c </i>and <b>6</b><i>d</i>, the LED includes a substrate <b>151</b>, a semiconductor stack <b>130</b>, isolation trenches <b>161</b>, connectors <b>135</b>, <b>135</b><i>a </i>and <b>135</b><i>b</i>, and a distribution Bragg reflector (DBR) <b>131</b> and <b>131</b><i>a</i>. The LED may further include an ohmic contact layer <b>133</b>, a separation insulating layer <b>137</b>, an adhesive layer <b>139</b>, a bonding metal <b>141</b>, a protective insulating layer <b>163</b>, and electrode pads <b>165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The substrate <b>151</b> is distinguished from a growth substrate for growing compound semiconductor layers, and is a substrate attached to the compound semiconductor layers which have been previously grown. Although the substrate <b>151</b> may be a sapphire substrate, the present invention is not limited thereto. That is, the substrate <b>151</b> may be another kind of insulating or conductive substrate. Particularly, if a sapphire substrate is used as the growth substrate for the semiconductor layers, the substrate <b>151</b> may be a sapphire substrate. Forming the substrate <b>151</b> from the same material as the growth substrate means these have the same thermal expansion coefficient as, which may be advantageous in view of the processes of bonding the substrate <b>151</b> and separating the growth substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The semiconductor stack <b>130</b> is divided into a plurality of regions S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> and P by the isolation trenches <b>161</b>. The semiconductor stack <b>130</b> includes a first conductivity type upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b>, an active layer <b>127</b> and a second conductivity type lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b>. The active layer <b>127</b> is interposed between the upper and lower semiconductor layers <b>125</b> and <b>129</b>. Meanwhile, in each of the regions S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b>, the active layer <b>127</b> and the lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b> are positioned so that a partial region of the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b> is exposed downward. That is, the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b> has a width greater than a width of the active layer <b>127</b> and the lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The active layer <b>127</b> and the upper and lower semiconductor layers <b>125</b> and <b>129</b> may be formed of a III-Nitride-based compound semiconductor, e.g., (Al, Ga, In)N semiconductor. Each of the upper and lower semiconductor layers <b>125</b> and <b>129</b> may have a single- or multi-layered structure. For example, the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b> and/or the lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b> may include a contact layer and a clad layer, and may further include a superlattice layer. In addition, the active layer <b>27</b> may have a single or multiple quantum well structure. The first conductivity type may be an n-type and the second conductivity type may be a p-type. Since the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b> may be formed with an n-type semiconductor layer whose resistance is relatively low, the thickness of the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b> may be relatively thick. Thus, it may be easy to form a roughened upper surface R of the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b>, wherein the roughened surface R may enhance the light extraction efficiency of the light generated in the active layer <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Meanwhile, in the present exemplary embodiment, the regions S<b>1</b> have a common light emitting cell. The term &#x201c;common light emitting cell&#x201d; means that a plurality of light emitting cells share a first or second conductivity type semiconductor layer. Here, the regions S<b>1</b> have a common light emitting cell that shares the first conductivity type upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>. Meanwhile, each of the regions S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> has a single light emitting cell. In other exemplary embodiments, each of the regions S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>3</b> may have a single light emitting cell.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The regions P are also separated by the isolation trenches. The electrode pads <b>165</b> are formed on the regions P, respectively. The electrode pads <b>165</b> are connected to an external power source so as to receive power. A wire (not shown) may be bonded to each of the electrode pads <b>165</b>. The regions P may be connected to the regions S<b>2</b>, respectively. That is, the regions P and S<b>2</b> may share at least one of the semiconductor layers, particularly, the first conductivity type upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b>. The regions P have connection trenches (or holes) <b>130</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) that pass through the second conductivity type lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b> and the active layer <b>127</b>. The isolation trenches <b>161</b> pass through the semiconductor stack <b>130</b> to separate the semiconductor stack <b>130</b> into the plurality of regions S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and P. In some embodiments, some of the isolation trenches <b>161</b> may not pass through the active layer <b>127</b> and the lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b>. Thus, no side surfaces of the active layer <b>127</b> and the lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b> may be exposed in some of the inner walls of the isolation trenches <b>161</b>. Alternatively, all of the isolation trenches <b>161</b> may be configured to pass through the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b>, the active layer <b>127</b> and the lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b>. Thus, the inner walls of the isolation trenches <b>161</b> may be formed with the semiconductor stack <b>130</b> including the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b>, the active layer <b>127</b>, and the lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b>. In that embodiment, since all of the isolation trenches <b>161</b> may be formed to have the same depth, it is possible to promote the stabilization of an etching process for forming the isolation trenches <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Meanwhile, the connectors <b>135</b> electrically connect the regions S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and P separated by the isolation trenches <b>161</b>. Since the connectors <b>135</b> are positioned between the semiconductor stack <b>130</b> and the substrate <b>151</b>, light emitted from a light emitting surface is not blocked by the connectors <b>135</b>. The connectors <b>135</b> have contact portions <b>135</b><i>a </i>electrically connected to the second conductivity type lower semiconductor layers <b>129</b> of the semiconductor stack <b>130</b> and contact portions <b>135</b><i>b </i>connected to the first conductivity type upper semiconductor layers <b>125</b> of the semiconductor stack <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, each region S<b>1</b> having the common light emitting cell has contact portions <b>135</b><i>a </i>connected to the lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b> and a contact portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>connected to the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c</i>, each of the regions S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> having single light emitting cells has a contact portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>connected to the lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b> and a contact portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>connected to the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b>. Further, each of the pad regions P has contact portions <b>135</b><i>a </i>connected to the lower semiconductor layer <b>129</b>. The contact portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>in the pad region P is electrically connected to the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b> through the holes <b>130</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Meanwhile, on a first row, the contact portions <b>135</b><i>a </i>in regions S<b>1</b> except regions S<b>1</b> positioned at both outermost sides on the first row are connected to the contact portions <b>135</b><i>a </i>in adjacent regions S<b>1</b>, respectively. The contact portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>of region S<b>1</b> adjacent to the pad region P is connected to the contact portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>in the pad region P.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The contact portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>in the right outermost region S<b>1</b> on the first row is connected to the contact portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>connected to the upper semiconductor layer <b>125</b> in the right outermost region S<b>2</b> on a third row. The contact portions <b>135</b><i>b </i>connected to the regions S<b>1</b> on the third row are connected to the contact portions <b>135</b><i>a </i>in the regions S<b>1</b> on the first row, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Meanwhile, the contact portions <b>135</b><i>a </i>in the regions S<b>3</b> on a second row are connected to the contact portions <b>135</b><i>b </i>on the first row, respectively, and each of the contact portions <b>135</b><i>b </i>in the regions S<b>3</b> on the second row is connected to two contact portions <b>135</b><i>a </i>on the third row.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Through the connectors <b>135</b>, an LED having an equivalent circuit diagram as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d </i>may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d</i>, serial arrays of light emitting cells are formed by the connectors <b>135</b>. These serial arrays are connected in reverse parallel between the electrode pads <b>165</b>. Thus, the LED can be driven by connecting an AC power source to the electrode pads <b>165</b>. Here, a forward voltage is applied to the light emitting cells in some regions S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> during one half period of AC power, and a reverse voltage is applied to the light emitting cells in some regions S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> during the other half period of the AC power. On the other hand, the forward voltage is applied to the light emitting cells in the regions S<b>3</b> during the whole period of the AC power. Thus, the effective light emitting area can be increased due to the full-wave light emitting cells (i.e., regions S<b>3</b>) which may emit light over the whole period in which the phase of the AC power is changed. According to the present invention, the reverse voltage applied to one full-wave light emitting cell has the same value as the forward voltage applied to two half-wave light emitting cells (i.e., S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the LED includes a substrate <b>251</b>, first and second light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, an intermediate insulating layer <b>237</b>, transparent ohmic contact layers <b>235</b> and a connector <b>255</b>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The substrate <b>251</b> is distinguished from a growth substrate for growing compound semiconductor layers, and is a substrate attached to the compound semiconductor layers which have been previously grown. The substrate <b>251</b> may be variously selected, and particularly may be a substrate made of a material with high thermal conductivity, e.g., Si, SiC, AlN, or a metallic material, so as to improve its heat dissipation property. However, the substrate is not particularly limited but may be another kind of insulating or conductive substrate. Particularly, if a sapphire substrate is used as the growth substrate for the semiconductor layers, the substrate <b>251</b> may be a sapphire substrate so as to have the same thermal expansion coefficient as the growth substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are separated by a cell separation region <b>230</b><i>a</i>. Each of the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> includes a semiconductor stack <b>230</b> having a first conductivity type upper semiconductor layer <b>225</b>, an active layer <b>227</b> and a second conductivity type lower semiconductor layer <b>229</b>. The active layer <b>227</b> is interposed between the upper and lower semiconductor layers <b>225</b> and <b>229</b>. Meanwhile, the cell separation region <b>230</b><i>a </i>separates the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> from each other by passing through the upper semiconductor layer <b>225</b>, the active layer <b>227</b> and the lower semiconductor layer <b>229</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The active layer <b>227</b> and the upper and lower semiconductor layers <b>225</b> and <b>229</b> may be formed of a III-Nitride-based compound semiconductor, e.g., (Al, Ga, In)N semiconductor. Each of the upper and lower semiconductor layers <b>225</b> and <b>229</b> may have a single- or multi-layered structure. For example, the upper semiconductor layer <b>225</b> and/or the lower semiconductor layer <b>229</b> may include a contact layer and a clad layer, and may further include a superlattice layer. In addition, the active layer <b>227</b> may have a single or multiple quantum well structure. Preferably, the first conductivity type is an n-type and the second conductivity type is a p-type. Since the upper semiconductor layer <b>225</b> is formed with an n-type semiconductor layer whose resistance is relatively low, the thickness of the upper semiconductor layer <b>225</b> can be relatively thick. Thus, it may be easy to form a roughened top surface R of the upper semiconductor layer <b>225</b>, wherein the roughened surface R enhances the light extraction efficiency of the light generated in the active layer <b>227</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The intermediate insulating layer <b>237</b> is positioned between the substrate <b>251</b> and the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> so as to insulate the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> from the substrate <b>251</b> or the bonding metal <b>241</b>.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The intermediate insulating layer <b>237</b> has a relatively high reflectance with respect to the light generated in the active layer <b>227</b>. For example, if the active layer generates blue light, the intermediate insulating layer <b>237</b> is formed to have a high reflectance with respect to the light in a wavelength range of 400 nm to 500 nm. Since SiO<sub>2 </sub>has a higher adhesion to a semiconductor layer than TiO<sub>2 </sub>or Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, SiO<sub>2 </sub>may be disposed as the first layer close to the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Alternatively, the intermediate insulating layer <b>237</b> may be formed to have a high reflectance with respect to not only blue light but also green light and red light.

The buffer layer is employed to reduce the lattice misalignment between the growth substrate <b>221</b> and the compound semiconductor layers, and may be a GaN-based material layer, such as GaN or AlN.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, transparent ohmic contact layers <b>235</b> which are spaced apart from each other are formed on the semiconductor stack <b>230</b>. Each of the transparent ohmic contact layers <b>235</b> is formed to correspond to a light emitting cell region, wherein a portion of the transparent ohmic contact layer is formed to be extended outwards from the light emitting cell region. The transparent ohmic contact layer <b>235</b> may be formed of a TCO such as ITO or ZnO, for example. The transparent ohmic contact layer <b>235</b> is ohmic-contacted with the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>229</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Subsequently, an intermediate insulating layer <b>237</b> is formed to cover the transparent ohmic contact layers <b>235</b>. The intermediate insulating layer <b>237</b> is formed to be a DBR formed by repeatedly stacking insulating layers whose refractive indices are different from each other. For example, the intermediate insulating layer <b>237</b> may be formed by repeatedly stacking SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>or SiO<sub>2</sub>/Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. A DBR with high reflectance throughout the wide wavelength range of blue, green, and red light can be formed by controlling the thickness of each of the insulating layers that constitute the intermediate insulating layer <b>237</b>. Then, a reflective metal layer <b>238</b> may be formed on the intermediate insulating layer <b>237</b>. The reflective metal layer <b>238</b> may be formed of Al, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, an adhesive layer <b>239</b> may be formed on the reflective metal layer <b>238</b>. Then, a bonding metal <b>241</b> is formed on the adhesive layer <b>239</b>, and a secondary substrate <b>251</b> is bonded thereto. The adhesive layer <b>239</b> may be formed of, for example, Cr/Au, while the bonding metal <b>241</b> may be formed of, for example, AuSn (80/20 wt %).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the substrate <b>221</b> is removed. The substrate <b>221</b> may be removed using a substrate separating process such as LLO. As the substrate <b>221</b> is removed, a surface of the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>225</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a roughened surface R may be formed on the exposed first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>225</b>. Although the roughened surface R may be formed on the entire surface of the exposed first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>225</b>, the roughened surface R may be confined to a partial region of the entire surface as shown in this figure. For example, a mask (not shown) may be formed on the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>225</b> so as to expose a region in which the roughened surface will be formed, and then the roughened surface R may be formed only in the confined region using photoelectrochemical (PEC) etching.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Meanwhile, a cell separation region <b>230</b><i>a </i>is formed by etching the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>225</b>, the active layer <b>227</b> and the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>229</b>, thereby separating the semiconductor stack into light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. The transparent ohmic contact layer <b>235</b> at the lower portion of the second light emitting cell S<b>2</b> is exposed by the cell separation region <b>230</b><i>a</i>. At this time, the transparent ohmic contact layer <b>235</b> is formed of a TCO film so as to prevent conductive etching by-products from being formed. Thus, it is possible to prevent an electrical short circuit which might be caused by the etching by-products of the transparent ohmic contact layer <b>235</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The process of forming the roughened surface R may be performed after the cell separation region <b>230</b><i>a </i>is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a first insulating layer <b>253</b> is formed to cover side surfaces of the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. The first insulating layer <b>253</b> may be formed of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and covers at least a portion of each side surface of the light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. Particularly, the first insulating layer <b>253</b> may cover a bottom of the cell separation region <b>230</b><i>a </i>and an inner wall of the cell separation region <b>230</b><i>a</i>. Meanwhile, the first insulating layer <b>253</b> may be patterned to have an opening <b>253</b><i>a </i>through which the transparent ohmic contact layer <b>235</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Then, a connector <b>255</b> is formed to electrically connect the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>225</b> of the first light emitting cell S<b>1</b> to the transparent ohmic contact layer <b>235</b> exposed to the cell separation region <b>230</b><i>a</i>. The connector <b>255</b> may be formed using a lift-off process. While the connector <b>255</b> is formed, electrode extending portions (<b>255</b><i>a </i>and <b>255</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) may be formed together.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Subsequently, a second insulating layer <b>257</b> may be formed to cover the first and second light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, the connector <b>255</b>, and the first insulating layer <b>253</b>. The second insulating layer <b>257</b> may cover the top surface of the LED except electrode pads (not shown). Accordingly, it is possible to protect the LED from external environmental factors.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Then, an individual LED including a plurality of light emitting cells S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> is completed through a singulation process.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide an LED, which can prevent an electrical short circuit in a light emitting cell by preventing metallic etching by-products from being formed, and a method of fabricating the same. Further, a DBR is employed so that the reflectance of the light which is emitted toward a substrate can be improved as compared with a reflective metal layer. Furthermore, since the DBR is formed by alternately stacking insulating layers such as SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>or SiO<sub>2</sub>/Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>whose refractive indices are different from each other, the DBR may be prevented from being deformed by oxidation.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Moreover, connectors are buried into the LED, so that the light emitted from a light emitting surface may be prevented from being lost by the connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Meanwhile, if an ohmic contact is formed using a transparent ohmic contact layer, it is unnecessary to separately form a barrier metal layer for protecting the transparent ohmic contact layer. Thus, a fabricating process may be simplified and an LED with high reliability may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In addition, an intermediate insulating layer may be formed as a DBR with high reflectance in the wide visible region of blue, green, and red light. In this case, the intermediate insulating layer has a high reflectance with respect to light that is emitted into the LED from the outside, so that a high light efficiency can be realized in an LED package for implementing polychromatic light, e.g., white light.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Although the present invention has been described in detail in connection with the exemplary embodiments, it will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes can be made thereto within the technical spirit and scope of the present invention. It is also apparent that the modifications and changes fall within the scope of the present invention defined by the appended claims.</p>
