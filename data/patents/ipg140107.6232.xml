<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With respect to constituent elements used in the following description, suffixes &#x201c;module&#x201d; and &#x201c;unit&#x201d; are simply given in consideration of ease in the preparation of the specification, and may be mingled with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A digital device according to the present invention as set forth herein may be an intelligent device that additionally provides a computer support function in addition to a broadcasting reception function, for example. As a result of adding an Internet function to the broadcasting reception function, the digital device may be provided with a more convenient interface, such as a handwriting input device, a touch-screen, or a spatial remote controller. Also, the digital device enables, for example, e-mailing, Web browsing, banking, and game playing functions by accessing the Internet or a computer because the digital device supports a wired or wireless Internet function. To implement these various functions, a standardized general-purpose Operating System (OS) may be used. In addition, since the digital device allows various applications to be freely added to or deleted from, for example, a general-purpose OS kernel, it may perform various user friendly functions. Examples of the digital device include a network TV, a Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HBBTV), and a smart TV, and as occasion demands may further include a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or a smart phone. In the following description, the digital device may correspond to any one of a mobile terminal and an image display device. However, for convenience of description, in this specification, the terms &#x201c;digital device&#x201d;, &#x201c;mobile terminal&#x201d; and &#x201c;image display device&#x201d; may be used interchangeably, and may respectively represent a particular device name in the corresponding drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and the disclosure illustrated in the accompanying drawings. However, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to or restricted by the following embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although the terms used in the following description are selected, as much as possible, from general terms that are widely used at present while taking into consideration of the functions obtained in accordance with the present invention, these terms may be replaced by other terms based on intensions of those skilled in the art, customs, emergence of new technologies, or the like. Also, in a particular case, terms that are arbitrarily selected by the applicant of the present invention may be used. In this case, the meanings of these terms may be described in corresponding description parts of the invention. Accordingly, it should be noted that the terms used herein should be construed based on practical meanings thereof and the whole content of this specification, rather than being simply construed based on names of the terms.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram schematically showing a digital system including digital devices according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the digital system includes a Content Provider (CP) <b>1010</b>, a Service Provider (SP) <b>1020</b>, a Network Provider (NP) <b>1030</b>, and a Home Network End User (HNED) <b>1040</b>. For example, the FINED <b>1040</b> may correspond to a client <b>1100</b>, i.e. a digital device according to the present invention. As described above, the digital device may include a network TV, a smart TV, and an IPTV, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The CP <b>1010</b> may produce and provide a variety of content. The CP <b>1010</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may include a terrestrial broadcaster, a System Operator (SO), a Multiple System Operator (MSO), a satellite broadcaster, an Internet broadcaster, and a private CP. The CP <b>1010</b> may provide, for example, a variety of applications as well as broadcast content. This will be described hereinafter in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The SP <b>1020</b> may service-package the content provided by the CP <b>1010</b>, and transmit the service-packaged content. For example, the SP <b>1020</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may package a first terrestrial broadcast, a second terrestrial broadcast, a cable MSO, a satellite broadcast, various Internet broadcasts, and applications, and provide the packaged broadcasts to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The SP <b>1020</b> may provide the service to a client <b>1100</b> using a uni-cast or multi-cast method, or using a push or pull method. The uni-cast method transmits data between a single transmitter and a single receiver in a one to one ratio. For example, if a receiver requests data to a server in the uni-cast method, the server transmits the data to the corresponding receiver in response to the request. On the other hand, the multi-cast method transmits data to a plurality of receivers within a particular group. For example, a server transmits data to a plurality of pre-registered receivers simultaneously. An Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) may be used for the multicast registration.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The CP <b>1010</b> and the SP <b>1020</b> may be the same entity. For example, the CP <b>1010</b> may produce content, service-package the content, and provide the packaged service. Thus, the CP <b>1010</b> may perform the function of the SP <b>1020</b>. The converse case is also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The NP <b>1030</b> may provide a network for data exchange between a server and the client <b>1100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The client <b>1100</b> may build a home network to enable transmission/reception of data.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Meanwhile, to protect content transmitted in the digital system, the server may utilize certain means, such as conditional access, content protection or the like. In this case, the client <b>1100</b> may utilize certain means to correspond to the conditional access or content protection, such as a CableCARD, a Downloadable Conditional Access System (DCAS) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In addition, the client <b>1100</b> may adopt a bi-directional service via a network. In this case, the client <b>1100</b> may also function as a CP, and the SP <b>1020</b> may receive content from the client <b>1100</b>, and in turn transmit the content to another client.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a digital device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The digital device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may correspond to the client <b>1100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and may be a digital television receiver, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The digital device <b>2000</b> includes a network interface <b>2010</b>, a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) manager <b>2020</b>, a service delivery manager <b>2030</b>, a Service or System Information (SI) decoder <b>2040</b>, a demultiplexer (DEMUX) <b>2050</b>, an audio decoder <b>2060</b>, a video decoder <b>2070</b>, a display Audio/Video (A/V) and On Screen Display (OSD) module <b>2080</b>, a service control manager <b>2090</b>, a service discovery manager <b>2100</b>, an SI &#x26; metadata database (DB) <b>2110</b>, a metadata manager <b>2120</b>, a service manager <b>2130</b>, and an User Interface (UI) manager <b>2140</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The network interface <b>2010</b> may receive or transmit IP packets via a network. That is, the network interface <b>2010</b> may receive, for example a service and content from the SP <b>1020</b> via a network.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The TCP/IP manager <b>2020</b> has a role in transmission of the IP packets to and from the digital device <b>2000</b>, i.e. in packet transmission between a source and a destination.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The service delivery manager <b>2030</b> serves to control received service data. For example, the service delivery manager <b>2030</b> may use a Real time Transport Protocol (RTP)/RT Control Protocol (RTCP) in the case of controlling real time streaming data. When transmitting the real time streaming data using the RTP, the service delivery manager <b>2030</b> may parse the received data packets based on the RTP and transmit the parsed data packets to the DEMUX <b>2050</b>, or may store the receive data packets in the SI &#x26; metadata DB <b>2110</b> based on control of the service manager <b>2130</b>. The service delivery manager <b>2030</b> may feedback information received via the network to a service providing server using the RTCP.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The DEMUX <b>2050</b> demultiplexes the received packets to audio, video and System Information (SI) data, and transmits the demultiplexed data to the audio and video decoders <b>2060</b> and <b>2070</b> and the SI decoder <b>2040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The SI decoder <b>2040</b> decodes service information, such as, for example, Program Specific Information (PSI), Program and System Information protocol (PSIP), and Digital Video Broadcasting-SI (DVB-SI).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The SI decoder <b>2040</b> stores the decoded service information in, for example, the SI &#x26; metadata DB <b>2110</b>. The stored service information, for example, may be read and used by a corresponding component in response to a user request. In the present invention, service information, related to an Electronic Program Guide (EPG) service depending on a user request, a channel browser service, or the like, may also be read from the SI &#x26; metadata DB <b>2110</b>.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The audio and video decoders <b>2060</b> and <b>2070</b> respectively decode audio data and video data demultiplexed in the DEMUX <b>2050</b>. The decoded audio and video data are provided to the user via the display A/V and OSD module <b>2080</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">An application manager may consist of the UT manager <b>2140</b> and the service manager <b>2130</b>, for example. The application manager may manage overall states of the digital device <b>2000</b>, provide a user interface, and manage other managers.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The UI manager <b>2140</b> provides a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for the user using an OSD, and the like, and performs an operation of the device upon receiving a key input from the user. For example, when receiving a key input signal for channel selection from the user, the UI manager <b>2140</b> transmits the key input signal to the service manager <b>2130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The service manager <b>2130</b> controls a service associated manager, such as the service delivery manager <b>2030</b>, the service discovery manager <b>2100</b>, the service control manager <b>2090</b>, and the metadata manager <b>2120</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The service manager <b>2130</b> makes a channel map, and selects a channel using the channel map based on the key input received from the UT manager <b>2140</b>. Additionally, the service manager <b>2130</b> receives service information on the channel from the SI decoder <b>2040</b>, and sets an audio/video Packet Identifier (PID) of the selected channel to the DEMUX <b>2050</b>. The set PID is used for the above-described demultiplexing. Thus, the DEMUX <b>2050</b> filters audio and video data, and SI data using the PID.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The service discovery manager <b>2100</b> provides information required to select an SP that provides a service.

The broadcast receiving unit <b>3005</b> may include at least one tuner <b>3010</b>, a demodulator <b>3020</b>, and a network interface <b>3030</b>. As necessary, the broadcast receiving unit <b>3005</b> may be designed to include the tuner <b>3010</b> and the demodulator <b>3020</b> without the network interface <b>3030</b>, or may be designed to include only the network interface <b>3030</b> without the tuner <b>3010</b> and the demodulator <b>3020</b>. Although not shown, the broadcast receiving unit <b>3005</b> may further include a multiplexer to multiplex a signal that has passed through the tuner <b>3010</b> and demodulated by the demodulator <b>3020</b> and a signal that has been received through the network interface <b>3030</b>. Additionally, although not shown, the broadcast receiving unit <b>3005</b> may further include a demultiplexer to demultiplex the multiplexed signal or the demodulated signal, or to demultiplex the signal that has passed through the network interface <b>3030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The tuner <b>3010</b> receives one of Radio Frequency (RF) broadcast signals received through an antenna by tuning a user-selected channel or all pre-stored channels. Then, the tuner <b>3010</b> converts the received RF broadcast signal into an Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal or a baseband signal.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">For example, the tuner <b>3010</b> may convert the received RF broadcast signal into a digital IF (DIF) signal if the RF broadcast signal is a digital broadcast signal, or may convert the received RF broadcast signal into an analog baseband audio or video signal (Composite Video Banking Sync/Sound Intercarrier Frequency (CVBS/SIF) signal) if the RF broadcast signal is an analog broadcast signal. That is, the tuner <b>3010</b> is capable of processing both digital and analog broadcast signals. The analog baseband audio or video signal (CVBS/SIF signal) output from the tuner <b>3010</b> may be directly input to the control unit <b>3070</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The tuner <b>3010</b> may receive an RF broadcast signal of a single carrier based on an Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC) mode or an RF broadcast signal of multiple carriers based on a Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) mode.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Additionally, the tuner <b>3010</b> may convert one of the RF broadcast signals received through the antenna into the IF signal or the baseband signal by sequentially tuning and receiving the RF broadcast signals of all broadcast channels stored via a channel memory function.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The demodulator <b>3020</b> receives and demodulates the DIF signal converted in the tuner <b>3010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">For example, if the DIF signal output from the tuner <b>3010</b> is based on the ATSC mode, the demodulator <b>3020</b> performs, for example, 8-Vestigal Side Band (8-VSB) demodulation. Also, the demodulator <b>3020</b> may perform channel decoding. To this end, the demodulator <b>3020</b> may include a trellis decoder, a de-interleaver, and a Reed Solomon (RS) decoder, and may perform trellis decoding, de-interleaving, and RS decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">For example, if the DIF signal output from the tuner <b>3010</b> is based on the DVB mode, the demodulator <b>3020</b> performs, for example, Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (COFDMA) demodulation. Also, the demodulator <b>3020</b> may perform channel decoding. To this end, the demodulator <b>3020</b> may include a convolution decoder, a de-interleaver, and an RS decoder, and may perform convolution decoding, de-interleaving, and RS decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The demodulator <b>3020</b> may output a stream signal after performing the demodulation and the channel decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The stream signal may be obtained by multiplexing a video signal, an audio signal or a data signal. For example, the stream signal may be MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) obtained by multiplexing an MPEG-2 video signal or a Dolby AC-3 audio signal. More specifically, the MPEG-2 TS may contain a 4-byte header and a 184-byte payload.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The demodulator <b>3020</b> as described above may be provided separately for the ATSC mode and the DVB mode. That is, the broadcast receiving unit <b>3005</b> may include an ATSC demodulator and a DVB demodulator.</p>

A control unit <b>3070</b> or <b>4080</b> will be described hereinafter in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the control unit <b>3070</b> or <b>4080</b> may include a DEMUX <b>6010</b>, a video processor <b>6020</b>, an On Screen Display generator <b>6040</b>, a mixer <b>6050</b>, a Frame Rate Converter (FRC) <b>6055</b>, and a formatter <b>6060</b>. Additionally, although not shown, the control unit <b>3070</b> or <b>4080</b> may further include an audio processor and a data processor.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The DEMUX <b>6010</b> demultiplexes an input stream. For example, the DEMUX <b>6010</b> may demultiplex an input MPEG-2 TS into a video signal, an audio signal, and a data signal. Here, the stream signal input to the DEMUX <b>6010</b> may be a stream signal output from the tuner <b>3010</b>, the demodulator <b>3020</b>, or the external device interface <b>3035</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The video processor <b>6020</b> may process the demultiplexed video signal. For video signal processing, the video processor <b>6020</b> may include a video decoder <b>6025</b> and a scaler <b>6035</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The video decoder <b>6025</b> decodes the demultiplexed video signal, and the scaler <b>6035</b> scales the decoded video signal so that the video signal can be displayed on the display unit <b>3080</b> or <b>4051</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The video decoder <b>6025</b> may operate based on various standards. For example, the video decoder <b>6025</b> may function as an MPEG-2 decoder in the case in which the video signal is an MPEG-2 encoded video signal. Also, the video decoder <b>6025</b> may function as an H.264 decoder in the case in which the video signal is a Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) or H.264 encoded signal.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The video signal decoded by the video processor <b>6020</b> is input to the mixer <b>6050</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The OSD generator <b>6040</b> generates OSD data autonomously or in response to a user input. For example, the OSD generator <b>6040</b> generates data, by which a variety of data is displayed as graphics or text on a screen of the display unit, based on a control signal of the user input interface. The generated OSD data includes various data, such as a UI screen of the digital device, a variety of menu screens, widgets, icons, and information on an audience rating, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The OSD generator <b>6040</b> may generate data, by which subtitles are displayed for a broadcast image or EPG-based broadcasting information.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The mixer <b>6050</b> may mix the decoded video signal processed by the video processor <b>6020</b> with the OSD data generated by the OSD generator <b>6040</b>, and output the mixed signal to the formatter <b>6060</b>. As the decoded video signal is mixed with the OSD data, an OSD may be overlaid on the broadcast image or the externally input image.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The FRC <b>6055</b> may change the frame rate of an input image. For example, the FRC <b>6055</b> may change a frame rate of 60 Hz of an input image into a frame rate of 120 or 240 Hz according to an output frequency of the display unit. As described above, a variety of methods to change the frame range may be used. In one example, in the case in which the frame rate is to be changed from 60 Hz to 120 Hz, the FRC <b>6055</b> may insert a first frame between the first frame and a second frame, or a predicted third frame between the first and second frames. In another example, in the case in which the frame rate is to be changed from 60 Hz to 240 Hz, the FRC <b>6055</b> may insert three identical frames or three predicted frames between the first and second frames. It is also possible to bypass the FRC <b>6055</b> when frame rate conversion is not performed.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The formatter <b>6060</b> changes the output of the FRC <b>6055</b> to suit the output format of the display unit. For example, the formatter <b>6060</b> may convert a received signal into an RGB data signal. The RGB signal may be output in the form of a Low Voltage Differential Signal (LVDS) or mini-LVDS. Also, in the case in which the FRC <b>6055</b> outputs a 3D video signal, the formatter <b>6060</b> converts the 3D video signal into a 3D signal to suit the output format of the display unit, thereby assisting a 3D service via the display unit.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The audio processor (not shown) of the control unit <b>3070</b> or <b>4080</b> may process the demultiplexed audio signal. For audio signal processing, the audio processor (not shown) may be configured to process a variety of formats. For example, in the case in which the audio signal is encoded into an MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MPEG-Surround, AAC, HE-AAC, AC-3, and BSAC format, the audio processor (not shown) may include corresponding decoders to process the respective encoded signals.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The audio processor (not shown) within the control unit <b>3070</b> or <b>4080</b> may also adjust the base, treble, and volume of the audio signal.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The data processor (not shown) within the control unit <b>3070</b> or <b>4080</b> may process the demultiplexed data signal. For example, in the case in which the demultiplexed data signal is an encoded data signal, the data processor may decode the encoded data signal. Here, the encoded data signal may include EPG information, which includes broadcast information specifying the start time, end time, etc. of scheduled broadcast programs of each channel.</p>

<p id="p-0212" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> are block diagrams showing various exemplary configurations of a platform provided in the image display device.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">A platform for the image display device <b>2000</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention may have OS-based software to implement the above-described various operations.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the platform for the image display device <b>2000</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention is of a separate-type. The platform may be designed separately from a legacy system platform <b>7000</b> and a smart system platform <b>7005</b>. An OS kernel <b>7010</b> may be shared between the legacy system platform <b>7000</b> and the smart system platform <b>7005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The legacy system platform <b>7000</b> may include a stack of a driver <b>7020</b>, middleware <b>7030</b>, and an application layer <b>7050</b> on the OS kernel <b>7010</b>. The smart system platform <b>7005</b> may include a stack of a library <b>7035</b>, a framework <b>7040</b>, and an application layer <b>7055</b> on the OS kernel <b>7010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">The OS kernel <b>7010</b> is the core of an operating system. When the image display device <b>2000</b> is driven, the OS kernel <b>7010</b> may be responsible for operation of at least one of control of hardware drivers, security protection for hardware and processors in the image display device <b>2000</b>, efficient management of system resources, memory management, hardware interfacing by hardware abstraction, multi-processing, and scheduling associated with multi-processing. Meanwhile, the OS kernel <b>7010</b> may further perform power management.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The hardware drivers within the OS kernel <b>7010</b> may include, for example, at least one of a display driver, a Wi-Fi driver, a Bluetooth driver, a USB driver, an audio driver, a power manager, a binder driver, and a memory driver.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The hardware drivers within the OS kernel <b>7010</b> may be a driver for hardware devices within the OS kernel <b>7010</b>. The hardware drivers may include a character device driver, a block device driver, and a network device driver. The block device driver may need a buffer for buffering data on a per block basis, because data is transmitted on a per block basis. The character device driver may not require a buffer since data is transmitted on a per basic data unit basis, that is, on a per character basis.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">The OS kernel <b>7010</b> may be implemented based on any of various Oss, such as Unix (Linux), Windows, etc. The OS kernel <b>7010</b> may be a general-purpose open kernel which can be implemented in other electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The driver <b>7020</b> is interposed between the OS kernel <b>7010</b> and the middleware <b>7030</b>. A long with the middleware <b>7030</b>, the driver <b>7020</b> drives devices for operation of the application layer <b>7050</b>. For example, the driver <b>7020</b> may include a driver(s) for a microcomputer, a display module, a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), an FRC, a General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pin, a HDMI, a System Decoder (SDEC) or DEMUX, a Video Decoder (VDEC), an Audio Decoder (ADEC), a Personal Video Recorder (PVR), and/or an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C). These drivers operate in conjunction with the hardware drivers of the OS kernel <b>7010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In addition, the driver <b>7020</b> may further include a driver for the remote controller, especially a 3D pointing device that will be described below. The driver for the 3D pointing device may be located in the OS kernel <b>7010</b> or the middleware <b>7030</b>, instead of the driver <b>7020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The middleware <b>7030</b> may be located between the OS kernel <b>7010</b> and the application layer <b>7050</b>. The middleware <b>7030</b> may mediate between different hardware devices or different software programs, for data transmission and reception between the hardware devices or the software programs. Therefore, the middleware <b>7030</b> can provide standard interfaces, support various environments, and enable interaction between tasks conforming to heterogeneous communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Examples of the middleware <b>7030</b> in the legacy system platform <b>7000</b> may include Multimedia and Hypermedia information coding Experts Group (MHEG) and Advanced Common Application Platform (ACAP) as data broadcasting-related middleware, PSIP or SI middleware as broadcasting information-related middleware, and DLNA middleware as peripheral device communication-related middleware.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The application layer <b>7050</b> on the middleware <b>7030</b>, i.e. the application layer <b>7050</b> in the legacy system platform <b>7000</b> may include, for example, UI applications associated with various menus in the image display device. The application layer <b>7050</b> on top of the middleware <b>7030</b> may allow editing and updating over a network by user selection.

<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Hereinafter, for example, an EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service according to the present invention will be described in more detail. To provide the aforementioned service, a digital system or a service system (hereinafter referred to as the digital system), for example, may be constituted of at least one device corresponding to a client, and a server. Meanwhile, in the following description, &#x201c;service data&#x201d; refers to data for at least one of an EPG service, a thumbnail image service, and a channel browser service.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">In the following description, to assist understanding of the present invention and for convenience of explanation, a service between the device and the server of the digital system will be described as being divided into an operation of transmitting service data from the digital device to the server and storing and processing the transmitted service data in the server, an operation of transmitting the processed service data from the server to the digital device, and an operation of processing the service data transmitted from the server between digital devices.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">In particular, examples of the operation of processing service data between the digital devices may include the case in which a mobile terminal controls a digital television receiver using service data, or the case in which service data is shared via a Social Network Service, such as Twitter, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">According to the present invention, the digital device can provide a user-friendly service close to an actual broadcasting environment by acquiring a greater quantity of various data than in the related art in relation to an EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service in response to a user request. An example of this user-friendly service is an Advanced EPG.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">First, the operation of transmitting service data from the digital device to the server and storing and processing the transmitted service data in the server, and the operation of transmitting the processed service data from the server to the digital device will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">As set forth herein, the digital device may include, for example, a digital television receiver such as a smart TV, and a mobile terminal, such as a tablet PC or a smart phone. In the following description, the digital device will be referred to as the digital television receiver or the mobile terminal as necessary. However, it will be clearly understood that the present invention is not essentially limited to the above-described digital television receiver or mobile terminal and is applicable based on the same or similar principle to other communicable electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">For example, an operation of acquiring EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data using the digital device is as follows.</p>

<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Alternatively, the digital device <b>10020</b> may receive EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data from a separate external server <b>10030</b> that is provided for provision of a particular service, configure a corresponding service based on the received service data, and provide the service to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">In particular, in the case of the EPG service, generally, the digital device <b>10020</b> tunes to a particular channel in response to a user request, such that the EPG service is acquired from service information contained in a digital broadcast signal received from the tuned channel. To this end, the format of service information in a transmitter may change according to an ATSC mode or a DVB mode. For example, DVB Terrestrial (DVB-T) service information may contain Program Association Table (PAT), Program Map Table (PMT), Virtual Channel Table/Service Description Table (VCT/SDT) and Event Information Table (EIT), for example. In this case, the digital device <b>10020</b> may autonomously configure the EPG service based on the received service data, and provide the EPG service in response to a user request.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">On the other hand, in the latter case, the external server <b>10030</b> may provide additional data that is not provided by the broadcasting station <b>10010</b>, or various other service data about a prime time or a prime program.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">As described above, the digital device <b>10020</b> may receive the service data transmitted from the broadcasting station <b>10010</b> and/or the external server <b>10030</b>, and provide the received service data to the user.</p>

<p id="p-0278" num="0277">The digital device <b>12010</b> may be any one of a mobile terminal and a digital television receiver as an image display device.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">The data server <b>12015</b> may be a server of a manufacturer of the mobile terminal or the digital television receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">As described above, the digital device <b>12010</b> may receive EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data from a digital broadcast signal and/or from service information contained in the digital broadcast signal transmitted from the broadcasting station <b>12005</b> and/or the external server <b>12090</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">However, in the case in which the EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data, which can be acquired by the single digital device <b>12010</b>, is acquired from a digital broadcast signal received by directly tuning to a corresponding channel via a tuner, or is acquired from the external server <b>12090</b>, generally, service coverage per area is low (less than 50%). Therefore, the digital device <b>12010</b> has a difficulty in providing an EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service that reflects an actual service environment. That is, the single digital device <b>12010</b> may frequently fail to provide a user requested data service or a searched data service under the above-described environment.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">As will be described hereinafter, according to the present invention, the data server <b>12015</b> is built and used to address the problem in that it is actually difficult to appropriately reply to a user request for the EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service using only the broadcasting station <b>12005</b> or the external server <b>12090</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">In the digital system according to the present invention, the data server <b>12015</b> may serve to collect EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data from respective digital devices and to store, process and manage the service data, thereby ensuring that the digital devices can provide a higher quality of various services to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Unlike digital devices of the related art, according to the present invention, as the data server <b>12015</b> can collect EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data acquired from a plurality of digital devices that have the same service list, and/or can couple or combine EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data acquired from the external server <b>12090</b> to transmit the processed service data to the respective digital devices. In this way, an upgraded service can be acquired from an abundance of the latest high-quality service data within a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">The collection, processing, storage and management of the service data between the digital device <b>12010</b> and the data server <b>12015</b> will hereinafter be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">In the embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the data server <b>12015</b> includes a control module <b>12020</b>, an EPG processor, and a thumbnail processor <b>12040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">The EPG processor may include an EPG crawler module <b>12030</b>, a processing module <b>12050</b>, and a DB <b>12070</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">The digital device <b>12010</b>, for provision of the EPG service according to the present invention, performs a registration or authentication procedure by communicating with the data server <b>12015</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">For example, the digital device <b>12010</b> initially transmits device information thereof to the data server <b>12015</b> (A), and receives a setting value from the data server <b>12015</b> based on the transmitted device information (C). In the following description, the setting value, for example, will be referred to as a service list set identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The device information includes, for example, at least one of a device model, device country, language, receiver type, channel or service list, and user ID.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The device model is, for example, a device model number or ID, which is important for transmission of accurate information to prevent a possible service error because even products of the same manufacturer may have differences in options or support services according to device model.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The device country may mean Korea (KR), Germany (DE), and England (UK), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">The language indicates, for example, language used in the country of the device, and may include language that can be supported via a caption function in the corresponding device.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">The receiver type may mean terrestrial, cable, satellite, IPTV, and mobile, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The service list may mean a list of services or channels that can be accessed or used by the digital device through auto-scan, for example. The service list may further include service name or channel name, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">The user ID is used to determine, for example, whether or not a corresponding user is a registered user, and whether or not the corresponding user is a proper user via user authentication. The user ID may be an inherent value allotted per device or per manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">If the digital device <b>12010</b> performs auto-scan, as described above, the digital device <b>12010</b> collects device information, and transmits the device information to the data server <b>12015</b>. The device information may further include three identifiers (hereinafter referred to as 3-ID), in addition to the aforementioned information. The 3-ID may be transmitted in particular information, such as the service list among the device information.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">The 3-ID may include an original network identifier, a transport stream identifier, and a service identifier, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">The 3-ID may serve as a reference that allows any one country to identify a device that can share the same service, for example, service data per receiver type. Alternatively, identification of the service may be accomplished using a service name or channel name acquired from the EPG service data as well as the 3-ID.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">For example, the digital device <b>12010</b> may configure device information with a device country of UK, a receiver type of MUX (DVB-T), and a service list in a format of dvb://233a.2f.1, and transmit the configured device information to the data server <b>12015</b>. In this case, &#x201c;233a&#x201d; may mean an original network identifier that represents an area, &#x201c;2f&#x201d; may mean a transport stream identifier that represents MUX, and &#x201c;1&#x201d; may mean a service identifier that represents a service.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Meanwhile, the data server <b>12015</b> determines a group to which the corresponding digital device belongs, based on the device information transmitted from the digital device <b>12010</b>. Here, the 3-ID within the device information may be used for determination of the group. The data server <b>12015</b> transmits group identification information, i.e., the aforementioned service list set identifier to the corresponding digital device based on the determined result.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">In the following description, the group will be referred to as a super set. The service list set identifier, for example, is information provided as the data server <b>12015</b> configures a super set to be managed together based on the country and receiver type information within the device information of each digital device, and determines a super set to which a specific receiver is allocated.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">The service list set identifier functions as identification information between the digital device <b>12010</b> and the data server <b>12015</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">In other words, so long as there is no special circumstance after a single service list set identifier is allotted for information exchange between the digital device <b>12010</b> and the data server <b>12015</b>, an appropriate process may be possible with only the allotted service list set identifier in the following procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">For example, when updating EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data from each digital device to the data server <b>12015</b> or when transmitting the EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data from the data server <b>12015</b> to each digital device, collection, processing, and management of all data may be performed using or based on the service list set identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">In the present invention, the service list set identifier is a value for identifying a bundle of service lists, i.e., super sets if the data server <b>12015</b> manages the EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data on a per service list basis. In general, as described above, two types of the device information, i.e., the country and receiver type information may constitute the super set. For example, in the case of Europe, if 3-ID is equally used in one country on a per receiver type basis, the service lists may be regarded as the same service.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, after the procedure A, each digital device may transmit EPG service data including previously allotted 3-UD to the data server <b>12015</b> to update the EPG service data periodically or non-periodically (B).</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">In this case, initial transmission of the EPG service data may be performed at the aforementioned procedure A, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">The transmitted EPG service data may be configured by the digital device <b>12010</b> based on service information which includes the EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data within a digital broadcast signal transmitted from the broadcasting station <b>12005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">As described above, the service information, which includes the EPG service data, for example, includes an event and VCT/SDT associated with a service, i.e., an EIT associated with a program, in the case of DVB terrestrial.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">In other words, the digital television receiver <b>12010</b> extracts data for configuring EPG by parsing VCT/SDT and EIT from the digital broadcast signal, stores the extracted data in a storage unit, reads the stored data in the aforementioned 3-ID format, and transmits the read data and the aforementioned 3-ID, i.e. the service list set identifier to the data server <b>12015</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">The data server <b>12015</b> may receive the EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data from each digital device, and transmit the received data directly or after processing the received data. The data server <b>12015</b> may use the EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data transmitted from the external server <b>12090</b> when processing the data received from each digital device. However, if the EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data from the external server <b>12090</b> collide with the EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data from each digital receiver during the processing procedure, any one of the data from the external server <b>12090</b> and the data from each digital device based on SI information may be used. For example, the data server <b>12015</b> may apply a weighted value to service data based on SI information transmitted from the broadcasting station <b>12005</b> that provides a program, other than service data from the external server <b>12090</b>, thereby prioritizing the service data from the broadcasting station <b>12005</b> when the aforementioned data collision occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">Hereinafter, the procedure of processing the EPG service data in the data server <b>12015</b> will be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">If the device information of each digital device is received at the aforementioned procedure A or B, the control module <b>12020</b> transmits the received device information to the crawler module <b>12030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">The crawler module <b>12030</b> configures a super set based on the device information of each digital device, and returns an identifier of the configured super set, i.e., a service list set identifier to the control module <b>12020</b>. Here, instead of the crawler module <b>12030</b>, the control module <b>12020</b> may configure a super set, and produce a service list set identifier for the super set.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">The control module <b>12020</b> returns the service list set identifier transmitted from the crawler module <b>12030</b> to each corresponding digital device.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">Also, if updated EPG service data is received from each digital device after the service list set identifier has been returned to the digital device, the control module <b>12020</b> transmits the updated EPG service data to the crawler module <b>12030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">The crawler module <b>12030</b> transmits the updated EPG service data of each digital device, which has been input through the control module <b>12020</b>, to the processing module <b>12050</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">In this case, the crawler module <b>12030</b> may analyze, for example, an updated parameter from the updated EPG data of each digital device.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">Also, the crawler module <b>12030</b> may process the analyzed result on a per service list set identifier basis, and transmit the analyzed result to the processing module <b>12050</b> together with the service list set identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">In this case, although each digital device may transmit the EPG service data to the data server <b>12015</b> at the same time, alternatively, each digital device may transmit the EPG service data to the data server <b>12015</b> at different times.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">In this case, as a result of analyzing the EPG service data received from a specific digital device, for example, if the EPG service data has the same parameter as updated service data or service data received from another digital device at a previous time or of the EPG service data has a version lower than the previously data, the crawler module <b>12030</b> may remove the EPG service data without transferring it to the processing module <b>12050</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">The crawler module <b>12030</b> may transmit the EPG service data to the processing module <b>12050</b> whenever the EPG service data is received from each digital device. However, in this case, since load may occur in the processing module <b>12050</b>, a parameter updated at a sufficient level may be accumulated or may periodically be transmitted to the processing module <b>12050</b>, whereby overall load of the server may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">The processing module <b>12050</b> receives the updated EPG service data of each digital device transmitted from the crawler module <b>12030</b>, and stores the received EPG service data in the database <b>12070</b> directly or after processing the received EPG service data.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">The processing module <b>12050</b> may receive the EPG service data from the external server <b>12090</b> periodically or non-periodically. The EPG service data from the external server <b>12090</b> may be used to process the updated EPG service data of each digital device, prior to storing the updated EPG service data.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">The processing module <b>12050</b> sorts the EPG service data received from the crawler module <b>12030</b> and the external server <b>12090</b> on the basis of, for example, a previously set super set, i.e., a service list set identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">The processing module <b>12050</b> processes the sorted EPG service data and stores the processed EPG service data in the database <b>12070</b> in a unit of the aforementioned super set.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">For example, translation and merge may be used for the processing procedure. The service list set identifier for later EPG data search and basic information required for channel change per broadcast standard may be added.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">Each digital device has higher service coverage per area than the related art, and thus can provide an EPG service optimal for an actual broadcasting environment in response to an EPG service request from the user. A procedure of providing the EPG service will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">If an EPG request is received from the user, the digital device <b>12010</b> transmits a search parameter to the data server <b>12015</b> together with the previously received service list set identifier to request the EPG service data,</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">In this case, the search parameter may include, for example, query information, start index (startIndex) information, maximum result (maxResults) information, category information, and sort information, in addition to the aforementioned device information.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">In particular, an EPG service may be set based on the category information for the aforementioned EPG service request. However, if the category is set to &#x2018;all&#x2019;, for example, information on CP tap (for example, YouTube tap) as well as real time tap may be received. In the case of the CP tap, only Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">The control module <b>12020</b> checks the request of the digital device <b>12010</b> and determines whether or the corresponding request is a request for the updated EPG service data.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">If it is determined that the corresponding input is the EPG service request, the control module <b>12020</b> transmits a search request to a search module (not shown) together with the search parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">The search module analyzes the search parameter transmitted from the control module <b>12020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">The search module transmits the result of the analyzed search parameter to a search engine, and the search engine searches for the database <b>12070</b> based on the transmitted search parameter. In this case, the database is required to store a great quantity of data for a long time because the EPG service data may generally provide not only information of the day or current information, but also information on the past and/or the future for a predetermined period on the basis of the current time or date. However, as will be described below, in the case of thumbnail image service data that does not essentially need long time or large capacity storage, a buffer or memory for temporary storage may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">The search engine receives the searched result from the database <b>12070</b> and transmits the received result to the search module. The search module analyzes the search result received from the search engine, configures the analyzed result in a response format corresponding to the request, and returns the response to the control module <b>12020</b>. In this case, the returned response of the search module may be xml format, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">The control module <b>12020</b> may transmit the EPG service data returned from the search module to the corresponding digital device alone or together with the service list set identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">The corresponding digital device parses the EPG service data received from the data server <b>12015</b>, and configures an EPG screen from the parsed result to provide the configured EPG screen to the user. In this case, the parsed EPG service data may be stored in the storage unit within the digital device, or a cloud or a mobile terminal connected to the digital device.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing an example of updating EPG service data in a data server according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an example illustrated at the left side may mean a digital device <b>13010</b>, and an example illustrated at the right side may mean a data server <b>13015</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, for example, a procedure of updating EPG service data according to the present invention will hereinafter be described by exemplifying three digital devices with respect to the same service UK, ENG, DVB-T.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">The first digital device <b>13020</b> is associated with the service UK, ENG, DVB-T, and a service list to which the corresponding digital device is accessible, i.e. an EPG service list may include, for example, six services of No. 1 dvb://233a.2f.1, No. 2 dvb://233a.2f.2, No. 3 dvb://233a.2f.3, No. 4 dvb://233a.3f.1, No. 5 dvb://233a.4f.1, and No. 6 dvb://233a.4f.2.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">The second digital device <b>13030</b> is associated with the service UK, ENG, DVB-T, and a service list to which the corresponding digital device is accessible, i.e. an EPG service list may include, for example, five services of No. 1 dvb://233a.2f.2, No. 2 dvb://233a.2f.3, No. 3 dvb://233a.3f.1, No. 4 dvb://233a.4f.1, and No. 5 dvb://233a.6f.1.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">The third digital device <b>13040</b> is associated with the service UK, ENG, DVB-T, and a service list to which the corresponding digital device is accessible, i.e. an EPG service list may include, for example, five services of No. 1 dvb://233a.2f.1, No. 2 dvb://233a.2f.2, No. 3 dvb://233a.2f.3, No. 4 dvb://233a.3f.1, and No. 5 dvb://233a.5f.1.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in particular, an update service of the first digital device <b>13020</b> is No. 2 service, an update service of the second digital device <b>13030</b> is No. 3 service, and an update service of the third digital device <b>13040</b> is No. 5 service.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">The three digital devices <b>13020</b>, <b>13030</b> and <b>13040</b> have the same service list set identifier. That is, EPG service data of the three digital devices <b>13020</b>, <b>13030</b> and <b>13040</b> belongs to a single super set.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">The super set contains, for example, data of a total of eight EPG services. That is, EPG service data may include eight services of No. 1 dvb://233a.2f.1, No. 2 dvb://233a.2f.2, No. 3 dvb://233a.2f.3, No. 4 dvb://233a.3f.1, No. 5 dvb://233a.4f.1, No. 6 dvb://233a.4f.2, No. 7 dvb://233a.5f.1, and No. 8 dvb://233a.7f.1.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">The above description is one example of EPG service data that is received and updated from the respective digital devices belonging to the super set. In other words, the respective digital devices belonging to the same super set, for example, may equally receive the EPG service data list within the super set from the data server <b>13050</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">For example, the first digital device <b>13020</b> can access a total of six services. However, if the first digital device <b>13020</b> requests EPG service data from the data server <b>13050</b>, the data server <b>13050</b> responds and transmits data of eight EPG services within the super set to which the corresponding digital device belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">In this case, the first digital device <b>13020</b> parses the response of the data server <b>13015</b>, and configures an EPG from the parsed EPG service data to provide the EPG to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">However, the first digital device <b>13020</b> may not include EPG service data with respect to an inaccessible service by filtering the EPG service data, and may configure EPG service data with respect to only an accessible service to provide the EPG service data to the user via a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">For example, the first digital device <b>13020</b> cannot access the services of No. 7 dvb://233a.5f.1 and No. 8 dvb://233a.7f.1 among the EPG service data within the response received from the data server <b>13050</b>, and therefore filtering the inaccessible services prior to providing the EPG service data may increase user convenience. However, even the filtered service, for example, may be used by the corresponding digital device to configure an EPG service if it is a service or content associated with other accessible services.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">Even in the case of the second digital device <b>13030</b> and the third digital device <b>13040</b>, an EPG service may be provided in the same manner as the above-described processing procedure of the first digital device <b>13020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">The super set is exemplified herein only for convenience of explanation, and may correspond to an example obtained by updating EPG service data processed through the control module <b>12020</b>, the crawler module <b>12030</b> and the processing module <b>12050</b> within the above-described data server <b>12015</b>, and thereafter searching the updated EPG service through the search module and the search engine.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">In addition, in the course of transmitting the updated EPG service data to the server <b>13015</b>, or separately from this course, the digital device may periodically or non-periodically transmit or receive information on a viewer rating associated with a channel or program that the corresponding digital device currently shows, together with the 3-ID.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">In this way, the data server <b>13050</b> may additionally receive information on a viewer rating with respect to EPG service data, together with the EPG service data of each digital device, and provide the additional information together or separately from provision of the EPG service, which results in a differentiated service as compared to the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">The above description generally exemplifies and explains a DVB mode. However, the present invention is not limited to the above-described DVB mode, and for example may be equally applied to an ATSC mode. In the case of the ATSC mode, a channel name and/or a program name may be additionally necessary due to differences in a broadcasting mode. Here, the channel name, for example, may have the same function as the aforementioned 3-ID.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">Accordingly, the server configures a super set on the basis of a channel name of each digital device, adds service list set identifier information on the configured super set, maps the super set with the digital device based on the added information, and transmits the mapped result to the corresponding digital device. The procedure of updating the EPG service data or the procedure of searching EPG service data in response to the EPG service request from the digital device are completely the same as the above description, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted hereinafter. However, in the case of North America, if collision of EPG data provided by a variety of sources occurs under the condition of a channel name reference, any one EPG data may be selected, or all collided EPG data may be transmitted to the digital device so that the corresponding digital device filters the EPG data based on information on a local area.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">Hereinafter, channel browser service data will be described in the same manner as the service EPG service data. Since a basic processing concept of channel browser service is similar to that of the EPG service data, a detailed description thereof is replaced by the above description, and the following description is centered only on context corresponding to a channel browser.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">In the case of the channel browser, data required to configure the channel browser may be extracted from service information contained in a digital broadcast signal transmitted from a broadcasting station, or may be received from a channel browser server, such as an EPG server.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">However, respective digital devices have different various channel coverages, and realistically the channel browser server has difficulty in providing proper channel browsers for all channels which a corresponding digital device can access due to limited channel coverage. Thus, although some channels may provide thumbnail images if the user requests for a channel browser, some channels may show only a black screen. This may cause dissatisfaction with the digital device and the broadcast service.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">In consideration of the above-described circumstance, the above-described broadcasting system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> may also be used to process the channel browser in a method similar to the above-described EPG service providing method.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">More specifically, the digital device serves as a channel browser for a currently tuned channel, and captures a current screen as a back channel to thereby store a thumbnail image even if no user request is present.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">The captured thumbnail image for the particular channel may be configured, for example, into a 3-ID format, and be transmitted to the data server together with or separately from the above-described updated EPG service data.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">The thumbnail image of a screen with respect to the channel may be captured in various ways. For example, when channel change occurs, a corresponding screen may be immediately captured, and a current screen may be periodically captured. In this case, the digital device may select only the latest stored thumbnail image among captured images of respective channels provided therein, and treats the selected thumbnail image as a representative thumbnail image for the corresponding channel to transmit the thumbnail image as channel browser update data to the data server.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">The control module <b>12020</b> within the data server <b>12015</b> may transmit the updated channel browser data to the crawler module <b>12030</b>, and in turn the crawler module <b>12030</b> may analyze the channel browser data to transmit the analyzed result to the processing module.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">The processing module processes the updated channel browser data for the respective channels on the basis of each service list set identifier by combining the updated channel browser data with, for example, additional channel browser data provided by the channel browser server. The processed channel browser data is stored in the database <b>12070</b>, for example, separately from the EPG service data.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">In this case, the channel browser service data includes, for example, thumbnail images, and therefore URL addresses required to access the corresponding thumbnail images are stored in the database <b>12070</b>, together with the thumbnail images.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">In the case of the stored channel browser service data, if a user request for a channel browser occurs in the future, similar to the case of processing the EPG service data as described above, a search parameter for search of the channel browser is transmitted to the data server, and in turn the control module <b>12020</b> within the data server <b>12015</b> transmits the search parameter to the search module so that the search module analyzes the search parameter and drives the search engine based on the analyzed result.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">The search engine, for example, searches the database based on the search parameter transmitted from the search module, collects data associated with the corresponding channel browser, and transmits the collected data to the search module.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">In response to a user request, the search module configures a response including an URL to access the thumbnail image of each channel from the collected channel browser data, and transmits the response to the corresponding digital device through the control module.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">The digital device reads each channel and the URL of the corresponding channel by parsing the aforementioned response. Then, the digital device extracts the thumbnail image for the corresponding channel by accessing the read URL, and provides a channel browser to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">According to the present invention, channel coverage of each digital device may be increased, and advanced EPG with an abundance of metadata per program and a channel browser may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">The thumbnail processor <b>12040</b> includes an authentication module and a program thumbnail crawler module.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">The authentication module determines whether or not the digital device <b>12010</b> has uploading authority, generates an authentication signal depending on the determined result, and transmits the signal to the control module <b>12020</b> and/or the program thumbnail crawler module. In this case, if it is determined based on the authentication signal transmitted from the authentication module that the digital device <b>12010</b> has no uploading authority, the control module <b>12020</b> may generate a control signal for controlling access of the corresponding device, and transmit the control signal to the corresponding digital device. On the contrary, if it is determined based on the authentication signal transmitted from the authentication module that the digital device <b>12010</b> has uploading authority, the control module <b>12020</b> may transmit a control signal that allows access of the corresponding device and contains a message indicating authentication success to the corresponding digital device.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">The program thumbnail crawler module may be activated according to the authentication signal transmitted from the authentication module, and may perform the same crawling function as the above-described EPG crawler module <b>12030</b> with respect to the thumbnail image transmitted from each digital device.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">In this case, like the above-described EPG processor, the thumbnail processor <b>12040</b> may build the database <b>12070</b> to store the thumbnail image processed by the program thumbnail crawler module. Alternatively, unlike the above-described EPG processor, the thumbnail processor <b>12040</b> may temporarily store the thumbnail image processed by the program thumbnail crawler module in a buffer or memory without building the database <b>12070</b>. The buffer or memory, for example, may be located inside or outside of the thumbnail processor.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">The processing module <b>12050</b>, for example, may process EPG service data processed by the EPG crawler module <b>12030</b>, and/or may combine and process the EPG service data with EPG service data collected by the external server <b>12090</b>. Also, the processing module <b>12050</b> may process even the program thumbnail image service data in the same manner as the EPG service data to transmit the program thumbnail image service data to the thumbnail processor or to store the program thumbnail image service data in the database <b>12070</b>. The processing module <b>12050</b> may process input data on the basis of various references (e.g., may add identification information), and store the data in the database <b>12070</b> or transmit the data to the corresponding processor.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in the digital system according to the present invention, for example, EPG service data, channel browser data, and thumbnail images may be processed in different modules.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">Transmission of data from the digital device <b>12010</b> to the data server <b>12015</b> may be performed on a per service data basis. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, if the respective categories of service data are previously collected and transmitted to the data server <b>12015</b>, the control module <b>12020</b> within the data server <b>12015</b> may sort the service data into respective categories and transmit each category of the service data to the corresponding module.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the case in which a digital device <b>14010</b> transmits, for example, both EPG service data <b>14024</b> and thumbnail image service data <b>14022</b> to a data server <b>14030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">In the present invention, each digital device transmits service data stored therein to the data server, and in turn the data server processes the service data transmitted from each digital device as well as service data separately collected via an external server, and thereafter transmits the processed data upon receiving a request from each digital device, whereby a greater quantity of higher quality service data may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">In this case, it is unnecessary to provide an infinite number of digital devices that are connected to the data server of the digital system and transmit service data to the data server, for example. This is because if an infinite number of digital devices respectively transmit service data stored therein to the data server, data traffic may occur and cause deterioration in service quality, and the data server has needs for high performance and high capacity, which results in cost burden. In addition, this is because data transmitted from the respective digital devices that communicate with the data server are not completely different from one another and may overlap to some extent. In this case, the digital system may be understood transmission of service data from the digital devices to the data server and transmission of the processed service data from the data server to the respective digital devices from different viewpoints. In other words, it is assumed that there are 100 digital devices and at least one data server connected to one another via a digital system. In this case, the digital devices may be controlled such that only 50 digital devices transmit service data to the data server, but the 100 digital devices receive processed service data from the data server so as to provide a corresponding service. This control mode may be appropriately determined to provide a differentiated service in terms of data traffic, cost, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">In addition, the data server within the digital system may transmit a control signal to each digital device, to assist the digital device in setting authority to transmit service data to the data server, a transmission cycle, and the like. This control mode, as described above, may be appropriately determined in terms of data traffic, the capacity of the server, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">For example, it is assumed that a digital device A transmits EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data to the data server by a cycle of 10 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">In this case, the data server may process the data as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">Basically, the data server determines whether or not the corresponding digital device A has transmission authority. If the digital device A has transmission authority, the data server determines a service list set identifier of the corresponding digital device A, and then determines whether or not another digital device having the same service list set identifier has already transmitted the same service data as that transmitted from the digital device A to the data server.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">If it is determined that the service data received from the digital device A overlaps with the previously received service data from another digital device having the same service list set identifier, the data server may fix a service data transmission cycle to the corresponding digital device A, but may control a data transmission cycle of another digital device. For example, if the data is transmitted from the digital device A at an interval of 10 seconds from a predetermined time, the data server may control the transmission cycle of another digital device to transmit the data at an interval of 10 seconds from a time delayed by &#x221d; from the predetermined time. Alternatively, the data server may transmit a control signal to change a service data transmission cycle. For example, if the previous transmission cycle is 10 seconds, the data server may change the transmission cycle to 11 seconds. Here, &#x221d; may be, for example, 1 to 3 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">In the above-described case, the data server may transmit a rejection message as well as the control signal, to allow the corresponding control signal to be identified and processed in the digital device. Thus, if the rejection message is received, the digital device may extract the control signal transmitted from the data server, decode the extracted control signal, and transmit the service data to the data server in the same manner after resetting a transmission time or transmission cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a block diagram showing a digital system according to a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the digital system may include a digital device <b>15010</b> and a data server <b>15015</b>. The data server <b>15015</b> may receive service data associated with the present invention by individually communicating with an external server <b>15090</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">Hereinafter, a detailed description of the same configurations as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> will be omitted, and only differences will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">In particular, the digital system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> has a slight difference in terms of configuration of the data server from the above-described digital system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">More specifically, basically, the data server <b>15015</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> includes an EPG service data processor and a thumbnail image service data processor in the same manner as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, but has differences in the configurations of the respective processors.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">For example, the EPG service data processor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> may further include a first analysis module <b>15035</b> and an EPG provider module <b>15040</b>, in addition to the above-described crawler module <b>12030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">If the digital device <b>15010</b> transmits device information or updated service data together with or separately from area information or position information on the digital device <b>15010</b>, for example, the first analysis module <b>15035</b> receives the transmitted data from a control module <b>15020</b> provided in the data server <b>15015</b>. Here, the position information, for example, may be at least one of GPS information, an identifier of the area to which the corresponding digital device <b>15010</b> belongs (e.g., an original network identifier) and a Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) code of the area to which the corresponding digital device <b>15010</b> belongs. The first analysis module <b>15035</b> analyzes the received position information on the digital device <b>15010</b>. The analyzed data, for example, may be the identifier of the area to which the corresponding digital device <b>15010</b> belongs, GPS information, or the ZIP code. That is, the first analysis module <b>15035</b> extracts at least one of the GPS information, then original network identifier, and the ZIP code as the position information on the corresponding digital device <b>15010</b>, and transmits the extracted position information to the EPG provider module <b>15040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">The EPG provider module <b>15040</b> may extract EPG service data based on the position information on the digital device <b>15010</b> received from the first analysis module <b>15035</b> by accessing a database <b>15080</b> in which the EPG service data is stored, and may again transmit the EPG service data to the digital device <b>15010</b> through the control module <b>15020</b>. When extracting the service data, the EPG provider module <b>15040</b> may determine proper service data by analytically comparing the received position information on the digital device <b>15010</b> with device information that is received through another digital device and is used for grouping. This is applicable in the same principle even to the case of a program thumbnail image that will be described hereinafter. For example, if the position information is the original network identifier, coincident groups may be searched by comparing original network identifiers of respective groups with one another. On the other hand, if the position information is the ZIP code, an original network identifier of the area corresponding to the ZIP code is extracted, and a group corresponding to the ZIP code may be searched. In the case of GPS information, similarly, a group corresponding to the GPS information may be searched from the original network identifier of the area corresponding to the GPS information.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">The aforementioned position information, for example, may be continuously changed rather than providing information on a fixed position if the digital device is a mobile terminal. This is because EPG service data may be changed on a per position basis.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">Similarly, in the case of a thumbnail image, the thumbnail processor receives the position information on the digital device <b>15010</b> from the corresponding digital device. A second analysis module <b>15055</b> analyzes the received device position information, and thereafter transmits at least one of the original network identifier and the ZIP code to a program thumbnail provider module <b>15060</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">The program thumbnail provider module <b>15060</b> accesses a database <b>15080</b> or a buffer or memory incorporated therein based on the original network identifier and/or the ZIP code, extracts service data having a service list set identifier coincident with the original network identifier and/or the ZIP code, and transmits the extracted service data to the corresponding digital device <b>15010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">In the case in which the digital device <b>15010</b> is a mobile terminal, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, if the mobile terminal transmits area information thereof to the server to receive service data, such as previously stored EPG data, the data server may transmit the EPG service data to the corresponding mobile terminal based on the received area information. In this case, the data server may select an optimal super set based on the received area information, extract service data of the selected super set, and transmit the extracted service data to the mobile terminal. However, since the mobile terminal may have change in the position information thereof, the super set may be again determined and selected if the area information differs from previous area information.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a diagram showing an example of EPG and/or thumbnail image service data according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, for example, a data server <b>16010</b> may be equal to the data server described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows transmission of service data from the data server to each digital device, other than data transmission from the digital device to the data server.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows the case <b>16020</b> of transmitting thumbnail image service data included in the format of EPG service data.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">Alternatively, as described above, EPG service data and thumbnail image service data may be respectively configured into single service data and be transmitted separately.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing an example of processing service data in a digital system according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, in the digital system, three digital devices <b>17010</b>, <b>17020</b> and <b>17030</b> transmit EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data to a data server <b>17040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">The data server <b>17040</b> collects, processes, and stores the service data. Then, if the digital device requests the service data, the data server <b>17040</b> transmits the stored service data to the corresponding digital device. In this case, for example, the digital device may be at least one of three digital television receivers <b>17010</b>, <b>17020</b> and <b>17030</b> and two mobile terminals <b>17052</b> and <b>17054</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">Although the above description exemplifies the case in which the digital device periodically or non-periodically transmits service data stored therein to the data server, and receives processed service data from the data server, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> exemplifies the case in which a device that transmits service data may differ from a device that receives the service data. In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, service data transmitted from the aforementioned three digital television receivers <b>17010</b>, <b>17020</b> and <b>17030</b> to the data server <b>17040</b> may be transmitted from the data server <b>17040</b> to the mobile terminals <b>17052</b> and <b>17054</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing an example of transmission/reception of service data between digital devices according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">Assuming the case in which one digital device receives latest processed service data from a data server as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 17</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> exemplifies the concept of expanding service from the corresponding digital device to another digital device that is not registered in or connected to the data server and thus has no authority.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, it is assumed that a mobile terminal <b>18010</b> receives latest processed EPG/thumbnail image/channel browser service data from a data server.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">The mobile terminal <b>18010</b> may transmit the received service data to a digital device <b>18020</b>, to which the mobile terminal <b>18010</b> is connectable via a wired/wireless network, to which the mobile terminal <b>18010</b> belongs or is connectable.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">A variety of wired/wireless communication means, such as various wired/wireless communication networks, and an N-screen, for example, may be constructed for transmission/reception of data between the mobile terminal <b>18010</b> and the digital television receiver <b>18020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0416">In this case, the mobile terminal <b>18010</b> or the digital television receiver <b>18020</b> may be connected to the broadcasting station <b>10010</b> and/or the external server <b>10030</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, thereby being capable of receiving service data.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing another example of transmission/reception of service data between digital devices according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> exemplifies the concept of controlling authority to prevent improper transmission of service data between digital devices connected to a wired/wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">For example, the situation in which a digital television receiver <b>19020</b> is present at home and a passerby who is present within a home network range accesses the network using a portable terminal <b>19010</b> thereof and attempts to control the digital television receiver <b>19020</b> is problematic.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">Accordingly, to prevent occurrence of the aforementioned situation, it can be contemplated that inter-authentication between digital devices is performed such that only a digital device that has proper authority is connectable to the other digital device and can perform transmission and reception of service data after being coupled with the other digital device.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, if the mobile terminal <b>19010</b> having service data transmits security authentication information <b>19012</b>, represented as xpto25, to the digital television receiver <b>19020</b> that belongs to a network, the digital television receiver <b>19020</b> decodes the authentication information <b>19012</b>, and transmits a message for access permission to the corresponding mobile terminal <b>19010</b> if an owner of the mobile terminal <b>19010</b> has proper authority, or displaying the message <b>19</b> <b>022</b> on a screen of the digital television receiver <b>19020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">The security authentication information <b>19012</b>, for example, may be generated and transmitted from the data server that transmits the processed service data, and may be generated from the mobile terminal <b>19010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">A variety of authentication algorithms may be used in relation to generation of the security authentication information <b>19012</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, there is illustrated a screen of the digital television receiver <b>18020</b> that is controlled based on service data (for example, EPG service data) received from the mobile terminal <b>18010</b> that is connected to the digital television receiver <b>18020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">A digital system prepared based on the expanded concept of the above description will be configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a first digital device (mobile terminal) <b>20040</b> transmits service data stored therein to a data server <b>20010</b>, and receives latest processed service data stored in a database <b>20030</b> from the data server <b>20010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">The first digital device <b>20040</b> may transmit the latest processed service data received from the data server <b>20010</b> to a second digital device (digital television receiver) <b>20050</b> via communication with the first digital device <b>20040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0428">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, for example, the first digital device <b>20040</b> may receive service data from the second digital device <b>20050</b>, and may transmit the received service data to the data server <b>20010</b> to enable processing of the service data.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0429"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing an example of a screen of a digital device that receives service data according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0430">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, assuming that a digital device is a mobile terminal, for example, the mobile terminal may directly receive service data from a data server, or may indirectly receive service data from another digital device that has received the service data from the data server. Then, the mobile terminal may output detailed information in response to a user request by decoding the received service data, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, for example, a screen <b>22010</b> of the mobile terminal may contain buttons used to select a previous program item <b>22020</b> and a next program item <b>22060</b>. Also, program information containing a thumbnail image <b>22030</b> may be displayed on the center of the screen <b>22010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432">The mobile terminal, for example, may control another digital device connected thereto. Thus, the screen <b>22010</b> of the mobile terminal may further contain a TV display item <b>22040</b> that allows a selected program to be displayed on a digital television receiver, and an SNS sharing item <b>22050</b> that allows a selected program to be shaped via an SNS.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0433">For example, when using an EPG/thumbnail/channel browser service in the mobile terminal having a limited screen size, transmitting the corresponding service data to a digital device having a larger screen size may provide viewer convenience. Alternatively, when the service data, along with text data, is shared via Twitter, expanded service coverage may be accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is an explanatory view showing service control between digital devices according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, it can be appreciated that a single digital device <b>23010</b> can control at least one of other digital devices <b>23020</b> and <b>23030</b> using service data received from a data server or the other digital devices.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0436">For example, if the user receives service data from the data server using a mobile terminal, the user can control the other digital devices <b>23020</b> and <b>23030</b> so long as the mobile terminal <b>23010</b> of the user has control authorities for the other digital devices <b>23020</b> and <b>23030</b>. In this case, the mobile terminal of the user may function as a remote controller.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0437">In addition, the mobile terminal may control only one digital device, and in turn the digital device may control the other digital device. Alternatively, the mobile terminal may directly control both the digital devices.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0438">For example, the mobile terminal <b>23010</b> transmits a device identifier to a digital device A <b>23020</b> in a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) manner, and requests a key for data encryption.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0439">The digital device A <b>23020</b> transmits a response code and an encryption key in response to the request from the mobile terminal <b>23010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">The mobile terminal <b>23010</b> encrypts a service displayed on a current screen, or at least one of three program identifiers including an original network identifier, a TS identifier, and a Service identifier, and a service name using the encryption key transmitted from the digital device A <b>23020</b>, and thereafter transmits the encrypted data to the digital device A <b>23020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">The digital device <b>23020</b> initially determines whether or not a current channel is available by decoding received channel information. If it is determined that the channel is available, the digital device <b>23020</b> plays a corresponding broadcast. However, if it is determined that the channel is not available, the digital device <b>23020</b> may transmit a response containing a code to inform that the corresponding digital device <b>23020</b> cannot play the broadcast to the mobile terminal <b>23010</b>. Thus, if the mobile terminal <b>23010</b> receives the response containing a playback not possible code from the corresponding digital device <b>23020</b>, the mobile terminal <b>23010</b> may be connected to the other digital device <b>23030</b> instead of the corresponding digital device <b>23020</b>, or may communicate with the other digital device <b>23030</b> to inquire and request broadcast playback in the above described manner after changing a service or program.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">The digital device A <b>23020</b> may communicate with the other digital device <b>23030</b> connected thereto even when it cannot play a broadcast as well as when it can play a broadcast, so as to inquiry as to whether or not playback is possible, or so as to process playback.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">As described above, the mobile terminal and the digital television receiver can exchange functions thereof. In addition to transmission/reception of service data and service control between the mobile terminal and the digital television receiver, transmission/reception of service data and service control between two mobile terminals or between two digital television receivers are possible.</p>

<p id="p-0452" num="0451">The digital device transmits a search parameter to request the service data in response to a user request to the data server (S<b>24014</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">If the data server receives the service data request from the corresponding digital device, the data server determines whether or not the corresponding digital device has proper authority.

<p id="p-0454" num="0453">The data server analyzes the search parameter, and accesses the database or the corresponding buffer or memory based on the service list set identifier to search the service data (S<b>24018</b>).
