<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of Ser. No. 11/486,287 filed on Jul. 13, 2006 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/700,065, filed Jul. 18, 2005, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to treated inorganic powders, more particularly treated titanium dioxide, having an improved loose bulk density; a process for their preparation; and their use in polymer compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">High molecular weight polymers, for example, hydrocarbon polymers and polyamides, are melt extruded into shaped structures such as tubing, pipe, wire coating or film by well-known procedures wherein a rotating screw pushes a viscous polymer melt through an extruder barrel into a die in which the polymer is shaped to the desired form, and is then subsequently cooled and solidified into a product, that is, the extrudate, having the general shape of the die. In film blowing processes, as an extruded plastic tube emerges from the die the tube is continuously inflated by air, cooled, collapsed by rolls and wound up on subsequent rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Inorganic powders can be added to the polymers for various reasons. In particular, titanium dioxide pigments, are added to polymers for imparting whiteness and/or opacity to the finished article. To deliver other properties to the molded part or film, additional additives are usually incorporated into the processing step.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a typical method for combining inorganic powders and polymers the powder and polymer are dropped through a feed tube into the feed barrel near the starting end of an extruder or into a &#x201c;side stuffer&#x201d; part-way along the extruder's length. The combined powders and polymers are compounded and extruded.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another typical method for combining inorganic powders and polymers, the inorganic powder can be dropped with the polymer into the cavity of a rotational blender such as a Banbury.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For ease of processing, it is desirable for bulk dry powders used as ingredients in industrial operations, and in polymer compositions in particular, to flow freely. One measure of the free-flow property of a powder is bulk flow. Bulk flow is a general term that describes the flowability of a powder in storage and handling systems. One measure of bulk flow is the Rat Hole Index (RHI) as measured by a Johanson Hang-up Indicizer which is described herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the field of compounding inorganic powders with polymers, the powders are typically received by the polymer compounder in packages containing from 20 kg to more than 20 tons. Smaller package volumes (typically up to 1 metric ton) are added to the process via small hoppers or &#x201c;day bins&#x201d; that can store sufficient powder for production periods ranging between a few minutes and a full day. Larger packages (from 1 to 20-25 tons) are typically unloaded into silos that may contain sufficient powder for many days of production. This unloading and powder transfer may be performed by pneumatic or mechanical conveyors or simple gravity chutes. In all of these cases, it is desirable for the powder to have sufficient flowability to discharge reliably from the hopper or silo without blockages and, preferably, without the need for extraordinary flow promotion efforts. Many inorganic powders, especially titanium dioxide, are known for having poor flow properties, as compared to free-flowing materials such as dry sand or plastic pellets. Handling systems for the subject materials are frequently operating near their limits; consequently, powder treatments that reduce the flowability of the dry bulk powder increase the compounder's handling costs. In particular, arching (bridging) and a related form of flow obstruction known as ratholing may occur with powders that have poor flow properties, making it difficult if not impossible to empty the silo or hopper without extensive human intervention which may require process shutdown. Powder flow properties also affect the filling of the screw flights of metering screws and feed screws of extruders. Poor flowing powders tend to not fill the flights in a consistent way, and also not fill them as completely as a more flowable powder would. This reduces both the uniformity (accuracy) of a screw transport system and also its delivery capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The need for improved productivity through higher output of compounded polymer is a constant issue with both blending and compounding methods. In each method, the production rate can be limited by the physical volume of the apparatus used to introduce the mixture of inorganic powder and polymer into the process. Since the feeding devices are limited by volume, not mass, increasing the loose bulk density of the inorganic powder (the density of the powder in loose form) is one possible way to increase the mass that can be processed. Both methods require that the powder flow readily into the reaction chamber. In the case of the extruder, the rate at which the compounding can occur may be limited by the transport capacity (volume per revolution) of the rotating screw. If the powder has a higher loose bulk density, more mass can be transported per revolution of the screw, resulting in higher output. Similarly the total output of a rotational blender may be limited by the volume occupied by the individual components prior to blending. To improve the productivity of these blenders, it is desirable to decrease the amount of space a given mass powder component takes up. Therefore, if the loose bulk density of the inorganic powder is increased, it will take up less volume and increase the overall output of the blender.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">While higher values of loose bulk density, in themselves, are beneficial for bulk flow, some titanium dioxide pigments with high loose bulk density are also highly compressible. The compressibility is indicative of interparticle packing which results in greater cohesive strength and poor bulk flow.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, powder treating techniques, in particular treatment with organosilicon compounds to improve performance properties such as lacing resistance in a polyolefin matrix, can have a detrimental impact on the bulk flow properties of the powder.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A treatment for inorganic powders which improves the loose bulk density of the powder without a significant impact on bulk flow has been discovered.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0040">The disclosure relates to a process for treating an inorganic powder, typically a titanium dioxide powder, to form a powder capable of being dispersed into a polymer melt for preparing a plastic part. The treated powder may be present in the amount of about 0.25 weight % to about 2.0 wt %, more typically in the amount of about 0.5 weight % to about 1.0 wt %, based on the total weight of the treated powder. The loose bulk density of the treated powder can be at least about 1%, typically at least about 3.0%, greater than the loose bulk density of an untreated silanized inorganic powder, more typically about 4 to about 50% greater than the loose bulk density of an untreated silanized inorganic powder, and still more typically about 10 to about 45% greater than the loose bulk density of an untreated silanized inorganic powder, by weight based on the entire weight of the powder.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Treated Powder:</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0041">It is contemplated that any inorganic powder will benefit from the surface treatment of this disclosure. By inorganic powder it is meant an inorganic particulate material that becomes uniformly dispersed throughout a polymer melt that can impart color and opacity to the polymer melt. Some examples of inorganic powders include but are not limited to ZnS, TiO<sub>2</sub>, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, BaSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnO, MoS<sub>2</sub>, silica, talc and clay.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0042">In particular, titanium dioxide is an especially useful powder in the processes and products of this disclosure. Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) powder useful in the present disclosure may be in the rutile or anatase crystalline form. It is commonly made by either a chloride process or a sulfate process. In the chloride process, TiCl<sub>4 </sub>is oxidized to TiO<sub>2 </sub>powders. In the sulfate process, sulfuric acid and ore containing titanium are dissolved, and the resulting solution goes through a series of steps to yield TiO<sub>2</sub>. Both the sulfate and chloride processes are described in greater detail in &#x201c;The Pigment Handbook&#x201d;, Vol. 1, 2nd Ed., John Wiley &#x26; Sons, NY (1988), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The powder may be a pigment or nanoparticle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0043">By &#x201c;pigment&#x201d; it is meant that the titanium dioxide powders have an average size of less than about 1 micron. Typically, the powders have an average size of from about 0.020 to about 0.95 microns, more typically, about 0.050 to about 0.75 microns and most typically about 0.075 to about 0.50 microns. Pigmentary titanium dioxide more typically ranges from about 0.15 to about 0.8 microns, and more typically from about 0.2 to about 0.4 microns in average size diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0044">By &#x201c;nanoparticle&#x201d; it is meant that the primary titanium dioxide powders typically have an average particle size diameter of less than about 100 nanometers (nm) as determined by dynamic light scattering that measures the particle size distribution of particles in liquid suspension. The particles are typically agglomerates that may range from about 3 nm to about 6000 nm. More specifically, the primary particles typically exist in air as agglomerates ranging from about 3000 nm to about 6000 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">The titanium dioxide powder may be substantially pure titanium dioxide or may contain other metal oxides, such as silica, alumina, zirconia. Other metal oxides may become incorporated into the powders, for example, by co-oxidizing or co-precipitating titanium compounds with other metal compounds. If co-oxidized or co-precipitated up to about 20 wt % of the metal oxide, more typically, 0.5 to 17 wt %, most typically about 0.7 to about 17 wt % may be present, based on the total powder weight.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">The titanium dioxide powder may also bear one or more metal oxide surface treatments. These treatments may be applied using techniques known by those skilled in the art. Examples of metal oxide treatments include silica, alumina, and/or zirconia among others. Such treatments may be present in an amount of about 0.1 to about 10 wt %, based on the total weight of the powder, preferably about 0.5 to about 3 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0047">The inorganic powder may be silanized by treating with at least one silane, or a mixture of at least one silane and at least one polysiloxane. The silane comprises a silane monomer. Suitable silane monomers are those in which at least one substituent group of the silane contains an organic substituent. The organic substituent can contain heteroatoms such oxygen or halogen. Typical examples of suitable silanes include, without limit, alkoxy silanes and halosilanes having the general formula:

<p id="p-0048" num="0063">The inorganic powder may be treated, additionally surface treated, by adding to the powder one or more of the long chain fatty acids or salts thereof of this disclosure that may have greater than about 8 carbon atoms, typically from about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms, more typically from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0064">Typically the fatty acid of this disclosure is a saturated or unsaturated, straight chain or branched chain fatty acid.

<p id="p-0051" num="0066">In another embodiment, the fatty acid can be monounsaturated or polyunsaturated.

<p id="p-0055" num="0070">By &#x201c;surface treated&#x201d; it is meant inorganic powders, in particular titanium dioxide powders, that have been contacted with the compounds described herein. Typically, the compounds are adsorbed on the surface of the powder or a reaction product of at least one of the compounds with the powder is present on the surface as an adsorbed species or chemically bonded to the surface. The compounds or their reaction products or combination thereof may be present as a coating, continuous or discontinuous, on the surface of the powder. Typically, a continuous coating comprising the fatty acid and the silane, siloxane or mixtures thereof, is on the surface of the powder.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0071">The silanized inorganic powders may be prepared by a process that comprises surface treating powders with the silane or combination of silane and siloxane. This process is not especially critical and may be accomplished in a number of ways. While typically the powder may be treated with the silane, if present, and then the siloxane compound in sequence, the powder may be treated with the silane and the siloxane compound simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0072">The surface treatment of the powder may be performed by contacting dry powder with neat compound or in an appropriate solvent that one skilled in the art can select. When a silane is employed the compound may be prehydrolzyed, then contacted with dry powder.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0073">Alternatively, the treating compounds may be dissolved in a solvent or prepared as a slurry before contacting powder, in dry or slurry form. In addition, the powder may be immersed in the treating compound, if liquid, or a solution, of the treating compound or compounds is used.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0074">Any of a variety of mixing processes and mixing devices therefor which are well known in the art of powder treating can be used. High shear mixing is especially useful. For example, mixing may be accomplished in any high shear mixing apparatus including but not limited to a V-cone blender fitted with an internal stirring bar at ambient temperature for a period of time, for example, while not being limited there to, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0075">Powders can be treated while being agitated by a shaker or other pulsating device, while falling from one container to another, while tumbling in a moving vessel or a vessel with rotating paddles that can mechanically fluidize the mixture such as a Forberg mixer. Additionally, the powders can be treated by vigorous shaking or lifting and dividing the powder and spraying the mixture while it is contained in a closed volume substantially larger than the volume of the powder. This can be accomplished on a small scale by shaking the ingredients while they are contained in a closed bag for a period of time. The treatment time can range from 10-15 minutes. A substantially shorter time is needed with a Forberg mixer. A double cone blender with intensifier bars and Littleford-type mixers can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0076">Mixing may also be accomplished by:</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0077">(i) metering treating agents comprising a long chain fatty acid or salt thereof, a silane and optionally a siloxane into a flow restrictor, having an inlet and an outlet, with air or some other motive gas, to create a zone of turbulence at the outlet of the flow restrictor thereby atomizing the treating agents to form an atomized liquid; and</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0078">(ii) contacting the inorganic powder with the atomized liquid, typically by dispersing the inorganic powder and simultaneously or subsequently contacting the inorganic powder with the atomized liquid, to form a treated powder comprising or derived from inorganic powder and the treating agents. The atomized liquid may be substantially uniformly coated on the surface of the inorganic powder. The foregoing mixing process involves dispersion of the liquid and the powder in a region of high shear.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0083">Typically, the polymer may be selected from the group consisting of polyolefin, polyvinyl chloride, polyamide and polyester, and mixture of these. More typically used polymers are polyolefins. Most typically used polymers are polyolefins selected from the group consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, and mixture thereof. A typical polyethylene polymer is low density polyethylene and linear low density polyethylene.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Other Additives</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0084">A wide variety of additives may be present in the polymer composition produced by the process of this disclosure as necessary, desirable or conventional. Such additives include polymer processing aids such as fluoropolymers, fluoroelastomers, etc., catalysts, initiators, anti-oxidants (e.g., hindered phenol such as butylated hydroxytoluene), blowing agent, ultraviolet light stabilizers (e.g., hindered amine light stabilizers or &#x201c;HALS&#x201d;), organic pigments including tinctorial pigments, plasticizers, antiblocking agents (e.g. clay, talc, calcium carbonate, silica, silicone oil, and the like) leveling agents, flame retardants, anti-cratering additives, and the like.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Preparation of the Polymer Composition</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0085">The present disclosure provides a process for preparing a powder-containing, high molecular weight polymer composition.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0086">In one embodiment of the disclosure, the treated powder may be contacted with a first high molecular weight melt processable polymer. Any melt compounding techniques, known to those skilled in the art may be used. Generally, the treated powder, other additives and melt-processable polymer are brought together and combined in a blending operation, such as dry blending, that applies shear to the polymer melt to form the powder containing, more typically pigmented, polymer. The melt-processable polymer is usually available in the form of powder, granules, pellets or cubes. Methods for dry blending include shaking in a bag or tumbling in a closed container. Other methods include blending using agitators or paddles. Treated powder, and melt-processable polymer may be co-fed using screw devices, which mix the treated powder, polymer and melt-processable polymer together before the polymer reaches a molten state. Alternately, the components may be fed separately into equipment where they may be melt blended, using any methods known in the art, including screw feeders, kneaders, high shear mixers, blending mixers, and the like. Typical methods use Banbury mixers, single and twin screw extruders, and hybrid continuous mixers.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0087">Processing temperatures depend on the polymer and the blending method used, and are well known to those skilled in the art. The intensity of mixing depends on the polymer characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0088">The treated powder containing polymer composition produced by the process of this disclosure is useful in production of shaped articles. The amount of powder present in the powdered polymer composition and shaped polymer article will vary depending on the end use application.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0089">In one embodiment of this invention a first melt processible polymer containing the inorganic oxide forms what is referred to as a &#x201c;masterbatch&#x201d; which is prepared by melt blending the polymer and inorganic oxide. Any polymer which is suitable for melt processing with a high concentration of inorganic oxide is suitable for the polymer of the masterbatch.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0090">The masterbatch is then melt blended with a second melt processible polymer referred to as a &#x201c;let down&#x201d; polymer. Any polymer suitable for the desired end-use can be used as the let down polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0091">The first and second polymers can be the same or different. Typically, the first and second polymers are highly compatible. The second polymer is usually free of inorganic oxide but can contain one or more other additives (such as an antiblock agent or antioxidant) which can be added by melt blending from a masterbatch containing the polymer and such other additive.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0092">While the amount of first polymer can vary depending on the polymer or mixture of polymers employed, the first polymer is typically present in an amount of from about 10 to about 60 wt. %, typically about 20 to about 50 wt %, even more typically about 30 to about 40 wt.%. based on the total weight of the first and second polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0093">The amount of inorganic oxide in the polymer composition can range from about 30 to about 90 wt %, based on the total weight of the composition, preferably, about 50 to about 80 wt %. The amount of inorganic oxide in an end use, such as a shaped article, for example, a polymer film, can range from about 0.01 to about 20 wt %, and is preferably from about 0.1 to about 15 wt %, more preferably 5 to 10 wt %, based on the entire weight of the article.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0094">A shaped article is typically produced by melt blending the treated inorganic oxide containing polymer which comprises a first high molecular weight melt-processable polymer, with a second high molecular weight melt-processable polymer to produce the polymer that can be used to form the finished article of manufacture. The treated inorganic oxide containing polymer composition and second high molecular weight polymer are melt blended, using any means known in the art, as disclosed hereinabove. In this process, twin-screw extruders are commonly used. Co-rotating twin-screw extruders are available from Werner and Pfleiderer. The melt blended polymer is extruded to form a shaped article.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0095">The treated inorganic oxide of this invention may be employed in any of a wide variety of melt processable polymer compositions and processes utilizing them which are well known in the industry for making plastic articles. For example, the polymer composition together with the inorganic oxide can be used in the extrusion of sheets, films and shaped products; pultrusion; coextrusion; ram extrusion; spinning; blown film; injection molding; insert molding; isostatic molding; compression molding; rotomolding; thermoforming; sputter coating; lamination; wire coating; calendaring; welding; powder coating. Particularly suitable shaped articles are tubing, pipes, wire coatings, sheet and films, especially blown films.</p>

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Loose Bulk Density (BD) Measurement:</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0096">Loose bulk density (BD) was measured as the most loosely packed bulk density when a material was left to settle by gravity alone. The loose bulk density utilized in these examples was measured using a Gilson Company nominal 3 inch sieve pan having a volume of 150.6 cm<sup>3</sup>. The material was hand sieved through a 10 mesh sieve over the tared sieve pan until overfilled. The top was scraped level using a large spatula blade at a 45&#xb0; angle from the horizontal, taking care not to tamp or compress the contents of the cup. The cup was then weighed and the loose bulk density was then calculated.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Rathole Index (RHI) Measurement:</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0097">The measured parameter referred to as rathole index (RHI), describes the degree of difficulty that can be expected in handling a powder. Typically the bulk flow of rutile titanium dioxide has a RHI of about 10 to about 24.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0098">Powder flowability, particularly in silo and hopper situations, can be described using a variety of shear cell testing devices. One such device is the Johanson Hang-up Indicizer from Johanson Innovations. The Indicizer device compresses a sample of powder to a pre-determined compaction stress and then measures the force necessary to press a punch through the compacted powder. From the measured force, and a concurrent measurement of the volume of the powder following compaction, the Indicizer calculates an estimate of the propensity of the powder to form a rathole-type flow obstruction. The predetermined compaction stress level corresponds to an estimate of the stress in a silo. In these examples, the prototypical silo is considered to be 10 feet in diameter, and the Indicizer sets the compaction stress accordingly. The calculated parameter is known as rathole index (RHI) and describes the degree of difficulty that can be expected in handling a powder. Larger values of the RHI correspond to greater amounts of difficulty expected in handling the powder.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0099">To obtain the test results reported in the Examples, a sample of each powder was carefully spooned into the test cell after being sieved through a 16-mesh sieve. Filling continued until the chamber was approximately 75% full. The cell was carefully weighed and then positioned into the Indicizer testing device. The powder weight and its volume were considered by the automated tester in both the calculation of the silo stresses and also the calculated propensity of the material to form a rathole. After the user input the sample weight and nominal silo diameter, the automated tester completed the test and displayed its estimated value of RHI.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0102">500 g samples of rutile titanium dioxide pigment (DuPont Ti-Pure&#xae; R104) were surface treated with cis-9-octadecanoic acid (oleic acid, 99+%, Aldrich) at various levels by diluting the desired amount of oleic acid with hexanes to a total volume of 20 mL. The oleic acid solution was placed into a clean and dry squirt bottle. The pigment was placed in a clean and dry, aluminum foil lined pan and spread uniformly to a depth of &#x2266;1.5 cm. The pigment was uniformly sprayed with the oleic acid solution present in the squirt bottle. Once the surface of the pigment had been wetted, the pigment was uniformly turned over using a spoon. Uniformly spraying the squirt bottle solution onto the overturned pigment was continued, and the steps of uniformly turning over the pigment and spraying were repeated until the squirt bottle was empty. The treated pigment was added to a clean and dry plastic bag and the contents of the bag were thoroughly shaken for a minimum of 3 minutes. The mixed, treated pigment was placed into a clean and dry, aluminum foil lined pan (the pigment was lightly covered with aluminum foil) and placed into a laboratory hood overnight to air dry. The air-dried pigment was then placed into a 120&#xb0; C. oven and dried for exactly one hour. The loose bulk density was measured per the standard method documented above. The results of this treatment are reported in Table 2 and show an increase in loose bulk density versus a comparative sample similarly prepared but without oleic acid.</p>
