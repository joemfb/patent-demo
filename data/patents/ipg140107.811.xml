<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The invention will be described with reference to various household appliances in the form of a soy milk maker, by way of example. The household appliance of the first embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, comprises a container <b>20</b> for receiving liquid or liquid containing material such as fruits, a rotatable working tool <b>30</b> disposed inside the container <b>20</b>, and a motor for driving the working tool <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The motor comprises a stator <b>40</b> and a rotor <b>50</b>. The stator <b>40</b> is mounted outside the container <b>20</b> and is isolated from the container <b>20</b>. Preferably, the stator <b>40</b> is disposed inside a closed housing <b>70</b> that is disposed above the container <b>20</b>. The stator <b>40</b> comprises stator windings <b>42</b> that are formed as a disc by over molding or other means. The stator windings <b>42</b> are fixed to a stator core <b>44</b>. The motor further comprises other electric components such as a control module <b>46</b> to control the current flow of the stator windings <b>42</b> and/or other electric components, which may be accommodated in the housing <b>70</b> so as to be isolated from the liquid of the container <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The rotor <b>50</b> is received in the container <b>20</b>. The rotor <b>50</b> comprises rotor magnets <b>52</b> and a magnetic conductive member <b>54</b> that is disposed at one side of the rotor magnets <b>52</b> remote from the stator. The rotor magnets <b>52</b> and the magnetic conductive member <b>54</b> form a magnetic body of the rotor <b>50</b>. Preferably, the magnetic body is disc shaped. The rotor magnets <b>52</b> are disposed adjacent but axially spaced from the stator windings <b>42</b>. In this embodiment, the stator windings <b>42</b> and the rotor magnets <b>52</b> are separated by the bottom of the housing <b>70</b>. There is a gap between the bottom and the rotor magnets <b>52</b> to allow the rotor magnets to rotate. The rotor magnets <b>52</b> are axially magnetized. Preferably, four poles are formed in the rotor magnets <b>52</b>. The magnetic flux path is formed by the magnetic conductive member <b>54</b>, the rotor magnets <b>52</b>, the gap between the bottom of the housing <b>70</b> and the rotor magnets <b>52</b>, the stator windings <b>42</b> and the stator core <b>44</b>. When the stator windings <b>42</b> are energized, the rotor <b>50</b> is driven by the stator <b>40</b>. The stator <b>40</b> may comprise one or more sensors for sensing the rotation of the rotor <b>50</b>. Depending on the controller, a sensor may not be required or may be replaced by other means.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The rotor <b>50</b> comprises a rotor shaft <b>56</b> on which the working tool <b>30</b> is fixed. The rotor magnets <b>52</b> and the conductive member <b>54</b> are also fixed to the shaft <b>56</b>. The shaft <b>56</b> is rotatably supported by a bearing <b>58</b> that is mounted to a support member <b>59</b>. Preferably, the bearing <b>58</b> is a water proof bearing. In this embodiment, there is a hood <b>60</b> inside the container <b>20</b>. The hood <b>60</b> is mounted to the top of container <b>20</b> or the bottom of the housing <b>70</b>. The rotor magnets <b>52</b>, the magnetic conductive member <b>54</b>, the rotor shaft <b>56</b>, the support member <b>59</b> and the working tool <b>30</b> are inside the hood <b>60</b>. Through holes are formed in the hood <b>60</b> so that the interior of the hood <b>60</b> is communicated with the interior of the container <b>20</b>. The hood <b>60</b> provides a screen to filter out large particles, such as pieces of the soy beans been ground to form soy milk. The hood <b>60</b> also provides a structure for the fixing of the support member <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, illustrates the support member <b>59</b> which comprises a center ring member <b>592</b> and a plurality of radial ribs <b>594</b> extending outwardly from the ring member <b>592</b>. A mounting hole <b>598</b> is formed in the ring member <b>592</b> for holding the bearing <b>58</b>. Water or brushes can pass through the openings <b>596</b> formed between the ribs <b>594</b> for cleaning the rotor magnets <b>52</b> and the magnetic conductive member <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The hood <b>60</b> is not essential. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a modified support member <b>59</b> in the form of a cage which could be detachably mounted to the bottom of the housing <b>70</b>. The cage shaped support member <b>50</b> also comprises a plurality of openings <b>596</b> for water or brushes to pass through.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the above embodiment, the container <b>20</b> is below the housing <b>70</b>. Alternatively, the container <b>20</b> could be disposed above the housing <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the container <b>20</b> is disposed above and supported by the housing <b>70</b>. The magnets <b>52</b> and the magnetic conductive member <b>54</b> are rotatably supported by a fixed shaft <b>57</b> via a bearing <b>58</b>. The fixed shaft <b>57</b> is fixed to the housing <b>70</b> or the bottom of the container <b>20</b>. The rotor shaft <b>56</b> is fixed to the magnets <b>52</b> and magnetic conductive member <b>54</b>. The rotor shaft <b>56</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is much shorter than the shaft of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the third embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the rotor magnet <b>52</b> is a cylindrical magnet fixed to rotor shaft <b>56</b>. The rotor magnet <b>52</b> is magnetized radially. The stator comprises a recess <b>72</b> for receiving the rotor magnet <b>52</b>. The stator windings <b>42</b> are in ring form and disposed confronting the cylindrical magnet <b>52</b>. The stator is disposed within the closed housing <b>70</b>.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the fourth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the rotor magnet <b>52</b> is a ring magnet. The housing <b>70</b> has a projection that extends out of the bottom of the closed housing <b>70</b> and received inside the ring magnet. The stator windings <b>42</b> and stator core are disposed inside the projection. The rotor magnet <b>52</b> is radially magnetized. A flux ring or magnetic housing could be disposed about the magnet and used to fix the magnet to the shaft. The closed housing <b>70</b> could be disposed below the container <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiments described above, the rotor is disposed in a first chamber formed by the container <b>20</b>. The stator winding <b>42</b>, stator core <b>44</b> and other electric components are disposed in a second chamber formed by the housing <b>70</b>. The second chamber is isolated from the first chamber by a wall to avoid the stator <b>40</b> and the electric components <b>46</b> being affected by moisture from the first chamber. For instance, the wall is formed by the bottom of the housing <b>70</b>. The rotor shaft <b>56</b> does not pass through the wall. The rotor could be made by water proof material, or have water proof coating. Further more, the liquid or liquid containing food inside the container <b>20</b> could be magnetized by the rotor magnet since the rotor magnet <b>52</b> is disposed inside the first chamber formed by the container <b>20</b>.</p>
