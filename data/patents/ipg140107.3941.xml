<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most electronic devices (e.g. computers and mobile phones) have an image capturing function. Some electronic devices have more than one camera module for capturing images having different resolutions, and each camera module includes a lens module and an image sensor. The image sensor is expensive. Therefore, the cost of the electronic device is increased.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, an electronic device <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment, includes a main body <b>10</b> and an image capturing device <b>20</b>. The electronic device <b>100</b> may be a mobile phone, a PDA, a computer, or the like. In this embodiment, the electronic device <b>100</b> is a mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The main body <b>10</b> is substantially cuboid, and includes a front surface <b>11</b>, a rear surface <b>12</b>, a top surface <b>13</b> and a bottom surface <b>14</b>, and two side surfaces <b>15</b>. The two side surfaces <b>15</b> connect the front surface <b>11</b>, the rear surface <b>12</b>, the top surface <b>13</b>, and the bottom surface <b>14</b>. A display <b>30</b> is arranged on the front surface <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this embodiment, the image capturing device <b>20</b> is arranged above and to the left of the display <b>30</b>. The top surface <b>13</b> defines a first cutout <b>131</b> and a second cutout <b>132</b> to accommodate the image capturing device <b>20</b>. Each of the first cutout <b>131</b> and the second cutout <b>132</b> includes a base surface <b>131</b><i>a </i>parallel to the top surface <b>13</b>. A protrusion <b>133</b> is formed between the first cutout <b>131</b> and the second cutout <b>132</b>. The protrusion <b>133</b> defines a blind hole <b>133</b><i>a </i>perpendicular to the base surface <b>131</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The image capturing device <b>20</b> includes a rotating plate <b>21</b>, a fixing pole <b>22</b>, a first lens module <b>23</b>, a second lens module <b>24</b>, and an image sensor <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The rotating plate <b>21</b> defines a through hole <b>211</b> and two mounting holes <b>212</b>. The two mounting holes <b>212</b> are symmetrically arranged on opposite sides of the through hole <b>211</b>. The center of the through hole <b>211</b> and the centers of the two mounting holes <b>212</b> are on one straight line.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fixing pole <b>22</b> is substantially a hollow cylinder, and includes a first portion <b>221</b> and a second portion <b>222</b> extending from the first portion <b>221</b>. The diameter of the first portion <b>221</b> is larger than that of the second portion <b>222</b> and the through hole <b>211</b>. The diameter of the second portion <b>222</b> is slightly smaller than that of the through hole <b>211</b>, and thus the rotating plate <b>21</b> can rotate in the second portion <b>222</b>. The second portion <b>222</b> extends through the through hole <b>211</b> to be inserted in the blind hole <b>133</b><i>a</i>, and thus the fixing pole <b>22</b> is fixed on the main body <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the blind hole <b>133</b><i>a </i>is substantially cylindrical, and the fixing pole <b>22</b> is screwed into the blind hole <b>133</b><i>a</i>. In other embodiments, the fixing pole <b>22</b> is an interference fit in the blind hole <b>133</b><i>a</i>. Other manners of fixing can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The fixing pole <b>22</b> defines a receiving groove <b>223</b> for receiving other accessories <b>224</b> (such as a stylus), and thus the configuration of the electronic device <b>100</b> can be more compact.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The first lens module <b>23</b> and the second lens module <b>24</b> are respectively fixed on or to the two mounting holes <b>212</b>, so as to be fixed on the rotating plate <b>21</b>. The first lens module <b>23</b> includes a barrel <b>231</b> and a first lens unit <b>232</b> received in the first barrel <b>231</b>. The second lens module <b>24</b> includes a second barrel <b>241</b> and a second lens module <b>242</b> received in the second barrel <b>241</b>. In this embodiment, the first barrel <b>231</b> includes a hollow cylindrical first fixing portion <b>231</b><i>a</i>. The second barrel <b>241</b> includes a hollow cylindrical second fixing portion <b>241</b><i>a</i>. The first lens unit <b>232</b> is mounted in the first fixing portion <b>231</b><i>a</i>, and the external diameter of the first fixing portion <b>231</b><i>a </i>is slightly smaller than the internal diameter of the mounting hole <b>212</b>. The second lens unit <b>242</b> is mounted in the second fixing portion <b>241</b><i>a</i>, and the external diameter of the second fixing portion <b>241</b><i>a </i>is slightly smaller than the internal diameter of the mounting hole <b>212</b>. In other embodiments, glue or some other fixative method may be used to secure the first lens module <b>23</b> and the second lens module <b>24</b> to the rotating plate <b>21</b>. The protrusion <b>133</b> is substantially oval in cross section, to facilitate the rotation of the plate <b>21</b>, and to ensure the correct orientation in use of the first lens module <b>23</b> and the second lens module <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The image sensor <b>25</b> is arranged on or in the base surface <b>131</b><i>a </i>or the second cutout <b>132</b>. The base surface <b>131</b><i>a </i>defines a receiving groove <b>131</b><i>b</i>. In the illustrated embodiment, the receiving groove <b>131</b><i>b </i>is a square, stepped depression. The image sensor <b>25</b> is arranged on the bottom of the receiving groove <b>131</b><i>b</i>, and a glass plate <b>26</b> covers and seals the image sensor <b>25</b>. The image sensor <b>25</b> can be a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) or a CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first lens module <b>23</b> has a large aperture which allows more light to pass through. Therefore, a greater number of the image pixels of the image sensor <b>25</b> can be activated to form a first image having a higher resolution. The second lens module <b>24</b> has a smaller aperture which allows less light to pass through, therefore a smaller number of the image pixels of the image sensor <b>25</b> can be activated to form a second image having a lower resolution. Thus, by aligning one or other of the lens modules with the image sensor <b>25</b>, images of the same object or scene but with different resolutions can be captured.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In use, if a user wants a high resolution image, he/she can rotate the rotating plate <b>21</b> to align the first lens module <b>23</b> with the image sensor <b>25</b> and then capture the image with the electronic device <b>100</b>. If the user wants to capture a lower resolution image, he/she can rotate the rotating plate <b>21</b> to align the second lens module <b>24</b> with the image sensor <b>25</b> and capture the image with the electronic device <b>100</b>. The mounting of the first lens module <b>23</b> and the second lens module <b>24</b> will be secure and the precise orientation of each lens module will be maintained at all points during the rotation and after any rotation of the plate <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The electronic device <b>100</b> having two interchangeable lens modules <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> and one image sensor <b>25</b>, the two lens modules can be alternated as desired and the omission of an image sensor with respect to the current electronic device will reduce the cost of the electronic device <b>100</b>.</p>
