<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a process for the production of a lignocellulose-containing material, in which, based in each case on the lignocellulose-containing material:
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0003">A) from 30 to 95% by weight of lignocellulose particles;</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0007">are mixed and are then pressed at elevated temperature and under elevated pressure, wherein the component B) comprises a formaldehyde scavenger.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0008">The sum of the components A), B), C) and optionally D) is 100%.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0009">The present invention furthermore relates to a process for the production of a multilayer lignocellulose material, the lignocellulose-containing material, a multilayer lignocellulose material and the use of a lignocellulose-containing material and of a multilayer lignocellulose material, in each case as defined in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0010">Lignocellulose materials, for example wood-base materials, in particular multilayer wood-base materials, are an economical and resource-protecting alternative to solid wood and have become very important, particularly in furniture construction, in the case of laminate floors and as construction materials. Starting materials used are usually wood particles of different thicknesses, for example wood chips or wood fibers of various timbers. Such wood particles are usually pressed with natural and/or synthetic binders and optionally with addition of further additives to give board- or strand-like wood-base materials.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0011">The production of such lignocellulose materials, for example wood-base materials, is known and is described, for example, in M. Dunky, P. Niemz, Holzwerkstoffe und Leime, Springer 2002, pages 91-155.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0012">Usually, lignocellulose particles, for example wood chips or wood fibers, are treated with so-called binders, for example aminoplast resins or phenol-formaldehyde resins, and compressed in a press at elevated temperature and cured.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0013">The corresponding moldings, for example particle boards or fiber boards, may emit formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is undesired in the environment. Its emission, for example from wood-base materials, should therefore be reduced as far as possible or even completely prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">Usually, a so-called formaldehyde scavenger, for example chemical compounds having amine or amide groups or sulfur groups, which binds with formaldehyde and thus reduces or prevents the emission of formaldehyde, is added to the formaldehyde-containing binders for this purpose. However, such added formaldehyde scavengers have the disadvantage that they delay the curing of the formaldehyde-containing glue, which in turn has disadvantageous effects on the cost-efficiency of the production of the wood-base materials and/or adversely affects the mechanical properties thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">For many applications, for example in the bathroom furniture sector or generally in construction, in humid climates, lignocellulose materials having improved mechanical properties, for example improved transverse tensile strength, and lower water absorption or swelling values are sought. Such wood-base materials, too, should have as low a formaldehyde emission as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">The prior art contains proposals for modifying wood-base materials by additions of filler polymers to the glue or to the wood particles.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0017">Thus, DE 20 2007 017 713 U1 describes a weight-reduced particle board by combination of wood chips and uniformly distributed foamed polystyrene beads in the middle layer of the particle board.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">The polystyrene can be used as a carrier of additives, such as formaldehyde scavengers, accelerators and flameproofing agents. The accelerators added to the polystyrene can have a positive effect on the process speed. Formaldehyde scavengers, accelerators and flameproofing agents are generically named.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">The object of the present invention was to provide lignocellulose-containing, preferably wood-containing, materials and lignocellulose materials, preferably wood-base materials, having improved mechanical properties and low water absorption and swelling values but still having good processing properties, such as conventional wood-base materials of the same density, which however have a reduced formaldehyde emission or even virtually no formaldehyde emission.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">The object was achieved by a process for the production of a lignocellulose-containing material, in which, based in each case on the lignocellulose-containing material:

<p id="p-0050" num="0057">The adhesion of the formaldehyde scavenger I) to the plastic particles on which component B) is based takes place for example as a result of the intrinsic adhesive properties of the formaldehyde scavengers I) or by virtue of the fact that the formaldehyde scavengers thicken, polymerize or undergo polycondensation and, for example, cure during or after said bringing into contact.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0076">The expanded plastic particles on which component B) is based are usually obtained as follows: compact plastic particles which comprise an expandable medium (also referred to as &#x201c;blowing agent&#x201d;) are expanded by the action of heat energy or pressure change (often also designated as &#x201c;foamed&#x201d;). The blowing agent expands thereby, the particles increase in size and cell structures form.</p>
