<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention will now be described more specifically with reference to the following embodiments. It is to be noted that the following descriptions of preferred embodiments of this invention are presented herein for purpose of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to be limited to the precise form disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">First of all, a charge sharing function is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which schematically illustrates a control circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention. The control circuit <b>10</b> is used in a flat panel display and includes a power supply unit <b>12</b>, a data driver <b>14</b>, and a timing controller <b>16</b>. The power supply unit <b>12</b> is a low dropout regulator (hereinafter, LDO) with a voltage output pin <b>120</b> being electrically connected to the timing controller <b>16</b>. According to the specification of LDO, the voltage output pin <b>120</b> is defined with Pin No. <b>25</b>, for providing a logic signal V_<b>25</b> to the timing controller <b>16</b>. The voltage level of the logic level V_<b>25</b> is V<b>25</b> (about 2.5 volts).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The control circuit <b>10</b> controls the driving and switching of M&#xd7;N pixel units of the display <b>2</b>. It is to be noted that only N pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>, P<sub>N</sub>) disposed in one row are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where N is a positive integer, and similar descriptions are applicable to other rows of pixel units. In each of the pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>, P<sub>N</sub>), a capacitor is included for storing charges.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In more detail, the data driver <b>14</b> is electrically connected to the N pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>, P<sub>N</sub>) via the N data lines (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, . . . D<sub>N-1</sub>, D<sub>N</sub>), respectively. With the N data lines, the data driver <b>14</b> is capable of driving the N pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>, P<sub>N</sub>) to accumulate or release charges stored in the corresponding capacitors, resulting in displaying or changing of images.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the numbers assigned, the N data lines (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, . . . D<sub>N-1</sub>, D<sub>N</sub>) can be classified as two sets, that is, a set of odd-numbered data lines (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, . . . DN-<sub>1</sub>), and another set of even-numbered data lines (D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>4</sub>, . . . D<sub>N</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the control circuit <b>10</b>, the odd-numbered data lines (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, . . . D<sub>N-1</sub>) are with an identical polarity in a duration while the even-numbered data lines (D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>4</sub>, . . . D<sub>N</sub>) are with the opposite polarity in the same duration. For example, the polarities of the odd-numbered data lines (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, . . . D<sub>N-1</sub>) are positive, and the polarities of the even-numbered data lines (D<sub>2</sub><img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="2.12mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US08624887-20140107-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> D<sub>4</sub><img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="2.12mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US08624887-20140107-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> . . . <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003" he="2.12mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US08624887-20140107-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> D<sub>N</sub>) are negative in a certain duration. The polarities of the two sets of data lines are exchanged in the next duration. Charge sharing functions are performed during the polarity swapping of the N data lines (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, . . . D<sub>N-1</sub>, D<sub>N</sub>) or the pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, a first switch set <b>18</b> is included in the control circuit, and includes (N&#x2212;1) switches (S<b>1</b><sub>1</sub>, S<b>1</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . S<b>1</b><sub>N-1</sub>), wherein two terminals of each switch are electrically connected to adjacent two of the N data lines (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, . . . D<sub>N-1</sub>, D<sub>N</sub>), respectively. For instance, the two terminals of the switch S<b>1</b><sub>1 </sub>are electrically connected to the data line D<b>1</b> and data line D<b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each of the switches (S<b>1</b><sub>1</sub>, S<b>1</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . , S<b>1</b><sub>N-1</sub>) is further coupled to a first control signal STB generated and outputted from the timing controller <b>16</b> for switching on the switches (S<b>1</b><sub>1</sub>, S<b>1</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . , S<b>1</b><sub>N-1</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the N data lines (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, . . . D<sub>N-1</sub>, D<sub>N</sub>) or the N pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>, P<sub>N</sub>) change their polarities, the voltage levels of the N data lines are also changed (or the charges stored in the N capacitors of the N pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>, P<sub>N</sub>) are re-allocated). In other words, some of the N capacitors of the N pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>, P<sub>N</sub>) are charged and some are discharged. As a result, the charges stored in the capacitors of the N pixel units can be shared. Therefore, the power consumption during polarity swapping driven by the data driver <b>14</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which schematically illustrates the voltage changes of a capacitor in a pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>of the flat panel display as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the polarity of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>is negative in the duration T<sub>GSD-1 </sub>and the voltage level representing the charges accumulated at capacitor of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>is V<sub>L</sub>. Afterwards, the polarity changes into positive one and the voltage level representing the charges accumulated at the capacitor of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>is V<sub>H </sub>for duration T<sub>GSD-2</sub>. If no charge sharing function is exhibited, the data driver <b>14</b> is required to charge the capacitor of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>from negative (V<sub>L</sub>) to positive (V<sub>H</sub>) for accumulating charges so as to change the polarity of the pixel unit P<sub>Q</sub>. The power consumption caused by charging the capacitor of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>is positively relative to (V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>L</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With charge sharing function, the timing controller <b>16</b> generates and outputs the first control signal STB at a high level for duration T<sub>CS-1 </sub>to switch on the (N&#x2212;1) switches (S<b>1</b><sub>1</sub>, S<b>1</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . S<b>1</b><sub>N-1</sub>) so that the charges stored in the N capacitors of the N pixel units are re-allocated. Accordingly, the voltage levels associated with the N pixel units are balanced and, for example, all reach an intermediate voltage level V<sub>COM</sub>. As a result, the power consumed by the polarity swapping of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>(i.e. from negative (V<sub>L</sub>) to positive (V<sub>H</sub>)) is positively relative to (V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>COM</sub>). It is apparent that the power consumption is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Likewise, the polarity of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>is positive in duration T<sub>GSD-2 </sub>and negative in duration T<sub>GSD-3</sub>. When the polarity of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>changes from &#x201c;positive&#x201d; to &#x201c;negative&#x201d;, the timing controller <b>16</b> generates and outputs the first control signal STB at high level again for duration T<sub>CS-2 </sub>for switching on the (N&#x2212;1) switches (S<b>1</b><sub>1</sub>, S<b>1</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . S<b>1</b><sub>N-1</sub>). Accordingly, the charges stored in the capacitors of the N pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>, P<sub>N</sub>) are re-allocated to result in a balanced voltage level V<sub>COM</sub>. Thus for changing the polarity of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>from &#x201c;positive&#x201d; (V<sub>H</sub>) to &#x201c;negative&#x201d; (V<sub>L</sub>), it is only required to discharge the capacitor of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>as a voltage change from V<sub>COM </sub>to V<sub>L</sub>. Desirably, the discharged energy is also made use of.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition to a first switch set <b>18</b> similar to that described above, the control circuit <b>20</b> further includes a second switch set <b>24</b> consisting of odd-numbered switches (S<b>2</b><sub>1</sub>, S<sub>23</sub>, . . .

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this embodiment, the timing controller <b>26</b> is electrically connected to both the first switch set <b>18</b> and the second switch set <b>24</b>.

S<b>2</b><sub>N-1</sub>) in the second switch set <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a signal waveform diagram illustrating the voltage changes of a capacitor in one of the odd-numbered pixel units of the flat panel display as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The polarity of the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>is positive (V<sub>H</sub>) in duration T<sub>GSD-1</sub>. In duration T<sub>CS-1</sub>, the first switch control signal STB generated and outputted by the timing controller <b>26</b> is at a high level so as to conduct the switches (S<b>1</b><sub>1</sub>, S<b>1</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . S<b>1</b><sub>N-1</sub>). Accordingly, the charges stored in the N capacitors in N pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>, P<sub>N</sub>) are shared. As a result, the voltage level of the charges stored in the capacitor in the pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>is a balanced voltage level V<sub>COM</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Subsequently, in response to a high level of the second control signal S<b>1</b> generated and outputted by the timing controller <b>26</b>, the switches (S<b>2</b><sub>1</sub>, S<b>2</b><sub>3</sub>, . . . S<b>2</b><sub>N-1</sub>) are switched on in duration T<sub>VCS-1</sub>. The odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>) and the voltage output pin <b>120</b> share charges so that the charges stored in the capacitors of the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>) are re-allocated. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the power supply unit <b>12</b> outputs the logic signal V_<b>25</b>, which is at a voltage level V<b>25</b> (about 2.5 volts), to the timing controller <b>26</b>. While the polarities of the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>n-1</sub>) are changing from positive ones to negative ones in duration T<sub>VCS-1</sub>, the capacitors in the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>n-1</sub>) discharge via the voltage output pin <b>120</b> of the power supply unit <b>12</b> so as to reach the voltage level V<b>25</b>. Meanwhile, receiving the recycled charges from the capacitors, power consumption for outputting logic signal V_<b>25</b> from the power supply unit <b>12</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Afterwards, the charges stored in the capacitor in pixel unit P<sub>Q </sub>are further discharged in duration T<sub>GSD-2 </sub>until the voltage level drops from V<b>25</b> to V<sub>L </sub>so as to complete the conversion of polarity from positive one to negative one.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The voltage level of the plurality of capacitors in the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>), after charge sharing, is desirably a sufficiently high level so that the charges from the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>) can be effectively recycled to the voltage output pin <b>120</b>. On the other hand, if the voltage level representing the averaged gray level of the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>) is lower than the voltage level V<b>25</b>, the charge flow from the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>) to the voltage output pin <b>120</b> cannot be performed, and thus no power saving can be accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Therefore, it is preferred that an averaged gray level of the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>) is calculated and compared with a threshold. If the averaged gray level is lower than the threshold, it is indicated that voltage level indicative of the averaged gray level is higher than the desired value. Then the high level of the second control signal S<b>1</b> is entered to enable the charge recycling.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a plot schematically illustrating the change of an output duration of a control signal with an averaged gray level of the odd-numbered pixel units, wherein the reference L<b>31</b> is exemplified as the threshold as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It can be seen from the figure that the averaged gray level higher than the threshold L<b>31</b> is directed to a relatively low voltage level of the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>) insufficient for recycling. As a result, the timing controller <b>26</b> does not output the second control signal S<b>1</b> at the high level. In other words, the second control signal S<b>1</b> will not enter the high level, and the output duration T of the high-level second control signal S<b>1</b> is zero.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">On the other hand, if the timing controller <b>26</b> determines that the averaged gray level of the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>) is less than the threshold L<b>31</b>, it is inferred that the averaged voltage level of the charges stored in the capacitors of the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>) is relatively high (e.g. greater than 2.5 volts). Hence charges are recycled from the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>) to the voltage output pin <b>120</b>, and the timing controller <b>26</b> outputs the second control signal S<b>1</b> at the high level for an output duration T which varies with the averaged gray level</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For instance, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for the averaged gray levels less than threshold L<b>31</b>, the lower the averaged gray level, the more charges are accumulated in the capacitors in the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>). Therefore, it takes longer for the pixel units to discharge via the voltage output pin <b>120</b> in response to a longer output duration T of the high-level second control signal S<b>1</b>. Specifically, the duration that the second control signal S<b>1</b> is at the high level, i.e. the output duration T, is inversely proportional to the averaged gray level of the odd-numbered pixel units (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, . . . P<sub>N-1</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the present invention, the control circuit <b>20</b> may further includes a third switch set <b>28</b> including even-numbered switches (S<b>3</b><sub>2</sub>, S<b>3</b><sub>4</sub>, . . . S<b>3</b><sub>N</sub>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. First terminals of the switches (S<b>3</b><sub>2</sub>, S<b>3</b><sub>4</sub>, . . . S<b>3</b><sub>N</sub>) in the third switch set are electrically connected to the voltage output pin <b>120</b> in parallel, and second terminals of the switches are electrically connected to the even-numbered data lines (D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>4</sub>, . . . D<sub>N</sub>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Likewise, the charges stored in the capacitors in these pixel units (P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>4</sub>, . . . P<sub>N</sub>) are recycled via the voltage output pin <b>120</b> to the power supply unit <b>12</b>. The operations of the third switch set <b>28</b> are similar to those of the second switch set <b>24</b>. For instance, the second terminal of switch S<b>3</b><sub>2 </sub>is electrically connected to the data line D<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, the third switching signal S<b>2</b> generated and outputted from the timing controller <b>26</b> is used to switch on/off the even-numbered switches (S<b>3</b><sub>2</sub>, S<b>3</b><sub>4</sub>, . . . S<b>3</b><sub>N</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In summary, the control circuit provided by the present invention is managed to reduce power consumption of the flat panel display. The charges stored in the capacitors in the pixel units can be shared and recycled via the specific voltage output pin of the power supply unit while the polarities of the N pixel units is swapping.</p>
