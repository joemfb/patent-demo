<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">As materials used in semiconductor processes advance, line spacing and line widths of conductors formed by electrochemical plating (ECP) and chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) are reduced. When material is formed by ECP and CMP to form conductors, problems such as gap filling, voids and pattern resolution (poor line quality) may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">To form conductive patterns on a semiconductor substrate using ECP, for each one of several metal layers to be formed over the semiconductor substrate, a dielectric layer is deposited over the semiconductor substrate. Using photolithography a conductor pattern for the selected metal layer is formed in a photoresist layer formed over the dielectric layer. An etch step is then performed on the underlying dielectric layer using the patterned photoresist as an etch mask to form patterned trenches. After the dielectric layer is etched, the photoresist is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">ECP may then be performed to deposit the conductive material into the trenches. In ECP, the substrate with the patterned dielectric layer is placed in an electrolyte electroplating bath solution, for example to electroplate copper conductors; the bath is acid copper sulfate solution. A sacrificial anode and the semiconductor substrate are immersed in the solution with the semiconductor substrate electrically coupled to act as a cathode. An electric potential is applied and the copper conductor material is drawn to the substrate by current flowing between the anode and the cathode terminals, and the conductor material is electroplated filling the trenches. The ECP process continues until the trenches in the dielectric are filled, and then overfilled, with the conductor material. This is referred to as an &#x201c;overburden&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">CMP is then used to remove the overburden conductor material from the substrate surface until the upper surface of the dielectric layer is exposed between the trenches, and the patterned conductors then remain in the trenches within the dielectric layer. This ECP and CMP process is performed for each metal layer formed over the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Following the ECP and CMP processes, a uniform conductor thickness is desired with a planar upper surface. However, in actual practice the thickness uniformity of the conductor material following the ECP process (post-ECP) varies across the semiconductor substrate. The thickness of the ECP plated conductor layer is known to be affected by the conductor pattern being formed (pattern density). The pattern density causes non-uniform current density during plating, resulting in areas where the post-ECP thickness is higher than in other areas. When this higher thickness area is observed in a post-ECP inspection of the conductor material on the substrate, it is often called a &#x201c;hump.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In semiconductor processing, the post-ECP and post-CMP results are examined using &#x201c;hump data&#x201d; maps of semiconductor wafers. The post-ECP hump data map illustrates areas on a semiconductor substrate that have non-uniform thickness in the conductor layer after the ECP (that is, the hump data map provides a visual representation of where the &#x201c;humps&#x201d; occur in the conductor thickness). Hump data maps may also be used after CMP processes (referred to as post-CMP hump data maps) to identify areas where the surface of the planarized dielectric and conductor material is non-uniform after CMP.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently computer simulation models for both the ECP and CMP processes have been developed. These simulators are referred to herein as virtual ECP (V-ECP) and virtual CMP (V-CMP). However, the predicted hump data maps obtained using the existing V-ECP simulators do not accurately track the actual post-ECP results obtained.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The making and using of the illustrative example embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that an illustrative embodiment provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely examples used to describe specific ways to make and use the embodiments, and these examples do not limit the scope of this description and do not limit the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As a brief summary, in one aspect, the present invention provides for a method, the method including receiving layout data for an IC design to be manufactured on a semiconductor wafer with patterned conductors formed in an electrochemical plating (ECP) process, and extracting layout data from the received layout data corresponding to at least one metal layer. The method further includes determining from the extracted layout data a layout effects factor for each of a plurality of unit grid areas covering the semiconductor wafer, the layout effects factor corresponding to one selected from a line edge density and a pattern density for the at least one metal layer in the unit grid area, and determining from the extracted layout data a global effects factor corresponding to a global pattern density for the at least one metal layer over a total area of the semiconductor wafer. The method further includes determining from the extracted layout data a local effects factor for each of the unit grid areas, the local effects factor corresponding to a local pattern density for the at least one metal layer over an area of the semiconductor wafer within a local grid area larger than, and surrounding, the corresponding unit grid area, and using a computing device, performing an ECP simulation configured to predict post-ECP plating hump heights in the at least one metal layer for each one of the unit grid areas, the ECP simulation using at least one of the global effects factor and the local effects factor as inputs, and using the layout effects factor as an input. The method further includes outputting a predicted post-ECP hump data map for the semiconductor wafer from the ECP simulation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another aspect, the present invention provides for a method, the method including using a computing device having a non-transitory computer memory storing executable programs, performing the steps of (a) retrieving layout data from the non-transitory computer memory for a design to be manufactured using an electrochemical plating (ECP) process forming patterned conductors in at least one metal layer over a semiconductor wafer, (b) determining from the layout data, for each one of a plurality of unit grid areas covering the semiconductor wafer, a layout effects factor corresponding to one selected from a line edge density and a conductor pattern density in the at least one metal layer in the unit grid area, (c) determining from the layout data a global effects factor corresponding to a total area of the metal layer on the semiconductor wafer over a total area of the semiconductor wafer, an (d) determining from the layout data a local effects factor for each of the unit grid areas, the local effects factor corresponding to a local pattern density of the at least one metal layer over a the surface area of a local area that is larger than and includes the corresponding unit grid area.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In yet other aspects, the present invention provides for a non-transitory computer readable medium containing executable instructions that, when executed by a computing device, cause the computing device to perform the following actions: retrieving layout data from the non-transitory computer readable medium for forming patterned conductors in at least one metal layer over a semiconductor wafer in an electrochemical plating (ECP) process; determining from the lout data a global effects factor corresponding to the total area in the at least one metal layer on the semiconductor wafer over a total area of the semiconductor wafer; determining from the layout data a layout effects factor for each of a plurality of unit grid areas covering the semiconductor wafer, the layout effects factor corresponding to the pattern density of the at least one metal layer; determining from the layout data a local effects factor for each unit grid area, each local effects factor corresponding to the total area of the at least one metal layer over the area of the semiconductor wafer in a local area that is larger than and includes the corresponding unit grid area using the computing device, executing an ECP simulation using at least one of the global effects factor and the local effects factor, and using the layout effects factor for each unit grid area, to predict the post-ECP hump height of the at least one metal layer for each unit grid area storing in the non-transitory computer readable medium an predicted post-ECP hump data map output from the ECP simulation; responsive to the post-ECP hump data map, modifying the layout for the at least one metal layer; and outputting a photomask generation file for the at least one metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In forming conductors for integrated circuits, several metallization layers are formed over the substrate, each separated from the adjacent metallization layers by interlevel dielectric material. These metallization layers are usually referred to in order starting from the surface of the substrate as metal <b>0</b>, metal <b>1</b>, etc. In forming the metallization layers, each metal level is formed using both ECP and CMP processes. The ECP process plates the conductor material for each metal layer into trenches formed in a corresponding intermetal dielectric layer, and the CMP process then removes excess overburden conductor material from the intermetal dielectric layer until the surface of the dielectric material is exposed. The finished conductors are conductor lines within filled trenches in the intermetal dielectric material. This series of process steps using ECP and CMP is performed for each metal layer metal <b>0</b>, metal <b>1</b> etc. formed over the semiconductor substrate. The metal layers are separated vertically by interlevel dielectric layers. Copper is typically used as the conductor material, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts in a cross sectional view a photomask <b>22</b> (also referred to as a reticle) being used in a photolithography system <b>1</b> to form a pattern for a metal layer to be plated. The pattern from photomask <b>22</b> is transferred to a photoresist layer <b>7</b>, which overlies a dielectric layer <b>5</b>. Dielectric layer <b>5</b> is shown deposited on a semiconductor substrate <b>3</b>. Dielectric layer <b>5</b> is formed from an appropriate intermetal dielectric material, such as high-k and low-k dielectric materials, silicon dioxide, oxide, nitrides and the like. Although a single dielectric layer <b>5</b> is shown over substrate <b>3</b> for simplicity in the illustration, in a practical device many intervening metal and interlevel dielectric layers are formed over substrate <b>3</b> and dielectric layer <b>5</b> includes these layers. A light source <b>20</b>, which is selected from sources such as visible light or laser, or other energy source depending on the light sensitivity of the particular photoresist <b>7</b>, is energized and the light energy is focused by lens <b>24</b> onto photomask <b>22</b>. An imaging system <b>21</b> then is used to further focus the optical pattern from the photomask <b>22</b> onto the photoresist layer <b>7</b>, thereby exposing the photoresist <b>7</b> through the pattern on mask <b>22</b>. After the exposure of the photoresist <b>7</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pattern on the photomask <b>22</b> creates exposed and unexposed areas in the photoresist layer <b>7</b> which correspond to the patterns on the photomask <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The photoresist <b>7</b> is then developed using a chemical developer, and the unexposed portion of photoresist <b>7</b> is removed, leaving a patterned photoresist layer <b>7</b>. Etching of the dielectric layer <b>5</b> may then be performed using the patterned photoresist <b>7</b> as an etch mask. Photoresist <b>7</b> is then removed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts in a cross sectional view the patterned dielectric layer <b>5</b> over the substrate <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, after the etch process described above has been performed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is simplified for explanation and it is to be understood that the device may include many levels of dielectric and metal layers included in the patterned dielectric layer <b>5</b> including gates, contacts, vias and other conductors, and that the substrate <b>3</b> may include active device regions such as source/drain regions formed as diffused portions of a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, patterned areas <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> are shown formed in the dielectric layer <b>5</b> after the etch step described above. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each patterned area <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> illustrates an example that has a different pattern density. Patterned area <b>2</b> illustrates an example where there is fairly high pattern density, that is, the conductor patterns fill most of the surface area in patterned area <b>2</b>. In patterned area <b>2</b>, several trenches <b>11</b> are formed which will be filled with conductor material in a subsequent ECP process, described below. Line width w<b>11</b> (the widths of trenches <b>11</b> in patterned area <b>2</b>) is relatively large, and the line spacing (the width of the dark areas in the dielectric material between trenches <b>11</b> in patterned area <b>2</b>) is comparatively small with respect to the line width w<b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Patterned area <b>4</b> illustrates another pattern example. In patterned area <b>4</b>, the line widths (the widths of trenches <b>13</b>) are smaller than widths w<b>11</b> for the trenches <b>11</b> in patterned area <b>2</b>, and the trench widths for trenches <b>13</b> in patterned area <b>4</b> are about equal to the line spacing (the width of the dielectric layer <b>5</b> separating the trenches <b>13</b>). Patterned area <b>6</b> illustrates an area with very high pattern density. In patterned area <b>6</b>, there is one single very wide trench <b>15</b> with width w<b>15</b>. In this patterned area <b>6</b>, almost all of the available surface area is covered by conductor material. Patterned area <b>8</b> illustrates a pattern of very fine conductor lines. Trenches <b>17</b> have relatively small width in the dielectric layer <b>5</b> and greater line spacing (the dielectric spacing between the trenches <b>17</b> is larger than in other patterned areas). Patterned area <b>9</b> illustrates trenches <b>19</b> with relatively large trench widths w<b>19</b>, and the trench spacing (dielectric layer <b>5</b> in patterned area <b>9</b> between trenches <b>19</b>) is less than the trench width w<b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In forming conductors in the trenches <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> in the patterned areas <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, such as, for example, copper conductors formed by ECP, the photomask such as <b>22</b> used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> above will determine the trench pattern to be formed in the dielectric layer <b>5</b>. A conductor pattern will then be formed as described below by using the ECP process to electroplate conductor material into the trenches <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to form the conductor lines of a metal layer. These steps will be performed for each layer of metal, metal <b>0</b>, metal <b>1</b> etc. There may be 4, 5, 6, 7 or more layers of metal for an integrated circuit produced on a semiconductor substrate (for example, a semiconductor wafer) in some embodiments of an advanced semiconductor process. The ECP and CMP processes described herein are performed for each of these metal layers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates substrate <b>3</b> and dielectric layer <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in a cross-sectional view following an ECP process. Copper or other conductor material <b>10</b> is formed by electroplating and is shown filling the trenches <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> in the patterned areas <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> in the dielectric layer <b>5</b> respectively, and the conductor layer <b>10</b> is shown overfilling the trenches to cover the upper surface of dielectric <b>5</b>. The material in copper layer <b>10</b> that overlies the upper surface of the dielectric layer <b>5</b> is the overburden.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the resulting thickness of the conductor <b>10</b> plated onto the substrate and the dielectric layer <b>5</b> varies in the different patterned areas <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> with the height of the conductor <b>10</b> over the surface of the dielectric layer <b>5</b> shown as height H<b>2</b>, H<b>4</b>, H<b>6</b>, H<b>8</b> and H<b>9</b>, respectively. As can be observed from the varying heights obtained for the conductor layer <b>10</b> after ECP, the height results obtained from the ECP process are affected by the differences in the trench patterns in the dielectric layer <b>5</b>. At patterned area <b>2</b>, the large line width and relatively fine space between the trenches results in peaks of a height H<b>2</b> forming in layer <b>10</b>. At patterned area <b>4</b>, a higher hump of height H<b>4</b> is seen where fine conductor trenches are filled with fine spacing between them. At patterned area <b>6</b>, the height H<b>6</b> of layer <b>10</b> is more uniform and lowered across patterned area <b>6</b> compared to patterned area <b>4</b>. Layer <b>10</b> in patterned area <b>6</b> has a greater pattern density than in the other patterned areas. In patterned area <b>6</b>, most of the available area s covered in conductor material, due to the use of a single wide trench filled with conductor. At patterned area <b>8</b>, layer <b>10</b> shows peaks of height H<b>8</b> where there is a relatively fine trench width with a larger spacing between the trenches. At patterned area <b>9</b>, there is a peak of height H<b>9</b> over the space between two wide trenches.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates that the line widths and line spacing of the conductor line patterns being formed by ECP in an area of the semiconductor substrate <b>3</b> affects the hump heights obtained during the ECP process, and thus the conductor line patterns being formed will affect the post ECP hump data map following the ECP process. Variations in the post-ECP hump height of conductor <b>10</b> are caused by the conductor patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates in a cross-section the post-ECP results of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, with a predetermined user defined hump height threshold Hth shown as a dashed line across the cross-section of each of the patterned areas <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, there are some hump heights that exceed the threshold Hth. For example, H<b>4</b> in patterned area <b>4</b> and H<b>8</b> in patterned area <b>8</b> exceed the threshold Hth. In an embodiment method, described below, the threshold Hth is user selected, and patterned areas with hump heights greater than that threshold are identified as &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After the ECP process is complete, a CMP process is performed on the conductor layer <b>10</b> to remove the portion of the layer <b>10</b> that is above the upper surface of the dielectric layer <b>5</b>, the overburden portion. Post-CMP results obtained on ECP layers with large hump height variations, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are not uniformly planar. The CMP process used to polish the post-ECP layer <b>10</b> down to be co-planar with the upper surface of the dielectric layer <b>5</b> can result in problems, for example, when removing high humps in layer <b>10</b> in one patterned area, the CMP process may remove more of the layer <b>10</b> material than is desired, due to over-polishing of other patterned areas. Large metal pattern areas are sometimes polished below the desired co-planar surface of the dielectric layer and scoops or &#x201c;dishing&#x201d; can occur. This dishing problem is further accentuated when the dielectric layers used are &#x201c;low-k&#x201d; dielectric material which is relatively soft and more susceptible to over polishing.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">By modifying the conductor line patterns for a metal layer to be formed by ECP (and CMP as described below), a more uniform conductor thickness can be obtained with lower variation in hump height. The hump height variations in a particular patterned area are determined by the current density during electroplating. If the current density during ECP is non-uniform across the semiconductor substrate, then non-uniform hump heights result. The conductor line patterns in the dielectric layer contribute to the non-uniformity in the current density during electroplating. By modifying the layout of the conductor line patterns, the current density during plating can be made more uniform and the post-ECP hump heights may also be made more uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates in a cross-section the results of ECP after a modification to the patterned areas <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> by adding dummy conductor lines. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, dummy trenches <b>13</b>D and <b>17</b>D are added to the patterned areas <b>4</b> and <b>8</b>. The dummy conductor lines are added by modifying the layout for the selected metal layer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the hump height H<b>4</b>&#x2032; illustrates an improvement where the hump height in patterned area <b>4</b> after ECP is lowered by the use of the dummy trench <b>13</b>D. Similarly, the hump height H<b>8</b>&#x2032; in patterned area <b>8</b> illustrates an improvement in the hump height, a lowered hump height is achieved by the addition of dummy trenches <b>17</b>D. The dummy conductors will not be connected electrically to circuit elements and are added to the layout to make the post-ECP hump heights more uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of substrate <b>3</b> and dielectric layer <b>5</b> and conductor layer <b>10</b> after CMP. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is used to illustrate, for example, desired or ideal post-CMP results. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the CMP process has removed the overburden portion of layer <b>10</b>, and the conductor lines can be seen in cross section as conductors in the trenches <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> with an upper surface that is co-planar with the upper surface of dielectric layer <b>5</b>. In an ideal case such as shown for explanation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the surface of the conductive material <b>10</b> in each trench post-CMP would be co-planar and uniform across the semiconductor substrate <b>3</b>. In such a case the post-CMP hump data map would show no hump areas.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">However, in a practical CMP process, the post-CMP results are not ideal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> depicts in a cross section an example of post-CMP results that are obtained from performing CMP on layer <b>10</b> formed over the dielectric layer <b>5</b> on substrate <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. Line <b>12</b> depicts a non-uniform polished surface that might occur when the CMP process is performed on layer <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, where the post-ECP hump height variation in layer <b>10</b> in the different patterned areas is significant. Areas <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> illustrate the &#x201c;dishing&#x201d; effect that can occur when the CMP process removes too much of the conductive material <b>10</b> in certain areas.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An improved post-ECP result (lower hump height variations) also improves the post-CMP result. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates in cross section a post-CMP result for the improved post-ECP results of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the line <b>12</b> that illustrates the polished surface after ECP shows an almost planar surface on dielectric layer <b>5</b>. By modifying the layout and adding dummy conductor trenches to the patterned areas <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the post-ECP results were improved. The CMP process then also improves, because a more uniform conductor layer with less variation in hump heights is easier to process using CMP to obtain a planar surface. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the expected surface shown by line <b>12</b> is closer to the ideal case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, and the dishing effects in areas <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Since modifying the conductor layout can improve results of post-ECP and post-CMP processes, modifications to improve uniformity in ECP such as adding dummy conductors to the patterns for a metal level are used in prior approaches. However, in the prior approaches, verifying that the modification to the layout actually improved the ECP and CMP results required manufacturing a modified photomask for the conductive line pattern, such as a modified photomask <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and then, making additional test wafers. This iterative photomask manufacturing and test wafer process is time consuming and expensive. It is desirable to simulate the ECP and CMP results obtained from the process and to use the simulator results to verify that the proposed layout pattern for a metal layer returns acceptable post-ECP and post-CMP results prior to any manufacture of the photomasks. However, the ECP and CMP simulations in the prior approaches were not sufficiently accurate, and the simulator output results did not match the results of the ECP processes; so it was not feasible to use these simulators to optimize the layouts before making the photomasks.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the prior art ECP simulations, only layout effect factors were used with the ECP simulators to determine the predicted post-ECP results. In the prior approach, for each of many unit grid areas for a metal layer on a semiconductor wafer, the line width and line spacing was used, with the ECP simulator, to predict the post-ECP hump heights. The ECP simulator is calibrated to a known process and to a known plating tool, and using the line width and line spacing, for each unit grid area, a resulting post-ECP thickness was predicted using a software model for the plating process. However, the predicted post-ECP results obtained did not track the results obtained from the actual process on the wafers, and so the predicted post-ECP hump heights obtained were not useful.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It has been observed that each of three factors, Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b> and Factor <b>3</b>, in the metal conductor patterns actually affects the hump heights seen in post-ECP results in experimental wafers. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, each of the three factors is determined for a proposed layout for a selected metal layer. V-ECP and V-CMP simulators are used, with each of the three factors as inputs to the simulators, to provide predicted post-ECP and post-CMP hump height data maps for the proposed layout. In various embodiments, modifications are made to the proposed layout, or in alternative embodiments, to the process recipes, and additional simulations are performed. When a simulator result is obtained with acceptable hump height uniformity, the modified layout is used to generate a photomask generation file, and a photomask is manufactured. The use of all three of the factors increases the accuracy of the ECP simulation, and also the CMP simulation, so that the predicted hump data map tracks experimental wafer results very closely. With the use of some embodiments, a proposed layout modification can be verified and there is no need to modify and manufacture multiple versions of the photomasks.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the three factors are determined for the conductor line pattern for a particular metal layer in a unit grid area, a global effects factor (Factor <b>1</b>), a local effects factor (Factor <b>2</b>) and a layout effects factor (Factor <b>3</b>). Factor <b>3</b> is similar to the layout effects used in prior approaches. By using all the three factors Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b> and Factor <b>3</b> calculated from a proposed pattern for a given metal layer, and by inputting the data for all three factors into a V-ECP simulator, an accurate predicted post-ECP hump data map is obtained. This predicted post-ECP hump data map predicts the post-ECP results for the proposed design, and it is then produced on an actual wafer. The predicted post-ECP hump data map is used to identify &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The proposed layout of the metal layer may then be modified, and the modified layout is used with the three factors in the ECP simulator to verify whether the &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; are removed by the modifications. In this manner, the proposed layout is optimized for ECP and CMP processing.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, patterned areas <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> have greater hump height than the surrounding areas and are shown as &#x201c;hot spots,&#x201d; where hump heights exceed a threshold Hth. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, post-CMP results show dishing problems and the non-planar surface that may result when CMP is performed on a conductive layer <b>10</b> with these post-ECP &#x201c;hot spots.&#x201d; In some embodiments, these &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; are reduced or eliminated before a wafer is processed in ECP and CMP tools.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Changes to the proposed IC layout are made, and an iterative approach can be used with the V-ECP simulator to verify that the modified layout will have fewer &#x201c;hot spots.&#x201d; In an embodiment, additional dummy conductor pattern areas are added to a proposed layout pattern, for example. The addition of dummy pattern areas can increase the pattern uniformity and reduce the hump height in the &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Conductors in the proposed layout can be rerouted or widened, for example, to change the conductor pattern density in certain areas of the substrate where the simulators indicate &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, after a change is made to the conductor pattern, the V-ECP simulator can be used again, with the updated data for each of the three factors, to verify that the changes made have improved the hump data map (reduced the number of &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d;). By using the V-ECP and V-CMP simulators and by optimizing the conductor pattern prior to the manufacture of photomasks, the need for subsequently modifying photomasks to address ECP hot spots is eliminated, design time is saved, and manufacturing costs are reduced by use of various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The three factors are now further described. It has been observed that the global conductor pattern effects impact the post-ECP hump data obtained for a particular pattern. That is, the pattern density for a conductor line pattern for an entire wafer, and the overall surface coverage of the plated conductor over the entire wafer surface area, impacts the post-ECP hump height variations. This factor, Factor <b>1</b>, is the global effects factor. In some embodiments, this factor is obtained by calculating the surface area of the substrate covered by conductor material for the selected metal layer, over the total surface area of the substrate. Factor <b>1</b> is then stored as input data for use in the V-ECP simulation for each unit grid area.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It has also been observed that local effects or environmental effects affect the post-ECP results. For experimental wafers, the post-ECP data maps are examined in cases where similar patterned areas are formed that are located in different parts of a wafer, or different areas within an integrated circuit die on a wafer. For example, the conductor line trenches in patterned area <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> might be formed in two different areas of an integrated circuit die. In one area of the integrated circuit die, the conductor line trenches of patterned area <b>2</b> were adjacent additional conductor patterns, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, where patterned area <b>4</b> has a different conductor pattern formed very close to patterned area <b>2</b>. In the experimental wafers, when the second area is examined, the same pattern (such as, for example, patterned area <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B) was formed in an area of the integrated circuit where there are no other adjacent metal patterns. Using hump data maps from the experimental wafers, it is observed that even when the same conductor line pattern (for example, patterned area <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B) is formed in two different regions of a substrate, different post-ECP hump height data are observed for the two (otherwise identical) conductor line patterns. This difference in the hump height data map is due to local pattern effects in the area surrounding the conductor pattern. The surrounding conductor patterns impact the hump height data from the ECP and CMP processes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, Factor <b>2</b>, the local effects factor, addresses these effects. To determine Factor <b>2</b>, a calculation is done by dividing the entire substrate area into unit grid areas. As described below, each unit grid area has a Factor <b>3</b>, the layout effects factor, associated with it. Each unit grid area is selected to be 10 microns by 10 microns, for a non-limiting example. To determine Factor <b>2</b> for each unit grid area, a larger local grid area is associated with each unit grid area. The local grid area is approximately centered on the unit grid area. Factor <b>2</b> is calculated for each of these local grid areas. This calculation is made by finding the surface area that is covered in the conductive material over the total surface area for each local grid area, that is, the pattern density is determined for the local grid area. In an example embodiment, a local area of 100 microns&#xd7;100 microns was used, although larger or smaller local grid areas could be used as well. The area of the local gird area covered by the conductor pattern over the total available surface area provides Factor <b>2</b> as a pattern density for the local grid area. In some embodiments, Factor <b>2</b> is calculated and stored for each unit grid area for the entire wafer. The Factor <b>2</b> data is then later retrieved for use in a V-ECP simulation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, Factor <b>3</b> is the layout effects factor. Factor <b>3</b> is determined for each of the unit grid areas. Layout effects are those effects determined by each individual line or pattern to be plated in ECP. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, patterned areas <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> each have one or more trenches to be filled with conductor layer <b>10</b>, as described above. Each of the trenches forms a conductor line pattern. The width and spacing of the conductor line patterns in each of the unit grid areas affects the hump heights obtained in the ECP process.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a pattern in a grid area <b>31</b>, in a plan view. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a conductor line pattern L<b>1</b> is formed and spaced from a parallel conductor line pattern L<b>2</b>. The conductor line patterns L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> are trenches <b>23</b> and <b>29</b>, and in cross section would appear like trenches <b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example. Dielectric spacing material <b>25</b> and <b>29</b> electrically isolates the conductor line patterns. The grid area <b>31</b> is a small portion of a semiconductor wafer, 10&#xd7;10 ums, or 20&#xd7;20 ums, or a similar grid size, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, Factor <b>3</b> is measured as a line edge density (LED) for each unit grid area over the semiconductor wafer. In this embodiment, the LED is calculated as LED=1/(line width+line spacing), and may have units such as microns<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. For example, if a line was 100 nanometers in width and it had a line spacer that was 100 nanometers, the LED for this pattern would be 1/0.2=5 microns<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, if the width L<b>1</b><i>w=</i>125 nanometers, and the spacing L<b>1</b><i>s=</i>125 nanometers, and likewise the width L<b>2</b><i>w=</i>125 nanometers and the spacing L<b>2</b><i>s=</i>125 nanometers, then the LED=1/(0.125+0.125+0.125+0.125)=1/0.5=2 microns<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another alternative embodiment, pattern density is used for Factor <b>3</b> for each unit grid area. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the pattern density for unit grid area <b>21</b> would 50% or 0.5, because half of the available area is covered by the conductor pattern of lines L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>. Note that the pattern density can also be determined by converting the LED, by multiplying the LED for each line by the line depth to determine the surface area covered by conductors, out of the total available surface area, in the grid area.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, Factor <b>3</b> is determined for each unit grid area. The entire wafer is broken into minimum unit grid areas, for example, in one embodiment grid sizes of 20 microns&#xd7;20 microns is selected. In another alternative embodiment, 10 microns&#xd7;10 microns is selected as a unit grid area.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In contrast to the existing approaches, in various embodiments of the present disclosure the three factors Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b> and Factor <b>3</b> are all used together, in some embodiments, with a V-ECP simulator. It has been observed that by using all three factors in a V-ECP simulator, the embodiments provide a V-ECP simulation that outputs a predicted post-ECP &#x201c;hump data&#x201d; map. This predicted post-ECP hump data map has been found to be matched to post-ECP hump data obtained from test wafers. In additional embodiments, the V-ECP simulations use at least one of Factor <b>1</b>, and Factor <b>2</b>, along with Factor <b>3</b>, to perform a more accurate V-ECP simulation when compared to the prior approaches. By adding the additional factor or factors (Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b>, or both) to the layout effects factor, Factor <b>3</b>, in the simulation input, the accuracy of the predicted post-ECP output is greatly increased.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, the V-ECP simulator is a software program that simulates the results from the electroplating process. The V-ECP simulator is calibrated to the particular ECP equipment being used and to the semiconductor process being used. Different predetermined ECP recipes that are available are characterized and stored as options for the user to select, so that the varying results are easily compared when using the different ECP recipes. For example, in various embodiments, the ECP recipes vary wafer rotation speed, plating time, temperature, voltage/current applied during plating, the plating solution selected, etc. and these recipes are stored as part of the input data used by the V-ECP simulator.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one embodiment, the ECP simulator is implemented as a correlated data look-up table formed using experimental data from test wafers. In this approach, each of the three factors Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b> and Factor <b>3</b>, are determined and presented as inputs to the V-ECP simulator for each unit grid area. The three factors, plus the process equipment details and user selected process recipes, are input into a table that is built from experimental wafer runs using the same process equipment and the same ECP recipes on previously processed wafers. By using the correlated data lookup table, a predicted hump height for the ECP process is obtained for each unit grid area. This predicted post ECP hump height is used, with all of the other predicted hump heights for the entire wafer, to form a predicted post-ECP hump height map for the entire semiconductor wafer. In some embodiments, this correlated data lookup table provides a virtual ECP simulation that is very accurate and is fast, in terms of processing time, to execute.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an alternative embodiment, a computer software modeling approach is used to create the V-ECP simulator. In this embodiment, software is used to model, using algorithms, the ECP process to form an executable simulator. For a proposed layout of a metal layer, the three factors are determined for each unit grid area, and input to the executable simulator, which is calibrated to a particular semiconductor process and user selected process recipes.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In either of the above described simulator embodiments, the V-ECP simulator includes at least one of the factors Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b>, and also Factor <b>3</b>, as inputs, in contrast to the prior ECP simulators. The predicted ECP result tracks the results obtained on wafers in the process. The post-ECP conductor thickness predicted by the simulator takes at least one of Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b> and Factor <b>3</b> into account for each unit grid area on the entire wafer. The predicted post-ECP hump height data that is output by the V-ECP simulators of the embodiments has proved to be very closely matched to test wafer results. Some embodiments are used to identify &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> above, and provide the ability to modify the layout for a metal layer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> above, and then use the V-ECP simulator to verify that improved post ECP results that are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates, in a flow diagram view, a first illustrative method embodiment for using a V-ECP simulator with Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b> and Factor <b>3</b> described above.

In various embodiments, application programs are written and stored in executable form, and executable code may be retrieved from the memory by a processor, and the instructions in the software may be executed by the processor during the performance of the method steps.</p>

At step <b>35</b>, the data needed for the V-ECP and V-CMP simulations for a selected metal layer are extracted from the GDSII data. For example, if the metal layer to be evaluated is metal-<b>1</b>, then the mask layout data corresponding to the conductor line patterns for metal-<b>1</b> are extracted. The data extraction of step <b>35</b> is done to reduce the amount of data being stored and retrieved for the V-ECP simulation. The V-ECP simulation will be performed for each of the selected metal layers, so in step <b>35</b> the layout data needed for any given metal layer is extracted for use in the method, and this extraction step is repeated later for the remaining layers. For example, if the selected layer is metal <b>1</b>, then the layout data corresponding to the metal <b>1</b> pattern is extracted from the GDSII data file.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At step <b>37</b>, Factor <b>1</b>, is determined. As described above, Factor <b>1</b> is calculated from the total pattern area as a percentage or ratio of the conductor material surface area for the selected metal pattern to the total surface area of the semiconductor wafer to be plated, and Factor <b>1</b> measures the global pattern density of the conductor material over the wafer. Factor <b>1</b> will be used by the ECP simulator to in some embodiments refine the post-ECP prediction for the hump height that will occur for each unit grid area.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At step <b>39</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, Factor <b>2</b> is determined for each unit grid area over the semiconductor wafer. As described above, the wafer is partitioned into local area grids or tiles, and these may overlap. For example, grids of 100 micron&#xd7;100 micron, or smaller or larger areas could be used. Each local grid area corresponds to an area surrounding and approximately centered on a particular unit grid area. The local grid area could correspond to a single integrated circuit die area, in some example embodiments. For example, this local area might be a 10000 square micron area, (100 ums&#xd7;100 ums) or some other selected area. The Factor <b>2</b> calculation described above is made and the Factor <b>2</b> data is stored for the local effects factor for each of the unit grid areas for the entire wafer. Factor <b>2</b> for each unit grid area is used in some embodiments in the ECP simulation to refine the prediction the simulator makes for the post-ECP hump height of the conductor material in the unit grid area.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">After the data for the selected metal layer is extracted, the layout effects data factor, at step <b>41</b>, Factor <b>3</b>, is calculated for each of the unit grid areas over the entire wafer. As described above Factor <b>3</b> is an LED calculation, in an embodiment. In an alternative embodiment, Factor <b>3</b> is a pattern density calculation for the unit grid area. There are hundreds or thousands of these unit grid areas for the semiconductor wafer. For each unit grid area on the semiconductor wafer the Factor <b>3</b> results are stored, in a non-transitory memory or computer readable medium. In some embodiments, a form of storage for the Factor <b>3</b> data is a map file with the unit grid areas indexed by their physical X, Y location on the wafer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in this embodiment the calculation of the three factors Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b> and Factor <b>3</b>, is performed in parallel (steps <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>41</b>, respectively). In various alternative embodiments, these three factor calculations (many calculations are performed over the entire wafer) are done in any order and in an example, are done serially, as is convenient in a given application. Additional modifications to the order of steps are contemplated and form additional alternative embodiments that are within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At step <b>43</b>, the V-ECP simulator is executed using at least one of the factors Factor <b>1</b> and Factor <b>2</b>, and either one or both of these factors are used along with the Factor <b>3</b> data from steps <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>41</b> as data inputs. In an embodiment, all three factors are used in the simulations. In other embodiments, at least one of Factor <b>1</b>, and Factor <b>2</b>, are used in a simulation along with Factor <b>3</b> (the layout factor). As described above, in one example embodiment, the V-ECP simulator is implemented as a calibrated look-up correlation table, where the predicted post-ECP hump heights are stored in a look up table, using experimental data from previous wafer runs. At step <b>43</b>, the V-ECP simulation is performed using an ECP model that is calibrated to the particular semiconductor process that will be used to perform the ECP process on the wafers. The V-ECP simulator is calibrated using prior results from test wafers, or from prior production wafers, as metrics, for example. Due to the use of at least one of Factor <b>1</b> and Factor <b>2</b>, along with Factor <b>3</b> for the unit grid areas during the V-ECP simulation, the predicted post-ECP hump data map is accurate. In some embodiments all three factors, Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b> and Factor <b>3</b> are used. Further, the predicted post-ECP hump heights from the V-ECP simulator at step <b>43</b> match the hump heights that are obtained in actual wafer runs using the corresponding ECP tools and recipes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At step <b>45</b>, a predicted post-ECP hump data map is output from the V-ECP simulator, which contains an entry for each unit grid area on the semiconductor wafer representing the predicted post-ECP metal conductor thickness for the unit grid area. The post-ECP hump data map output by the V-ECP simulator is stored for later retrieval in a computer memory in non-transitory form. In some embodiments, the predicted post-ECP hump data map is displayed for visual inspection as a two dimensional image of the wafer on a graphical computer display, for example, in one embodiment the predicted post-ECP data map is presented as a visual representation of the predicted hump height patterns in the conductor layer after ECP. The graphical display is convenient for human operators to visually inspect. In an example embodiment, colors were used to indicate higher humps and visually represent &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; hump heights that exceed some predetermined threshold, as shown as Hth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">At step <b>51</b>, the predicted post-ECP hump data map is analyzed. If hump heights in the predicted post-ECP hump data map exceed certain predetermined acceptable hump height thresholds, these are identified as &#x201c;hot spots,&#x201d; as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> above. For example, returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B above, the patterned areas <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> have hump heights H<b>4</b> and H<b>8</b>. If as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a hump height threshold Hth was defined near the height H<b>2</b> of patterned area <b>2</b>, then patterned areas <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> have hump heights in the predicted post-ECP hump data map that exceed that threshold; and patterned areas <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> would be marked as &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Continuing at step <b>51</b>, if the predicted post-ECP hump data map has &#x201c;hot spots,&#x201d; the mask layout for the selected metal layer is modified to improve the ECP results. For example, the metal conductors for the selected metal layer could be routed to different areas; alternatively the metal conductor line widths and line spacing could be changed to be larger or smaller. Also, as described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 4C</figref> above, dummy metal conductor areas are added to the conductor line pattern in the &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; to improve the conductor line pattern uniformity. Increased conductor line pattern uniformity improves plating uniformity in the ECP process and this reduces hump height variations in the post-ECP thickness of the plated metal conductor, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">After the proposed layout is modified, at step <b>51</b>, in one embodiment, the method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is iteratively performed. Using the modified layout and starting again at step <b>33</b>, the V-ECP simulator at step <b>43</b> is used to verify that the post-ECP hump data map of the modified layout for the selected metal layer is improved, and that the hump heights in the predicted post-ECP hump data map at step <b>45</b> are reduced to allowable levels. In one embodiment, this iterative method continues until acceptable post-ECP hump heights (less than a predetermined hump height threshold) are achieved for each unit grid area across the wafer. In other embodiments, the iterative method is repeated a selected number of times, as determined by the user. In still other embodiments, the iterative method is repeated until the predicted post-ECP hump height data map does not further improve.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The V-CMP simulator at step <b>47</b> simulates a chemical mechanical polishing process on a wafer for a given CMP tool with a particular semiconductor process. Like the V-ECP simulator, the V-CMP simulator is calibrated to a particular piece of CMP equipment and to the particular semiconductor process. In CMP, a chemical slurry is dispensed onto a rotating abrasive polishing pad that is mechanically pressured against the surface of a dielectric layer or wafer that is being reduced or smoothed by polishing. The V-CMP simulator thus takes into account the type of slurry, the type of pad, the speed of rotation, the pressure applied, and the position of the polishing pad which moves on an arm. The V-CMP simulator at step <b>47</b> may also include a selection of predetermined CMP recipes where the user can select. The recipes include type of slurry used, slurry pH, pad pressure, pad type, processing time, and other variables are sometimes varied.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment, the V-CMP simulator at step <b>47</b> is also implemented as a correlated data look up table, similar to the V-ECP simulator described above. The CMP process recipes are stored with results taken from test wafer runs to form the correlated data look-up table. Further, because the predicted post-ECP hump data map from the V-ECP simulation at step <b>45</b> now closely matches the actual wafers processed when using the various embodiments described above, a highly accurate V-CMP simulation is performed, and thus, an accurate predicted post-CMP hump data map obtained. This post-CMP hump data map is also used to further spot potential &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; on the substrate after the CMP process. A user provided post-CMP hump height threshold can be compared to the post-CMP hump height data map, and areas where the V-CMP simulator predicts the post-CMP hump height exceeds the threshold can be identified as &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d;, similar to the threshold comparison in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> above. These &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; may include areas of &#x201c;dishing&#x201d; where the dielectric material is removed during CMP, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The proposed layout for the design can then be modified and further optimized for the CMP process to obtain an improved post-CMP result, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. All of the modifications described above to the proposed layout are made prior to the photomask manufacturing steps, further increasing wafer yield and, without the need for repeated photomask manufacturing steps, and without making test wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The method embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and the alternatives described below, is performed for at least one metal layer and up to each metal layer used in an integrated circuit design to be implemented on a semiconductor wafer. Thus, the photomasks such as <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that determine the metal conductor pattern for each metal layer to be formed using an ECP process in a multilayer design are optimized for ECP and CMP processes. The layout is optimized prior to the manufacture of the photomasks by use of various embodiments. When the photomasks are finally manufactured, the hump height variation results from the ECP process and the CMP process for each metal layer on the wafers manufactured using the photomasks will be within predetermined threshold limits, because the layout design has already been optimized by use of the V-ECP and V-CMP simulators of various embodiments before the photomask manufacturing step.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In alternative embodiments, the V-ECP simulator further provides a way to optimize the selection of an optimal ECP recipe among known ECP recipes for the particular ECP tools to be used in production. This is also described at step <b>51</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The ECP recipe selected is modified and the V-ECP simulation at step <b>43</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is again performed to determine if better post-ECP results (e.g., no or fewer hot spots in the predicted post-ECP hump data map) are obtained. In this embodiment, the post-ECP results are improved without the need for modifying the layout design. In another alternative method embodiment, both the layout and the ECP recipe are modified, and the V-ECP simulation again performed, to obtain optimal results.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts in a flow diagram an alternative method embodiment showing an iterative approach for modifying the layout to obtain acceptable ECP results. Some steps of this method embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are common to the above described method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and like reference numerals are used for like steps. For example, the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also begins at step <b>33</b> as described above. Mask layout data such as GDSII formatted data is received for a conductor pattern for a proposed IC to be produced on a semiconductor wafer using ECP/CMP processes. At step <b>35</b>, the needed data is obtained for the selected metal layer. At step <b>55</b>, the three factors Factor <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are determined for each unit grid area over the entire wafer, as described above. In an embodiment, at least one of Factor <b>1</b>, and Factor <b>2</b>, are determined for each unit grid area for the entire wafer, and these are used along with Factor <b>3</b> in the V-ECP simulations. In one embodiment, all three factors Factor <b>1</b>, Factor <b>2</b> and Factor <b>3</b> are used in the V-ECP simulations. For simplicity in illustration the steps <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>41</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> above are not again described in detail here, but are instead shown here as a single, combined step <b>55</b>. At step <b>43</b>, the V-ECP simulator is again executed. A predicted post-ECP hump data map is output at step <b>45</b>. At step <b>59</b>, a comparison is made for each pattern in the post-ECP hump data map to a predetermined hump height threshold, and hot spots in the post-ECP hump data map are identified, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> above.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If any hot spots are identified at step <b>59</b>, then at step <b>61</b>, the pattern layout for the particular metal layer is modified, for example, by rearranging the conductor pattern for the particular metal layer, or by adding dummy conductor patterns to increase pattern density uniformity for the particular metal layer as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. The entire process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is then repeated from step <b>33</b>. The method embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is continued iteratively until the comparison at step <b>59</b> is negative, that is, until no post-ECP hot spots are found in the comparison at step <b>59</b>. The method then continues to step <b>63</b>. Alternatively, the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may end when the improvements that occur in the post-ECP hump height data map at step <b>45</b> between successive iterations are less than some predetermined percentage; indicating little further improvement is made between iterations.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In an embodiment, the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is performed for each metal layer in an IC design, as each metal layer is formed using ECP and CMP processes.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">At step <b>63</b>, the method continues.

Photomask generation (PG) data files are output to a photomask manufacturing facility that makes the reticle corresponding to the pattern, such as photomask <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts in a flow diagram an alternative method embodiment that also uses an iterative approach, when the ECP recipe is modified. Some steps of this method embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are common to the above described methods and like reference numerals are used for like steps. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also begins at step <b>33</b>, where mask layout data such as GDSII formatted data is received for an entire wafer with metal layers to be produced using ECP/CMP processes. At step <b>35</b>, the needed data is extracted for the selected metal layer in the IC design. At step <b>55</b>, the three factors Factor <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are determined as described above for each unit grid area over the entire wafer. For simplicity, the steps <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>41</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> above are not again described here, but are shown here as a single, combined step <b>55</b>. At step <b>43</b>, the V-ECP simulator is executed. A predicted post-ECP hump data map for the wafer is obtained in step <b>45</b>. At step <b>59</b>, a comparison is made for each pattern in the post-ECP hump data map in each unit grid area to a predetermined hump height threshold as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> above, and hot spots in the post-ECP hump data map are identified in unit grid areas where the threshold is exceeded.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If any hot spots are identified at step <b>59</b>, then the method transitions to step <b>62</b>, where the ECP recipe is modified. Unlike the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, here the layout pattern for the metal layer is left unmodified, although in an alternative embodiment both the layout and the ECP recipe can be modified. Instead, ECP recipe variables such as wafer rotation speed, current magnitude applied during plating, ECP solution chemistry, plating time, are changed to better optimize the predicted post-ECP hump height map. The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> then transitions back to the V-ECP simulation at step <b>43</b>, and continues using the new ECP recipe in the V-ECP simulation. This process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is continued iteratively until the comparison at step <b>59</b> is negative, that is, until no hot spots are found in the predicted post-ECP hump height data map.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At step <b>63</b>, the process continues, for example, by taking the predicted post-ECP hump data map from step <b>45</b> as an input to a V-CMP simulator.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, some of the steps are the same as described above and like reference numerals are used for like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The method in this embodiment starts at step <b>33</b>, receiving mask layout data as before; in an example this is a GDSII format file that contains the data for each layer of the wafer.

At step <b>55</b>, the three factors, (at least one of the global effects factor, Factor land the local effects factor, Factor <b>2</b>, and the layout factor, Factor <b>3</b>) are determined as described above for each unit grid over the entire wafer. At step <b>43</b>, the V-ECP simulator is executed as described above, using the three factors as inputs. In an alternative embodiment, at least one of Factor <b>1</b>, and Factor <b>2</b>, is used with the third factor, Factor <b>3</b>, in the V-ECP simulations. At step <b>45</b>, the predicted post-ECP hump data map is obtained for the entire wafer.
