<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Polydiorganosiloxane polyamide copolymers having organic soft segments and methods of making the copolymers are described.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Siloxane polymers have unique properties derived mainly from the physical and chemical characteristics of the siloxane bond. These properties include low glass transition temperature, thermal and oxidative stability, resistance to ultraviolet radiation, low surface energy and hydrophobicity, high permeability to many gases, and biocompatibility. The siloxane polymers, however, often lack tensile strength.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The low tensile strength of the siloxane polymers can be improved by forming block copolymers. Some block copolymers contain a &#x201c;soft&#x201d; siloxane polymeric block or segment and any of a variety of &#x201c;hard&#x201d; blocks or segments. Polydiorganosiloxane polyamides and polydiorganosiloxane polyureas are exemplary block copolymers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Polydiorganosiloxane polyamides have been prepared by condensation reactions of amino terminated silicones with short-chained dicarboxylic acids. Alternatively, these copolymers have been prepared by condensation reactions of carboxy terminated silicones with short-chained diamines. Because polydiorganosiloxanes (e.g., polydimethylsiloxanes) and polyamides often have significantly different solubility parameters, it can be difficult to find reaction conditions for production of siloxane-based polyamides that result in high degrees of polymerization, particularly with larger homologs of the polyorganosiloxane segments. Many of the known siloxane-based polyamide copolymers contain relatively short segments of the polydiorganosiloxane (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane) such as segments having no greater than 30 diorganosiloxy (e.g., dimethylsiloxy) units or the amount of the polydiorganosiloxane segment in the copolymer is relatively low. That is, the fraction (i.e., amount based on weight) of polydiorganosiloxane (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane) soft segments in the resulting copolymers tends to be low.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Polydiorganosiloxane polyureas are another type of block copolymer. Although these block copolymers have many desirable characteristics, some of them tend to degrade when subjected to elevated temperatures such as 250&#xb0; C. or higher.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Polydiorganosiloxane polyamide block copolymers having amide end-capped (e.g., oxalated) organic soft segments and methods of making the copolymers are disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the block copolymers are polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide block copolymers having amide end-capped (e.g., oxalated) organic soft segments. The polydiorganosiloxane polyamide copolymers can be linear or branched. As used herein, the term &#x201c;branched&#x201d; is used to refer to a polymer chain having branch points that connect three or more chain segments. Examples of branched polymers include long chains having occasional and usually short branches including the same repeat units as the main chain (nominally termed a branched polymer). Branched polydiorganosiloxane polyamide block copolymers having amide end-capped organic soft segments can optionally form cross-linked networks.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The copolymers can have many of the desirable features of polysiloxanes such as low glass transition temperatures, thermal and oxidative stability, resistance to ultraviolet radiation, low surface energy and hydrophobicity, and high permeability to many gases. Additionally, the copolymers can have improved mechanical strength and elastomeric properties compared to polysiloxanes and linear polydiorganosiloxane polyamide block copolymers. At least some of the copolymers are optically clear, have a low refractive index, or both.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this formula, each R<sup>1 </sup>is independently an alkyl, haloalkyl, aralkyl, alkenyl, aryl, or aryl substituted with an alkyl, alkoxy, or halo. G is a residue unit equal to the formula G(NHR<sup>3</sup>)<sub>q </sub>minus the q &#x2014;NHR<sup>3 </sup>groups, and q is an integer greater than or equal to 2. In certain embodiments q can, for example, be equal to 2, 3, or 4. Group R<sup>3 </sup>is hydrogen or alkyl (e.g., an alkyl having 1 to 10, 1 to 6, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms) or R<sup>3 </sup>taken together with G and with the nitrogen to which they are both attached forms a heterocyclic group (e.g., R<sup>3</sup>HN-G-NHR<sup>3 </sup>is piperazine or the like). Each Y is independently an alkylene, aralkylene, or a combination thereof. D is an organic soft segment residue. Subscript n is independently an integer of 0 to 1500 and the subscript p is an integer of 1 to 10. Each asterisk (*) indicates a site of attachment of the repeat unit to another group in the copolymer such as, for example, another repeat unit of Formula I (I-a or I-b) and/or Formula VI (VI-a or VI-b).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Suitable alkyl groups for R<sup>1 </sup>in Formula I (I-a or I-b) typically have 1 to 10, 1 to 6, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Exemplary alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, and iso-butyl. Suitable haloalkyl groups for R<sup>1 </sup>often have only a portion of the hydrogen atoms of the corresponding alkyl group replaced with a halogen. Exemplary haloalkyl groups include chloroalkyl and fluoroalkyl groups with 1 to 3 halo atoms and 3 to 10 carbon atoms. Suitable alkenyl groups for R<sup>1 </sup>often have 2 to 10 carbon atoms. Exemplary alkenyl groups often have 2 to 8, 2 to 6, or 2 to 4 carbon atoms such as ethenyl, n-propenyl, and n-butenyl. Suitable aryl groups for R<sup>1 </sup>often have 6 to 12 carbon atoms. Phenyl is an exemplary aryl group. The aryl group can be unsubstituted or substituted with an alkyl (e.g., an alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms), an alkoxy (e.g., an alkoxy having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms), or halo (e.g., chloro, bromo, or fluoro). Suitable aralkyl groups for R<sup>1 </sup>usually have an alkylene group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms and an aryl group with 6 to 12 carbon atoms. In some exemplary aralkyl groups, the aryl group is phenyl and the alkylene group has 1 to 10 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms (i.e., the structure of the aralkyl is alkylene-phenyl where an alkylene is bonded to a phenyl group).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some repeat units of Formula I (I-a or I-b), all R<sup>1 </sup>groups can be one of alkyl, haloalkyl, aralkyl, alkenyl, aryl, or aryl substituted with an alkyl, alkoxy, or halo (e.g., all R<sup>1 </sup>Groups are an alkyl such as methyl or an aryl such as phenyl). In some compounds of Formula II, the R<sup>1 </sup>groups are mixtures of two or more selected from the group consisting of alkyl, haloalkyl, aralkyl, alkenyl, aryl, and aryl substituted with an alkyl, alkoxy, or halo in any ratio. Thus, for example, in certain compounds of Formula I, 0%, 1%, 2, %, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, or 100% of the R<sup>1 </sup>groups can be methyl; and 100%, 99%, 98%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, or 0% of the R<sup>1 </sup>groups can be phenyl.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some repeat units of Formula I (I-a or I-b), at least 50 percent of the R<sup>1 </sup>groups are methyl. For example, at least 60 percent, at least 70 percent, at least 80 percent, at least 90 percent, at least 95 percent, at least 98 percent, or at least 99 percent of the R<sup>1 </sup>groups can be methyl. The remaining R<sup>1 </sup>groups can be selected from an alkyl having at least two carbon atoms, haloalkyl, aralkyl, alkenyl, aryl, or aryl substituted with an alkyl, alkoxy, or halo.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Each Y in Formula I (I-a or I-b) is independently an alkylene, aralkylene, or a combination thereof. Suitable alkylene groups typically have up to 10 carbon atoms, up to 8 carbon atoms, up to 6 carbon atoms, or up to 4 carbon atoms. Exemplary alkylene groups include methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, and the like. Suitable aralkylene groups usually have an arylene group with 6 to 12 carbon atoms bonded to an alkylene group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms. In some exemplary aralkylene groups, the arylene portion is phenylene. That is, the divalent aralkylene group is phenylene-alkylene where the phenylene is bonded to an alkylene having 1 to 10, 1 to 8, 1 to 6, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms. As used herein with reference to group Y, &#x201c;a combination thereof&#x201d; refers to a combination of two or more groups selected from an alkylene and aralkylene group. A combination can be, for example, a single aralkylene bonded to a single alkylene (e.g., alkylene-arylene-alkylene). In one exemplary alkylene-arylene-alkylene combination, the arylene is phenylene and each alkylene has 1 to 10, 1 to 6, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Each subscript n in Formula I (I-a or I-b) is independently an integer of 0 to 1500. For example, subscript n can be an integer up to 1000, up to 500, up to 400, up to 300, up to 200, up to 100, up to 80, up to 60, up to 40, up to 20, or up to 10.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The value of n is often at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 5, at least 10, at least 20, or at least 40. For example, subscript n can be in the range of 40 to 1500, 0 to 1000, 40 to 1000, 0 to 500, 1 to 500, 40 to 500, 1 to 400, 1 to 300, 1 to 200, 1 to 100, 1 to 80, 1 to 40, or 1 to 20.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The subscript p is an integer of 1 to 10. For example, the value of p is often an integer up to 9, up to 8, up to 7, up to 6, up to 5, up to 4, up to 3, or up to 2. The value of p can be in the range of 1 to 8, 1 to 6, or 1 to 4.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Group G in Formula I (I-a or I-b) and/or Formula VI (VI-a or VI-b) is a residual unit that is equal to a diamine or polyamine compound of formula G(NHR<sup>3</sup>)<sub>q </sub>minus the q amino groups (i.e., &#x2014;NHR<sup>3 </sup>groups), where q is an integer greater than or equal to 2. The diamine and/or polyamine can have primary and/or secondary amino groups. Group R<sup>3 </sup>is hydrogen or alkyl (e.g., an alkyl having 1 to 10, 1 to 6, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms) or R<sup>3 </sup>taken together with G and with the nitrogen to which they are both attached forms a heterocyclic group (e.g., R<sup>3</sup>HN-G-NHR<sup>3 </sup>is piperazine). In most embodiments, R<sup>3 </sup>is hydrogen or an alkyl. In many embodiments, all of the amino groups of the diamine and/or polyamine are primary amino groups (i.e., all the R<sup>3 </sup>groups are hydrogen) and the diamine and/or polyamine are of the formula G(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q </sub>(e.g., a diamine of the formula R<sup>3</sup>HN-G-NHR<sup>3 </sup>when q=2).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In certain embodiments, Group G in Formula I (I-a or I-b) and/or Formula VI (VI-a or VI-b) is a mixture of residual units that are equal to (i) a diamine compound of the formula R<sup>3</sup>HN-G-NHR<sup>3 </sup>minus the two amino groups (i.e., &#x2014;NHR<sup>3 </sup>groups) and (ii) a polyamine compound of the formula G(NHR<sup>3</sup>)<sub>q </sub>minus the q amino groups (i.e., &#x2014;NHR<sup>3 </sup>groups), where q is an integer greater than 2. In such embodiments, the polyamine compound of formula G(NHR<sup>3</sup>)<sub>q </sub>can be, but is not limited to, triamine compounds (i.e., q=3), tetraamine compounds (i.e., q=4), and combinations thereof. In such embodiments, the number of equivalents of polyamine (ii) per equivalent of diamine (i) is preferably at least 0.001, more preferably at least 0.005, and most preferably at least 0.01. In such embodiments, the number of equivalents of polyamine (ii) per equivalent of diamine (i) is preferably at most 3, more preferably at most 2, and most preferably at most 1.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When G includes residual units that are equal to (i) a diamine compound of formula R<sup>3</sup>HN-G-NHR<sup>3 </sup>minus the two amino groups (i.e., &#x2014;NHR<sup>3 </sup>groups), G can be an alkylene, heteroalkylene, polydiorganosiloxane, arylene, aralkylene, or a combination thereof. Suitable alkylenes often have 2 to 10, 2 to 6, or 2 to 4 carbon atoms. Exemplary alkylene groups include ethylene, propylene, butylene, and the like. Suitable heteroalkylenes are often polyoxyalkylenes such as polyoxyethylene having at least 2 ethylene units, polyoxypropylene having at least 2 propylene units, or copolymers thereof. Suitable polydiorganosiloxanes include the polydiorganosiloxane diamines of Formula III, which are described below, minus the two amino groups. Exemplary polydiorganosiloxanes include, but are not limited to, polydimethylsiloxanes with alkylene Y groups. Suitable aralkylene groups usually contain an arylene group having 6 to 12 carbon atoms bonded to an alkylene group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Some exemplary aralkylene groups are phenylene-alkylene where the phenylene is bonded to an alkylene having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, 1 to 8 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms. As used herein with reference to group G, &#x201c;a combination thereof&#x201d; refers to a combination of two or more groups selected from an alkylene, heteroalkylene, polydiorganosiloxane, arylene, and aralkylene. A combination can be, for example, an aralkylene bonded to an alkylene (e.g., alkylene-arylene-alkylene). In one exemplary alkylene-arylene-alkylene combination, the arylene is phenylene and each alkylene has 1 to 10, 1 to 6, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Each D is Formula VI (VI-a or VI-b) represents an organic soft segment. Organic soft segments typically include one or more polyether residues such as, for example, polyoxyethylene residues, polyoxypropylene residues, poly(oxyethylene-co-oxypropylene) residues, and combinations thereof. The organic soft segment preferably has an average molecular weight of at least 450, more preferably at least 700, and most preferably at least 2000. The organic soft segment preferably has an average molecular weight of at most 8000, more preferably at most 6000, and most preferably at most 4000. A wide variety of organic soft segments can be used including, for example, those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,119,615 (Schulze).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In preferred embodiments, the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide having amide end-capped (e.g., oxalated) organic soft segments is a polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide. The polydiorganosiloxane polyamide tends to be free of groups having a formula &#x2014;R<sup>a</sup>&#x2014;(CO)&#x2014;NH&#x2014; where R<sup>a </sup>is an alkylene. All of the carbonylamino groups along the backbone of the copolymeric material are part of an oxalylamino group (i.e., the &#x2014;(CO)&#x2014;(CO)&#x2014;NH&#x2014; group). That is, any carbonyl group along the backbone of the copolymeric material is bonded to another carbonyl group and is part of an oxalyl group. More specifically, the polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide has a plurality of aminoxalylamino groups.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The polydiorganosiloxane polyamide having amide end-capped (e.g., oxalated) organic soft segments is a block copolymer and can be an elastomeric material. Unlike many of the known polydiorganosiloxane polyamides that are generally formulated as brittle solids or hard plastics, the polydiorganosiloxane polyamides can be formulated to include greater than 50 weight percent polydiorganosiloxane segments based on the weight of the copolymer. The weight percent of the diorganosiloxane in the polydiorganosiloxane polyamides can be increased by using higher molecular weight polydiorganosiloxanes segments to provide greater than 60 weight percent, greater than 70 weight percent, greater than 80 weight percent, greater than 90 weight percent, greater than 95 weight percent, or greater than 98 weight percent of the polydiorganosiloxane segments in the polydiorganosiloxane polyamides. Higher amounts of the polydiorganosiloxane can be used to prepare elastomeric materials with lower modulus while maintaining reasonable strength.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Some of the polydiorganosiloxane polyamides can be heated to a temperature up to 200&#xb0; C., up to 225&#xb0; C., up to 250&#xb0; C., up to 275&#xb0; C., or up to 300&#xb0; C. without noticeable degradation of the material. For example, when heated in a thermogravimetric analyzer in the presence of air, the copolymers often have less than a 10 percent weight loss when scanned at a rate 50&#xb0; C. per minute in the range of 20&#xb0; C. to 350&#xb0; C. Additionally, the copolymers can often be heated at a temperature such as 250&#xb0; C. for 1 hour in air without apparent degradation as determined by no detectable loss of mechanical strength upon cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The copolymeric material having repeat units of Formula I (I-a or I-b) and Formula VI (VI-a or VI-b) can be optically clear. As used herein, the term &#x201c;optically clear&#x201d; refers to a material that is clear to the human eye. An optically clear copolymeric material often has a luminous transmission of at least 90 percent, a haze of less than 2 percent, and opacity of less than 1 percent in the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range. Both the luminous transmission and the haze can be determined using, for example, the method of ASTM-D 1003-95.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Additionally, the copolymeric material having repeat units of Formula I (I-a or I-b) and Formula VI (VI-a or VI-b) can have a low refractive index. As used herein, the term &#x201c;refractive index&#x201d; refers to the absolute refractive index of a material (e.g., copolymeric material) and is the ratio of the speed of electromagnetic radiation in free space to the speed of the electromagnetic radiation in the material of interest. The electromagnetic radiation is white light. The index of refraction is measured using an Abbe refractometer, available commercially, for example, from Fisher Instruments of Pittsburgh, Pa. The measurement of the refractive index can depend, to some extent, on the particular refractometer used. For some embodiments (e.g., embodiments in which the copolymer includes a polydimethylsiloxane segment), the copolymeric material can have a refractive index in the range of 1.41 to 1.50. For some other embodiments (e.g., embodiments in which the copolymer includes a polyphenylsiloxane or a polydiphenylsiloxane segment), the copolymeric material can have a refractive index in the range of from 1.46 to 1.55.</p>

The reaction mixture can then be formed, poured, pumped, coated, injection molded, sprayed, sputtered, atomized, stranded or sheeted, and partially or completely polymerized. The partially or completely polymerized material can then optionally be converted to a particle, droplet, pellet, sphere, strand, ribbon, rod, tube, film, sheet, coextruded film, web, non-woven, microreplicated structure, or other continuous or discrete shape, prior to the transformation to solid polymer. Any of these steps can be conducted in the presence or absence of applied heat. In one exemplary process, the components can be metered using a gear pump, mixed using a static mixer, and injected into a mold prior to solidification of the polymerizing material.</p>

A polydiorganosiloxane diamine of Formula III (p moles) is reacted with a molar excess of an oxalate of Formula IV (greater than p+1 moles) under an inert atmosphere to produce the polydiorganosiloxane-containing precursor of Formula II and R<sup>2</sup>&#x2014;OH by-product. In this reaction, R<sup>1</sup>, Y, n, and p are the same as previously described for Formula I (I-a or I-b). Each R<sup>2 </sup>in Formula IV is independently an alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, or aryl substituted with an alkyl, alkoxy, halo, or alkoxycarbonyl. The preparation of the precursor of Formula II according to Reaction Scheme A is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/317,616, filed 23 Dec. 2005.
</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The polydiorganosiloxane diamine of Formula III in Reaction Scheme A can be prepared by any known method and can have any suitable molecular weight, such as an average molecular weight in the range of 700 to 150,000 g/mole. Suitable polydiorganosiloxane diamines and methods of making the polydiorganosiloxane diamines are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,890,269 (Martin), 4,661,577 (Jo Lane et al.), 5,026,890 (Webb et al.), 5,276,122 (Aoki et al.), 5,214,119 (Leir et al.), 5,461,134 (Leir et al.), 5,512,650 (Leir et al.), and 6,355,759 (Sherman et al.). Some polydiorganosiloxane diamines are commercially available, for example, from Shin Etsu Silicones of America, Inc., Torrance, Calif. and from Gelest Inc., Morrisville, Pa.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">A polydiorganosiloxane diamine having a molecular weight greater than 2,000 g/mole or greater than 5,000 g/mole can be prepared using the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,214,119 (Leir et al.), 5,461,134 (Leir et al.), and 5,512,650 (Leir et al.). One of the described methods involves combining under reaction conditions and under an inert atmosphere (a) an amine functional end blocker of the following formula</p>

where Y and R<sup>1 </sup>are the same as defined in Formula I (I-a or I-b) and M<sup>+</sup> is a sodium ion, potassium ion, cesium ion, rubidium ion, or tetramethylammonium ion. The reaction is continued until substantially all of the amine functional end blocker is consumed and then additional cyclic siloxane is added to increase the molecular weight. The additional cyclic siloxane is often added slowly (e.g., drop wise). The reaction temperature is often conducted in the range of 80&#xb0; C. to 90&#xb0; C. with a reaction time of 5 to 7 hours. The resulting polydiorganosiloxane diamine can be of high purity (e.g., less than 2 weight percent, less than 1.5 weight percent, less than 1 weight percent, less than 0.5 weight percent, less than 0.1 weight percent, less than 0.05 weight percent, or less than 0.01 weight percent silanol impurities). Altering the ratio of the amine end functional blocker to the cyclic siloxane can be used to vary the molecular weight of the resulting polydiorganosiloxane diamine of Formula III.

The reaction is continued until substantially all of the amine functional end blocker is consumed. This method is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,355,759 B1 (Sherman et al.).

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Examples of polydiorganosiloxane diamines include, but are not limited to, polydimethylsiloxane diamine, polydiphenylsiloxane diamine, polytrifluoropropylmethylsiloxane diamine, polyphenylmethylsiloxane diamine, polydiethylsiloxane diamine, polydivinylsiloxane diamine, polyvinylmethylsiloxane diamine, poly(5-hexenyl)methylsiloxane diamine, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In Reaction Scheme A, an oxalate of Formula IV is reacted with the polydiorganosiloxane diamine of Formula III under an inert atmosphere. The two R<sup>2 </sup>groups in the oxalate of Formula IV can be the same or different. In some methods, the two R<sup>2 </sup>groups are different and have different reactivity with the polydiorganosiloxane diamine of Formula III in Reaction Scheme A.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Group R<sup>2 </sup>can be an alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, or aryl substituted with an alkyl, alkoxy, halo, or alkoxycarbonyl. Suitable alkyl and haloalkyl groups for R<sup>2 </sup>often have 1 to 10, 1 to 6, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Although tertiary alkyl (e.g., tert-butyl) and haloalkyl groups can be used, there is often a primary or secondary carbon atom attached directly (i.e., bonded) to the adjacent oxy group. Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, and iso-butyl. Exemplary haloalkyl groups include chloroalkyl groups and fluoroalkyl groups in which some, but not all, of the hydrogen atoms on the corresponding alkyl group are replaced with halo atoms. For example, the chloroalkyl or a fluoroalkyl groups can be chloromethyl, 2-chloroethyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, 3-chloropropyl, 4-chlorobutyl, fluoromethyl, 2-fluoroethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 3-fluoropropyl, 4-fluorobutyl, and the like. Suitable aryl groups for R<sup>2 </sup>include those having 6 to 12 carbon atoms such as, for example, phenyl. An aryl group can be unsubstituted or substituted with an alkyl (e.g., an alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, or n-propyl), an alkoxy (e.g., an alkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methoxy, ethoxy, or propoxy), halo (e.g., chloro, bromo, or fluoro), or alkoxycarbonyl (e.g., an alkoxycarbonyl having 2 to 5 carbon atoms such as methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, or propoxycarbonyl).</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The oxalates of Formula IV in Reaction Scheme A can be prepared, for example, by reaction of an alcohol of formula R<sup>2</sup>&#x2014;OH with oxalyl dichloride. Commercially available oxalates of Formula IV (e.g., from Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis. and from VWR International, Bristol, Conn.) include, but are not limited to, dimethyl oxalate, diethyl oxalate, di-n-butyl oxalate, di-tert-butyl oxalate, bis(phenyl)oxalate, bis(pentafluorophenyl)oxalate, 1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-(2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorophenyl)oxalate, and bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)oxalate.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">A molar excess of the oxalate is used in Reaction Scheme A. That is, the molar ratio of oxalate to polydiorganosiloxane diamine is greater than the stoichiometric molar ratio, which is (p+1): p. The molar ratio is often greater than 2:1, greater than 3:1, greater than 4:1, or greater than 6:1. The condensation reaction typically occurs under an inert atmosphere and at room temperature upon mixing of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The condensation reaction used to produce the precursor of Formula II (i.e., Reaction Scheme A) can occur in the presence or absence of a solvent. In some methods, no solvent or only a small amount of solvent is included in the reaction mixture. In other methods, a solvent may be included such as, for example, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, or aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes such as hexane).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Removal of excess oxalate from the precursor of Formula II prior to reaction with the diamine tends to favor formation of an optically clear polydiorganosiloxane polyamide. The excess oxalate can typically be removed from the precursor using a stripping process. For example, the reacted mixture (i.e., the product or products of the condensation reaction according to Reaction Scheme A) can be heated to a temperature up to 150&#xb0; C., up to 175&#xb0; C., up to 200&#xb0; C., up to 225&#xb0; C., or up to 250&#xb0; C. to volatilize the excess oxalate. A vacuum can be pulled to lower the temperature that is needed for removal of the excess oxalate. The precursor compounds of Formula II tend to undergo minimal or no apparent degradation at temperatures in the range of 200&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C. or higher. Any other known methods of removing the excess oxalate can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The by-product of the condensation reaction shown in Reaction Scheme A is an alcohol (i.e., R<sup>2</sup>&#x2014;OH is an alcohol). Group R<sup>2 </sup>is often limited to an alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a haloalkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or an aryl such as phenyl that form an alcohol that can be readily removed (e.g., vaporized) by heating at temperatures no greater than 250&#xb0; C. Such an alcohol can be removed when the reacted mixture is heated to a temperature sufficient to remove the excess oxalate of Formula IV.

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Either pressure sensitive adhesives or heat activated adhesives can be formulated by combining the polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamides with a tackifier such as a silicate tackifying resin. As used herein, the term &#x201c;pressure sensitive adhesive&#x201d; refers to an adhesive that possesses the following properties: (1) aggressive and permanent tack; (2) adherence to a substrate with no more than finger pressure; (3) sufficient ability to hold onto an adherend; and (4) sufficient cohesive strength to be removed cleanly from the adherend. As used herein, the term &#x201c;heat activated adhesive&#x201d; refers to an adhesive composition that is essentially non-tacky at room temperature but that becomes tacky above room temperature above an activation temperature such as above 30&#xb0; C. Heat activated adhesives typically have the properties of a pressure sensitive adhesive above the activation temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Tackifying resins such as silicate tackifying resins are added to the polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide copolymer to provide or enhance the adhesive properties of the copolymer. The silicate tackifying resin can influence the physical properties of the resulting adhesive composition. For example, as silicate tackifying resin content is increased, the glassy to rubbery transition of the adhesive composition occurs at increasingly higher temperatures. In some exemplary adhesive compositions, a plurality of silicate tackifying resins can be used to achieve desired performance.</p>

Typical exemplary silicate resins include MQ silicate tackifying resins, MQD silicate tackifying resins, and MQT silicate tackifying resins. These silicate tackifying resins usually have a number average molecular weight in the range of 100 to 50,000 or in the range of 500 to 15,000 and generally have methyl R&#x2032; groups.</p>

The above-described resins are generally prepared in solvent. Dried or solventless, M silicone tackifying resins can be prepared, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,319,040 (Wengrovius et al.), 5,302,685 (Tsumura et al.), and 4,935,484 (Wolfgruber et al.).</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Certain MQ silicate tackifying resins can be prepared by the silica hydrosol capping process described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,676,182 (Daudt et al.) as modified according to U.S. Pat. No. 3,627,851 (Brady), and U.S. Pat. No. 3,772,247 (Flannigan). These modified processes often include limiting the concentration of the sodium silicate solution, and/or the silicon-to-sodium ratio in the sodium silicate, and/or the time before capping the neutralized sodium silicate solution to generally lower values than those disclosed by Daudt et al. The neutralized silica hydrosol is often stabilized with an alcohol, such as 2-propanol, and capped with R<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2 </sub>siloxane units as soon as possible after being neutralized. The level of silicon bonded hydroxyl groups (i.e., silanol) on the MQ resin may be reduced to no greater than 1.5 weight percent, no greater than 1.2 weight percent, no greater than 1.0 weight percent, or no greater than 0.8 weight percent based on the weight of the silicate tackifying resin. This may be accomplished, for example, by reacting hexamethyldisilazane with the silicate tackifying resin. Such a reaction may be catalyzed, for example, with trifluoroacetic acid. Alternatively, trimethylchlorosilane or trimethylsilylacetamide may be reacted with the silicate tackifying resin, a catalyst not being necessary in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">MQD silicone tackifying resins are terpolymers having R&#x2032;<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2 </sub>units (&#x201c;M&#x201d; units), SiO<sub>4/2 </sub>units (&#x201c;Q&#x201d; units), and R&#x2032;<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2/2 </sub>units (&#x201c;D&#x201d; units) such as are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 2,736,721 (Dexter). In MQD silicone tackifying resins, some of the methyl R&#x2032; groups of the R&#x2032;<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2/2 </sub>units (&#x201c;D&#x201d; units) can be replaced with vinyl (CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2550;CH&#x2014;) groups (&#x201c;D<sup>Vi</sup>&#x201d; units).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">MQT silicate tackifying resins are terpolymers having R&#x2032;<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2 </sub>units, SiO<sub>4/2 </sub>units and R&#x2032;SiO<sub>3/2 </sub>units (&#x201c;T&#x201d; units) such as are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,110,890 (Butler) and Japanese Kokai HE 2-36234.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Suitable silicate tackifying resins are commercially available from sources such as Dow Corning, Midland, Mich., General Electric Silicones Waterford, N.Y. and Rhodia Silicones, Rock Hill, S.C. Examples of particularly useful MQ silicate tackifying resins include those available under the trade designations SR-545 and SR-1000, both of which are commercially available from GE Silicones, Waterford, N.Y. Such resins are generally supplied in organic solvent and may be employed in the formulations of the adhesives of the present invention as received. Blends of two or more silicate resins can be included in the adhesive compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The adhesive compositions typically contain 20 to 80 weight percent polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide and 20 to 80 weight percent silicate tackifying resin based on the combined weight of polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide and silicate tackifying resin. For example, the adhesive compositions can contain 30 to 70 weight percent polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide and 30 to 70 weight percent silicate tackifying resin, 35 to 65 weight percent polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide and 35 to 65 weight percent silicate tackifying resin, 40 to 60 weight percent polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide and 40 to 60 weight percent silicate tackifying resin, or 45 to 55 weight percent polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide and 45 to 55 weight percent silicate tackifying resin.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The adhesive composition can be solvent-free or can contain a solvent. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes such as hexane), or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Polydiorganosiloxane polyamides with a small amount of branching can be soluble in many common organic solvents such as, for example, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes such as hexane), or mixtures thereof. Polydiorganosiloxane polyamides with higher amounts of branching can be swellable in many common organic solvents such as, for example, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes such as hexane), or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The polydiorganosiloxane polyamides can be cast from solvents as film, molded or embossed in various shapes, or extruded into films. The high temperature stability of the copolymeric material makes them well suited for extrusion methods of film formation. The films can be optically clear. A multilayer film containing the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide block copolymers is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/614,169, filed 21 Dec. 2006.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Processes of Making Compositions and Constructions</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The compositions and constructions disclosed herein can be made by solvent-based processes known to the art, by a solventless process, or by a combination of the two.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">For embodiments in which the composition or construction includes, for example, an organic polymer, one skilled in the art can expect the optimum material for a particular application to be a function of the architecture and ratios of the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component, the architecture and ratios of organic polymer, optional initiator architecture, and whether any fillers, additives, or property modifiers are added.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">For embodiments in which the composition or construction includes an organic polymer, the organic polymer is generally added as a molten stream to the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component or to one of the reactants of the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component. Sometimes the polymeric material needs to be melted in a separate vessel before the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component is added (1) as pellets, (2) as reactants or (3) as a separate molten stream from a second vessel. Examples when a separate vessel is preferred include, for example, when (1) additives are preferred to concentrate in the organic polymer, (2) organic polymers need high processing temperatures and (3) organic polymers include elastomeric thermoset materials.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The order of adding the various components is important in forming the mixture. For embodiments in which the composition or construction includes an organic polymer, any order of addition can be used if the organic polymer is substantially unreactive with the reactants for making the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide (e.g., diamines) as discussed earlier. The polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component can be added to the organic polymer, and vice versa, or the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component can be made in the presence of the organic polymer. However, the organic polymer must be added after the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component is formed if the organic polymer is reactive with the reactants for making such component. Also, the organic polymer is preferably sufficiently heated to a processable state in a separate vessel and added to a molten stream of the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component if the temperature needed to process the organic polymer would degrade the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Other additives such as plasticizing materials, tackifying materials, pigments, fillers, initiators, and the like can generally be added at any point in the process since they are usually not reactive with the reactants but are typically added after a substantial amount of the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">For embodiments in which the composition or construction includes an organic polymer, organic polymers that are non-thermoplastic elastomeric materials generally need special conditions to be melt processed when mixed with polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing components. Two methods of making non-thermoplastic elastomeric materials melt processable are (1) reducing their apparent melt viscosity by swelling them with tackifying or plasticizing material or (2) masticating the materials as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,539,033.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Four process considerations can affect the final properties of the mixtures made by the solventless process. First, the properties of polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component could be affected by whether the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component is made in a solvent or an essentially solventless process. Secondly, the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component can degrade if exposed to too much heat and shear. Thirdly, the stability of the mixture is affected by how the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component is mixed with the organic polymer. Fourthly, the morphology of the article made with the mixture is determined by the interaction of the processing parameters and characteristics of the components in the mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In a first consideration, the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component can be made previously by either a solvent or solventless process or can be made in the presence of the organic polymer. Methods of making the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component in solvent were disclosed above. Methods of making the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component in substantially solventless conditions can result in polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component high in molecular weight</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In a second consideration, the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component can degrade if it is heated too much under shear conditions, particularly in the presence of oxygen. The polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component is exposed to the least amount of heat and shear when made in the presence of the organic polymer, and in particular, when the mixture is made under an inert atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In a third consideration, the stability of the mixture is affected by how the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component is mixed with the organic polymer. Polydiorganosiloxanes are generally immiscible with most other polymeric materials. However, the inventors have found that a wide variety of polymers can be mixed with a polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component when both are in the molten state. Care must be taken that the conditions needed to soften one component does not degrade the other. Preferably, the mixing temperature should be at a temperature above the mixing and conveying temperature of the mixture and below the degradation temperature of the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component. The polydiorganosiloxane polyoxamide copolymer can usually be subjected to elevated temperatures up to 250&#xb0; C. or higher without apparent degradation.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Any vessel in which the components can be adequately heated and mixed in the molten state is suitable for making mixtures as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In a fourth consideration, the processing steps influence the morphology of an article made with the mixtures as disclosed herein. The mixtures generally have at least two domains, one discontinuous and the other continuous, because of the general immiscibility of the polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component with the organic polymer. The component comprising the minor phase typically forms discontinuous domains that range in shape from spheroidal to ellipsoidal to ribbon-like to fibrous. The component comprising the major phase typically forms the continuous domain that surrounds the discontinuous domains. The discontinuous domains of the mixture generally elongate if the mixture is subjected to sufficient shear or extensional forces as the mixture is formed into an article, such as a film or coating. The discontinuous domains generally remain elongated if at least one of the components has a sufficient viscosity at use temperature to prevent the elongated domain from relaxing into a sphere when the mixture is no longer under extensional or shear forces. The elongated morphology is usually stable until the mixture is reheated above the softening point of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">While both a solvent based process and a solventless process for making the mixtures as disclosed herein can be used, there may be some situations where a combination of the two is preferred. In the latter case, a polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component could be made by the solvent based process and subsequently dried and melt mixed with the organic polymer.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Types of Articles</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Polymers and compositions of the present invention, depending on specific formulation, can be used to make a variety of articles that can be used, for example, as release films, optical films, diffuse optical articles, process aids, optical PSAs, pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes, pressure-sensitive adhesive transfer tapes, pressure-sensitive adhesive medical tapes, including for example transdermal drug delivering devices, rubber-toughened articles, and pressure-sensitive adhesive coatings directly onto desired articles.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Polymers and compositions as disclosed herein can be cast from solvents as film, molded or embossed in various shapes, or extruded into films. They can be formed into various articles, for example, one that includes a layer containing the polymer or composition and one or more optional substrates. For example, the polymer or composition can be in a layer adjacent to a first substrate or positioned between a first substrate and a second substrate. That is, the article can be arranged in the following order: a first substrate, a layer containing the polymer or composition, and a second substrate. As used herein, the term &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; refers to a first layer that contacts a second layer or that is positioned in proximity to the second layer but separated from the second layer by one or more additional layers.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Pressure-sensitive adhesive articles are made by applying the pressure-sensitive adhesive by well known hot melt or solvent coating process. Any suitable substrates that can by used, including, but not limited to, for example, cloth and fiber-glass cloth, metallized films and foils, polymeric films, nonwovens, paper and polymer coated paper, and foam backings. Polymer films include, but are not limited by, polyolefins such as polypropylene, polyethylene, low density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene and high density polyethylene; polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate; polycarbonates; cellulose acetates; polyimides such as that available under the trade designation KAPTON. Nonwovens, generally made from randomly oriented fibers, include, but are not limited by, nylon, polypropylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyurethane, rayon and the like. Foam backings include, but are not limited by acrylic, silicone, polyurethane, polyethylene, neoprene rubber, and polypropylene, and may be filled or unfilled. Backings that are layered, such as polyethylene-aluminum membrane composites, are also suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In the case of pressure-sensitive tapes, these materials are typically applied by first making a tape construction which comprises a layer of the pressure-sensitive adhesive material coated on a backing. The exposed surface of the pressure-sensitive adhesive coating may be subsequently applied to a surface from which it could be released later or directly to the desired substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Some pressure-sensitive adhesive articles use release liners, i.e., transfer tapes that can be made by coating the composition between two liners both of which are coated with a release coating. The release liners typically comprise polymeric material such as polyester, polyethylene, polyolefin and the like, or release coated paper or polyethylene coated paper. Preferably, each release liner is first coated or primed with a release material for the adhesive materials utilized in the invention. When the composition contains a significant amount of a tackified polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing component, useful release liners include those that are suitable for use with silicone adhesives. One example is the polyfluoropolyether coated liner described in European Patent Publication No. 433070. Other useful release liner release coating compositions are described in European Patent Publication No. 378420, U.S. Pat. No. 4,889,753, and European Patent Publication No. 311262. Commercially available liners and compositions include that available under the trade designation SYL-OFF Q2-7785 fluorosilicone release coating from Dow Corning Corp., Midland, Mich., X-70-029NS fluorosilicone release coatings available from Shin-Etsu Silicones of America, Inc., Torrance, Calif.; that available under the trade designation S TAKE-OFF 2402 fluorosilicone release liner from Release International, Bedford Park, Ill.; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Compositions of the present invention are also useful in medical applications including transdermal drug delivery devices. Transdermal drug delivery devices are designed to deliver a therapeutically effective amount of drug through or to the skin of a patient. Transdermal drug delivery provides significant advantages; unlike injection, it is noninvasive; unlike oral administration, it avoids hepatic first pass metabolism, it minimizes gastrointestinal effects, and it provides stable blood levels.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Compositions of the present invention may also be used in pressure-sensitive adhesives that readily attach to prepared and unprepared surfaces, especially metals, polyolefin and fluorine containing polymeric films, providing a highly conformable, continuous interfacial silicone coating that prevents ingress of environmental contaminants including those that corrosively attack unprotected surfaces. A pressure sensitive adhesive patch typically consists of a protective polydiorganosiloxane polyamide-containing pressure sensitive adhesive composition and optionally a barrier or edge adhesive, layers of conformable barrier or backing materials, or combinations of these materials. For some applications it is preferable that the backing does not shield electric field lines, making an open structure backing more preferable to solid films of, for example, polyethylene or PVC. A tapered or profiled adhesive layer to better match surface topology may be preferred when patching some surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Compositions of the present invention may also be used as pressure-sensitive adhesives or hot melt adhesives for heat shrink tubes. These constructions provide a single article that can withstand the high temperatures experienced during the heat shrink operation and provide an environmental seal after cooling. The rheology, heat stability, tack, and clarity of these materials make them especially suitable for this application.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Compositions of the invention can also be coated onto a differential release liner; i.e., a release liner having a first release coating on one side of the liner and a second release coating coated on the opposite side. The two release coatings preferably have different release values. For example, one release coating may have a release value of 5 grams/cm (that is, 5 grams of force is needed to remove a strip of material 1 cm wide from the coating) while the second release coating may have a release value of 15 grams/cm. The material can be coated over the release liner coating having the higher release value. The resulting tape can be wound into a roll. As the tape is unwound, the pressure-sensitive adhesive adheres to the release coating with the higher release value. After the tape is applied to a substrate, the release liner can be removed to expose an adhesive surface for further use.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Hot melt adhesives are compositions that can be used to bond nonadhering surfaces together into a composite. During application to a substrate, hot melt adhesives should be sufficiently fluid to wet the surface completely and leave no voids, even if the surface is rough. Consequently, the adhesive must be low in viscosity at the time of application. However, the bonding adhesive generally sets into a solid to develop sufficient cohesive strength to remain adhered to the substrate under stressful conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">For hot melt adhesives, the transition from fluid to solid may be accomplished in several ways. First, the hot melt adhesive may be a thermoplastic that softens and melts when heated and becomes hard again when cooled. Such heating results in sufficiently high fluidity to achieve successful wetting. Alternatively, the hot melt adhesive may be dissolved in a solvent or carrier that lowers the viscosity of the adhesive sufficiently to permit satisfactory wetting and raises the adhesive viscosity when the solvent or carrier is removed. Such an adhesive can be heat activated, if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Compositions of the present invention can be formed into unsupported films, which can be used, for example, as release articles, adhesive transfer tapes, optical adhesives, hot melt adhesives, optical articles, diffusers, non-woven webs, water repellant films, rubber toughened plastics, anti-graffiti films, casting liners, pressure sensitive adhesives, vibration dampers, acoustic dampers, medical backings, tape backings, medical articles, and sealants.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Compositions of the present invention can be incorporated into one or more layers of a multilayer film, which can be used, for example, for the uses described herein above for unsupported films. In addition, the multilayer films can be used, for example, as relective polarizers, infra-red radiation reflectors, diffusers, optical filters, pressure sensitive adhesives, vibration dampers, acoustic dampers, reflectors, and permeable films.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Compositions of the present invention can be used in melt process aids, which can be used, for example, for surface modification, slip aids, compatibilizers, refractive index modifiers, impact modifiers, optics modifiers, rheology modifiers, permeability modification, water repellency, fiber treatment to impart a perfect smoothness, lubricity, reduced tackiness, and pleasant tactile sensations.</p>

<heading id="h-0054" level="1">Titration Method to Determine Equivalent Weight</heading>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">10 grams (precisely weighed) of the precursor compounds were added to a jar. Approximately 50 grams THF solvent (not precisely weighed) was added. The contents were mixed using a magnetic stir bar mix until the mixture was homogeneous. The theoretical equivalent weight of precursor was calculated and then an amount of N-hexylamine (precisely weighed) in the range of 3 to 4 times this number of equivalents was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for a minimum of 4 hours. Bromophenol blue (10-20 drops) was added and the contents were mixed until homogeneous. The mixture was titrated to a yellow endpoint with 1.0N (or 0.1N) hydrochloric acid. The number of equivalents of precursor was equal to the number of equivalents of N-hexylamine added to the sample minus the number of equivalents of hydrochloric acid added during titration. The equivalent weight (grams/equivalent) was equal to the sample weight of the precursor divided by the number of equivalents of the precursor.</p>
<heading id="h-0055" level="1">Preparative Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">In a 2 liter, 3-neck resin flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, heating mantle, nitrogen inlet tube (with stopcock), and an outlet tube was placed diethyl oxalate (145.00 grams). The flask was purged with nitrogen for 15 minutes and, with vigorous stirring, Huntsman XTJ-576 (500.00 grams, MW=2,018) was added over a period of one minute. This reaction mixture was stirred for approximately one hour at room temperature. The reaction flask was fitted with a distillation adaptor and receiver. The reaction mixture was heated to 120&#xb0; C. under vacuum (1 Torr) for 2 hours, until no further distillate was able to be collected. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature to provide the oxamido ester terminated polypropylene oxide product. The ester equivalent weight was determined by titration (eq. wt.=1,191 grams/eq.).</p>
<heading id="h-0056" level="1">Preparative Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Diethyl oxalate (241.10 grams) was placed in a 3 liter, 3-neck resin flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, heating mantle, nitrogen inlet tube (with stopcock), and an outlet tube.

After 8 hours at room temperature, the reaction flask was fitted with a distillation adaptor and receiver, the contents stirred and heated to 150&#xb0; C. under vacuum (1 Torr) for 4 hours, until no further distillate was able to be collected. The remaining liquid was cooled to room temperature to provide 2,573 grams of oxamido ester terminated product. Gas chromatographic analysis of the clear, mobile liquid showed that no detectable level of diethyl oxalate remained. Molecular weight was determined by <sup>1</sup>H NMR (MW=5,477 grams/mole) and titration (Equivalent weights of 2,547 grams/mole and 2,550 grams/mole).</p>
