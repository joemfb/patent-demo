<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national Stage Patent Application of PCT International Patent Application No. PCT/KR2010/000897, filed on Feb. 12, 2010 under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371, which claims priority of a Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0082713, filed on Sep. 2, 2009, which are all hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a side view mirror assembly for a vehicle, and more particularly to a side view mirror assembly having three mirrors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a vehicle is attached with a pair of right and left side view mirrors next to A-pillars. A driver watches the right and left sides of the vehicle by using such side view mirrors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, in a case in which a side view mirror is a flat mirror, a blind spot generally occurs. In order to solve this problem, a curved mirror is used, or an additional auxiliary mirror is provided at the surface of the side view mirror or within a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, a technology of electromotively tilting a side view mirror downward to view the lower side during backward movement of a vehicle was commercialized.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, some drivers may want to set a side view mirror in such a manner that the side view mirror is divided into mirrors for a blind spot and backward movement according to their respective driving habits and tastes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to meet this requirement, a left/right or upper/lower divided side view mirror has been developed. Furthermore, an actuator allowing each of divided side view mirrors to be controlled from inside the vehicle has been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, by the simple division of a side view mirror, it is impossible to sufficiently cope with a driver's taste or a change in a driving environment. In other words, there is a limitation in that it is difficult to replace the side view mirror with another side view mirror having a color or a UV filtering function according to seasons or weathers, or to immediately replace the side view mirror when the side view mirror is damaged (or cracked) by an impact.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, when respective divided side view mirrors are controlled from inside the vehicle, separate remote controls for the respective divided parts as well as a conventional side view mirror remote control are required. Thus, there is a problem in that the operation of a pair of right and left side view mirrors is very troublesome.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned problems, and the present invention provides a side view mirror assembly for a vehicle, in which a multi-divided side view mirror can cope with a blind spot and backward movement.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also, it is another object of the present invention to provide a side view mirror assembly for a vehicle, in which a multi-divided side view mirror can be easily replaced. More particularly, in the side view mirror assembly, two overlapping mirrors having different characteristics are inserted so that the mirrors can be easily replaced as required.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, it is a further object of the present invention to provide a side view mirror assembly for a vehicle, in which the respective angles of multi-divided mirrors can be simultaneously adjusted by only a single operation of a remote control.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the embodiments in the following description.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, a driver can freely replace a side view mirror according to his own driving habit and taste, thereby setting the side view mirror with personality.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Especially, since two overlapping mirrors are inserted to each of the center, the lateral side, and the lower side, it is possible to replace one mirror with the other one having a required color, that is, the front mirror with the rear one, according to seasons or weathers without a visit to a car maintenance center. This doubles the convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, it is possible to simultaneously adjust the angles of the lateral mirror and the lower mirror by only a single operation, and further to simultaneously adjust the angles of the lateral mirrors and the lower mirrors of left/right side view mirrors by only a single operation. This maximizes the convenience in use.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Mode for Invention</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Hereinafter, the configuration of a sectionalized and detachable side view mirror assembly for a vehicle, according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows views illustrating the external form of a sectionalized and detachable side view mirror assembly for a vehicle, according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and the ratios of angles and sizes of mirrors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a view illustrating the inserting and mounting of a total of 6 mirrors into a housing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a view illustrating the structure of a mirror mounting part shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, it can be seen that rectangular shaped mirrors <b>210</b> and <b>230</b> and a semicircular shaped mirror <b>220</b> are arranged with predetermined angles therebetween. In order to clarify the angles between the respective mirrors, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows side view mirror assemblies in which the upper one is a plan view, the left one is a left-side view, and the center one is a front view.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Meanwhile, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>shows a perspective view of the arrangement of such three mirrors, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>shows the state where such three mirrors are mounted within a housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>shows the external form of a right side view mirror assembly for a vehicle, and hereinafter, the description will be based on the right side view mirror assembly for convenience sake. A left side view mirror assembly, of course, has the same configuration as that of the right side view mirror assembly except for the direction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Meanwhile, it can be seen that the vehicle side view mirror assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>includes the housing <b>100</b> having a hollow section therewithin, mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> mounted within the housing, and the three mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> which are inserted and fixed within mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Herein, the mirror <b>210</b> at the upper left side is a central mirror which is used when a driver watches the rear side of the vehicle from the inside of the vehicle, the mirror <b>230</b> at the lower left is a lower mirror which is used when the drive watches the rear lower side of the vehicle during the backward movement, and the semicircular mirror <b>220</b> at the right side is a lateral mirror which is used to watch the short distance blind spot at the rear side of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that the mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> can be inserted into the inner spaces of front-side frames <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b> of the mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> by opening the frames <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> include hinges <b>330</b>, <b>430</b>, and <b>530</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> so as to open/close the front-side frames <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b>. Also, into the inner spaces of the front-side frames <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b>, the mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> are inserted. Herein, at the back surfaces of the front-side frames <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b>, fastening protrusions <b>311</b>, <b>411</b>, and <b>511</b> are formed. After being fitted by a force, the fastening protrusions <b>311</b>, <b>411</b>, and <b>511</b> are forcedly fitted in fastening grooves <b>321</b>, <b>421</b>, and <b>521</b> formed at corresponding positions of back panels <b>320</b>, <b>420</b>, and <b>520</b> and fix the mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> inserted into the inner spaces. In order to securely fix the mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b>, an additional rubber sealing (not shown) may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Meanwhile, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, since the space formed between the back panel <b>320</b>, <b>420</b>, and <b>520</b> and the front-side frame <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b> corresponds to the thickness of two overlapped mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b>, two overlapped mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> are inserted and then the front-side frames <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b> are closed and fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b>. In the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> are integrally fabricated. Preferably, the mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> are made of a plastic material, and are assembled by fastening the three front-side frames <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b> with respect to the hinges <b>330</b>, <b>430</b>, and <b>530</b> on one integrally injection-molded back panel and are inserted and fixed in such a manner that they completely cover the hollow section within the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Meanwhile, the housing <b>100</b> is fixedly provided on the lateral surface at the front side of the A pillar of the vehicle. Thus, the driver can open any one of the front-side frames <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b> and replace the mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> at any time, that is, before or after he gets into the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Herein, an important thing is that the mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> form predetermined angles therebetween. This allows the mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> inserted and fixed in the mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> to be fixed with the angles shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In other words, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the lateral mirror mounting part <b>400</b> is positioned adjacently to the right side (that is, the outside of the vehicle) with respect to the central mirror mounting part <b>300</b>, and is slightly curved toward the back of the vehicle. The interior angle formed by the central mirror mounting part <b>300</b> and the lateral mirror mounting part <b>400</b> ranges from about 175 to 177&#xb0;, which is lower than 180&#xb0;. This allows the driver to watch the blind spot through the lateral mirror <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Meanwhile, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the lower mirror mounting part <b>500</b> is slightly curved toward the inside of the housing <b>100</b> with respect to the central mirror mounting part <b>300</b>. In other words, the angle formed by the central mirror mounting part <b>300</b> and the lower mirror mounting part <b>500</b> ranges from about 183 to 185&#xb0;, which is higher than 180&#xb0;. In other words, the angle of 3 to 5&#xb0; formed toward the inside of the housing <b>100</b> allows the driver to more minutely watch the situation at the lower rear side of the vehicle from the inside of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Meanwhile, the central mirror <b>210</b> is mainly used by the driver during the driving of the vehicle, and thus the position and the size of the central mirror <b>210</b> are preferably different from those of the lateral mirror <b>220</b> and the lower mirror <b>230</b>. The size of the central mirror <b>210</b> is sufficiently secured without any inconvenience in usual driving only when the length (height) ratio of the central mirror <b>210</b> to the lower mirror <b>230</b> ranges from 7:3 to 8:2, and the breadth (width) ratio of the central mirror <b>210</b> to the lateral mirror <b>220</b> ranges from 7:3 to 8:2. Also, in the above described ratio range, the sizes of the lateral mirror <b>220</b> and the lower mirror <b>230</b> are not too small so that they do not interfere with the driving.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Meanwhile, the front-side frame <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b> forms a thin and long frame which allows the surface of the mirror <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> inserted therein to be easily exposed to the outside. Also, within the front-side frame <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b>, a rectangular or semicircular opening is formed. Meanwhile, such a front-side frame <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b> is preferably fabricated in such a manner that its width is as thin and narrow as possible within a limit of hardness capable of sufficiently securing the mirror <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b>. Especially, the surface of the front-side frame <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b> is coated with a reflective material so that it does not obstruct the driver's view during the driving.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the reflective material is not coated, the front-side frames <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>510</b> visually separate the three mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> from each other. This not only aggravates confusion, but also narrows the mirror's area itself.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Hereinafter, the configuration of a sectionalized and detachable side view mirror assembly for a vehicle, according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention, will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The description on structures overlapping those described above will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows views illustrating the angle adjustment of a three-part side view mirror assembly from the inside, according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows views illustrating the structure of the inside of a sectionalized and detachable side view mirror assembly for a vehicle, according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows views illustrating the structure and the operation principle of an actuator according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> are integrally fabricated so that the angles between the mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> are fixed, while in the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the angles between the mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> are electromotively adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the central mirror <b>210</b>, the lateral mirror <b>220</b>, and the lower mirror <b>230</b> are on the same plane. In other words, the mirrors form angles of 180&#xb0; therebetween. Meanwhile, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, when the driver operates an indoor remote control <b>600</b>, the central mirror <b>210</b> remains as it is, the lateral mirror <b>220</b> is inclined toward the back of the vehicle, and the lower mirror <b>230</b> is inclined toward the inside of the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Meanwhile, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, when the driver reversely operates the indoor remote control <b>600</b> in a state where the lateral mirror <b>220</b> and the lower mirror <b>230</b> are inclined at predetermined angles, the inclined angles of the mirrors <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> are unfolded so that the central mirror <b>210</b>, the lateral mirror <b>220</b>, and the lower mirror <b>230</b> are placed on the same plane as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Herein, an important thing is that the lateral mirror <b>220</b>, and the lower mirror <b>230</b> are simultaneously inclined with predetermined angles by the single operation of the indoor remote control <b>600</b>, in which the mirrors are inclined in opposite directions. In other words, the angle formed by the lateral mirror <b>220</b> and the central mirror <b>210</b> is lower than 180&#xb0; while the angle formed by the lower mirror <b>230</b> and the central mirror <b>210</b> is higher than 180&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Meanwhile, although the indoor remote control <b>600</b> is shown as a stick-type remote control moving in left and right directions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it may be fabricated as a one-touch button type remote control. In the button type remote control, when a button is pressed once, the mirrors may be inclined as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, and when the button is pressed again, the mirrors may be returned to their original positions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Accordingly, the driver, who usually drives in a state where the three mirrors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b> integrally form one flat mirror as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, may adjust the angles of the lateral mirror <b>220</b> and the lower mirror <b>230</b> to be an angle appropriate for driving by only a single operation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>at any time when he wants to watch the blind spot or determines that the adjustment is required for reasons of backward movement, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> showing the configuration of the central mirror mounting part <b>300</b>, the lateral mirror mounting part <b>400</b>, and the lower mirror mounting part <b>500</b>, the lateral mirror mounting part <b>400</b>, and the lower mirror mounting part <b>500</b>, which rotate at predetermined angles, except for the central mirror mounting part <b>300</b> inserted and fixed into the housing <b>100</b>, include rotation shafts <b>440</b>, and <b>540</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Meanwhile, within the housing <b>100</b>, a sheet-type vertical panel <b>110</b> crossing the hollow section is provided. In the example of the right side view mirror assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the central mirror mounting part <b>300</b> is provided and fixed in the upper portion of the left space of the vertical panel <b>110</b>. Also, in the lower mirror mounting part <b>500</b>, the rotation shafts <b>540</b> formed at the upper ends of the left and right lateral surfaces of the lower mirror mounting part <b>500</b> are fixed to the inner lateral surface at the left side of the housing <b>100</b> and to the vertical panel <b>110</b>, respectively, so that the lower mirror mounting part <b>500</b> can rotate on the rotation shaft as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>. The rotation shaft <b>540</b> is fixed by inserting both ends of the rotation shaft <b>540</b> by a predetermined length into a rotation shaft insertion hole (not shown) of the inner lateral surface of the housing <b>100</b>, and into a rotation shaft insertion hole <b>111</b> of the vertical panel <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The lateral mirror mounting part <b>400</b> is formed with the rotation shaft <b>440</b> at the right side end of the upper and lower surfaces thereof, and thus is fixed to the upper and lower surfaces at the inside of the housing and can rotate on the rotation shaft. The rotation shaft <b>440</b> is fixed by inserting both ends of the rotation shaft <b>440</b> by a predetermined length into rotation shaft insertion holes (not shown) in the upper and lower surfaces at the inside of the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an actuator <b>700</b> includes a motor <b>710</b> operated by the indoor remote control <b>600</b>, and a gear box <b>720</b> transferring the rotary motion of the motor, which are mounted at the back of the mirror mounting parts <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> within the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The lower mirror mounting part <b>500</b> has a spur gear <b>550</b> extending to its rear lower side. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the motor <b>710</b> rotates counterclockwise, the lower mirror mounting part <b>500</b> draws the rear lower portion due to the spur gear <b>550</b> connected to the gear box <b>720</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, the lower mirror mounting part <b>500</b> is inclined toward the inside of the housing <b>100</b> with a predetermined angle.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Meanwhile, the lateral mirror mounting part <b>400</b> has a spur gear <b>450</b> extending to its rear left side. As described above, when the motor <b>710</b> rotates counterclockwise, the lateral mirror mounting part <b>400</b> pushes the rear left portion due to the spur gear <b>450</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, the lateral mirror mounting part <b>400</b> is inclined toward the back of the vehicle with a predetermined angle.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Accordingly, by only a single operation of the indoor remote control <b>600</b>, the lateral mirror <b>220</b> and the lower mirror <b>230</b> are simultaneously inclined with predetermined angles in opposite directions, or are reversely unfolded.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Furthermore, by only a single operation of the indoor remote control <b>600</b>, the lateral mirrors <b>220</b> and the lower mirrors <b>230</b> included in a pair of right and left side view mirror assemblies may be simultaneously inclined with predetermined angles in opposite directions, or may be reversely unfolded. Of course, since the angles between the driver and the left/right side view mirror assemblies are different from each other, the angles of the left side view mirror assembly and the right side view mirror assembly have to be separately adjusted. However, the angles formed by the central mirror <b>210</b>, the lateral mirror <b>220</b> and the lower mirror <b>230</b> may be adjusted to be the same angles for both the right side view mirror assembly and the left side view mirror assembly, thereby achieving the convenience in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the above description, the shape of the lateral mirror is semicircular. However, herein, the semicircular shape does not necessarily indicate a shape formed by geometrically halving a circle, and may be any shape as long as it is a figure having a straight line at one side and one round curved line joining one end of the straight line to the other end.</p>
