<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a light guide plate and a planar lighting device that may be used in liquid crystal displays and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A liquid crystal display uses a planar lighting device (a backlight unit) which illuminates a liquid crystal display panel by irradiation of light from the back side of the liquid crystal display panel. The backlight unit is configured using a light guide plate for diffusing light emitted from an illumination light source to illuminate the liquid crystal display panel and parts such as a prism sheet and a diffusion sheet for making outgoing light from the light guide plate uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, large-sized liquid crystal televisions predominantly use a so-called underneath type backlight unit including a light guide plate disposed immediately above an illumination light source. This type of backlight unit ensures uniform light amount distribution and necessary luminance by disposing a plurality of cold cathode tubes used as light sources behind the liquid crystal display panel and providing the inside of the casing with white reflection surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the underneath type backlight unit requires a thickness of about 30 mm in a direction perpendicular to the liquid crystal display panel in order to make the light amount distribution uniform and further reduction in thickness is difficult to achieve.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, an exemplary backlight unit that allows the thickness reduction includes one using a light guide plate which receives light emitted from an illumination light source, guides the received light in predetermined directions and emits the guided light through a light exit surface that is different from the surface through which the light entered.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As the backlight unit using the light guide plate as described above, there has been proposed a backlight unit of a type using a light guide plate in plate form which is obtained by incorporating scattering particles for scattering light in a transparent resin and which receives light through its lateral faces and emits the received light through the front face.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, JP 7-36037 A describes a light scattering and guiding light source device comprising a light scattering guide having at least one light incidence surface region and at least one light exit surface region and light source means for light incidence through the light incidence surface region, the light scattering guide having a region that has a tendency to decrease in thickness with increasing distance from the light incidence surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">JP 8-248233 A describes a surface light source device comprising a light scattering guide, a prism sheet provided on the side of the light scattering guide closer to the light exit surface, and a reflector provided on the back side of the light scattering guide.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, the backlight unit of, for example, a tandem type using a light guide plate of which the thickness decreases with increasing distance from the light source suffers from inferior light use efficiency to the underneath type in relation to the relative dimensions of the cold cathode tubes and the reflector although the backlight unit can be reduced in thickness. Further, in cases where the light guide plate used is so shaped as to receive cold cathode tubes in grooves formed therein, the light guide plate can be shaped in such a manner that the thickness decreases with increasing distance from the cold cathode tubes but the reduction in the thickness of the light guide plate increases the luminance just above the cold cathode tubes disposed in the grooves, thus causing uneven luminance on the light exit surface to stand out. In addition, the light guide plates of these types each have a complex shape and therefore increase machining costs, thus leading to increased costs when used in the backlight of a large-sized liquid crystal television having a screen size of, for example, 37 inches or more and in particular 50 inches or more.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">JP 2003-90919 A, JP 2004-171948 A, JP 2005-108676 A and JP 2005-302322 A propose light guide plates of which the thickness is increased with increasing distance from the light incidence surface in order to achieve stable manufacturing while suppressing luminance unevenness (unevenness in the amount of light) using multireflection. However, these light guide plates are transparent members and allow light received from the light source to penetrate to the opposite end side and therefore need to have prisms or dot patterns on the lower surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">There is also a method in which a reflection member is provided at the opposite end from the light incidence surface to emit the incident light through the light exit surface by multireflection. However, an increase in size involves increases in thickness and weight of the light guide plate and the costs are also increased. Further, the light sources are projected into the light guide plate and perceived as such to cause uneven luminance and/or uneven illuminance.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the lighting device described in JP 8-220346 A, the reflection surface is provided with serration grooves to serve as the diffuse reflection surface and therefore the light guide plate is to be increased in thickness in order to get larger in size. This involves an increase in weight and a complicated machining process, thus leading to increased costs.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The planar lighting device described in JP 2009-117349 A includes the light guide plate of which the light exit surface is concave. However, scattering particles are uniformly mixed in the whole of the light guide plate, which makes it difficult to further reduce the thickness in terms of optical properties. In addition, the light incidence surface is small, which hinders improvement of the light use efficiency (light incidence efficiency) without increasing the weight of the light guide plate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The light guide plate described in JP 2009-117357 A is certainly a two-layer light guide plate in which the interface between the first layer and the second layer is inclined in the directions approaching the light exit surface with increasing distance from the ends toward the center of the light guide plate so that the cross section is in the shape of an isosceles triangle. However, adjustment of the shape of the second layer to optimize the amount of outgoing light has not been taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also in the planar light source device described in JP 4127897 B (JP 11-345512 A), adjustment of the shape of the scattering light guide region to optimize the amount of outgoing light has not been taken into account. Further, a large-sized light guide plate expands and contracts greatly due to ambient temperature and humidity changes and repeats expansion and contraction of 5 mm or more in a size of about 50 inches. Therefore, it is not known on which side a flat light guide plate warps, on the light exit surface side or the reflection surface side. If the light guide plate warps on the light exit surface side, the light guide plate expands and contracts to push up the liquid crystal panel to cause pool-like unevenness in light emitted from the liquid crystal display. To avoid this, one may consider preliminarily providing a great distance between the liquid crystal panel and the backlight unit. However, this may cause a problem that it is impossible to reduce the thickness of the liquid crystal display.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, when a backlight unit is to be made thinner and larger, the particle concentration of the scattering particles needs to be reduced in order to guide the admitted light deep into the light guide plate but the reduced particle concentration of the scattering particles leads to insufficient diffusion of incident light in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces. Therefore, light emitted from the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces may have visible bright lines (dark lines, unevenness) which are attributable to such causes as the intervals at which the light sources are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">On the other hand, a high particle concentration of the scattering particles in the regions near the light incidence surfaces causes light having entered through the light incidence surfaces to be reflected in the regions near the light incidence surfaces. Therefore, the incident light may exit through the light incidence surfaces as return light or outgoing light through the regions near the light incidence surfaces which is not used because the regions are covered with the housing may increase.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An object of the present invention is to solve the problems associated with the foregoing prior art and to provide a large-sized thin light guide plate which is high in light use efficiency, and is capable of emitting light with reduced unevenness in luminance and obtaining a so-called convex or bell-shaped brightness distribution, that is, such a distribution that an area around the center of the screen is brighter than the periphery as required of a flat large-screen liquid crystal television.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another object of the invention is to provide a light guide plate capable of reducing return light, which is light outgoing through the light incidence surfaces after it once enters the light guide plate, and outgoing light through the regions in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces which is not used because the regions are covered with the housing, whereupon the use efficiency of outgoing light through the effective region of the light exit surface can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Still another object of the invention is to provide a light guide plate capable of sufficiently diffusing incident light in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces to prevent outgoing light through the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces from having visible bright lines (dark lines, unevenness) which are attributable to such causes as intervals at which the light sources are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to achieve the above objects, the invention provides a light guide plate comprising: a rectangular light exit surface; at least one light incidence surface which is provided on at least one end side of the light exit surface and through which light enters; a rear surface on an opposite side from the light exit surface; and scattering particles dispersed in the light guide plate, wherein the light guide plate includes two or more layers superposed on each other in a direction substantially perpendicular to the light exit surface and containing the scattering particles at different particle concentrations, wherein the two or more layers include a first layer disposed on a side closer to the light exit surface and a second layer disposed on a side closer to the rear surface than the first layer and Npo and Npr satisfy a relationship expressed by Npr&#x3e;Npo where Npo represents a particle concentration of the first layer and Npr represents a particle concentration of the second layer, wherein thicknesses of the first and second layers in the direction substantially perpendicular to the light exit surface change so that a combined particle concentration of the light guide plate has, in a direction perpendicular to the at least one light incidence surface, a first local maximum value on at least one side closer to the at least one light incidence surface and a second local maximum value located at a position farther from the at least one light incidence surface than at least one position of the first local maximum value and being larger than the first local maximum value, whereupon the thickness of the second layer continuously changes so that the second layer increases in thickness with increasing distance from the at least one light incidence surface, then decreases in thickness and subsequently increases in thickness again, and wherein an interface between the first layer and the second layer in a region corresponding to an area from the at least one position of the first local maximum value to a position of the second local maximum value includes at least one curved surface concave toward the light exit surface on at least one side on which the combined particle concentration takes the first local maximum value, and a curved surface smoothly connected to the at least one concave curved surface and convex toward the light exit surface on a side on which the combined particle concentration takes the second local maximum value such that the combined particle concentration smoothly changes from the at least one position of the first local maximum value to the position of the second local maximum value.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the light exit surface, at least the region corresponding to the area from the at least one position of the first local maximum value to the position of the second local maximum value is preferably an effective screen area.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the at least one light incidence surface comprises two light incidence surfaces provided on two opposite end sides of the light exit surface and the combined particle concentration has the first local maximum value on both sides closer to the two light incidence surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The second layer preferably has a maximum thickness at a central portion of the light exit surface.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably, the at least one light incidence surface is provided on one end side of the light exit surface and the combined particle concentration has the first local maximum value at one position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Npo and Npr preferably fall within ranges satisfying Npo=0 wt % and 0.01 wt %&#x3c;Npr&#x3c;0.8 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Alternatively, Npo and Npr preferably fall within ranges satisfying 0 wt %&#x3c;Npo&#x3c;0.15 wt % and Npo&#x3c;Npr&#x3c;0.8 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The rear surface is preferably a flat surface parallel to the light exit surface.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In order to achieve the above objects, the invention provides a planar lighting device comprising: the light guide plate described above; at least one light source disposed so as to face the at least one light incidence surface of the light guide plate; and a housing containing the light guide plate and the at least one light source and having an opening on a side closer to the light exit surface of the light guide plate, the opening being smaller than the light exit surface, wherein the first local maximum value of the combined particle concentration is located at a position corresponding to a vicinity of an edge of the opening of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the invention, the light guide plate has a thin shape, is high in light use efficiency, and is capable of emitting light with reduced unevenness in luminance and obtaining a so-called convex or bell-shaped brightness distribution, that is, such a distribution that an area around the center of the screen is brighter than the periphery as required of a flat large-screen liquid crystal television.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the invention, the scattering particle concentration in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces can be reduced to decrease return light, which is light outgoing through the light incidence surfaces, and outgoing light through the regions in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces which is not used because the regions are covered with the housing, whereupon the use efficiency of outgoing light through the effective region of the light exit surface can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the invention, the combined particle concentration has the first local maximum value in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces and hence incident light through the light incidence surfaces can be sufficiently diffused to prevent bright lines (dark lines, unevenness), which are attributable to such causes as intervals at which the light sources are disposed, from occurring in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The drive unit <b>14</b> applies a voltage to transparent electrodes in the liquid crystal display panel <b>12</b> to change the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules, thereby controlling the transmittance of light passing through the liquid crystal display panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The backlight unit <b>20</b> is a lighting device for illuminating the whole surface of the liquid crystal display panel <b>12</b> from behind the liquid crystal display panel <b>12</b> and comprises a light exit surface <b>24</b><i>a </i>of which the shape is substantially the same as an image display surface of the liquid crystal display panel <b>12</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the light source <b>28</b> comprises a plurality of light emitting diode chips (referred to below as &#x201c;LED chips&#x201d;) <b>50</b> and a light source support <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The LED chip <b>50</b> is a chip of a light emitting diode emitting blue light, which has a phosphor applied on the surface thereof. It has a light-emitting face <b>58</b> with a predetermined area through which white light is emitted.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Specifically, when blue light emitted through the surface of the light emitting diode of the LED chip <b>50</b> passes through the phosphor, the phosphor emits fluorescence.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An example of the LED chip <b>50</b> includes a chip obtained by applying a YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) phosphor to the surface of a GaN light emitting diode, an InGaN light emitting diode, and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The light source support <b>52</b> is formed of a metal having high heat conductivity such as copper or aluminum and also serves as a heat sink which absorbs heat generated from the LED chips <b>50</b> and releases the generated heat to the outside.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the LED chips <b>50</b> according to this embodiment each have such a rectangular shape that the sides in a direction perpendicular to the direction in which the LED chips <b>50</b> are arrayed are shorter than the sides lying in the direction in which the LED chips <b>50</b> are arrayed, that is, the sides lying in the direction of thickness of the light guide plate <b>30</b> to be described later (the direction perpendicular to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a</i>) are shorter sides. In other words, the LED chips <b>50</b> each have a shape satisfying b&#x3e;a where &#x201c;a&#x201d; denotes the length of the side in a direction perpendicular to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> and &#x201c;b&#x201d; denotes the length of the side in the array direction. Now, given &#x201c;q&#x201d; as the distance by which the arrayed LED chips <b>50</b> are spaced apart from each other, then q&#x3e;b holds. Thus, the length &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the side of the LED chips <b>50</b> perpendicular to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b>, the length &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the side in the array direction, and the distance &#x201c;q&#x201d; by which the LED chips <b>50</b> are spaced apart from each other preferably have a relationship satisfying q&#x3e;b&#x3e;a.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The LED chips <b>50</b> each having a rectangular shape allow a thinner design of the light source to be achieved while keeping the output of a large amount of light. A thinner light source <b>28</b>, in turn, permits the reduction of the thickness of the backlight unit. Further, the number of LED chips that need to be arranged can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">While the LED chips <b>50</b> each preferably have a rectangular shape with the shorter sides lying in the direction of the thickness of the light guide plate <b>30</b> for a thinner design of the light source <b>28</b>, the invention is not limited thereto and LED chips having various shapes including a square shape, a circular shape, a polygonal shape and an elliptical shape may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Next, the light guide plate <b>30</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic perspective view showing the shape of the light guide plate.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B and <b>5</b>, the light guide plate <b>30</b> includes the rectangular light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a</i>; the two light incidence surfaces (the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d</i>) formed at both ends on the longer sides of the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>and substantially perpendicular to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a</i>; and a flat rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>located on the opposite side from the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a</i>, that is, on the back side of the light guide plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The two light sources <b>28</b> mentioned above are disposed so as to face the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b>, respectively. In this embodiment, the light-emitting face <b>58</b> of each LED chip <b>50</b> in the light sources <b>28</b> has substantially the same length as the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d </i>in the direction substantially perpendicular to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thus, the backlight unit <b>20</b> has the two light sources <b>28</b> disposed so as to sandwich the light guide plate <b>30</b> therebetween. In other words, the light guide plate <b>30</b> is disposed between the two light sources <b>28</b> so that the former faces the latter at a predetermined distance from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The light guide plate <b>30</b> is formed by kneading and dispersing scattering particles for light scattering into a transparent resin. Exemplary materials of the transparent resin that may be used for the light guide plate <b>30</b> include optically transparent resins such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PP (polypropylene), PC (polycarbonate), PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), benzyl methacrylate, MS resin, and COP (cycloolefin polymer). Silicone particles (e.g., TOSPEARL (registered trademark)) and other particles made of silica, zirconia and a dielectric polymer may be used for the scattering particles to be kneaded and dispersed in the light guide plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The light guide plate <b>30</b> is of a two-layer structure including a first layer <b>60</b> on the side closer to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>and a second layer <b>62</b> on the side closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b</i>. When the boundary between the first layer <b>60</b> and the second layer <b>62</b> is referred to as &#x201c;interface z&#x201d;, the first layer <b>60</b> has a sectional region surrounded by the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a</i>, the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c</i>, the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d </i>and the interface z. On the other hand, the second layer <b>62</b> is a layer adjacent to the first layer on the side closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>and has a sectional region surrounded by the interface z and the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Now, the particle concentration of the scattering particles in the first layer <b>60</b> and that of the scattering particles in the second layer <b>62</b> are denoted by Npo and Npr, respectively. Then, Npo and Npr have a relationship expressed by Npo&#x3c;Npr. Thus, in the light guide plate <b>30</b>, the second layer on the side closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>contains the scattering particles at a higher particle concentration than the first layer on the side closer to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">When seen from the cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the light incidence surface, the interface z between the first layer <b>60</b> and the second layer <b>62</b> continuously changes so that the second layer <b>62</b> decreases in thickness from the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>at the bisector &#x3b1; (i.e., the central portion of the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a</i>) toward the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d</i>, then increases in thickness in the vicinities of the light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d</i>, and then continuously changes so that the second layer <b>62</b> decreases in thickness again.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">More specifically, the interface z includes a curved surface convex toward the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>in the central portion of the light guide plate <b>30</b>, concave curved surfaces smoothly connected to the convex curved surface, and concave curved surfaces connected to the concave curved surfaces and communicating with ends of the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>on the side closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The thickness of the second layer <b>62</b> at the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>is zero.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">By thus continuously changing the thickness of the second layer containing scattering particles at a higher particle concentration than that in the first layer <b>60</b> such that the second layer has a first local maximum value as a result of an increased thickness in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces and a second local maximum value at the central portion of the light guide plate having the largest thickness, the combined particle concentration of the scattering particles is changed so as to have the first local maximum value in the vicinity of each of the first and second light incidence surfaces (<b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d</i>) and the second local maximum value at the central portion of the light guide plate, the second local maximum value being larger than the first local maximum value.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The combined particle concentration as used herein denotes a concentration of scattering particles expressed using the amount of scattering particles added or combined in a direction substantially perpendicular to the light exit surface at a position spaced apart from one light incidence surface toward the other on the assumption that the light guide plate is a flat plate having the thickness at the light incidence surfaces throughout the light guide plate. In other words, the combined particle concentration denotes a quantity per unit volume of scattering particles or a weight percentage with respect to the base material of scattering particles added in a direction substantially perpendicular to the light exit surface at a position spaced apart from the light incidence surface on the assumption that the light guide plate is a flat light guide plate which has the thickness at the light incidence surfaces throughout the light guide plate and in which the concentration is the same.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The first local maximum value in the thickness of the second layer <b>62</b> (combined particle concentration) is located at the edge of an opening <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the upper housing <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The regions from the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>to their corresponding positions of the first local maximum value are located outside the opening <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the upper housing <b>44</b>, that is, in the frame portion forming the opening <b>44</b><i>a</i>, and therefore does not contribute to the emission of light as the backlight unit <b>20</b>. In other words, the regions from the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>to their corresponding positions of the first local maximum value are so-called mixing zones M for diffusing light having entered through the light incidence surfaces. The region which is closer to the central portion of the light guide plate than the mixing zones M, that is, the region corresponding to the opening <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the upper housing <b>44</b> is an effective screen area E and is a region contributing to the emission of light as the backlight unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">By thus adjusting the combined particle concentration of the light guide plate <b>30</b> (thickness of the second layer) so that the concentration has the second local maximum value which is the largest in the central portion of the light guide plate, incident light through the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>can travel to positions farther from the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>even if the light guide plate is large and thin, whereupon outgoing light may have a luminance distribution which is high in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">By adjusting the combined particle concentration so as to have the first local maximum value in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d</i>, incident light through the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>can be sufficiently diffused in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces to prevent outgoing light through the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces from having visible bright lines (dark lines, unevenness) which are attributable to such causes as intervals at which the light sources are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">By adjusting the combined particle concentration so that the regions on the sides closer to the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>than the positions where the combined particle concentration takes the first local maximum value have a lower combined particle concentration than the first local maximum value, return light, which is light outgoing through the light incidence surfaces after it once enters the light guide plate, and outgoing light through the regions in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces (mixing zones M) which is not used because the regions are covered with the housing can be reduced to improve the use efficiency of outgoing light through the effective region of the light exit surface (effective screen area E).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">By setting the positions where the combined particle concentration takes the first local maximum value on the sides closer to the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>from the opening <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the upper housing <b>44</b>, outgoing light through the regions in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces (mixing zones M) which is not used because the regions are covered with the housing can be reduced to improve the use efficiency of outgoing light through the effective region of the light exit surface (effective screen area E).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The adjustment of the shape of the interface z enables the luminance distribution (concentration distribution of the scattering particles) as well to be set as desired to improve the efficiency to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition, since the particle concentration of the layer on the side closer to the light exit surface (first layer) is reduced, the total amount of the scattering particles used can be reduced, thus leading to cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the illustrated embodiment, the combined particle concentration is adjusted so as to have the first local maximum value at the edge of the opening <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the upper housing <b>44</b>. However, this is not the sole case of the invention and the combined particle concentration may have the first local maximum value at positions inside the opening <b>44</b><i>a </i>or in the frame portion of the surface of the upper housing <b>44</b> having the opening <b>44</b><i>a </i>(outside the opening <b>44</b><i>a</i>) as long as the first local maximum value of the combined particle concentration is located near the edge of the opening <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the upper housing <b>44</b>. In other words, the combined particle concentration may have the first local maximum value at positions in the effective screen area E or at positions in the mixing zones M.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Although the light guide plate <b>30</b> is divided into the first layer <b>60</b> and the second layer <b>62</b> by the interface z, the first layer <b>60</b> and the second layer <b>62</b> are obtained by dispersing the same scattering particles in the same transparent resin and have an integrated structure, the only difference being the particle concentration. That is, the light guide plate <b>30</b> has different particle concentrations in the respective regions on both sides of the interface z which serves as a reference but the interface z is a virtual face and the first layer <b>60</b> is integrated with the second layer <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The light guide plate <b>30</b> as described above may be manufactured using an extrusion molding method or an injection molding method.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the light guide plate <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, light emitted from the light sources <b>28</b> and allowed to enter the light guide plate <b>30</b> through the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d </i>is scattered by scatterers (scattering particles) contained inside the light guide plate <b>30</b> as it travels through the inside of the light guide plate <b>30</b>, and is emitted through the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>directly or after having been reflected by the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Then, part of light may leak through the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>but the light which leaked out is then reflected by a reflector <b>34</b> disposed on the side of the light guide plate <b>30</b> closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>to enter the light guide plate <b>30</b> again. The reflector <b>34</b> will be described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Further, the particle concentration Npo of the scattering particles in the first layer <b>60</b> and the particle concentration Npr of the scattering particles in the second layer <b>62</b> preferably satisfy the relationships of 0 wt %&#x3c;Npo&#x3c;0.15 wt % and Npo&#x3c;Npr&#x3c;0.8 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">If the first layer <b>60</b> and the second layer <b>62</b> of the light guide plate <b>30</b> satisfy the above relationships, the light guide plate <b>30</b> can guide the incident light to the inside (center) of the light guide plate <b>30</b> without scattering it so much in the first layer <b>60</b> having a lower particle concentration, and the light is scattered by the second layer having a higher particle concentration as it approaches the center of the light guide plate, thus enabling the amount of light emitted through the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>to be increased. In brief, the illuminance distribution which is high in the middle at a preferable ratio can be obtained while further enhancing the light use efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The particle concentration [wt %] as used herein denotes a ratio of the weight of the scattering particles to the weight of the base material.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Further, the particle concentration Npo of the scattering particles in the first layer <b>60</b> and the particle concentration Npr of the scattering particles in the second layer <b>62</b> preferably satisfy the relationships of Npo=0 wt % and 0.01 wt %&#x3c;Npr&#x3c;0.8 wt %. In other words, the light guide plate may be configured such that the scattering particles are not dispersed in the first layer <b>60</b> by kneading to guide incident light deep into the light guide plate <b>30</b>, and the scattering particles are only kneaded and dispersed in the second layer <b>62</b> to scatter the light more as it comes closer to the center of the light guide plate, thereby increasing the amount of light emitted through the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Since the first layer <b>60</b> and the second layer <b>62</b> of the light guide plate <b>30</b> satisfy the above relationships, the illuminance distribution which is high in the middle at a preferable ratio can be obtained while further enhancing the light use efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The thickness of the light guide plate of the invention is not particularly limited. The light guide plate may be several millimeters in thickness or may be a so-called light guide sheet which is a film with a thickness of 1 mm or less. A film-like light guide plate having two layers which contain scattering particles kneaded and dispersed therein at different particle concentrations may be produced by a method which involves forming as the first layer a base film containing scattering particles by extrusion molding or other process, applying a monomer resin liquid (transparent resin liquid) having scattering particles dispersed therein to the formed base film, and irradiating the base film with ultraviolet light or visible light to cure the monomer resin liquid to thereby form the second layer having a desired particle concentration, thus producing a film-like light guide plate. Alternatively, the film-like light guide plate may be produced by two-layer extrusion molding.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Also in cases where the light guide plate is a film-like light guide sheet with a thickness of 1 mm or less, formation of the light guide plate with two layers enables the illuminance distribution which is high in the middle at a preferable ratio to be obtained while further enhancing the light use efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the illustrated light guide plate <b>30</b>, the interface z has such a shape as to form a curved surface which is concave toward the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>in each of the regions from the positions of the first local maximum value to their corresponding light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d</i>, and which communicates with ends of the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b</i>. However, the invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6E</figref> are schematic views showing other examples of the light guide plate of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">By forming the interface z so as to have such a shape that the second layer decreases in thickness from the positions of the first local maximum value toward the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>as in the light guide plates shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6E</figref>, the regions from the positions of the first local maximum value to the light incidence surfaces <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>30</b><i>d </i>(mixing zones M) can be adjusted to have a lower combined particle concentration than the first local maximum value to reduce return light, which is light outgoing through the light incidence surfaces after it once enters the light guide plate, and outgoing light through the regions in the vicinities of the light incidence surfaces (mixing zones M) which is not used because the regions are covered with the housing, whereupon the use efficiency of outgoing light through the effective region of the light exit surface (effective screen area E) can be improved.</p>

The materials of the prism sheet and the diffusion sheets are also not particularly limited, and use may be made of various optical members, as long as they can further reduce the unevenness in luminance and illuminance of the illumination light emitted through the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">For example, the optical members used in addition to or instead of the above-described diffusion sheets and prism sheet may be transmittance adjusting members in which a large number of transmittance adjusters consisting of diffusion reflectors are disposed according to the luminance unevenness and the illuminance unevenness. Further, the optical member unit may be of a two-layer structure including one prism sheet and one diffusion sheet or including two diffusion sheets only.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Next, the reflector <b>34</b> of the lighting device main body <b>24</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The reflector <b>34</b> is provided to reflect light leaking through the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> back into the light guide plate <b>30</b> and helps enhance the light use efficiency. The reflector <b>34</b> has a shape corresponding to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> and is formed so as to cover the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b</i>. In this embodiment, the reflector <b>34</b> is formed into a shape contouring the profile of the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> having a flat plane, that is, having a linear shape in cross section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The reflector <b>34</b> may be formed of any material, as long as it can reflect light leaking through the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b>. The reflector <b>34</b> may be formed, for example, of a resin sheet produced by kneading a filler with PET or PP (polypropylene) and then drawing the resultant mixture to form voids therein for increased reflectance; a sheet with a specular surface formed by, for example, aluminum vapor deposition on the surface of a transparent or white resin sheet; a metal foil such as an aluminum foil or a resin sheet carrying a metal foil; or a thin metal sheet having a sufficient reflectivity on the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Upper light guide reflectors <b>36</b> are disposed between the light guide plate <b>30</b> and the diffusion sheet <b>32</b><i>a</i>, i.e., on the side closer to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b>, so as to cover the light sources <b>28</b> and the end portions of the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> (i.e., the end portion on the side closer to the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the end portion on the side closer to the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d</i>). In other words, each upper light guide reflector <b>36</b> is disposed so as to cover an area extending from part of the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> to part of the light source support <b>52</b> of the light source <b>28</b> in a direction parallel to the direction of the optical axis. Briefly, the two upper light guide reflectors <b>36</b> are disposed at both end portions of the light guide plate <b>30</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">By thus providing the upper light guide reflectors <b>36</b>, light emitted from the light sources <b>28</b> can be prevented from failing to enter the light guide plate <b>30</b> and leaking toward the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Thus, light emitted from the light sources <b>28</b> can efficiently enter the light guide plate <b>30</b> through the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> to enhance the light use efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Lower light guide reflectors <b>38</b> are disposed on the side closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> so as to cover part of the light sources <b>28</b>. Ends of the lower light guide reflectors <b>38</b> closer to the center of the light guide plate <b>30</b> are connected to the reflector <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The upper light guide reflectors <b>36</b> and the lower light guide reflectors <b>38</b> may be formed of any of the above-mentioned various materials used to form the reflector <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">By providing the lower light guide reflectors <b>38</b>, light emitted from the light sources <b>28</b> can be prevented from failing to enter the light guide plate <b>30</b> and leaking toward the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Thus, light emitted from the light sources <b>28</b> can efficiently enter the light guide plate <b>30</b> through the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> to enhance the light use efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">While the reflector <b>34</b> is connected to the lower light guide reflectors <b>38</b> in the embodiment under discussion, this is not the sole case and they may be used as separate members.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The shapes and the widths of the upper light guide reflectors <b>36</b> and the lower light guide reflectors <b>38</b> are not particularly limited as long as light emitted from the light sources <b>28</b> can be reflected toward and allowed to enter through the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>or the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d </i>and the light having entered the light guide plate <b>30</b> can be guided to the central side of the light guide plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the embodiment under discussion, the upper light guide reflectors <b>36</b> are disposed between the light guide plate <b>30</b> and the diffusion sheet <b>32</b><i>a</i>. However, the upper light guide reflectors <b>36</b> may be disposed at any position without particular limitation. It may be disposed between the sheet members constituting the optical member unit <b>32</b> or between the optical member unit <b>32</b> and the upper housing <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Next, the housing <b>26</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the housing <b>26</b> accommodates and supports the lighting device main body <b>24</b> and holds and secures the lighting device main body <b>24</b> from the side closer to the light exit surface <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the side closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b>. The housing <b>26</b> comprises the lower housing <b>42</b>, the upper housing <b>44</b>, the bent members <b>46</b> and the support members <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The lower housing <b>42</b> is open at the top and has a shape formed by a bottom section and lateral sections provided upright on the four sides of the bottom section. In brief, it is substantially in the shape of a rectangular box open on one side. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the lower housing <b>42</b> supports the lighting device main body <b>24</b> placed therein from above on the bottom section and the lateral sections and covers the faces of the lighting device main body <b>24</b> except the light exit surface <b>24</b><i>a</i>, i.e., the face opposite from the light exit surface <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the lighting device main body <b>24</b> (rear surface) and the lateral faces.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The upper housing <b>44</b> has the shape of a rectangular box; it has at the top a rectangular opening which is smaller than the rectangular light exit surface <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the lighting device main body <b>24</b> and is open at the bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the upper housing <b>44</b> is placed from above the lighting device main body <b>24</b> and the lower housing <b>42</b> (from the light exit surface side) to cover the lighting device main body <b>24</b> and the lower housing <b>42</b> holding the main body therein, including the four lateral sections.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The bent members <b>46</b> have a concave (U-shaped) sectional profile that is always identical throughout their length. That is, each bent member <b>46</b> is a bar-shaped member having a U-shaped profile in cross section perpendicular to the direction in which they extends.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bent members <b>46</b> are fitted between the lateral faces of the lower housing <b>42</b> and the lateral faces of the upper housing <b>44</b> such that the outer face of one of the parallel sections of the U-shaped member is connected with the lateral section of the lower housing <b>42</b> whereas the outer face of the other parallel section is connected with the lateral section of the upper housing <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Various known methods including a method using bolts and nuts and a method using an adhesive may be used to connect the lower housing <b>42</b> with the bent members <b>46</b> and the bent members <b>46</b> with the upper housing <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">By thus providing the bent members <b>46</b> between the lower housing <b>42</b> and the upper housing <b>44</b>, the rigidity of the housing <b>26</b> can be increased to prevent the light guide plate <b>30</b> from warping. As a result, for example, light having no or reduced luminance unevenness and illuminance unevenness can be efficiently emitted. Further, even in cases where the light guide plate used is liable to develop a warp, the warp can be corrected more reliably or the warping of the light guide plate can be prevented more reliably, thereby allowing light having no or reduced luminance unevenness and illuminance unevenness to be emitted through the light exit surface.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Various materials such as metals and resins may be used to form the upper housing, the lower housing and the bent members of the housing. The material used is preferably light in weight and very strong.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">While the bent members are provided as separate members in the embodiment under discussion, they may be integrated with the upper housing or the lower housing. Alternatively, the housing may not have the bent members.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The support members <b>48</b> are rod members each having an identical shape in cross section perpendicular to the direction in which they extend.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the support members <b>48</b> are provided between the reflector <b>34</b> and the lower housing <b>42</b>, more specifically, between the reflector <b>34</b> and the lower housing <b>42</b> at positions corresponding to the ends of the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> on the sides closer to the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d</i>, respectively. The support members <b>48</b> thus secure the light guide plate <b>30</b> and the reflector <b>34</b> to the lower housing <b>42</b> and support them.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The light guide plate <b>30</b> can be brought into close contact with the reflector <b>34</b> by supporting the reflector <b>34</b> with the support members <b>48</b>. Furthermore, the light guide plate <b>30</b> and the reflector <b>34</b> can be secured to the lower housing <b>42</b> at predetermined positions.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">While the support members are provided as separate members in the embodiment under discussion, the invention is not limited thereto and they may be integrated with the lower housing <b>42</b> or the reflector <b>34</b>. To be more specific, projections may be formed in part of the lower housing <b>42</b> to serve as support members or projections may be formed in part of the reflector <b>34</b> to serve as support members.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The location of the support members is also not particularly limited and they may be provided at any positions between the reflector and the lower housing. However, to stably hold the light guide plate, the support members are preferably provided on the end sides of the light guide plate, that is, near the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d </i>in the embodiment under discussion.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The shape of the support members <b>48</b> is not particularly limited and the support members <b>48</b> may have any of various shapes. The support members <b>48</b> may also be formed of various materials. For example, two or more support members may be provided at predetermined intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Further, the support members may have such a shape as to fill the whole space formed by the reflector and the lower housing. More specifically, the support members may have such a shape that the side thereof facing the reflector has a contour following the surface of the reflector and the side thereof facing the lower housing has a contour following the surface of the lower housing. In cases where the whole surface of the reflector is supported by the support members, the reflector can be reliably prevented from being separated from the light guide plate, and light reflected by the reflector can be prevented from causing luminance unevenness and illuminance unevenness.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The backlight unit <b>20</b> is basically configured as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In the backlight unit <b>20</b>, light emitted from the light sources <b>28</b> provided on both sides of the light guide plate <b>30</b> enters through the light incidence surfaces (the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>d</i>) of the light guide plate <b>30</b>. The incident light through the respective surfaces is scattered by scatterers contained inside the light guide plate <b>30</b> as the light travels inside the light guide plate <b>30</b> and is emitted through the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>directly or after being reflected by the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Then, part of the light leaking through the rear surface is reflected by the reflector <b>34</b> to enter the light guide plate <b>30</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Thus, light emitted through the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>30</b> is transmitted through the optical member <b>32</b> and emitted through the light exit surface <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the lighting device main body <b>24</b> to illuminate the liquid crystal display panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The liquid crystal display panel <b>12</b> uses the drive unit <b>14</b> to control the light transmittance according to the position so as to display characters, figures, images, etc. on the surface of the liquid crystal display panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Although each of the light guide plates according to the above embodiments is of a type comprising two light sources disposed on two light incidence surfaces so that light enters from both sides of the light guide plate, the invention is not limited thereto; the light guide plate may be of a type comprising only one light source disposed on one light incidence surface so that light enters from one side of the light guide plate. Reduction in number of light sources enables the number of parts and hence the costs to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In cases where light is allowed to enter from one side of the light guide plate, the interface z may have an asymmetric shape. For example, the light guide plate may have one light incidence surface and include a second layer which has such an asymmetric shape that the second layer has a maximum thickness at a position far from the light incidence surface beyond the bisector of the light exit surface.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing part of a backlight unit using another example of the inventive light guide plate. Since the backlight unit <b>156</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> has the same configuration as the backlight unit <b>20</b> except that the light guide plate <b>30</b> is replaced by a light guide plate <b>150</b> and only one light source <b>28</b> is used, like elements are denoted by the same reference numerals and the following description mainly focuses on the distinctive portions.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The backlight unit <b>156</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> comprises the light guide plate <b>150</b> and the light source <b>28</b> disposed so as to face the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>of the light guide plate <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The light guide plate <b>150</b> includes the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>facing the disposed light source <b>28</b> and a lateral surface <b>150</b><i>d </i>opposite from the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The light guide plate <b>150</b> includes a first layer <b>152</b> on the side closer to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>and a second layer <b>154</b> on the side closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b</i>. When seen from the cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c</i>, the interface z between the first layer <b>152</b> and the second layer <b>154</b> changes so that the second layer <b>154</b> increases in thickness from the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>toward the lateral surface <b>150</b><i>d</i>, then once changes so that the second layer <b>154</b> decreases in thickness, then changes again so that the second layer <b>154</b> increases in thickness and continuously changes so that the second layer <b>154</b> decreases in thickness on the side closer to the lateral surface <b>150</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">More specifically, the interface z includes a curved surface convex toward the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>on the side closer to the lateral surface <b>150</b><i>d</i>, a concave curved surface smoothly connected to the convex curved surface, and a concave curved surface connected to the concave curved surface and communicating with one end of the light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>on the side closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The thickness of the second layer <b>154</b> at the light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>is zero.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">More specifically, the combined particle concentration of the scattering particles (thickness of the second layer) is changed so as to have the first local maximum value in the vicinity of the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second local maximum value on the side closer to the lateral surface <b>150</b><i>d </i>beyond the central portion of the light guide plate, the second local maximum value being larger than the first local maximum value.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Although not shown, the combined particle concentration of the light guide plate <b>150</b> has the first local maximum value at the edge of the opening of the housing. In other words, the region from the light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>to the position of the first local maximum value is a so-called mixing zone M for diffusing light having entered through the light incidence surface.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In the case of one-side light incidence using only one light source, by thus adjusting the combined particle concentration of the light guide plate <b>150</b> (thickness of the second layer <b>154</b>) so that the concentration has the first local maximum value at a position closer to the light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the second local maximum value which is larger than the first local maximum value on the side closer to the lateral surface <b>150</b><i>d </i>beyond the central portion, light having entered through the light incidence surface can travel to a position farther from the light incidence surface even in a large and thin light guide plate, whereby outgoing light may have a luminance distribution which is high in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">By adjusting the combined particle concentration so as to have the first local maximum value in the vicinity of the light incidence surface, light having entered through the light incidence surface can be sufficiently diffused in the vicinity of the light incidence surface to prevent outgoing light through the vicinity of the light incidence surface from having visible bright lines (dark lines, unevenness) which are attributable to such causes as intervals at which the light sources are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">By adjusting the combined particle concentration such that the region on the side close to the light incidence surface from the position where the combined particle concentration takes the first local maximum value has a lower combined particle concentration than the first local maximum value, return light, which is light outgoing through the light incidence surface after it once enters the light guide plate, and outgoing light through the region in the vicinity of the light incidence surface (mixing zone M) which is not used because the region is covered with the housing can be reduced to improve the use efficiency of outgoing light through the effective region of the light exit surface (effective screen area E).</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The interface z in the mixing zone M of the light guide plate <b>150</b> of the backlight unit <b>156</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> has such a shape as to include a curved surface which is concave toward the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>and communicates with an end of the light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>on the side closer to the rear surface <b>30</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Curved surfaces and flat surfaces are thus combined to form the interface z into an asymmetric shape so that the combined particle concentration of the scattering particles in the effective screen area E has a minimum value at a position close to the light incidence surface and a maximum value at a position far from the light incidence surface, whereby light emitted from the light source and allowed to enter through the light incidence surface can be guided deep into the light guide plate to obtain a suitable luminance distribution and improve the light use efficiency.</p>

<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The backlight unit <b>226</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> comprises a light guide plate <b>220</b> and the light source <b>28</b> disposed so as to face the first light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>of the light guide plate <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In the light guide plate <b>220</b>, a rear surface <b>220</b><i>b </i>is inclined with respect to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>so that the thickness in a direction perpendicular to the light exit surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>decreases with increasing distance from the light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c. </i></p>

<p id="p-0199" num="0198">By thus inclining the rear surface <b>220</b><i>b </i>in a direction in which the thickness of the light guide plate decreases with increasing distance from the light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c</i>, the amount of outgoing light from the position away from the light incidence surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>can be increased. Therefore, by adjusting the shape of the interface z and the combined particle concentration in accordance therewith, incident light through the light incidence surface can be guided deep into the light guide plate to obtain a suitable luminance distribution and improve the light use efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The backlight unit using the light guide plate of the invention is not limited thereto and, in addition to the two light sources, light sources may also be provided so as to face the lateral surfaces on the short sides of the light exit surface of the light guide plate.

<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Light may be emitted not only through the light exit surface but also from the rear surface side.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The light guide plate of the invention includes two layers which contain scattering particles at different particle concentrations.
