<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A semiconductor structure including nanotubes forming an electrical connection between electrodes is disclosed. The semiconductor structure may include an open volume defined by a lower surface of an electrically insulative material and sidewalls of at least a portion of each of a dielectric material and opposing electrodes. The nanotubes may extend between the opposing electrodes, forming a physical and electrical connection therebetween. The nanotubes may be encapsulated within the open volume in the semiconductor structure. A semiconductor structure including nanotubes forming an electrical connection between source and drain regions is also disclosed. The semiconductor structure may include at least one semiconducting carbon nanotube electrically connected to a source and a drain, a dielectric material disposed over the at least one semiconducting carbon nanotube and a gate dielectric overlying a portion of the dielectric material. Methods of forming the semiconductor structures are also disclosed.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/176,013, filed Jul. 18, 2008, now U.S. Patent No. 8,222,127, issued Jul. 17, 2012, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by this reference in its entirety.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the invention relate to methods of forming structures and, more specifically, to methods of forming switching elements and transistor devices including control structures including a nanotube component.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fabricating nano-scale devices that function as ohmic contacts and have low resistance has been a challenge to the semiconductor industry. Conventional low resistance ohmic contacts are made of metal suicides formed on heavily doped semiconductor regions. The contact resistance is inversely proportional to contact area. In nano-scale devices, the contact area is on the order of nanometer or smaller and, thus, contact resistance limits performance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Carbon nanotube structures are finding their way into nano-scale devices due to their unique electron transport properties. The carbon nanotubes may be metallic or semiconductive. Carbon nanotubes have high current densities, such as up to about 10<sup>9 </sup>A/cm<sup>2</sup>. This and other properties of the carbon nanotubes make them ideal candidates for use in molecular-scale electronic devices. Due to their low dimensionality, structural symmetry and electronic properties, carbon nanotubes are being explored for use in transistors, interconnects and switches for non-volatile memory applications.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Integrated circuits combining carbon nanotubes with a silicon metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) switching circuit have been formed by growing the carbon nanotubes onto the integrated circuit at predefined locations. Conventionally, the carbon nanotubes are positioned on gate oxides and contacted by polycrystalline thin film metal electrodes or are overgrown epitaxially by high-k dielectrics using atomic layer deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Presently, the manufacturing of carbon nanotube memory devices depends on a so-called &#x201c;top-down&#x201d; fabrication technique. For example, a film including a monolayer of nanotubes is deposited on an electrically conductive material using a spin-on technique and is lithographically patterned to make columns and rows of the nanotubes. The 1 nm to 2 nm-thick, patterned nanotube is interconnected with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Semiconductor structures have also been formed including so-called &#x201c;ribbons&#x201d; of carbon nanotubes that are suspended over a carbon substrate. In the &#x201c;off&#x201d; state, the ribbon of carbon nanotubes does not touch the carbon substrate, and electricity does not flow between an interconnect suspending the ribbon. In the &#x201c;on&#x201d; state, the carbon nanotubes bend downward and adhere to the carbon substrate through van der Waals forces, enabling electricity to flow between the interconnect. However, bit failure is a common occurrence with the above-mentioned techniques because reliable contact between electrodes and the carbon nanotubes has not been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Semiconductor structures with improved control structures are desired, as are methods of forming such semiconductor structures.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention. However, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. The drawings presented herein are not necessarily drawn to scale and are not actual views of a particular semiconductor structure or fabrication process thereof, but are merely idealized representations that are employed to describe the embodiments of the invention. Additionally, elements common between drawings may retain the same numerical designation.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following description provides specific details, such as material types, material thicknesses, and processing conditions in order to provide a thorough description of embodiments of the invention. However, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without employing these specific details. Indeed, the embodiments of the invention may be practiced in conjunction with conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques employed in the industry. In addition, the description provided below does not form a complete process flow for manufacturing a semiconductor device in which the semiconductor structure is present, and the semiconductor devices described below do not form a complete electronic device. Only those process acts and semiconductor structures or semiconductor devices necessary to understand the embodiments of the invention are described in detail below. Additional processing acts to form a complete semiconductor device from the semiconductor structures or to form a complete electronic device from the semiconductor device may be performed by conventional fabrication techniques, which are not described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The materials described herein may be formed by any suitable technique including, but not limited to, spin coating, blanket coating, chemical vapor deposition (&#x201c;CVD&#x201d;), atomic layer deposition (&#x201c;ALD&#x201d;), plasma enhanced ALD, or physical vapor deposition (&#x201c;PVD&#x201d;). Alternatively, the materials may be grown in situ. Depending on the specific material to be formed, the technique for depositing or growing the material may be selected by a person of ordinary skill in the art. While the materials may be formed as layers, the materials are not limited thereto and may be formed in other configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a semiconductor structure <b>10</b> that includes an electrically insulative material <b>12</b>, an electrode material <b>14</b>, a dielectric material <b>16</b>, a flowable material <b>18</b> and a mask material <b>20</b>. The electrode material <b>14</b> may be formed over and in contact with the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> may be formed over and in contact with the electrode material <b>14</b>, the flowable material <b>18</b> may be formed over and in contact with the dielectric material <b>16</b>, and the mask material <b>20</b> may be formed over and in contact with the flowable material <b>18</b>. The electrically insulative material <b>12</b>, the electrode material <b>14</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the flowable material <b>18</b> may be formed by conventional techniques, which are not described in detail herein. For example, the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> may have a thickness of less than or equal to about 500 &#x212b; and may be formed from a dielectric material such as silicon dioxide (&#x201c;SiO<sub>2</sub>&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> may be deposited over a substrate (not shown) by conventional techniques, which are not described in detail herein. As used herein, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; means and includes a base material or construction upon which materials, such as the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> and electrode material <b>14</b>, are deposited. The substrate may be a semiconductor substrate, a base semiconductor layer on a supporting structure, a metal electrode or a semiconductor substrate having one or more layers, structures or regions formed thereon. The substrate may include, for example, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) type substrates, silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) type substrates, and epitaxial layers of silicon supported by a layer of base material. Semiconductor type materials may be doped or undoped.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">By way of non-limiting example, the electrode material <b>14</b> may have a thickness in a range of from about 10 &#x212b; to about 1000 &#x212b; and may be formed from a conductive material, such as a transition metal, a conductive metal oxide, or a metal carbide. More specifically, the electrode material <b>14</b> may include tungsten, hafnium, zirconium, titanium, tantalum, aluminum, ruthenium, palladium, platinum, cobalt, nickel, combinations thereof, or an alloy thereof. The electrode material <b>14</b> may be deposited over the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> by conventional techniques such as, for example, electroless deposition, PVD, and CVD. The dielectric material <b>16</b> may have a thickness in a range of from about 10 &#x212b; to about 1000 &#x212b; and may be an oxide material, a nitride material or a polysilicon material. In one embodiment, the dielectric material <b>16</b> is silicon dioxide. The dielectric material <b>16</b> may be deposited over the electrode material <b>14</b> by conventional techniques, which are not described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The flowable material <b>18</b> may have a thickness in a range of from about 100 &#x212b; to about 5000 &#x212b; and may be deposited over and in contact with the dielectric material <b>16</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;flowable material&#x201d; means and includes a material capable of flowing when heated to a sufficient temperature. For example, the flowable material <b>18</b> may be a material that, when heated, forms a viscous liquid or semi-solid material. The flowable material <b>18</b> may be a non-reactive, non-conductive material and may provide a barrier to moisture. By way of non-limiting example, the flowable material <b>18</b> may be a glass, such as a borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG), a phosphosilicate glass (PSG) or a spin-on glass (SOG). Alternatively, the flowable material <b>18</b> may be a polymer or a polyimide. In one embodiment, the flowable material <b>18</b> is BPSG. The flowable material <b>18</b> may be distributed on the surface of the dielectric material <b>16</b> by conventional processes, such as by spin-coating.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The mask material <b>20</b> may be a positive or negative photoresist material or a hardmask material, such as transparent carbon or amorphous carbon. Such photoresist and hardmask materials are known in the art and, therefore, are not described in detail herein. The mask material <b>20</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as being patterned. The mask material <b>20</b> may be deposited on the flowable material <b>18</b>, and may be patterned and developed to form an aperture <b>22</b> exposing a region of the underlying flowable material <b>18</b>. Photoresist materials and photolithographic techniques are well known in the art and, therefore, selecting, depositing, patterning and developing the photoresist material are not discussed in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the semiconductor structure <b>10</b> including a recess <b>24</b> extending through the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrode material <b>14</b>. Forming the recess <b>24</b> produces electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The recess <b>24</b> is defined by a lower surface <b>28</b> of the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> and sidewalls <b>26</b> of at least the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrode material <b>14</b>. The recess <b>24</b> may have a width in a range of from about 10 nm to about 0.1 &#x3bc;m. By way of non-limiting example, the recess <b>24</b> may be a two-dimensional structure, such as a container (not shown) having a generally cylindrical interior, or may be a trench-like structure. More specifically, the recess <b>24</b> may be a cylindrical capacitor container structure. The lower surface <b>28</b> of the recess <b>24</b> may correspond to an upper surface of the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>. A mouth <b>25</b> of the recess <b>24</b> may be positioned at an opposite end from the lower surface <b>28</b> of the recess <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, the electrode material <b>14</b> may be further removed to form a cavity <b>17</b>, which is shown in broken lines. The cavity <b>17</b> may be formed using a selective etching process that removes the electrode material <b>14</b> at a faster rate than the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b>, and the flowable material <b>18</b>. By way of non-limiting example, if the electrode material <b>14</b> is tungsten, the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> is polysilicon, the dielectric material <b>16</b> is silicon dioxide, and the flowable material <b>18</b> is BPSG, a wet etchant including ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) may be applied at a temperature of about 65&#xb0; C. to form the cavity <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For the sake of clarity, the semiconductor structure <b>10</b> depicted in the following drawings includes one recess <b>24</b>. In other embodiments, a plurality of recesses <b>24</b> may be formed in the semiconductor structure <b>10</b>. To form the recess <b>24</b>, a portion of each of the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrode material <b>14</b> underlying the aperture <b>22</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be removed. Portions of the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrode material <b>14</b> may be removed using a single etch chemistry, or separate etch chemistries may be used to remove each of these materials. The etch chemistries may be selected by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the materials used as the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrode material <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As a non-limiting example, if the flowable material <b>18</b> is BPSG, a dry (i.e., plasma) etching process using tetrafluoromethane (CF<sub>4</sub>) or trifluoromethane (CHF<sub>3</sub>) may be used to remove the portion of the flowable material <b>18</b> exposed through the mask material <b>20</b>, forming the mouth <b>25</b> of the recess <b>24</b>. If the dielectric material <b>16</b> is silicon dioxide, a dry (i.e., plasma) etching process using tetrafluoromethane (CF<sub>4</sub>) or trifluoromethane (CHF<sub>3</sub>) may be used to remove the exposed portion of the dielectric material <b>16</b>. If the electrode material <b>14</b> is formed from a transition metal, the exposed portion may be removed using, for example, a carbon monoxide-based plasma etch or a hydrogen chloride and argon plasma etch, to form electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Removing the electrode material <b>14</b> may expose at least a portion of the underlying electrically insulative material <b>12</b>. As shown by the dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the recess <b>24</b> may, optionally, extend at least partially into the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">While subsequent drawings illustrate the recess <b>24</b> as extending at least partially into the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>, the recess <b>24</b> may terminate at the upper surface of the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>. By way of non-limiting example, if the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> is silicon dioxide, the exposed portion of the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> may be removed using a buffered HF solution to extend the recess <b>24</b> at least partially into the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>. The sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b> include opposing, exposed vertical regions of the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The exposed vertical regions of the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>on opposing sides of the recess <b>24</b> may be contiguous. Alternatively, the sidewalls <b>26</b> include exposed vertical regions of the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>. The exposed vertical regions of the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> within the recess <b>24</b> may oppose one another at contiguous regions within the recess <b>24</b>. The lower surface <b>28</b> of the recess <b>24</b> may be defined by an exposed portion of the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, after formation of the recess <b>24</b>, the mask material <b>20</b> may be removed to expose an upper surface <b>21</b> of the flowable material <b>18</b>. By way of non-limiting example, if the mask material <b>20</b> is a photoresist material, the photoresist material may be removed using a conventional masking process. Alternatively, the mask material <b>20</b> may be removed after removing a portion of the flowable material <b>18</b> when forming recess <b>24</b> such that the remaining portions of the flowable material <b>18</b> are used as a mask to extend the recess <b>24</b> into underlying dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrode material <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a catalyst <b>30</b> may be deposited on the sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b>. The catalyst <b>30</b> may be a material suitable for catalyzing the growth of carbon nanotubes. As a non-limiting example, the catalyst <b>30</b> may be a transition metal, such as nickel, cobalt, iron, platinum, palladium, copper, vanadium, molybdenum, zinc, an oxide of a transition metal and combinations or alloys thereof. The catalyst <b>30</b> may be deposited on the sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b> by electroless deposition, spray deposition, photocatalytic deposition, electrochemical deposition, chemical vapor deposition, or any other method suitable for depositing the catalyst <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, the catalyst <b>30</b> is a transition metal capable of being deposited electrolessly. The catalyst <b>30</b> may be deposited substantially continuously over the lower surface <b>28</b> and the sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, nanodots (not shown) including a transition metal, such as nickel, cobalt, iron, platinum, palladium, copper, vanadium, molybdenum, zinc, a transition metal oxide, or any combination or alloy thereof, may used as the catalyst <b>30</b>. The nanodots may be deposited as a discontinuous layer having a thickness in a range of from about 2 nm to about 8 nm, and may include particles having an average diameter in a range of from about 1 nm to about 10 nm. Conventional methods including, but not limited to, plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) or plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD), may be used to deposit the nanodots on the sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The catalyst <b>30</b> located on each of the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> may be selectively removed so that the catalyst <b>30</b> remains only on sidewalls <b>15</b> of the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>within the recess <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. By way of non-limiting example, if the flowable material <b>18</b> is BPSG and both the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> are SiO<sub>2</sub>, an etch chemistry selective for oxides may be used to remove the catalyst <b>30</b> from the BPSG and the SiO<sub>2</sub>. By way of non-limiting example, a solution including dilute HF may be used to remove exposed portions of the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>. By removing the exposed portions of the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrically insulative material <b>12</b>, as shown in broken lines, the catalyst <b>30</b> deposited on these materials may be removed without removing the catalyst <b>30</b> deposited on the sidewalls <b>15</b> of the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>to produce the semiconductor structure <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the semiconductor structure <b>10</b> includes a cavity <b>17</b> having surfaces <b>19</b> shown in dashed lines of the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>exposed within the recess <b>24</b>. The catalyst <b>30</b> may be deposited on the sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b> as well as on the surfaces <b>19</b> of the electrode material <b>14</b>. A protective material (not shown) may be applied over the sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b> and within the cavity <b>17</b>. Deposition of the catalyst <b>30</b> may be followed by a conventional spacer etch to remove the catalyst <b>30</b> from the sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b> and the upper surface <b>21</b> of the flowable material <b>18</b> without removing the catalyst <b>30</b> from the surfaces <b>19</b> of the cavity <b>17</b>. The protective material may then be removed selective to the catalyst <b>30</b> to form the semiconductor structure <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The semiconductor structure <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> may, alternatively, be formed by selectively depositing the catalyst <b>30</b> on the sidewalls <b>15</b> of the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>using, for example, an electroless deposition process. The catalyst <b>30</b> may be selectively deposited on the sidewalls <b>15</b> of the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>while exposed portions of the flowable material <b>18</b>, the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the electrically insulative material <b>12</b> within the recess <b>24</b> remain substantially free of the catalyst <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows the semiconductor structure <b>10</b> after formation of nanotubes <b>32</b> within the recess <b>24</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;nanotubes&#x201d; means and includes any hollow carbon cylinders or graphene cylinders, such as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs). A plurality of nanotubes <b>32</b> may be formed on the catalyst <b>30</b> within the recess <b>24</b> by conventional techniques including, but not limited to, CVD, arc discharge, and laser vaporization. As a non-limiting example, to initiate formation of the nanotubes <b>32</b>, the catalyst <b>30</b> on the sidewalls <b>15</b> of the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be exposed to, or contacted with, a process gas. The process gas may be a gaseous precursor including a carbon-containing gas or a mixture of the carbon-containing gas and an inert gas. Non-limiting examples of carbon-containing gases include aliphatic hydrocarbons, both saturated and unsaturated, such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, hexane, ethylene, propylene and combinations thereof; carbon monoxide; oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as acetone, acetylene, methanol and combinations thereof; and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, benzene, naphthalene and combinations thereof. In addition, combinations of the above-mentioned carbon-containing gases may be used. More specifically, the carbon-containing gas may be methane, carbon monoxide, acetylene, ethylene or ethanol. Inert gases, such as nitrogen, helium, hydrogen, ammonia or combinations thereof, may be used in the process gas.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><b>4</b>process gas in a reaction chamber (not shown). The reaction chamber may be, for example, an inductively coupled plasma chamber, a capacitatively coupled plasma chamber, a vacuum chamber, a microwave plasma chamber, or any other chamber capable of generating high-density plasma. The process gas may enter the reaction chamber at a flow rate in a range of from about 50 cm<sup>3</sup>/minute to about 2000 cm<sup>3</sup>/minute, a pressure in a range of from about 150 torr to about 550 torr and a temperature in a range of from about 700&#xb0; C. to about 1200&#xb0; C. For example, if cobalt particles are used as the catalyst <b>30</b>, nanotubes <b>32</b> may be formed by exposing the cobalt particles to methane gas at a pressure of about 500 torr and a temperature of about 950&#xb0; C. As another example, if the catalyst <b>30</b> includes iron particles, the nanotubes <b>32</b> may be formed by exposing the iron particles to methane gas at a pressure of about 200 torr and a temperature of about 800&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Once formation of the nanotubes <b>32</b> has been initiated on the catalyst <b>30</b>, the nanotubes <b>32</b> self-assemble in the presence of the gaseous precursor. The nanotubes <b>32</b> may have a diameter in a range of from about 1 nm to about 10 nm and a length in a range of from about 10 nm to about 0.1 &#x3bc;m. The nanotubes <b>32</b> may be grown so that a so-called &#x201c;bridge&#x201d; is formed between the particles of the catalyst <b>30</b> on opposing electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The nanotubes <b>32</b> may extend from the particles of catalyst <b>30</b> towards particles of catalyst <b>30</b> on the opposite electrode, providing an electrical connection between the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. In other words, the nanotubes <b>32</b> may form an interconnect between the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>on opposing sides of the recess <b>24</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;interconnect&#x201d; means and includes a structure or structures that enable communication of an electrical signal between the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The interconnect may be a path through which data is transmitted, such as an electrically conductive bridge. The interconnect may be associated with, for example, an interface or connection between transistors on a semiconductor die. By growing the nanotubes <b>32</b> in situ, electrical contact between the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be substantially improved because terminal ends of the nanotubes <b>32</b> may be embedded on the surface of, and between, particles of the catalyst <b>30</b>. In contrast, conventional techniques for fanning nanotubes provide only physical contact between the nanotubes and the electrodes. In addition, growing the nanotubes <b>32</b> in situ provides improved distribution of the nanotubes <b>32</b> at the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>than conventional techniques of spinning on or spraying the nanotubes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, during formation, the nanotubes <b>32</b> may cross over or connect with one another to form at least one junction <b>34</b>. Nanotubes <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>may come into contact with one another at the junction <b>34</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;contact&#x201d; means and includes electrical contact, in which there is a conductive pathway between the nanotubes <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>. The crossed nanotubes <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>and the junction <b>34</b> may provide a memory element able to be switched between at least two readable states. Alternatively, a bias may be applied to the nanotubes <b>32</b> after formation to separate the nanotubes <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>eliminating the junction <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the nanotubes <b>32</b> may be formed to extend between surfaces <b>19</b> of the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>within the cavity <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flowable material <b>18</b> may be reflowed to form an encapsulating element <b>38</b> that covers the mouth <b>25</b> of the recess <b>24</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), forming an open volume <b>40</b> in the recess <b>24</b>. The encapsulating element <b>38</b> may span or connect the opposing sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the flowable material <b>18</b> may be reflowed such that the encapsulating element <b>38</b> connects the opposing sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b> and at least partially fills the recess <b>24</b> while maintaining at least a portion of the open volume <b>40</b>. The encapsulating element <b>38</b> may be formed by applying sufficient heat to convert the flowable material <b>18</b> to a semi-solid or liquid state. For example, if the flowable material <b>18</b> is a polymer material, it may be heated to a temperature in a range of from about 150&#xb0; C. to about 350&#xb0; C., so that the polymer material flows across the mouth <b>25</b> of the recess <b>24</b> forming the encapsulating element <b>38</b>. The nanotubes <b>32</b> may be stable at a temperature used to reflow the flowable material <b>18</b>. Since nanotubes <b>32</b> are thermally stable up to a temperature of about 2500&#xb0; C. in a vacuum, the nanotubes <b>32</b> are capable of withstanding the process conditions used to reflow the flowable material <b>18</b>. As a non-limiting example, if the flowable material is BPSG, the BPSG may be heated to a temperature of about 600&#xb0; C. such that the BPSG is present in a semi-solid or liquid state. Once heated, the flowable material <b>18</b> may cover the mouth <b>25</b> of the recess <b>24</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or may flow into and partially fill the mouth <b>25</b> of the recess <b>24</b>, such as at least a portion of the recess <b>24</b> between opposing sidewalls of the flowable material <b>18</b>. However, at least a portion of the recess <b>24</b> may remain substantially unfilled, maintaining the open volume <b>40</b> around the nanotubes <b>32</b>. As the flowable material <b>18</b> cools, the flowable material <b>18</b> may fuse or consolidate into a substantially continuous material over the dielectric material <b>16</b> and the open volume <b>40</b>, thus forming the encapsulating element <b>38</b>. The encapsulating element <b>38</b> may form a moisture-resistant barrier that encloses the nanotubes <b>32</b> within the open volume <b>40</b> in the semiconductor structure <b>10</b>. By encapsulating the nanotubes <b>32</b> within the open volume <b>40</b>, the nanotubes <b>32</b> may be protected while maintaining a free space around the nanotubes <b>32</b>. Additionally, the flowable material <b>18</b> may be heated to backfill at least a portion of the open volume <b>40</b>, reducing the volume of the open volume <b>40</b> surrounding the nanotubes <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another embodiment, a sealing material may be applied over and in contact with the flowable material <b>18</b> to cover at least the mouth <b>25</b> of the recess <b>24</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), encapsulating the nanotubes <b>32</b> and forming the open volume <b>40</b>. The sealing material may bridge or connect the opposing sidewalls <b>26</b> of the recess <b>24</b>. By way of non-limiting example, the sealing material may be a preformed film <b>44</b> that may be adhered or otherwise secured to the flowable material <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As a non-limiting example, the preformed film <b>44</b> may include a dielectric protective material, such as a polyimide or BPSG. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the sealing material, such as the preformed film <b>44</b>, may be used in place of the flowable material <b>18</b> and may be applied over and in contact with the dielectric material <b>16</b> to cover at least the mouth <b>25</b> of the recess <b>24</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The preformed film <b>44</b> may be at least partially fused to the underlying flowable material <b>18</b> or to the underlying dielectric material <b>16</b>. The sealing material may also be applied by spin-coating, spray-coating, dip-coating or other conventional techniques. By way of non-limiting example, the sealing material may be spin-coated or sprayed over the flowable material <b>18</b> such that a meniscus (not shown) of the sealing material bridges the mouth <b>25</b> of the recess <b>24</b>, forming the open volume <b>40</b> and encapsulating the nanotubes <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The semiconductor structure <b>10</b> may function as an electronic memory element in which electrical connection between electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>is established by the nanotubes <b>32</b>. By providing an electrical connection between the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the nanotubes <b>32</b> may provide the basis for an electromechanical switching device. The nanotubes <b>32</b> may serve as the memory elements of the electromechanical switching device and as elements for switching between a stable conducting (&#x201c;on&#x201d;) state and an open (&#x201c;off&#x201d;) state. For example, the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be source and drain electrodes and the nanotubes <b>32</b> may be suspended therebetween. The electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be operably coupled to a voltage source and ground so that a current is passed between the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>by the nanotubes <b>32</b>. Switching between the on and off states may be performed by applying a voltage across the nanotubes <b>32</b>. The voltage may be applied to the nanotubes <b>32</b>, for example, through the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. By way of non-limiting example, a voltage in a range of from about 0.5 volt to about 5 volts may be applied between the electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. When a sufficient voltage is applied, the semiconductor structure <b>10</b> remains in the on state. The semiconductor structure <b>10</b> may be switched to the off state by a change in the voltage applied. For example, the crossed nanotubes <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>which intersect at the junction <b>34</b> may be cut or disconnected by applying a sufficient bias to the nanotubes <b>32</b>. The nanotubes <b>32</b> may be switched between on and off states by alternatively biasing the nanotubes <b>32</b> or by biasing the nanotubes <b>32</b> at the junction <b>34</b>. The application of a current may induce the nanotubes <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>to deform and connect such that the electromechanical switching device is in the on state. When the current flow is restricted, the nanotubes <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>disconnect such that the electromechanical switching device is in the off state.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows another embodiment of a semiconductor structure <b>100</b> that includes a recess <b>108</b> formed through an electrode material <b>104</b> and a dielectric material <b>106</b> overlying an electrically insulative material <b>102</b>. The electrode material <b>104</b> may be formed over and in contact with the electrically insulative material <b>102</b>; the dielectric material <b>106</b> may be formed over and in contact with the electrode material <b>104</b>. The electrically insulative material <b>102</b>, the electrode material <b>104</b>, the dielectric material <b>106</b> may be formed by conventional techniques, which are not described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, the electrically insulative material <b>102</b> may be fanned from a dielectric material such as silicon dioxide (&#x201c;SiO<sub>2</sub>&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the electrically insulative material <b>102</b> may be deposited over a substrate (not shown) by conventional techniques, which are not described in detail herein. By way of non-limiting example, the electrode material <b>104</b> may be formed from a semiconductive material or a conductive material, such as doped polysilicon material. The electrode material <b>104</b> may be deposited over the electrically insulative material <b>102</b> by conventional techniques such as, for example, by CVD. The dielectric material <b>106</b> may be an oxide material, a nitride material or a polysilicon material. In one embodiment, the dielectric material <b>106</b> is silicon dioxide. The dielectric material <b>106</b> may be deposited over the electrode material <b>104</b> by conventional techniques, which are not described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the recess <b>108</b> is defined by a surface <b>110</b> of the electrically insulative material <b>102</b> and sidewalls <b>112</b> including opposing, exposed vertical regions of the dielectric material <b>106</b> and the electrode material <b>104</b>. For the sake of clarity, the semiconductor structure <b>100</b> depicted in the following drawings includes one recess <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, a plurality of recesses (not shown) may be formed in the semiconductor structure <b>100</b>. To form the recess <b>108</b>, a portion of each of the dielectric material <b>106</b> and the electrode material <b>104</b> may be removed using conventional techniques. For example, portions of the dielectric material <b>106</b> and the electrode material <b>104</b> may be removed selective to a mask material (not shown) using a single etch chemistry, or separate etch chemistries. The etch chemistries may be selected by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the materials used as the dielectric material <b>106</b> and the electrode material <b>104</b>. By way of non-limiting example, if the dielectric material <b>106</b> is silicon dioxide, a suitable dry (i.e., plasma) etching process using, for example, tetrafluoromethane or trifluoromethane, may be employed to remove a portion of the dielectric material <b>106</b> selective to the mask material. The electrode material <b>104</b> may be selectively removed using the underlying electrically insulative material <b>102</b> as an etch stop. If the electrode material <b>104</b> is a doped polysilicon and the electrically insulative material <b>102</b> is silicon dioxide, a hot phosphoric acid etch may be used to remove a portion of the electrode material <b>104</b> without substantially removing the underlying electrically insulative material <b>102</b>.</p>

Conventional techniques of forming carbon nanotubes may result in the formation of a mixture of carbon nanotubes with metallic-type properties, which are referred to herein as &#x201c;metallic nanotubes,&#x201d; and carbon nanotubes with semiconducting-type properties, which are referred to herein as &#x201c;semiconducting nanotubes.&#x201d; The metallic nanotubes may be removed or damaged using conventional techniques, such as selective etching using a hydrogen or methane plasma, electrical breakdown or microwave heating. By way of non-limiting example, a sufficient current may be passed through the nanotubes to selectively damage or destroy the metallic nanotubes, while preserving the semiconducting nanotubes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After substantially removing the metallic nanotubes, at least one semiconducting nanotube <b>116</b> may remain.

The electrode material <b>104</b> may function as source and drain regions <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>of the semiconductor structure <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a gate dielectric <b>118</b> may be conformally formed over and in contact with the dielectric material <b>106</b>, the sidewalls <b>112</b> of the dielectric material <b>106</b> and the source and drain regions <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>, and the surface <b>110</b> of the electrically insulative material <b>102</b>. The gate dielectric <b>118</b> may be deposited over or may encase or surround the semiconducting nanotubes <b>116</b>.
