<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to structured compositions comprising a depilatory, and uses of such compositions in personal care products.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of so-called &#x201c;structured&#x201d; compositions for use in personal care, home care, and other consumer products are known in the art. Such structured compositions are often typified by the presence of a lamellar, surfactant-rich phase, and tend to exhibit desirable rheological and aesthetic properties, as well as, significant power to suspend functional ingredients that are not soluble in water.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Applicants have recognized that, it would be desirable to combine the favorable rheology and aesethetics of a structured system with a depilatory active system. Applicants have further recognized that it would also be desirable to create a depilatory composition that is not only aesthetically pleasing and/or phase-stable, but also exhibits one or more additional properties such as rinsability and/or mildness. However, applicants have additionally recognized that the incorporation of depilatories into structured systems tends to be problematic. In particular, applicants believe that the (1) aggressive nature of depilatory actives as well as (2) the high levels of electrolyte that are often required to augment the efficacy of the depilatory, make it difficult to form a stable structured depilatory composition.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">All percentages listed in this specification are percentages by weight, unless otherwise specifically mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As used herein the term &#x201c;structured composition,&#x201d; means a composition having a Yield Stress from about 1 Pascal (Pa) to about 1500 Pa as measured via the &#x201c;Yield Stress Test&#x201d; described in the Test Methods below. Examples of certain preferred structured compositions include those having a Yield Stress of from about 10 Pa to about 1100 Pa, as measured by the Yield Stress Method described hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As noted above, applicants have discovered unexpectedly that structured compositions may be obtained by combining at least one depilatory active with at least one surfactant. Applicants have further discovered that compositions of the instant invention, according to certain embodiments have the desirable attribute that may be referred to as &#x201c;heaping,&#x201d; i.e. the ability to recover shape rapidly and form peaks when subject to shearing, as determined by the &#x201c;Degree of Heaping Test&#x201d; described in the Test Methods below. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the inventive compositions have a Hauesorff-Besicovitch Dimension (hereinafter, &#x201c;H-B Dimension&#x201d;) that is less than about 1.7, preferably less than about 1.6, more preferably less than about 1.5, and even more preferably less than about 1.4, as measured by the Degree of Heaping Test Method described hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Any of a variety of suitable depilatory actives may be used in the compositions of the present invention. By depilatory active, it is meant a chemical species that is capable of chemically degrading hair and is therefore meant to exclude those species, e.g., waxes that function to remove hair solely by physically bonding thereto so that the hair may be mechanically torn from the body. Examples of suitable depilatory actives include any of those compounds suitable for chemically degrading keratin or hair (such as by disrupting disulfide bonds of the hair). Suitable examples of depilatory actives include thio-containing compounds that may be either ionized or unionized, water soluble or water-dispersible. Examples of suitable depilatory actives include thioglycolates such as potassium thioglycolate, dithioerythritol, thioglycerol, thioglycol, thioxanthine, thiosalicylic acid, N-acetyl-L-cysteine&#x2032; lipoic acid, sodium dihydrolipoate 6,8 dithicocatanoate, sodium 6,8-diothioocatanoate, a hydrogen sulphide salt, thioglycolic acid, 2-mercaptopropionic acid, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, thiomalic acid, ammonium thioglycolate&#x2032; glyceryl monothioglycolate, monoethanolamine thioglycolate&#x2032; monoethanolamine thioglycolic acid, diammoniumdithiodiglycolate, ammonium thiolactate, monoethanolamine thiolactate, thioglycolamide, homocysteine, cysteine, glutathione, dithiothreitol, dihydrolipoic acid, 1&#x2032;3-dithiopropanol, thioglycolamide, glycerylmonothioglycolate, thioglycolhydrazine, keratinase, guanidine thioglycolate, calcium thioglycolate and/or cysteamine, and combinations thereof. Particularly suitable depilatory actives are thioglycolates.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0058">In certain preferred embodiments, the anionic surfactant for use in the present invention comprises a branched anionic surfactant. By &#x201c;branched anionic surfactant,&#x201d; it is meant an anionic surfactant comprising more than 10% branched surfactant molecules. Suitable branched anionic surfactants include tridecanol based sulfates such as sodium trideceth sulfate, which generally comprises a high level of branching, with over 80% of surfactant molecules comprising at least 2 branches. Another suitable branched anionic surfactant is a C<sub>12-13 </sub>alkyl sulfate derived from SAFOL 23 alcohol (Sasol, Inc, Houston, Tex., USA) which has about 15-30% branched surfactant molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">Branched anionic surfactants include but are not limited to the following branched anionic alkyl sulfate or alkyl ether sulfate surfactants: sodium tridecyl sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-13 </sub>alkyl sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-15 </sub>alkyl sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-15 </sub>alkyl sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-18 </sub>alkyl sulfate, sodium C<sub>10-16 </sub>alkyl sulfate, sodium trideceth sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-13 </sub>pareth sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-13 </sub>pareth-n sulfate, and sodium C<sub>12-14 </sub>pareth-n sulfate. One particularly suitable branched anionic surfactant (about 50% branched) is a sodium trideceth sulfate, available as CEDEPAL TD 430 MFLD from Stepan Company of Northfield, Ill.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060">Other salts of all the aforementioned branched anionic surfactants are useful, such as TEA, DEA, ammonia, potassium salts. Useful alkoxylates include the ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and EO/PO mixed alkoxylates. Phosphates, carboxylates and sulfonates prepared from branched alcohols are also useful anionic branched surfactants. Branched anonic surfactants can be derived from synthetic alcohols such as the primary alcohols from the liquid hydrocarbons produced by Fischer-Tropsch condensed syngas, for example SAFOL 23 Alcohol available from Sasol North America, Houston, Tex.; from synthetically made alcohols such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,312 issued to Coffindaffer, et al on Jan. 1, 2002. Preferred alcohols are SAFOL&#x2122; 23. Preferred alkoxylated alcohols are SAFOL 23-3. Sulfates can be prepared by conventional processes to high purity from a sulfur based SO<sub>3 </sub>air stream process, chlorosulfonic acid process, sulfuric acid process, or Oleum process. Preparation via SO<sub>3 </sub>air stream in a falling film reactor is a preferred sulfation process.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0061">Suitable branched anionic surfactants include but are not limited to the branched anionic sulfates derived from SAFOL 23-n as previously described, where n is an integer between 1 and about 20. Fractional alkloxylation is also useful, for example by stoichiometrically adding only about 0.3 moles EO, or 1.5 moles EO, or 2.2 moles EO, based on the moles of alcohol present, since the molecular combinations that result are in fact always distributions of alkoxylates so that representation of n as an integer is merely an average representation. Preferred monomethyl branched anionic surfactants include a C<sub>12-13 </sub>alkyl sulfate derived from the sulfation of SAFOL 23, which has about 28% branched anionic surfactant molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0062">When the branched anionic surfactant is a branched anionic primary sulfate, it may contain some of the following branched anionic surfactant molecules: 4-methyl undecyl sulfate, 5-methyl undecyl sulfate, 7-methyl undecyl sulfate, 8-methyl undecyl sulfate, 7-methyl dodecyl sulfate, 8-methyl-dodecyl sulfate, 9-methyl dodecyl sulfate, 4,5-dimethyl decyl sulfate, 6,9-dimethyl decyl sulfate, 6,9-dimethyl undecyl sulfate, 5-methyl-8-ethyl undecyl sulfate, 9-methyl undecyl sulfate, 5,6,8-trimethyl decyl sulfate, 2-methyl dodecyl sulfate, and 2-methyl undecyl sulfate. When the anionic surfactant is a primary alkoxylated sulfate, these same molecules may be present as the n=0 unreacted alcohol sulfates, in addition to the typical alkoxylated adducts that result from alkoxylation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0063">Any amounts of anionic surfactant or combinations thereof suitable to, in conjunction with other ingredients in the composition to produce a structured composition is suitable. According to certain embodiments, anionic surfactant is used in a concentration from greater than about 0.1% to about 30% by weight of active anionic surfactant in the composition. However to provide sufficient structuring, preferably the anionic surfactant is used in a higher concentration, preferably from about 2% to about 30%, more preferably from about 7% to about 25%, even more preferably from about 10% to about 22% of active anionic surfactant in the composition.</p>

<p id="p-0121" num="0154">In certain preferred embodiments, the anionic surfactant for use in the present invention comprises a branched anionic surfactant. By &#x201c;branched anionic surfactant,&#x201d; it is meant an anionic surfactant comprising more than 10% branched surfactant molecules. Suitable branched anionic surfactants include tridecanol based sulfates such as sodium trideceth sulfate, which generally comprises a high level of branching, with over 80% of surfactant molecules comprising at least 2 branches. Another suitable branched anionic surfactant is a C<sub>12-13 </sub>alkyl sulfate derived from SAFOL 23 alcohol (Sasol, Inc, Houston, Tex., USA) which has about 15-30% branched surfactant molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0155">Branched anionic surfactants include but are not limited to the following branched anionic alkyl sulfate or alkyl ether sulfate surfactants: sodium tridecyl sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-13 </sub>alkyl sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-15 </sub>alkyl sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-15 </sub>alkyl sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-18 </sub>alkyl sulfate, sodium C<sub>10-16 </sub>alkyl sulfate, sodium trideceth sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-13 </sub>pareth sulfate, sodium C<sub>12-13 </sub>pareth-n sulfate, and sodium C<sub>12-14 </sub>pareth-n sulfate. One particularly suitable branched anionic surfactant (about 50% branched) is a sodium trideceth sulfate, available as CEDEPAL TD 430 MFLD from Stepan Company of Northfield, Ill.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0156">Other salts of all the aforementioned branched anionic surfactants are useful, such as TEA, DEA, ammonia, potassium salts. Useful alkoxylates include the ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and EO/PO mixed alkoxylates. Phosphates, carboxylates and sulfonates prepared from branched alcohols are also useful anionic branched surfactants. Branched anonic surfactants can be derived from synthetic alcohols such as the primary alcohols from the liquid hydrocarbons produced by Fischer-Tropsch condensed syngas, for example SAFOL 23 Alcohol available from Sasol North America, Houston, Tex.; from synthetically made alcohols such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,312 issued to Coffindaffer, et al on Jan. 1, 2002. Preferred alcohols are SAFOL&#x2122; 23. Preferred alkoxylated alcohols are SAFOL 23-3. Sulfates can be prepared by conventional processes to high purity from a sulfur based SO<sub>3 </sub>air stream process, chlorosulfonic acid process, sulfuric acid process, or Oleum process. Preparation via SO<sub>3 </sub>air stream in a falling film reactor is a preferred sulfation process.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0157">Suitable branched anionic surfactants include but are not limited to the branched anionic sulfates derived from SAFOL 23-n as previously described, where n is an integer between 1 and about 20. Fractional alkloxylation is also useful, for example by stoichiometrically adding only about 0.3 moles EO, or 1.5 moles EO, or 2.2 moles EO, based on the moles of alcohol present, since the molecular combinations that result are in fact always distributions of alkoxylates so that representation of n as an integer is merely an average representation. Preferred monomethyl branched anionic surfactants include a C<sub>12-13 </sub>alkyl sulfate derived from the sulfation of SAFOL 23, which has about 28% branched anionic surfactant molecules.</p>

In sum, the benefit agent is used in a &#x201c;safe and effective amount,&#x201d; which is an amount that is high enough to deliver a desired skin or nail benefit or to modify a certain condition to be treated, but is low enough to avoid serious side effects, at a reasonable risk to benefit ratio within the scope of sound medical judgment.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0218">Compositions of the present invention are structured, i.e., have a Yield Stress from about 1 Pascal (Pa) to about 1500 Pa; more preferably from about 10 Pa to about 1100 Pa and preferably include a lamellar phase that is largely composed of one or more surfactants that is dispersed within an exterior (typically aqueous) phase. The viscosity of the personal care composition may be such that the composition is spreadable such as that of a cream or lotion or gel. For example. when measured using a LVT3 spindle at 30 rpm, the viscosity may be from about 500 cps to about 2000 cps.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0219">In certain embodiments of the invention the viscosity of the composition is particularly stable over time.

Similarly the change in pH from an initial reading to the composition having undergone 3 freeze-thaw cycles may be less than +/&#x2212;0.05.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0221">In one embodiment of the present invention the structured composition comprises at least two visually distinct phases wherein a first phase is visually distinct from a second phase. Preferably, the visually distinct phases are packaged in physical contact with one another and are stable. Preferably, the visually distinct phases form a pattern such as stripes, ribbons, or striations.

<p id="p-0174" num="0229">The following Yield Stress Test is used in the instant methods and in the following Examples. In particular, as described above, the Yield Stress test is used to determine whether a composition is structured, according to the present invention. Furthermore, the Degree of Heaping Test is used to determine the ability of the composition to recover shape rapidly.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Yield Stress Test:</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0230">The following Yield Stress Test was performed on various personal care compositions to determine the Yield Stress according to the present invention. Samples were placed in a water bath set at 25&#xb0; C. for a period time sufficient to allow the sample to equilibrate (at least about an hour). The procedure was accomplished by gently placing about 1.0 grams of the composition to be tested was on the base plate of a properly calibrated rheometer (e.g., Advanced Rheometer AR 2000) having a 20 mm cone with a 1 degree angle, a 20 mm plate, a water bath, and a solvent trap. The sample size was just sufficient to allow some minor flow of the sample out of the gap once the final position of the cone and plate was reached (0.030 mm). To minimize shearing of the sample prior to testing, each sample was applied to the plate in a consistent manner, by gently scooping out the sample in one motion without significant shear or spreading, evenly layered on the plate, and without compressing and rotating the spatula away from the sample. The sample was centered on the base plate and laid relatively even across the plate. Once the measurement position was reached, a small bulge of the sample material protruded from the gap. This was removed quickly and gently so as not to disturb the top plate and pre-shear the sample. [If the top plate was moved then the run was aborted.] The sample preparation described thus far was less than 20 seconds to reduce undue drying of the sample. The instrument was set for a controlled shear rate run (log) with a shear rate spanning from 0.01<sup>&#xb7;&#x2212;1</sup>, to 300<sup>&#xb7;&#x2212;1</sup>; 300 data points collected; 300 seconds test duration; 25&#xb0; C. water bath. The output device attached to the rheometer was set to plot stress (Pa) as a function of shear rate s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Yield stress was determined from the plot of yield stress versus shear rate as the stress at which the curve departs from linearity. The average and standard deviation of the 3 runs was determined.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Degree of Heaping Test:</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0231">The following Degree of Heaping Test was performed on various personal care compositions to determine the H-B Dimension according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0232">Immediately after completing the Yield Stress Test above, the cone was then removed from the plate using the automated lift motor on the rheometer. The sample was left on the plate for 30 minutes and a digital picture was taken with a Canon S25, 5 megapixel camera. The picture is evaluated using a box counting technique method, starting with a box scale of one box covering the plate sample area and doubling the number of boxes with each iteration until the number of boxes equals one thousand and twenty four. The H-B dimension of the material is calculated by plotting log N(1) versus log 1, where N(1) is a number of boxes containing any surface of the material and 1 is a resolution representing the reciprocal of the number of the boxes (i.e., box resolution) and wherein the H-B dimension is a straight line slope of the plot from eight boxes to one thousand and twenty four boxes. The test method repeated so that 10 replicates were performed for each sample. If the resulting H-B dimension has a relative standard deviation of less than 10% the value is reported for the sample.</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0235">The structured compositions noted in Table 1 were prepared as follows: Ingredients were added in the order listed to a suitable size vessel equipped with an overhead propeller type mixer. Agitation was sufficient to maintain good batch movement without aeration. Components were added while maintaining constant agitation. pH was measured after the last component was added and adjusted to 5.5-6.5 Citric acid was then added to reduce to pH to between about 5.7. Specifically 0.12%, 0.11%, and 0.10% of citric acid was added to Ex. 1, Ex. 2 respectively to reduce the pH to 5.70, 5.70 and 5.74 respectively. Examples Ex. 1-Ex. 2 were evaluated for viscosity using a standard Brookfield DV-I+ viscometer with rotating LVT3 spindle at 30 rpm, with values in centipoise (cps) reported in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0236">Ex. 1 and Ex. 2 were applied to a body surface and allowed to remain for several minutes. The depilatory composition was then removed. The compositions were successful at removing hair. Viscosity stability for Ex. 1 evaluated after 1 week at 50&#xb0; C. was not as good as expected, but these conditions are considered a very demanding challenge for a depilatiory composition. Ex. 2 also showed excellent creamy aesthetics and excellent stability after a limited 3 day evaluation.</p>

Ex. 3 and Ex. 4 were applied to a body surface and allowed to remain for several minutes. The depilatory composition was then removed. The inventive compositions were successful at removing hair. Ex. 3 and Ex. 4 showed excellent creamy aesthetics. By using the alkyl olefin sulfonate to aid in structuring the composition, it is also possible to achieve excellent pH stability, excellent freeze thaw stability and excellent viscosity stability. Unlike Ex. 1, the changes in pH (between initial and either 2 weeks at 25&#xb0; C. or freeze thaw; or between 2 weeks at 25&#xb0; C. and 13 weeks at 25&#xb0; C.) are all less than 0.05 units. Furthermore, unlike Ex. 1, the changes in viscosity (between initial and either 2 weeks at 25&#xb0; C. or freeze thaw; or between 2 weeks at 25&#xb0; C. and 13 weeks at 25&#xb0; C.) are all less than +/&#x2212;15%.</p>
