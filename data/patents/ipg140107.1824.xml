<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Section 371 of International Application No. PCT/EP2005/007682, filed Jul. 14, 2005, which was published in the German language on Jan. 26, 2006, under International Publication No. WO2006/008072 A3, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an adapter for an electrosurgical instrument and in particular for a power connection element located between a handle and an electrosurgical instrument adapted to be fastened to it.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For many years now, electrosurgical instruments have been in use in high-frequency surgery to coagulate or cut biological tissue. In the case of coagulation, a high-frequency current is passed through the tissue under treatment so that it contracts as a result of protein coagulation and dehydration, sealing vessels and making it possible to arrest bleeding. An increase in the current density permits complete separation, i.e. cutting of the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To perform operations, electrosurgical instruments with monopolar electrodes are used, among other things, in HF surgery. The electrodes, for example ball or loop electrodes, are usually arranged at one distal end of a shank. One proximal end of the shank comprises a power connection element shaped to accommodate a handle so that the electrosurgical instrument can be connected to an HF generator via the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Commercially available electrosurgical instruments with monopolar electrodes have a shank diameter of 2.35 mm or 4.00 mm, and the size of the power connection elements is coordinated to the respective shank diameter. Problems are caused by the fact that instruments with different shank diameters are manufactured on two different production lines and, for example, the single parts needed for production have to be stocked completely. The realization of differing production processes, however, calls for a considerable organizational effort and is costly.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention therefore provides an adapter that makes it possible to reduce organizational effort and costs in the production of electrosurgical instruments with monopolar electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the invention there is provided an adapter for a power connection element located between a handle and an electrosurgical instrument adapted to be attached to it that comprises an insulation portion for adapting at least on insulation section of the power connection element and an electrically conductive portion for adapting at least one electrically conductive section of the power connection element. The insulation portion and the electrically conductive portion are configured in such a way that the insulating section and the electrically conductive section may have their dimensions increased.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Hence, in view of the invention, only the electrosurgical instruments with the smaller shank diameter have to be manufactured. With the aid of the adapter, instruments with the larger diameter can be produced using those with the smaller shank diameter so that both types of instruments can be obtained from one production line only. In a first preferred embodiment the insulating portion and/or the electrically conductive portion are essentially configured in a sleeve shape. The portions can then be preferably arranged over the appropriate sections, i.e. over the insulating section and the conductive section of the power connection element in the simplest of ways because the portions only need to be pushed over the electrosurgical instrument. The sleeve-shaped portions can also be manufactured easily and at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further preferred embodiment, the insulating portion envelops at least the insulating section essentially in a form fit. The insulating element is therefore provided with the geometry and thus also the characteristics of the insulating section.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The insulating portion preferably comprises a rotation lock configured particularly as a hexagonal part. The rotation lock is already provided on the insulating section of the power connection element to ensure reliable arresting of the handle. As the insulating portion also features a rotation lock, the handle can be fitted in the usual way and the instrument can be operated in the usual way with the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The electrically conductive portion preferably envelops at least one electrically conductive section essentially in a form fit. The electrically conductive portion is provided with the geometry and the characteristics of the electrically conductive section and the instrument can be operated in the usual way.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment the insulating portion is firmly connected to the electrically conductive portion. Hence, the complexity of fitting the adapter device to the electrosurgical element can be minimized because the adapter device can be fitted onto the electrosurgical instrument in one single operation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The insulating portion and the electrically conductive portion are preferably capable of being connected to one another. If it is intended to produce the insulating portion and the electrically conductive portion as independent components, these can be replaced easily, for example if they have been damaged. However, a screwable connection ensures a reliable connection when the portions are fitted together.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further embodiment, the insulating portion and the electrically conductive portion can be connected to one another by means of a plug connection. The plug connection ensure particularly easy assembly and disassembly of the components so as to ensure fast and easy replacement of one single component.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The portions are preferably configured so that, when fitted, they are at least at such a distance from the sections of the power connection element to rule out tilting during assembly. End welding of the electrically conductive section and electrically conductive portion then ensures reliable arresting of the adapter and establishes electrical contact.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the following description, the same reference numbers are used to denote identical parts and those that have an identical effect.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an electrosurgical instrument <b>10</b> in an embodiment whereby the instrument <b>10</b> comprises an electrode <b>13</b> at one distal end. The electrode <b>13</b> is configured on a shank <b>14</b> of the electrosurgical instrument <b>10</b>. A power connection element <b>15</b> is provided on one proximal end <b>12</b> of the electrosurgical instrument <b>10</b>. The power connection element <b>15</b> consists of an insulating section <b>20</b> and an electrically conductive section <b>30</b>. The insulating section <b>20</b> comprises a hexagonal part <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Commercially available electrosurgical instruments with monopolar electrodes are configured with a shank diameter of 2.35 mm or 4.00 mm. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the electrosurgical instrument <b>10</b> is shown with a shank diameter of 2.35 mm. The power connection element <b>15</b> is designed accordingly. To provide the illustrated instrument <b>10</b> with a power connection element that is designed according to a shank diameter of 4.00 mm, an insulating element <b>40</b> and an electrically conductive element <b>50</b> can be pushed over the proximal end <b>12</b> of the electrosurgical instrument <b>10</b> and thus over the power connection element <b>15</b>. The insulating element <b>40</b> and the electrically conductive element <b>50</b> are shown in their non-assembled stated in the figure.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the fitted state, the insulating element <b>40</b> envelops the insulating section <b>20</b> and an area of the electrically conductive section <b>30</b>. Just like the insulating section <b>20</b>, the insulating element <b>40</b> comprises a hexagonal part <b>41</b> on a first end of the insulating section <b>40</b>. On later fitting of a handle (not shown), the hexagonal part <b>41</b> serves as a rotation lock for the handle. This ensures that the handle is reliably fastened on the electrosurgical instrument <b>10</b> and the operating surgeon can reliably guide the electrosurgical instrument <b>10</b> during treatment. In this embodiment, the insulating element <b>40</b> and the electrically conductive element <b>50</b> are sleeve-shaped so they can be pushed very easily over the power connection element <b>15</b>. According to this embodiment, the insulating element <b>40</b> and the electrically conductive element <b>50</b> are capable of being connected to one another by plugging. This ensures easy assembly and disassembly of the elements.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As an alternative, it is possible to connect the insulating element and the electrically conductive to one another by means of a screwed connection. The screwed connection ensures a reliable connection when the elements are fitted together. If the two elements are firmly connected to one another, the complexity of fitting the adapter device to the electrosurgical element can be minimized because the adapter device can be fitted onto the electrosurgical instrument in one single operation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the electrosurgical element <b>10</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, whereby here the power connection element is already provided with the insulating element <b>40</b> and the electrically conductive element <b>50</b>.</p>

The adapter device fitted to the electrosurgical instrument is shown in a section. The insulating element <b>40</b> or the electrically conductive element <b>50</b> is pushed over the insulating section <b>20</b> or an electrically conductive section <b>30</b>. As can be seen in the figure, the insulating element <b>40</b> and the electrically conductive element <b>50</b> are connected to one another by means of a plug connector <b>60</b>. To this end, at one end pointing towards the insulating element <b>40</b> the electrically conductive element <b>50</b> comprises a rotation-symmetrical recess <b>51</b>, into which an appendage <b>42</b> of the insulating element <b>40</b> can be pushed. As can be seen in the figure, the insulating element <b>40</b> and the electrically conductive element <b>50</b> envelop the insulating section <b>20</b> or the electrically conductive section <b>30</b> essentially in a form fit. The insulating element <b>40</b> or envelops an area of the electrically conductive section <b>30</b>. The sleeve-shaped insulating element <b>40</b> is configured in an area enveloping the insulating section <b>20</b> in such a way that the hexagonal part <b>21</b> of the insulating section <b>20</b> can be accommodated in the insulating element <b>40</b> and, in this embodiment, once again comprises the hexagonal part <b>41</b> on an outer circumference. The hexagonal parts are intended as rotation locks so as to ensure fitting of a handle (not shown) on the electrosurgical instrument without subsequent rotation of the handle being enabled. To ensure a reliable connection between the sections and the elements and electrical contact between the electrically conductive section <b>30</b> and the electrically conductive element <b>50</b>, the electrically conductive element <b>50</b> is welded to the electrically conductive section <b>30</b> at the end, i.e. by means of a weld <b>70</b> at an end opposite the plug connector <b>60</b>.</p>
