<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A description will now be given of exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Some exemplary embodiments apply a burn-in process to a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) of selective oxidation type and screens a faulty VCSEL in a short period of time at low cost. The scale of the figures is emphasized for the purpose of better understanding of the exemplary embodiments and is not identical to the actual device scale.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an exemplary VCSEL of selective oxidation type. A VCSEL <b>10</b> has an n-type GaAs substrate on which there are stacked an n-type GaAs buffer layer <b>104</b>, an n-type lower Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) <b>106</b>, an active region <b>108</b>, a current confining layer <b>110</b>, and a p-type upper DBR <b>112</b> in this order. The n-type lower DBR layer <b>106</b> is composed of AlGaAs layers that have different Al compositions and are alternately stacked. The current confining layer <b>110</b> is formed of p-type AlAs. The p-type upper DBR <b>112</b> is composed of AlGaAs layers that have different Al compositions and are alternately stacked. The uppermost layer of the upper DBR <b>112</b> may be a p-type GaAs contact layer <b>114</b>, and the lowermost layer thereof may be the current confining layer <b>110</b>. An n-side electrode <b>150</b> is formed on the backside of a substrate <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A cylindrical post (column structure) P that functions as a light emitting part of laser is defined by etching the stacked layer structure from the upper DBR <b>112</b> to a part of the lower DBR <b>106</b>. An electrode pad <b>134</b> is formed in a pad formation area <b>118</b>, which is separate from the post P across a groove. The current confining layer <b>110</b> includes an oxidized region <b>110</b>A and a circular conductive region. The oxidized region <b>110</b>A is formed by selectively oxidizing an outer circumferential portion of the post P from the side surface of the post P. The conductive region is surrounded by the oxidized region <b>110</b>A. The current confining layer thus formed confines current and light within the conductive region.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An interlayer insulation film <b>120</b>, which may be made of, for example, SiNx, is formed on the substrate including a part of the top of the post P. A ring-shaped contact hole is formed in the interlayer insulation film <b>120</b> at the top of the post P. A p-side upper electrode <b>130</b> is electrically connected to the contact layer <b>114</b> via the contact hole. The p-side upper electrode <b>130</b> may be made of, for example, gold or titanium/gold, and has an aperture <b>132</b> located at the center and shaped into a circle. The aperture <b>132</b> defines an emission range of the laser beam. In the exemplary structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the aperture <b>132</b> is covered with the interlayer insulation film <b>120</b> to thus protect the contact layer <b>114</b> so as not to be exposed to the outside.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A VCSEL <b>10</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> does not have the n-side electrode <b>150</b> on the backside of the substrate but has an n-side electrode <b>150</b>A formed on the main surface of the substrate.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The VCSEL does not have catastrophic optical degradation (COD) which the edge emitting semiconductor laser has. Thus, most of optical degradation due to the current upper limit is thermal breakdown. Heat generation resulting from current injection concentrates on the post P of the VCSEL. Thus, the conditions for applying stress to the VCSEL depend on the VCSEL temperature and the heat resistance of each substance that forms the VCSEL. An exemplary substance that is often used for VCSEL and has a low melting point is gold for the p-side electrode (having a melting point of about 1000&#xb0; C., and the alloy temperature of Au and AlGaAs or AlGa has a lower melting point than the Au alone, which is as low as about 600&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The temperature rise of the light emitting part due to the upper limit of the current injection range in the practical use of VCSEL is 60&#xb0; C. at maximum. Thus, there is a margin of 540&#xb0; C. or more in order to thermally break down the normal device. Thus, breakdown caused by injection of high current is effective as a method for burn-in screening thermally weak devices. Particularly, a lattice defect occurs in VCSEL of selectively oxidation type in which the AlAs layer and the AlGaAs layer are selectively oxidized. This is because a lattice mismatch between the AlGaAs layers located on and below the amorphous oxidized layer (current confining layer) formed in the post P. Thus, the burn-in screening may have another requirement in which the injected current corresponds to a temperature higher than the temperature at which AlAs is selectively oxidized. The oxidation temperature of the current confining layer is approximately 340&#xb0; C. Current easily flows in fine faulty portions in the active layer and the temperature rises quickly due to the current injection. Thus, the optical output is degraded shortly due to current injection corresponding to high temperature. Further, a fault may occur in the Au upper electrode or the AlGaAs lower layer in VCSEL. Thus, by raising the light emitting temperature up to 600&#xb0; C. by current injection, VCSEL having an ohmic failure between the Au electrode and AlGaAs may be screened.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Next, the burn-in process for VCSEL is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph of illustrating a relation between change of the optical power of VCSEL and time. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the vertical axis is the amount of light, and the horizontal axis is the time. It is assumed that Po is the amount of light obtained when the VCSEL operates normally in room temperature (25&#xb0; C.). When the amount Po of light reduces by 2 dB, the VCSEL is determined to be failure. The usable period Tc of VCSEL is up to the means time to failure (MTTF) when the failure occurs. Tb is the burn-in period, which may be defined as MTTF&#xd7;0.1. By applying stress to VCSEL for the burn-in period Tb, random failures that occur at the initial stage of VCSEL in operation can be detected. The initial failures of VCSEL may be sudden death in which the amount Po of light is zero. A failure mode that causes sudden death may be crystal defect caused in the active layer during the epitaxial growth, stress change due to crack, peeling or flaw in the protection film that covers the post P, and change of the nature of the surface film caused by alloying due to local Joule heat between the p-side upper electrode and the contact layer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The burn-in process of the present exemplary embodiment applies high stress current to the VCSEL placed in the room-temperature environment and thus applies an abrupt thermal load or stress to the VCSEL. The stress current is greater than the current that causes thermal rollover of VCSEL and is smaller than the failure current at which the VCSEL fails. The burn-in period is set equal to or shorter than 2 seconds by applying the stress current to VCSEL.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph of an estimated relation between the laser temperature (the inner temperature of the post P) and drive current Iop injected to the VCSEL. The laser temperature rises as the drive current Iop increases. The drive current obtained when the amount Po of light of the VCSEL reduces by 2 dB, that is, the failure current is 48.1 mA. At this time, the laser temperature is approximately 810&#xb0; C. It is estimated that the p-side Au electrode on the top of the post P starts melting. Thus, the stress current in the burn-in process may be set to a current value with which the laser temperature is lower than 810&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph of exemplary setting ranges of the stress current in the burn-in process of the present exemplary embodiment. The horizontal axis of the graph is the drive current Iop supplied to the VCSEL, and the vertical axis is the scales of the amount of light and voltage. A curve K<b>1</b> is the amount of laser light emitted by the VCSEL, and a curve K<b>2</b> is the operating voltage of the VCSEL. A curve K<b>3</b> is the slope effect. The drive current Iop supplied to the VCSEL is segmented into three ranges A, B and C associated with changes in the amount of light of the VCSEL.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The range A is between a current value with which the VCSEL starts emitting the laser oscillation and a current value located at a turning point at which the amount Po of light of the VCSEL changes from increasing to decreasing. The latter current value is located at the turning point of the thermal rollover R. In the range A, the dominant factor is the electro-optic conversion in which the current injected to the VCSEL is converted to light. The transverse diffusion current due to increase in current degrades the electro-optic conversion efficiency and generates heat. The range A may be used in the normal operation mode, normal inspection and burn-in process.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The range B is between the current value at the turning point at which the amount Io of light of the VCSEL changes from increasing to decreasing (the turning point of the thermal rollover R) and a current value with which the amount Po of light is zero. In the range B, the dominant factor is the electro-thermal conversion. The electro-optic conversion in the active layer is saturated and extra injection current is converted to heat. The range B may be used for stress current in the burn-in process and a failure detection mode of the present exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The range C is between the upper limit of the current value of the region B and the failure current value. The dominant factor is the electro-thermal conversion, and the laser oscillation does not take place. The region C may be used for stress current in the burn-in process that is carried out for an extremely short period of time at room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The burn-in process of the present exemplary embodiment is based on the experimental results conducted by the inventors in which the applied temperature range associated with the change of the optical output is expanded by applying high stress current to the VCSEL at room temperature of 25&#xb0; C. For example, the conventional burn-in process may be typically carried out in such a manner that the burn-in time Tb is set equal to tens to hundreds of hours and the laser temperature is equal to or lower than around 200&#xb0; C. In contrast, according to the present exemplary embodiment, the laser temperature is around 600&#xb0; C. and the burn-in period Tb is set equal to 2 seconds or less.</p>

Although the amount-of-light measurement unit <b>270</b> may be of fixed type, it is preferably configured to move on the X-Y plane in accordance with a corresponding control signal from the control part <b>280</b>.</p>

The control part <b>280</b> includes a burn-in condition setting part <b>281</b>, a drive current control part <b>282</b>, a stage position control part <b>283</b>, a stage temperature control part <b>284</b>, a measurement unit control part <b>285</b>, a measured value comparing part <b>286</b>, and a pass/fail decision making part <b>287</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A description will now be given of a wafer-level burn-in method in accordance with an exemplary embodiment with reference to a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. First, the wafer W is placed on the suction stage <b>250</b> and is sucked thereto (step S<b>101</b>). Next, the burn-in condition setting part <b>281</b> reads the burn-in conditions, which may be stored in the memory beforehand or may be supplied by the input part <b>290</b>, and sets the burn-in conditions in the control part <b>280</b>. For example, the input part <b>290</b> supplies the control part <b>280</b> with information about the number n of chips that are integrally formed on the wafer W and should be subjected to the burn-in process, the screening condition, and the temperature Ta of the suction stage <b>250</b> to be set (which may be equal to 25&#xb0; C.) (step S<b>102</b>). After the burn-in conditions are thus set in the burn-in condition setting part <b>281</b>, as necessary, the stage temperature control part <b>284</b> sets the temperature of the suction stage <b>250</b> to the room temperature of 25&#xb0; C. on the basis of the burn-in conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Then, the electro-optic characteristic of the specific or selected VCSEL <b>10</b> on the wafer W is measured (step S<b>103</b>). In this measurement, the stage position control part <b>283</b> moves the suction stage <b>250</b> to electrically contacts the p-side and n-side probe pins <b>230</b> and <b>240</b> to the p-side and n-side electrodes of the VCSEL <b>10</b>. The switch part <b>226</b> of the current drive part <b>220</b> supplies the measurement current generated by the measurement current generating part <b>224</b> to the VCSEL <b>10</b>. The VCSEL <b>10</b> driven by the measurement current emits the laser beam via the emission window of the post P. The amount-of-light measurement unit <b>270</b> is positioned to the target VCSEL <b>10</b>, and measures the amount of light emitted by the VCSEL <b>10</b>. The amount of light thus measured is stored in the measured value comparing part <b>286</b> as the initial value obtained by the first measurement (step S<b>103</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with the burn-in conditions thus set, the stress current is applied to the selected VCSEL <b>10</b> (step S<b>104</b>). More specifically, the switch part <b>226</b> of the current drive part <b>220</b> supplies the stress current generated by the stress current generating part <b>222</b> to the VCSEL <b>10</b>. As has been described, the stress current falls in the region B or C higher than the thermal rollover. When the stress current that approximately corresponds to an inner temperature of the post P of 600&#xb0; C. is applied to the VCSEL <b>10</b>, the stress current is applied for about 2 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The second-time measurement for the electro-optic characteristic of the selected VCSEL <b>10</b> is measured (step S<b>105</b>). The second-time measurement is carried out in the same manner as the first-time measurement. The measured value obtained by the second-time measurement is supplied to the measured value comparing part <b>286</b>, which compares the measured value of the first-time measurement with the measured value of the second-time measurement. The pass/fail decision making part <b>287</b> makes a pass/fail decision on the comparison results in accordance with a predetermined decision reference (step S<b>106</b>). The decision result by the pass/fail decision making part <b>287</b> is stored in the memory in associated with the selected VCSEL <b>10</b> (step S<b>107</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the burn-in process for the selected VCSEL <b>10</b> is complete, the control part <b>280</b> determines whether all of the chips have been processed by referring to the number n of chips (step S<b>108</b>), and proceeds to step S<b>103</b> to process the next VCSEL <b>10</b> if the answer is NO. This process is repeatedly carried out until all of the VCSELs <b>10</b> on the wafer W are completed. When all of the VCSELs <b>10</b> are completed, the screening process for the wafer W is completed, and the wafer W is taken out from the suction stage <b>250</b> (step S<b>109</b>). Then, VCSELs that are determined to be abnormal or faulty ones on the wafer W are marked.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to the present exemplary embodiment, the wafer-level burn-in process is carried out in the room-temperature environment. It is thus possible to reduce the problem arising from the difference in thermal expansion between the heat generation of the wafer and the probe pin array and to suppress heat generation by stress. Further, there is no need for a facility such as a large-scale chamber or furnace for keeping the wafer at high temperatures and for physically and thermally separating the function of detecting the amount of light from the facility. Furthermore, there is no need for particular dedicated probe pin arrays and probe cassette. This makes it possible to handle various mask pin patterns and increase the degree of freedom of mask design and facilitate design change.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A second exemplary embodiment will now be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram of a burn-in system in accordance with a second exemplary embodiment.

The stress current drive part <b>220</b>A supplies a stress current supplied from the stress power source <b>212</b> to a first set of p-side and n-side probe pins <b>230</b>A and <b>240</b>A. The measurement current drive part <b>220</b>B supplies a measurement current supplied from the measurement power source <b>214</b> to a second set of p-side and n-side probe pins <b>230</b>B and <b>240</b>B.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">During a period t<b>1</b> of time, the first VCSEL on the wafer selected by the stage position control part <b>283</b> is positioned to the first set of p-side and n-side probe pins <b>230</b>A and <b>230</b>B. Then, the stress current is applied to the first VCSEL by the stress current drive part <b>220</b>A. Preferably, the stress current falls in the region C (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and the VCSEL does not oscillate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">During a period t<b>2</b> of time, the first VCSEL is positioned to the second set of p-side and n-side probe pins <b>230</b>B and <b>240</b>B by the stage position control part <b>283</b>. Then, the measurement current is applied to the first VCSEL by the measurement current drive part <b>220</b>B. Thus, the first VCSEL oscillates. At this time, the amount-of-light measurement unit <b>270</b> is positioned to the first VCSEL, and measures the amount of laser light emitted by the first VCSEL.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">During a period t<b>3</b> of time, the second VCSEL on the wafer is selected and is positioned to the first set of p-side and n-side probe pins <b>230</b>A and <b>240</b>A. Then, the stress current is applied to the second VCSEL by the current drive part <b>220</b>A. During this operation, the amount-of-light measurement unit <b>270</b> is moved to a position where the mount of light of the second VCSEL can be measured during a period t<b>4</b> of time. During the period t<b>4</b>, the second VCSEL is positioned to the second set of p-side and n-side probe pins <b>230</b>B and <b>240</b>B. Then, the measurement current is applied to the second VCSEL. The amount of laser light emitted by the second VCSEL is measured by the amount-of-light measurement unit <b>270</b>. By alternately carrying out the application of the stress current and the electro-optic measurement, the process time it takes to perform the wafer-level burn-in process is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the above-described exemplary embodiment, the VCSEL is positioned to the p-side and n-side probe pins by moving the stage. Alternatively, the p-side and n-side probe pins may be moved to the VCSEL. It is possible to employ an arbitrary number of sets of probe pins, each of which is composed of a probe pin for supplying the stress current and another probe pin for supplying the measurement current. That is, the stress current drive part <b>220</b>A has multiple sets of p-side and n-side probe pins, and simultaneously supplies multiple VCSELs with the stress currents. The measurement current drive part <b>220</b>B has multiple sets of p-side and n-side probe pins, and simultaneously supplies multiple VCSELs with the measurement currents. The amount-of-light measurement unit measures the amounts of lights concurrently emitted by the multiple VCSELs.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The above-described exemplary embodiment is configured to successively perform the application of the stress current and the electro-optic measurement. This exemplary embodiment may be varied so as to simultaneously perform the two operations in which the stress current is applied to the first VCSEL while the amount of light emitted by the second VCSEL that has been supplied with the stress current is simultaneously measured. The precision of the optical measurement may be degraded due to optical crosstalk from the adjacent VCSEL. However, the present exemplary embodiment does not have such a problem. By supplying the VCSEL with the stress current that is not enough to generate laser oscillation, the electro-optic measurement of the adjacent VCSEL is not affected by the optical crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The program that executes the process sequence employed in the second exemplary embodiment makes it possible to successively perform the burn-in process for the multiple VCSELs on the wafer.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a block diagram of a system for performing the burning-in process for multiple modules. A system <b>200</b>B configured in accordance with the third exemplary embodiment has an arrangement in which a cassette or board <b>500</b> on which multiple modules <b>300</b> are mounted is attached to the suction stage <b>250</b>. An interconnection pattern used to connect the external terminals of the modules <b>300</b> is formed on the board <b>500</b>. The stress current drive part <b>220</b>A and the measurement current drive part <b>220</b>B are connected to the interconnection pattern on the board <b>500</b> via control lines rather than the probe pins. In this manner, the stress current and the measurement current are applied to the selected module <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the burn-in process for the module on which the VCSEL is mounded, the light emission post should not be covered with an organic material having carbonization/discoloration/combustibility because the temperature of the light emitting portion rises greatly.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A description will now be given of a fourth exemplary embodiment, which is different from the first through third exemplary embodiments in the following. The first through third exemplary embodiments apply the stress current to the VCSEL or VCSELs and then apply the measurement current thereto for the electro-optic characteristic in which the amount of light responsive to the measurement current is measured. In contrast, the fourth exemplary embodiment is configured to screen VCSELs by measuring an electric characteristic rather than the electro-optic characteristic. The VCSELs have a tendency such that the operation voltage of the normal VCSEL drops with high or great stress current being applied thereto. The fourth exemplary embodiment utilizes the above tendency.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 8</figref>, the selected one of the VCSELs on the suction stage <b>250</b> is supplied with great stress current for obtaining a predetermined light output via the p-side and n-side probe pins. The stress current may be greater than the thermal rollover R, and is preferably within the range B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The operating voltage of the VCSEL is measured while the stress current is applied thereto. Then, the operating voltage is compared with a predetermined threshold value. If the measured operating voltage is less than the threshold value, the VCSEL is determined to be normal. If not, it is determined that the VCSEL is faulty.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The fourth exemplary embodiment does not employ the amount-of-light measurement unit, and is greatly less expensive. The fourth exemplary embodiment may be combined with any of the first through third exemplary embodiments. The period of time during which current is applied may be extended up to the MTTF with which the breakdown test is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The foregoing description of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention has been provided for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously, many modifications and variations will be apparent to practitioners skilled in the art. The exemplary embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications, thereby enabling others skilled in the art to understand the invention for various exemplary embodiments and with the various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
