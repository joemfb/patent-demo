<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a memory, e.g., a flash memory, sometimes a word line's voltage needs to be higher than a power supply voltage VDD in order to effectively fulfill certain functions, e.g., read, erase, and/or program (write) functions. In some architectures, a thick gate-dielectric Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) device is used as a high voltage device in a word line boost circuit to boost the word line voltage higher than VDD supply. For example, a thick oxide MOS device is used because during an erase operation, the MOS device is exposed to a high voltage stress (e.g., more than 13 V in a flash memory cell).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, due to a relatively smaller gate capacitance in the high voltage device, a large number of high voltage devices are required to pump sufficient charge carriers into the word line's voltage supply and in turn to boost the word line voltage to a level higher than VDD in a reasonable time period. But a large number of high voltage devices consume a large chip area.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The making and using of various embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present disclosure provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use, and do not limit the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an exemplary word line boost circuit for a memory, e.g., a flash memory, using a thin dielectric capacitor in a read operation according to some embodiments. A dielectric (layer) can be implemented using various materials, e.g., oxide. The word line boost circuit <b>101</b> is coupled to a word line (WL) at a node N<b>0</b>. The WL is coupled to a word line bias supply <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The word line boost circuit <b>101</b> includes a pulse-generator <b>104</b>, a delay buffer <b>106</b>, a switch SW<b>1</b>, a transmission gate comprising high-voltage devices Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> (having thick gate-dielectric), a core device Q<b>3</b> (having thin gate-dielectric) that is a (MOS) capacitor (for word line boost), and a capacitor C<b>1</b> having thick gate-dielectric. Here, the term &#x201c;gate-dielectric&#x201d; is used for a dielectric layer of a MOS capacitor, but other terms can be used for an equivalent dielectric layer structure between two conductors of a capacitor for other embodiments, e.g., a &#x201c;capacitor dielectric (layer)&#x201d;. The capacitor C<b>1</b> is used to boost (i.e., supply a higher voltage than a power supply voltage VDD to) the N-well <b>108</b>, and is significantly smaller than the core device capacitor Q<b>3</b> that is used to boost the WL to a higher voltage than VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The thickness of thick and thin gate-dielectric is relative and can be varied depending on the integrated circuit technology implemented. For example, in one implementation of a 0.18 &#x3bc;m technology, the thick gate-dielectric thickness can be about 200 &#x212b;, while the thin gate-dielectric thickness can be about 30 &#x212b;. Thick gate-dielectric devices are suitable for a high-voltage (e.g., higher than VDD) operation, while thin gate-dielectric devices would be adversely influenced by the stress and eventually may fail under the high-voltage operation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For a read operation, the word line bias supply <b>102</b> provides a power supply voltage VDD to WL and at node N<b>0</b>, and the VDD is also supplied to N<b>1</b> through the switch SW<b>1</b> that is closed before being opened. Then SW<b>1</b> is opened and the transmission gate (devices Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>) are fully turned on. The capacitor C<b>1</b> keeps the voltage level of node N<b>1</b> at VDD, and the transmission gate (devices Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>) supplies the VDD at the node N<b>2</b> that charges the capacitor Q<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Then the pulse generator <b>104</b> applies a pulse signal CK<b>1</b> to node N<b>3</b>, which is coupled to the capacitor C<b>1</b> and pushes (boosts) the voltage at N<b>1</b> from VDD to VDD plus &#x394;V (i.e., VDDb=VDD+&#x394;V), e.g., VDD=1.8 V and VDDb=2.8 V. Also, the pulse signal from the pulse generator <b>104</b> passes through the delay buffer <b>106</b> having a time delay &#x394;t, and provides a pulse signal CK<b>2</b> to the MOS capacitor Q<b>3</b>. The pulse signal CK<b>2</b> also pushes (boosts) the voltage level of node N<b>2</b> from VDD to VDD plus &#x394;V (i.e., VDDb=VDD+&#x394;V).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The node N<b>1</b> is coupled to a bulk of the Q<b>1</b> device (PMOS transistor), which is contained in a (high-voltage) N-well <b>108</b>. Because the voltage level of the node N<b>1</b> is boosted by the pulse signal CK<b>1</b> from VDD to VDDb before the voltage level of the node N<b>2</b> (coupled to a source of the Q<b>1</b> device) is boosted by the pulse signal CK<b>2</b> from VDD to VDDb, a junction leakage current that may result from a forward-bias across a p-n junction in the N-well <b>108</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Since gate-dielectric thickness of core device Q<b>3</b> (e.g., a MOS capacitor) is smaller than the thickness of a high-voltage device having a thick gate-dielectric used in similar circuits, the gate capacitance of the core device Q<b>3</b> is greater than that of a high-voltage device. The relationship between charge carrier Q and the capacitance C of a capacitor can be expressed as Q=CV, where V is the voltage across the capacitor. Hence the larger the capacitance, the more charge carriers (or current) can be provided, e.g., for the load coupled to WL.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one example, compared to a high-voltage device having Width/Length W/L=600 &#x3bc;m/1.6 &#x3bc;m, a thin gate-dielectric device has W/L=150 &#x3bc;m/1.6 &#x3bc;m for similar capacitance. Therefore, the area of the thin gate-dielectric device (core device) is only 25% of the high-voltage (thick gate-dielectric) device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram showing the exemplary word line boost circuit for a memory in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in an erase (or program) operation according to some embodiments. During the erase (ultra-high voltage) operation, a much higher voltage (e.g. 13 V or above) than a power supply voltage VDD (e.g., 1.8 V) can be supplied from the word line bias supply. For the erase operation, the pulse generator <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is disabled. Hence, no pulse signals (CK<b>1</b> and CK<b>2</b>) are provided, and one terminal of the capacitor C<b>1</b> and the gate of the thin gate-dielectric device Q<b>3</b> (i.e., MOS capacitor) are grounded.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Meanwhile, the switch SW<b>1</b> is closed to connect the N-well <b>108</b> to the source terminal of Q<b>1</b> in order to prevent a junction leakage current across the p-n junction of Q<b>1</b> formed by the source and the bulk of Q<b>1</b>. The devices Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> (transmission gate) are turned off during the erase (high-voltage) operation. Thus, the thin gate-dielectric device Q<b>3</b> is isolated from the high-voltage stress (from the word line bias supply <b>102</b>) during the ultra-high voltage operation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plot showing waveforms for the exemplary word line boost circuit for a memory in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to some embodiments. The voltage waveforms of (high-voltage) N-Well <b>108</b> (HVNW) and word line (WLVDD) show that they are successfully boosted to about 2.6 V (VDD=1.8 V) at about time t<b>1</b> (and t<b>2</b>), while waveforms CK<b>1</b> and CK<b>2</b> show that CK<b>2</b> is asserted &#x394;t (from the delay buffer <b>106</b>) after CK<b>1</b>. Compared to the word line waveform (WLHVD) of a word line boost circuit having a thick gate-dielectric MOS capacitor instead of the thin gate-dielectric MOS capacitor (Q<b>3</b>), WLVDD show similar a boost function.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, compared to the word line boost circuit using a thick gate-dielectric MOS capacitor, the exemplary word line boost circuit <b>101</b> using a thin gate-dielectric MOS capacitor has a significantly reduced area (e.g., 25%). Also, the ultra high voltage (e.g., 13 V or above) that may be used during some operations, e.g., an erase or program operation, does not damage the thin gate-dielectric MOS capacitor in the exemplary word line boost circuit <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart of a method for the exemplary word line boost circuit for a memory in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to some embodiments. At step <b>402</b>, a power supply voltage (e.g., VDD=1.8 V) is supplied to a word line of the memory. At step <b>404</b>, a first capacitor (e.g., Q<b>3</b>) is charged to the power supply voltage level (e.g., VDD). The first capacitor (e.g., Q<b>3</b>) in the word line boost circuit (e.g., <b>101</b>) has a first capacitor dielectric thickness. At step <b>406</b> during a first operation (e.g., a read operation) of the memory, a first voltage level of the word line is boosted through a transmission gate (e.g., comprising devices Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>) to a first high voltage (e.g., 2.6 V) that is higher than the power supply voltage (e.g., 1.8 V). The transmission gate has a second gate-dielectric thickness that is greater than the first capacitor dielectric thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In various embodiments, a pulse (e.g., CK<b>2</b>) is supplied for the first capacitor (e.g., Q<b>3</b>). The pulse (e.g., CK<b>2</b>) is delayed. The delayed pulse (e.g., CK<b>2</b>) is supplied to the first capacitor (e.g., Q<b>3</b>). A second capacitor (e.g., C<b>1</b>) is charged to the power supply voltage (e.g., VDD). The second capacitor (e.g., C<b>1</b>) has a second capacitor dielectric thickness greater than the first capacitor dielectric thickness. A pulse (e.g., CK<b>1</b>) is supplied to the second capacitor (e.g., C<b>1</b>). A switch (e.g., SW<b>1</b>) coupled to the word line and the second capacitor (e.g., C<b>1</b>) is opened during the first operation (e.g., a read operation) of the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In various embodiments, a second voltage level of a bulk (e.g., <b>108</b>) of a PMOS transistor (e.g., Q<b>1</b>) in the transmission gate is boosted to a second high voltage (e.g., 2.6 V) that is higher than the power supply voltage (e.g., 1.8 V) during the first operation, e.g., a read operation, of the memory. The bulk (e.g., <b>108</b>) is coupled to the second capacitor (e.g., C<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various embodiments, a third high voltage (e.g., 13 V) that is higher than the first high voltage (e.g., 2.6 V) is supplied to the word line during a second operation (e.g., an erase operation) of the memory. The first capacitor (e.g., Q<b>3</b>) is isolated from the third high voltage (e.g., 13 V) during the second operation, e.g., an erase operation, of the memory. The isolation of the first capacitor (e.g., Q<b>3</b>) is performed by turning off the transmission gate (e.g., devices Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to some embodiments, a memory includes a word line and a word line boost circuit. The word line boost circuit includes a capacitor having a first capacitor dielectric thickness, and a transmission gate coupled to the word line and the capacitor. The transmission gate has a gate-dielectric thickness that is greater than the first capacitor dielectric thickness. The word line boost circuit is configured to supply a high voltage that is higher than a power supply voltage to the word line during an operation of the memory by utilizing the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to some embodiments, a method for boosting a word line of a memory includes supplying a power supply voltage to a word line of the memory. A capacitor has the first capacitor dielectric thickness in a word line boost circuit. The capacitor is charged to the power supply voltage. The voltage level of the word line is boosted to a high voltage that is higher than the power supply voltage through a transmission gate having a gate-dielectric thickness that is greater than the first capacitor dielectric thickness during an operation of the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One aspect of this description relates to a memory including a boost circuit configured to supply a voltage higher than a supply voltage to a word line.
