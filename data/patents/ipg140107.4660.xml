<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Existing telecommunications energy monitoring methods are very coarse. For instance, energy management systems and methods have traditionally been utilized at a site level (e.g., a central office site or a wireless site). For example, historically a telecommunication organization simply monitored energy consumption of a single site by way of regularly comparing the site's utility bills from month to month. While this approach helps ensure that the telecommunication site's energy consumption is at least consistent, it does not provide visibility to power consumption by each piece of telecommunication equipment arranged in the telecommunication site.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As such, telecommunications companies are beginning to monitor power consumption at a power distribution system level. Specifically, telecommunications companies are beginning to monitor power consumption at a primary power distribution level (e.g., a battery distribution feeder bay (BDFB)). For example, a telecommunications company may monitor energy consumption of a primary power distribution system by monitoring a current shunt monitor of the primary power distribution system. While this approach provides visibility to power consumption at the primary power distribution level, it also does not provide visibility to power consumption by each piece of telecommunication equipment arranged in the telecommunication site.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, power protection devices exist that have current monitors integrated and/or housed in the power protection device. For example, fuses exist that have a Hall Effect sensor mounted in the fuse assembly to measure a current of the fuse. Circuit breakers exist that have a current sensor assembly structurally fastened to, and integrated (e.g., internally wired) with, the circuit breaker forming a single integrated current sensor/circuit breaker assembly. While this approach provides visibility to power consumption at the equipment level, if the sensor fails, the whole sensor/circuit breaker assembly must be replaced.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This summary is provided to introduce simplified concepts for removable telecommunication sensor modules and a method of using the same, which is further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended for use in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A removable telecommunication sensor module is provided to monitor energy usage at a telecommunication equipment circuit level for a piece of telecommunication equipment arranged in a telecommunication network infrastructure. In one example, a current monitor device may be removeably coupled between a power protection device and a bus bar as a self-contained stand-alone single unit. The self-contained stand-alone current monitor device may be easily inserted into a slot of a power distribution system (e.g., a secondary power distribution panel) and removably coupled to the bus bar. A power protection device may also subsequently be inserted into the same slot and removably coupled to the self-contained current monitor device. One current monitor device may monitor a load output of a piece of telecommunication equipment. In another example, a current monitor device may be removeably coupled between a power protection device and a backplane (e.g., printed circuit board assembly (PCBA)) as a self-contained stand-alone single unit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The current monitor device may include a power receptacle having a through hole for providing a tool access to a power terminal arranged in-line with the power receptacle. In this way, the through hole allows a user to quickly and easily removably couple the current monitor device, housed in a slot, to and/or from a bus bar.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example, the current monitor device may comprise a current monitoring assembly (e.g., a printed circuit assembly (PCA)) arranged in the current monitor device to monitor a current flowing through a power protection device. The current monitoring assembly may be configured to report a signal based on the monitored current. The current monitor device may further comprise alarm contact receptacles to removably couple with cooperating alarm contacts of the power protection device. The current monitoring assembly may receive trip status signals from the alarm contacts and pass these trip status signals generated by the power protection device to a central control board. Further, the current monitoring assembly may also manipulate the monitored current to be outside a valid current range based on the trip status signals. This provides for the current monitoring assembly to indicate to a user that either the piece of telecommunication equipment arranged in-line with the power protection device is powered off or, alternatively, that the power protection device itself has tripped.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This disclosure is directed to removable telecommunication sensor modules and a method of using the same. The removable telecommunication sensor modules are easily installed and/or replaced. The removable sensor modules may comprise a housing containing a mini-bus bar to provide for connecting a power protection device and a bus bar. The mini-bus bar may include a power receptacle arranged in-line with a power terminal. The power receptacle may be disposed in a first surface of the housing to removably couple with a power plug of the power protection device. The power terminal may protrude from a second surface opposite the first surface to removably couple with a bus bar. The power receptacle may have a through hole providing a tool access to the power terminal to fasten the power terminal to and/or detach the power terminal from a bus bar. With the through hole providing a tool access to the power terminal arranged in-line with the power receptacle, the removable sensor modules may be quickly and easily installed and/or replaced. For example, a user may simply remove a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) breaker from a breaker panel, gaining access to a removable sensor module behind the COTS breaker, loosen the power terminal from the bus bar via the through hole in the power terminal, and remove the removable sensor module. To install/replace the removable sensor module, the user may simply insert the removable sensor module into the slot of the breaker panel, tighten the power terminal to the bus bar via the through hole in the power terminal, and insert a COTS breaker into the slot of the breaker panel, coupling the COTS breaker with the removable sensor module.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The removable sensor module may also contain a current monitoring assembly (e.g., a printed circuit assembly (PCA)). The current monitoring assembly may be arranged in the housing of the removable sensor module to be directly next to the mini-bus bar. The current monitoring assembly may include a current monitor (e.g., a current sensor mounted on a printed circuit assembly (PCA)) coupled to the mini-bus bar. The current monitor may monitor and report a current flowing through the mini-bus bar. In some implementations, the current monitor may be a Hall Effect current monitor disposed on a current monitor board coupled to the mini-bus bar.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The removable sensor modules may comprise a printed circuit assembly (PCA) having a receptacle fixed to a first end of the PCA, and power input and power output receptacles fixed to a second end of the PCA opposite the first end. The PCA may provide for connecting the removable sensor modules to a power protection device and/or a backplane.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Because, in this example, the removable sensor modules are self-contained single units, the removable sensor modules may be installed in the same single slot as a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) breaker and/or fuse. This provides for cost effective replacement and upgrade. For example, because the removable sensor modules are self-contained single units a user may simply replace a removable sensor module without having to replace a breaker and/or a fuse as well. Further, because the removable sensor modules are self-contained single units a user may simply replace a breaker and/or a fuse without having to replace a sensor. In addition, because the removable sensor modules may be installed in the same single slot as a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) breaker and/or fuse, a breaker and/or fuse panel density (i.e., number of breaker slots and/or fuse slots per one rack unit (1RU)) may be maintained. For example, because the removable sensor modules are self-contained as single units, the power protection devices remain intact. This eliminates any modification of the power protection devices. As such, the size of the power protection devices remains intact (i.e., remains stock COTS size) and likewise the breaker and/or fuse panel density remains intact. Further, the function of the power protection devices remains intact and as such the reliability of the power protection devices remains intact.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the illustrated embodiments show secondary power distribution panels comprising breakers and/or fuses, the breakers and fuses may be of any type of power protection devices suitable for use in power systems. For example the breakers and/or fuses may be TPS, TLS, breakers, KTK, KLM, TPC, GMT &#x201c;grasshopper&#x201d; type power protection devices. Further, while the illustrated embodiments show secondary power distribution panels suitable for powering telecommunications equipment configured to utilize &#x2212;48 VDC, +24 VDC, or other voltages, suitable for powering telecommunications equipment, the secondary power distribution panels may be of any type of power distribution panels. For example, the power distribution panels may be a distribution board, panel board, electrical panel, service panel, load center, or the like.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Example Power Protection Systems</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates an example telecommunications cabinet <b>102</b> including power distribution systems <b>104</b> having power protection devices <b>106</b> installed in slots in a front of the power distribution systems <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates an example telecommunications power distribution system <b>108</b> having power protection devices <b>106</b> installed in slots in a front of the power distribution system <b>108</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates another example telecommunications power distribution system <b>110</b> having power protection devices <b>106</b> installed in slots in a front of the power distribution system <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A cabinet <b>102</b> may be configured in a variety of ways to maintain or hold a plurality of components in a telecommunications infrastructure. For example, a cabinet <b>102</b> may be configured as a cabinet for a primary power distribution panel (e.g., a BDFB), a secondary power distribution panel (e.g., a breaker panel and/or a fuse panel) a housing, a terminal block, a panel, a chassis, a digital cross-connect, a switch, a hub, a rack, a frame, a bay, a module, an enclosure, an aisle, or other structure for receiving and holding a plurality of components.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Power distribution systems <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> may be configured in a variety of ways to provide power distribution in a single compact unit. For example, the power distribution systems <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> may be configured as breaker panels, fuse panels, dual-feed panels, combination breaker/fuse panels, combination dual-feed breaker/fuse panels, or the like. For example, the power distribution system <b>108</b> may be a combination dual-feed breaker/fuse panel and the power distribution system <b>110</b> may be a dual-feed fuse panel. The power distribution systems <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> may be configured to be installed in a cabinet, a rack, an enclosure, a chassis, a housing, or the like. For example, the power distribution system <b>108</b> may be installed in a rack and consume four rack units (4RUs) of the rack. Further, the power distribution system <b>110</b> may be installed in a rack and consume 1RU of the rack.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The power protection devices <b>106</b> may have standard dimensions that drive, or otherwise constrain, the dimensions of the slots. The power protection devices <b>106</b> may also drive, or otherwise constrain, the dimensions of removable sensor modules that may be installed in each of the slots. For example, the power protection devices <b>106</b> may be bullet-style circuit breakers to provide for pressing into a slot for installation. The bullet-style circuit breakers may have standard widths, lengths, and heights that are in a standards agency's compliance (e.g., Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Network Equipment Building Systems (NEBS), or the like). Further, the power protection devices <b>106</b> may be GMT-style fuses to provide for pressing into a slot for installation. Similarly the GMT-style fuses may have standard widths, lengths, and heights that are in a standards agency's compliance (e.g., Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Network Equipment Building Systems (NEBS), or the like). In either embodiment, the standard widths, lengths, and/or heights may constrain the dimensions of the slots.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Example Monitoring Systems</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example implementation of a current monitoring device <b>202</b> for use in the power distribution system <b>104</b> and in the power distribution system <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, respectively. The current monitoring device <b>202</b> may be inserted as a single unit into a slot <b>204</b> of the power distribution system <b>104</b>. For example, a user can easily install and/or replace a current monitoring device <b>202</b> which requires only front access because of the current monitoring device <b>202</b> blind mate installations. This provides for replacing failed current monitoring devices <b>202</b> and upgrading from &#x201c;non-monitoring&#x201d; to monitoring current monitoring devices <b>202</b> (discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Further, this provides for switching to a different current range (e.g., switching from a 60A max version to a 125A max version). A blind mate installation as used herein comprises a mating action that happens where you cannot see the connectors when mating (e.g., connecting) connectors. For example, a connector may be on a back of a current monitoring device (e.g., current monitoring device <b>202</b>) that is to be mated (e.g., connected and/or plugged) with a cooperating connector inside a power distribution system (e.g., power distribution system <b>104</b>). As such, the mating of the connector with the cooperating connector inside the power distribution system is not visible.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The current monitoring device <b>202</b> may include a housing <b>206</b> having a first surface <b>208</b>(A) opposite a second surface <b>208</b>(B). While the first and second surfaces <b>208</b>(A) and <b>208</b>(B) are illustrated as being planar surfaces, the first and second surfaces <b>208</b>(A) and <b>208</b>(B) may be spherical. For example, first and second surfaces <b>208</b>(A) and <b>208</b>(B) may be convex and/or concave. The current monitoring device <b>202</b> may also include a power receptacle <b>210</b>. The power receptacle <b>210</b> may be disposed in the first surface <b>208</b>(A) to removably couple with a power plug <b>212</b>(A) of the power protection device <b>106</b>. The power protection device <b>106</b> may also have another power plug <b>212</b>(B) which, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates, may not removably couple with the current monitoring device <b>202</b>. Instead, the other power plug <b>212</b>(B) may removably couple to an internal electrical component (e.g., a bus bar, a backplane, a harness, etc.) or some other power distribution equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The housing <b>206</b> may be formed of a plastic, metal, composite, or the like and may include a first portion <b>214</b>(A) and a cooperating second portion <b>214</b>(B) fastened to the first portion. The housing <b>206</b> may have external dimensions that are driven, or otherwise constrained by the dimensions of the power protection device <b>106</b>, and likewise the dimensions of the slot <b>204</b>. For example, the power protection device <b>106</b> may be a bullet-style circuit breaker having a standard width <b>216</b> of about 2.49 inches, a standard height <b>218</b> of about 0.75 inches, and a depth <b>220</b> of about 1.86 inches. The plugs <b>212</b>(A) and <b>212</b>(B) (i.e., bullets) may have a length of about 0.9 inches. The slot <b>204</b> may have an opening also having dimensions driven by the dimensions of the power protection device <b>106</b>. For example, the slot <b>204</b> may have an opening having dimensions capable of receiving a portion of the bullet-style circuit breaker. In this embodiment, where the slot has an opening to receive a bullet-style circuit breaker, the slot may have an opening having a width <b>222</b> of about 2.55 inches and a height <b>224</b> of about 0.78 inches. As such, the housing <b>206</b> may have a width <b>226</b> of about 2 inches, a height <b>228</b> of about 0.75 inches, and a depth <b>230</b> of about 1.8 inches for cooperating with the slot <b>204</b> and the power protection device <b>106</b>. More specifically, the first and second surfaces <b>208</b>(A) and <b>208</b>(B) of the housing <b>206</b> may each be about the same width <b>226</b> and height <b>228</b>. For example, each of the first and second surfaces <b>208</b>(A) and <b>208</b>(B) may have a width of about 0.85 times a width of a power protection device. For example, each of the first and second surfaces <b>208</b>(A) and <b>208</b>(B) may have a width of about 0.85 times the width <b>216</b>. Stated otherwise, the second surfaces <b>208</b>(A) and <b>208</b>(B) may have a width some amount less than the width of the power protection device <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the current monitoring device <b>202</b> may include alarm contact receptacles <b>232</b>(A) disposed in the first surface <b>208</b>(A). The alarm contact receptacles <b>232</b>(A) may removably couple with cooperating alarm contacts <b>232</b>(B) of the power protection device <b>106</b>. The power protection device <b>106</b> may pass trip status signals generated by the power protection device <b>106</b> to a central control board. For example, the power protection device <b>106</b> may pass trip status signals from the alarm contacts <b>232</b>(B) to the alarm contact receptacles <b>232</b>(A) and subsequently, pass the trip status signals to a central control board via a backplane, a central monitoring board, a harness, a cable, or other electrical interconnection equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a current monitoring device <b>202</b> for removably coupling with a bullet-style circuit breaker, the current monitoring device <b>202</b> may be for removably coupling with any other type of power protection device suitable for protecting equipment arranged in-line with the current monitor device. For example, the power protection device may be a single-pole circuit breaker, a double-pole circuit breaker, a triple-pole circuit breaker, a mid-trip circuit breaker, an instantaneous-trip breaker, or the like, power protection device. Further, the power protection device may be a fuse (e.g., a TPS fuse, a TLS fuse, a KTK fuse, a KLM fuse, a TPC fuse, a GMT fuse, etc.) type power protection device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a top section view of a current monitoring device installed in a slot of a power distribution system housed by a telecommunications cabinet. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the current monitoring device <b>202</b> removably coupled between the power protection device <b>106</b> and a bus bar <b>302</b>. The power plug <b>212</b>(A) of the power protection device <b>106</b> is illustrated as being removably received by the power receptacle <b>210</b> of the power protection device <b>106</b>. The alarm contacts <b>232</b>(B) of the power protection device <b>106</b> are illustrated as being removably coupled with cooperating alarm contact receptacles <b>232</b>(A) of the current monitoring device <b>202</b>. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the housing <b>206</b> with the second portion <b>214</b>(B) of the housing <b>206</b> removed, and the first portion <b>214</b>(A) of housing <b>206</b> exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a power terminal <b>304</b> protruding from the second surface <b>208</b>(B). The power terminal <b>304</b> is illustrated as being arranged in-line, along a center line <b>306</b>, with the power receptacle <b>210</b>. The power terminal <b>304</b> to removably couple with the bus bar <b>302</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the power terminal <b>304</b> being a threaded fastener, the power terminal <b>304</b> may be a quick-disconnect fastener, interference fastener, or the like. The power receptacle <b>210</b> may include a through hole <b>308</b> providing access to the power terminal <b>304</b> to removably couple the current monitoring device <b>202</b> to an/or from the bus bar <b>302</b>. For example, the through hole <b>308</b> may provide for a tool (e.g., a screw driver) to access the power terminal <b>304</b> (when the power protection device <b>106</b> is not installed in the slot) to fasten the power terminal <b>304</b> to and/or from the bus bar <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A mini-bus bar <b>310</b> may be arranged in the first portion <b>214</b>(A) of the housing <b>206</b>. The mini-bus bar <b>310</b> may connect the power receptacle <b>210</b> and the power terminal <b>304</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the power receptacle <b>210</b> and the power terminal <b>304</b> concentrically arranged in a first tab <b>312</b>(A) and a second tab <b>312</b>(B) of the mini-bus bar <b>310</b>, respectively. For example, the power receptacle <b>210</b> and the power terminal <b>304</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> being arranged concentric with, and opposite to each other along center line <b>306</b>. A current monitor <b>314</b> may be coupled to the mini-bus bar <b>310</b>. The current monitor <b>314</b> may monitor and report a current flowing through the mini-bus bar <b>310</b>. For example, the current monitor <b>314</b> may monitor and report a current flowing from the power protection device <b>106</b>, through the mini-bus bar <b>310</b>, to the bus bar <b>302</b>, and to a load (e.g., a piece of telecommunications equipment). Because the current flows through the power protection device <b>106</b> before the current monitoring device <b>202</b>, when the power protection device <b>106</b> is removed their will be no voltage passing to the load. This provides for installation and/or replacement of a current monitoring device <b>202</b> while leaving power to the rest of the current monitoring devices <b>202</b> in the power distribution system <b>104</b>. Current monitor <b>314</b> may be, for example, Hall Effect current monitors, although any other efficient (and potentially low cost) current sensors may be implemented. The Hall Effect current monitors may be purchased from a supplier. For example, the Hall Effect current monitors may be purchased from the following suppliers: Melexis Microelectronic Systems, located at Rozendaalstraat 12, B-8900 leper, Belgium; Allegro MicroSystems, Inc., located at 115 Northeast Cutoff, Worcester, Mass. 01606 USA; Analog Devices Inc. located at 3 Technology Way Norwood, Mass. 02062; or Honeywell International Inc., located at 101 Columbia Road Morristown, N.J. 07962.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a current monitoring device <b>202</b> having a current monitor <b>314</b> coupled to the mini-bus bar <b>310</b>, current monitoring device <b>202</b> may not have a current monitor <b>314</b> coupled to the mini-bus bar <b>310</b>. In this implementation, the current monitor device <b>202</b> may be devoid of current monitoring hardware and may be a &#x201c;non-monitoring&#x201d; current monitoring device <b>202</b>. For example, the &#x201c;non-monitoring&#x201d; current monitoring device <b>202</b> may pass a current from the power protection device <b>106</b> to the bus bar <b>302</b> via the mini-bus <b>310</b>. In addition, the &#x201c;non-monitoring&#x201d; current monitoring device <b>202</b> may receive trip status signals (e.g., alarm signals) generated by the power protection device <b>106</b> via the alarm contact receptacles <b>232</b>(A) removably coupled with cooperating alarm contacts <b>232</b>(B). By providing a &#x201c;non-monitoring&#x201d; current monitoring device <b>202</b>, this can be advantageous for a customer who may want to purchase a power distribution system <b>104</b> that does not require per circuit current monitoring at the time of purchase, but may wish to upgrade in the future. For example, a customer may install a piece of telecommunications equipment that the customer wants to monitor individually. In this example, the customer may simply remove the &#x201c;non-monitoring&#x201d; current monitoring device <b>202</b> and install a current monitoring device <b>202</b> that contains the necessary current monitoring hardware.</p>

The current monitoring device <b>202</b> may comprise signal pins <b>318</b>(A) removably coupled with cooperating receptacles <b>318</b>(B) of the backplane <b>316</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a backplane <b>316</b> having cooperating receptacles <b>318</b>(B), a harness may have cooperating receptacles <b>318</b>(B). For example, cooperating receptacles of a harness may be arranged between the current monitoring device <b>202</b> and the bus bar <b>302</b> via a bracket, or some other fastening mechanism to removably couple with the signal pins <b>318</b>(A). The signal pins <b>318</b>(A) may be disposed in the second surface <b>208</b>(B). For example a connector having the signal pins <b>318</b>(A) may be disposed in the second surface <b>208</b>(B) to removably connect with a cooperating connector having the cooperating receptacles <b>318</b>(B). The removably coupled signal pins <b>318</b>(A) disposed in the second surface <b>208</b>(B) may pass signals to a central control board.

The central board <b>406</b> of the current monitoring assembly <b>402</b> may include the alarm contact receptacles <b>232</b>(A) that may removably couple with cooperating alarm contacts <b>232</b>(B) of the power protection device <b>106</b>. The alarm contact receptacles <b>232</b>(A) may pass trip status signals generated by the power protection device <b>106</b> to a central control board. The current monitoring assembly <b>402</b> may include the signal pins <b>318</b>(A) that may removably couple with cooperating receptacles <b>318</b>(B) of the backplane <b>316</b>, or a cable harness, to pass signals to a central control board.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The current monitoring device <b>202</b> may provide for indicating to a user that a piece of telecommunication equipment arranged in-line with the power protection device (i.e., the load) is powered off or, alternatively, that the power protection device <b>106</b> has tripped. For example, the current monitoring assembly <b>402</b> may manipulate a monitored current received from the current monitor <b>314</b> to be outside a valid current range based on a trip status signal generated by the power protection device <b>106</b>. In this example, the valid current range may be a pulse-width modulation duty cycle range of approximately 10-90% and the current monitoring assembly <b>402</b> may force the monitored current to a pulse-width modulation duty cycle of approximately 0% based on a presence of a voltage on the alarm contact receptacles <b>232</b>(A) generated by the power protection device <b>106</b>. Alternatively, the valid current range may be an analog range of approximately 1-4 volts, and the current monitoring assembly <b>402</b> may force the monitored current to approximately 0 volts based on a presence of a voltage on the alarm contact receptacles <b>232</b>(A) generated by the power protection device <b>106</b>. By manipulating a monitored current, this provides for a user (i.e., a controller) monitoring the signals provided by the current monitoring device <b>202</b> to know if the power protection device <b>106</b>, or a fuse, is in a tripped state without needing discrete alarm signals from each piece of telecommunication equipment arranged in-line with the power protection device <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example implementation of a current monitoring device <b>502</b> for use in the power distribution system <b>108</b> and the power distribution system <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>. The current monitoring device <b>502</b> may be inserted as a single unit into a slot <b>504</b> of the power distribution system <b>110</b>. For example, a user can easily install and/or replace a current monitoring device <b>502</b> which requires only front access because of the current monitoring device <b>502</b> blind mate installations. This provides for replacing failed current monitoring devices <b>502</b> or upgrading from &#x201c;non-monitoring&#x201d; to monitoring current monitoring devices <b>502</b> (discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Further, this provides for switching to a different current range (e.g., switching from a 15A max version to a 20A max version).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The current monitoring device <b>502</b> may include a printed circuit assembly (PCA) <b>506</b>. The PCA <b>506</b> may have a first end <b>508</b>(A) opposite a second end <b>508</b>(B). A receptacle <b>510</b> may be fixed to the first end <b>508</b>(A). The receptacle <b>510</b> may provide for removably coupling with a power protection device <b>106</b>. For example, the receptacle <b>510</b> may be a fuse holder (e.g., a GMT type fuse holder) fixed to the first end <b>508</b>(A) of the PCA <b>506</b>. While the receptacle <b>510</b> is illustrated as comprising a GMT type fuse holder, the receptacle may be a KTK, KLM, TPA, TPC, TPS, TLS or the like, type fuse holder. The current monitoring device <b>502</b> may comprise a power input and power output receptacles <b>512</b>(A) and <b>512</b>(B), respectively, fixed to the second end <b>508</b>(B) of the PCA <b>506</b>. The power input and power output receptacles <b>512</b>(A) and <b>512</b>(B) may provide for removably coupling with an internal electrical component (e.g., a backplane, a harness, a bus bar, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The current monitoring device <b>502</b> may comprise a current monitor <b>514</b> arranged on the PCA <b>506</b> between the first end <b>508</b>(A) and the second end <b>508</b>(B). The current monitor <b>514</b> may provide for monitoring a current flowing through the current monitoring device <b>502</b> and reporting of a signal based on the monitored current. The current monitor <b>514</b> may be a Hall Effect current monitor. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a current monitoring device <b>502</b> having a current monitor <b>514</b> arranged on the PCA <b>506</b>, the current monitoring device <b>202</b> may not have a current monitor <b>514</b> arranged on the PCA <b>506</b>. In this implementation, the current monitor device <b>502</b> may be devoid of current monitoring hardware and may be a &#x201c;non-monitoring&#x201d; current monitoring device <b>502</b>. For example, the &#x201c;non-monitoring&#x201d; current monitoring device <b>202</b> may pass a current from the power protection device <b>106</b> to an internal electrical component (e.g., a backplane, a harness, a bus bar, etc.) via electrical traces formed in the PCA <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The current monitoring device <b>502</b> may comprise signal pins <b>516</b> fixed to the second end <b>508</b>(B). The signal pins <b>516</b> may provide for removably coupling with cooperating receptacles of an internal electrical component (e.g., a backplane, a harness, a bus bar, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The current monitoring device <b>502</b> may have external dimensions that are driven, or otherwise constrained by the dimensions of the power protection device <b>106</b>, and likewise the dimensions of the slot <b>504</b>. For example, the power protection device <b>106</b> may be a GMT type fuse having a standard height <b>518</b> of about 0.7 inches, a standard width <b>520</b> of about 0.1 inches, and a depth <b>522</b> of about 0.8 inches. The slot <b>504</b> may have an opening also having dimensions driven by the dimensions of the power protection device <b>106</b>. For example, the slot <b>504</b> may have an opening having dimensions capable of receiving a portion of the GMT type fuse. In this embodiment, where the slot <b>504</b> has an opening to receive a GMT type fuse, the slot <b>504</b> may have an opening having a height <b>524</b> of about 1 inch and a width <b>526</b> of about 0.5 inches. As such, the current monitoring device <b>502</b> may have a height <b>528</b> of about 0.8 inches and a width <b>530</b> of about 0.4 inches for cooperating with the slot <b>504</b> and the power protection device <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A cover <b>532</b> may be removably fastened to a front surface <b>534</b> of the power distribution device <b>110</b>. The cover <b>532</b> may provide for securing each current monitoring device <b>502</b> in a respective slot <b>504</b>. For example, a user can easily removably install each current monitoring device <b>502</b> as a single unit into a slot <b>504</b> of the power distribution system <b>110</b> via a blind mate installation. For example, a user may insert a current monitoring device <b>502</b> into a slot <b>504</b> and removably disconnect the power input <b>512</b>(A), power output <b>512</b>(B), and signal pins <b>516</b>, to a backplane <b>536</b>. A user may then subsequently removably fasten the cover <b>532</b> to the front surface <b>534</b>, securing each current monitoring device <b>502</b>. For example, the cover <b>532</b> may comprise an opening <b>538</b> to receive at least a portion of each current monitoring device <b>502</b>. For example, each opening <b>538</b> may receive a portion of each receptacle <b>510</b> of each current monitoring device <b>502</b>. While the power distribution device <b>110</b> is illustrated as including a cover <b>532</b> for securing each current monitoring device <b>502</b>, the power distribution device <b>110</b> may not include a cover <b>532</b>. For example, each current monitoring device <b>502</b> may comprise a front plate (e.g., a faceplate) that may secure to the front surface <b>534</b>. For example, each current monitoring device <b>502</b> may comprise a front plate that provides for fastening the current monitor device <b>502</b> to the front surface <b>534</b> via a snap fit, press fit, twist lock type fastener, threaded fastener, or the like.</p>

For example, a user may insert the current monitoring device <b>502</b> into a slot <b>504</b> and mate the power input and power output receptacles <b>512</b>(A) and <b>512</b>(B) with the cooperating power input and power output studs <b>602</b>(A) and <b>602</b>(B).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The backplane <b>536</b> may comprise cooperating receptacles <b>604</b>.
