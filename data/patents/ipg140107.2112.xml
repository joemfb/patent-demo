Covers <b>714</b> and <b>716</b> can be secured, bonded, adhered, or otherwise affixed to substrate <b>701</b> using an adhesive <b>715</b>. The adhesive can be, for example, a pressure sensitive adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The microfluidic devices <b>98</b>, <b>498</b>, and <b>700</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> can be used for filtering liquids that are manipulated to pass through the devices. The devices can be used, for example, for gel filtration, size-exclusion filtration, ion-exchange filtration, or combinations of these filtration techniques. For example, filtration materials can be loaded and/or included in the devices, and can include small beads of filtration materials. Size-exclusion materials can be used that can retain smaller molecules of an aqueous sample while allowing larger molecules of the sample to pass through or around. For example, P-10 BIO-GEL materials from Bio-Rad can be used and are composed of acrylamide particles that are roughly 45-90 &#x3bc;m in average particle size diameter. These particles, when hydrated, can capture free dyes, undesired nucleotides, and salt ions from a sample as the sample migrates through the materials.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Samples can be manipulated through devices <b>98</b>, <b>498</b>, and <b>700</b> by gravity pressure differentials, or centripetal force, for example. The resulting filtrates that elute from the devices can then be analyzed, used, or subsequently passed on through the device to a subsequent stage of processing, for example, into a PCR reaction chamber, a sequencing reaction chamber, or other processing reaction chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to various embodiments, the filter frit material <b>112</b>, <b>412</b>, or <b>712</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> can be &#x201c;press fit&#x201d; into the respective chamber, placed in the respective chamber, or otherwise positioned in the respective chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The covers described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> can include a plastic material, for example, a polyolefin material. According to various embodiments, covers can include tape or film materials coated with a pressure-sensitive adhesive, or plastic materials that can be thermally bonded to a respective substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to various embodiments including those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, the device can include one or more channels that can be rectangular in cross-sectional shape. The devices can include channels that can be, for example, from about 0.1 mm to about 1.0 cm deep, from about 0.1 mm to about 1.0 cm wide, and from about 0.1 mm to about 10.0 cm long. An exemplary channel can be 0.50 mm deep, 0.50 mm wide, and 20 mm long, thus providing total volume of about 5 &#x3bc;L.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to various embodiments including those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, a gel filtration material can be disposed in a channel of the device. The gel filtration material can be loaded into the device by pipetting into an input opening of the device and/or drawing the material into the device by using vacuum force, for example, applied to an output opening of the device. A channel of the device can be filled with a gel filtration material by pressure loading the gel filtration material through an input opening of the device to dispense the gel filtration material in a channel or chamber of the device. In an exemplary embodiment, a fully hydrated gel filtration material is loaded into a channel of the device, for example, into first channel <b>104</b> of device <b>98</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Once the channel is filled with hydrated gel filtration material, the device can be centrifuged to de-water the gel filtration material and to &#x201c;pack&#x201d; the gel filtration material, forming a purification column. This process can be used to prepare the device for sample filtration and can be used to remove unnecessary or excess water or buffer from the gel filtration material. In a variant of this process, the excess water or buffer can be collected in an outlet channel or chamber and later used to dilute and increase the volume of a filtered sample to render the sample injection-ready.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to various embodiments including the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, the device can include additional chambers and/or channels. For example, the device can include a PCR amplification chamber, a sequencing reaction chamber, or both a PCR amplification chamber and a sequencing reaction chamber. According to various embodiments, the device can include an output chamber useful for holding a sample prior to injecting the sample into a sequence detection system or other analytical detector.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to various embodiments, microfluidic devices are provided that include a plurality of sample processing pathways as described herein, in a single device.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to various embodiments, a porous filter frit material can be used to prevent the gel filtration material loaded in a channel from flowing out of the channel. The average pore size of the filter frit material can be chosen to allow fluids to pass through (water, sample, etc.) while constraining the movement of a gel filtration material such as acrylamide beads. For instance, the microfluidic device shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> can utilize a hydrophilic polyethylene filter frit material with an average pore size of about 33 microns. When used with P-10 BIO-GEL gel filtration materials, such a frit can adequately constrain the gel filtration materials while allowing water and sample fluids to pass therethrough. An exemplary porous filter frit material that can be used for such purpose is a sintered, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) frit having a suitable average pore size.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to various embodiments, a gel filtration retention mechanism can be provided in a device and includes a flow-restrictor in the form of a small channel or serpentine path formed in the substrate and which prevents the gel filtration material from passing.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to various embodiments including the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, wherein two channels are provided and separated by a filtration chamber or column, one of the channels can be formed in a first surface of a substrate and a second channel can be formed in the opposing surface of the substrate. For example, the second channel <b>108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or <b>408</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) can be formed in a first surface of the substrate and can provide fluid communication between a processing chamber and a respective output opening.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The second channel can have dimensions similar to, or the same as, the dimensions of the first channel, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The second channel can have a depth of from about 0.1 mm to about 1.0 cm, a width of from about 0.1 mm to about 1.0 cm, and a length of from about 0.1 mm to about 10.0 cm. An exemplary second channel has a depth of about 0.50 mm, a width of about 0.75 mm and a length of about 3.0 mm. The second channel can be at least partially defined by a cover, for example, cover <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 416</figref> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Regardless of whether the device includes a first channel filled with a gel filtration material, the second channel of the device can be provided with a gel filtration material loaded therein. Gel filtration material can be loaded into the second channel before, after, or at the same time that a filtration frit is positioned within the device.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to various embodiments, the output opening <b>110</b>, <b>410</b>, <b>710</b> can serve to capture or retain a processed sample after the sample passes through a processing chamber in the microfluidic device. Initially, the output opening <b>110</b>, <b>410</b>, <b>710</b> can be open so that vacuum can be applied to the device for loading a gel filtration material. The output opening can remain open during centrifugation of the microfluidic device to further pack and/or dewater the gel filtration material. During such a packing process, excess water or buffer can be purged from the device and can escape the device through the outlet opening <b>110</b>, <b>410</b>, <b>710</b>. When a sample is manipulated through the microfluidic device, as by centrifugation, for example, the outlet opening <b>110</b>, <b>410</b>, <b>710</b> can be sealed with a cover film <b>116</b>, <b>416</b>, <b>716</b> to prevent the sample from being lost, or to otherwise retain the sample in the device.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to various embodiments, a microfluidic device can be provided with a plurality of pathways formed in a substrate, with each pathway being similar to one of the pathways shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-6</figref>. Using channels and chambers having widths of about 0.50 mm or less, for example, it is possible to provide up to 96 or more such pathways in the substrate and to provide a resulting substrate size equivalent to that of a standard micro-titer tray, for example, a length of about 4.75 inches and a width of about 3.25 inches. An exemplary device of such design is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> and incorporates the 5 &#x3bc;L gel filtration columns.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to various embodiments, a microfluidic device is provided similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and having a substrate that includes a thickness that is greater than the sum of the depth of the first channel and the depth of the second channel. According to various embodiments, a microfluidic device is provided similar to the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> and having a substrate that includes a thickness that is the same as the depth of the filter chamber <b>713</b>.</p>

Under such circumstances, it can be useful to employ a flow restrictor according to various embodiments. According to various embodiments, a channel with a cross-sectional area that is significantly smaller than a connecting channel can be used to form a flow restrictor. Depending upon the desired results and restriction, the dimensions of the restriction can be selected, for example, to retain smaller particles in the larger cross-sectional area connecting channel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows representative geometries of flow restriction designs that can be used.</p>

For example, according to various embodiments, a first channel can include an output end having a first cross-sectional area, and which intersects a second channel having a second cross-sectional area that is from about 5% to about 50% the cross-sectional area of first channel. The cross-sectional area of the second channel can be, for example, from about 6% to about 30% of the cross-sectional area of the first channel, for example, from about 10% to about 15% of the cross-sectional area of the first channel.

Once such a deformer is removed from contact with the microfluidic device, the deformable intermediate wall can remain in a deformed state while the cover layer elastically rebounds, for at least an amount of time sufficient to enable fluid transfer between two or more recesses that are fluidly connected by deformation of the intermediate wall. The deformable material of the intermediate wall can be elastic to some extent, or can be inelastic.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The elastically deformable cover layer, and/or the substrate, can be chemically resistant and inert. The elastically deformable cover layer can include a material that can withstand thermal cycling at temperatures of between about 60&#xb0; C. and about 95&#xb0; C., for example, are used in polymerase chain reactions. Any suitable elastically deformable film material can be used for the cover layer, for example, elastomeric materials. According to various embodiments, PCR tape materials can be used as or with the elastically deformable cover layer. Polyolefin material films, other polymeric films, copolymeric films, and combinations thereof can be used for the cover layer.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The cover layer can be a semi-rigid plate that bends over its entire width or length or that bends or deforms locally. The cover layer can be from about 10 micrometers (&#x3bc;m) to about 500 &#x3bc;m thick, for example, 50 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m, and can include, an adhesive layer. If used, the adhesive layer can be from about 50 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m thick.

<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The dimensional characteristics of a typical, straight channel flow restrictor cross-section can be, for example, about 0.2 mm by about 0.2 mm. The length of such a channel can be, for example, from about 0.1 mm to about 10 cm, for example, about 5 mm. A flow restrictor can be used in conjunction with a larger chamber, greater than approximately 0.50 mm, and serve to retain particles, for example, P-10, SEIE beads, particulates, and SEC beads, located in a chamber. The flow restrictor can be located downstream of the chamber holding the particles. Downstream means the flow restrictor is located at a greater distance from an axis of rotation than the chamber. When subjected to a centripetal force, the materials in the chamber can move toward the flow restrictor where the particulates can be retained while the fluids can pass into an adjacent channel or chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to various embodiments and as described above, dimensions of the flow restrictor are not limited to square cross-sections. Other shapes can be successfully implemented. For example, a rectangular flow restrictor cross-section having a 0.10 mm depth and a 0.30 mm width can be formed in a substrate to retain gel filtration media such as P-10 beads available from BioRad.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to various embodiments, the processing system can include microfluidic device holders on the platen that orient parallel pathways of the microfluidic devices off axis with regard to the axis of rotation of the platen. According to various embodiments, a holder can be provided that aligns all of the parallel pathways of a microfluidic device such that when the pathways are parallel to a radius of the platen all of the pathways lie off of the radius and on the same side of the radius.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">According to various embodiments, a sample processing system is provided that includes a microfluidic device, having a plurality of parallel pathways disposed in the holder, wherein each input opening of the plurality of pathways is closer to the axis of rotation than each respective output opening of the plurality of pathways. According to various embodiments, each of the plurality of parallel pathways of the device includes a respective input opening, at least one processing chamber, and output opening in a linear arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">According to various embodiments, the microfluidic device used with the sample processing system is shaped as a rectanguloid having a length, a width, and a thickness, and the holder is capable of holding the microfluidic device securely to the platen. Clips, fasteners, or other holding mechanisms can be employed to secure the device to the platen.

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">A description of other materials components and methods useful for various features of the microfluidic devices, systems, and methods described herein, is provided in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/398,851 to Bryning et al., which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The foregoing described and other sample processing devices can be processed alone. According to various embodiments, a sample processing device <b>610</b> can be mounted on a carrier <b>680</b>. Such an assembly is depicted in an exploded perspective view of sample processing device <b>610</b> and carrier <b>680</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">By providing a carrier that is separate from the sample processing device, the thermal mass of the sample processing device can be minimally affected as compared to manufacturing the entire sample processing device with a thickness suitable for handling with automated equipment, for example, by robotic arms, and/or processing with conventional equipment. Another potential advantage of a carrier is that the sample processing devices may exhibit a tendency to curl or otherwise deviate from a planar configuration. Attaching the sample processing device to a carrier can retain the sample processing device in a planar configuration for processing. According to various embodiments, the carrier can be made of plastic or other rigid material to provide the carrier with sufficient rigidity when attached to the sample processing device. The plastic carrier can be provided with a rubber pad or rubber pads attached to at least one surface thereof. A silicone foam pad or layer can be used on a surface of the carrier, for example, on the surface that contacts the sample processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The carrier can be provided with limited areas of contact with the sample processing device to which it is mounted, to reduce thermal transmission between the sample processing device and the carrier. The surface of the carrier facing away from the sample processing device can provide limited areas of contact with for example, a platen or other structure used to force the sample processing device against a thermal block to reduce thermal transmission between the carrier and the platen or other structure. The carrier can have a relatively low thermal mass to avoid influencing temperature changes in the sample processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">According to various embodiments, the carrier can exhibit some compliance such that the carrier and/or attached sample processing device can conform to the surfaces between which the assembly is compressed, for example, a thermal block and platen. Carriers themselves may not be perfectly planar due to, e.g., variations in manufacturing tolerances, etc. Further, the assemblies may have different thicknesses due to thickness variations in the carrier and/or the sample processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">According to various embodiments, the sample processing device <b>610</b> can be loaded using centripetal forces. The carrier can maintain the integrity of the sample processing device by applying pressure to the card during loading and/or thermal cycling.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The carrier <b>680</b> can be attached to the sample processing device <b>610</b> in a manner that allows for the carrier <b>680</b> to be reused with many different sample processing devices <b>610</b>. According to various embodiments, the carrier <b>680</b> can be permanently attached to a single sample processing device <b>610</b> such that, after use, both the sample processing device <b>610</b> and the carrier <b>680</b> are discarded together.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In the depicted embodiment, the sample processing device <b>610</b> includes molded posts <b>611</b> for aligning the sample processing device <b>610</b> to the carrier. At least one of the molded posts can be located proximate a center of the sample processing device <b>610</b>. Although only one molded post <b>611</b> can be used for attaching the sample processing device <b>610</b> to the carrier <b>680</b>, at least two posts <b>611</b> can be included. The centrally-located post <b>611</b> can assist in centering the sample processing device <b>610</b> on the carrier <b>680</b>, while a second post <b>611</b> can be provided to prevent rotation of the sample processing device <b>610</b> relative to the carrier <b>680</b>. Further, although only two posts <b>611</b> are depicted, it will be understood that three or more posts or other sites of attachment between the sample processing device <b>610</b> and the carrier <b>680</b> can be provided. Further, the posts <b>611</b> can be melt bonded to the sample processing device <b>610</b> to accomplish attachment of the two components in addition to alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Posts or other alignment features can be provided on either or both of the sample processing device <b>610</b> and the carrier <b>680</b> to generally align the sample processing device <b>610</b> with the carrier <b>680</b> before the final alignment and attachment using molded posts <b>611</b> on the sample processing device <b>610</b>. The posts and/or other alignment features can align the assembly including the sample processing device <b>610</b> and carrier <b>680</b> relative to, for example, a thermal processing system used to thermally cycle materials in the sample process chambers <b>650</b>. One or more alignment features can also be used in connection with a detection system for detecting the presence or absence of a selected analyte in the process chambers <b>650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">According to various embodiments, posts or other alignment mechanisms can be provided on the carrier <b>680</b> to align the carrier <b>680</b> with a thermal block. The posts can be arranged as cone-shaped or tapered pins that can mate with corresponding truncated or non-truncated cone-shaped or tapered wells or recesses formed in the thermal block. The posts can be arranged to have a cross-like cross-section, such as a philips head screwdriver tip, that can be compressible and/or elastic, and that can mate with cone-shaped or tapered wells or recesses formed in the thermal block. The posts of the carrier <b>680</b> can be made of polypropylene. The wells or recesses formed in the thermal block can have the shape of a truncated cone.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The carrier <b>680</b> can include various features such as openings <b>682</b> that are preferably aligned with the process chambers <b>650</b> of the sample processing device <b>610</b>. By providing openings <b>682</b>, the process chambers <b>650</b> can be viewed through the carrier <b>680</b>. One alternative to providing the openings <b>682</b> is to manufacture the carrier <b>680</b> of a material (or materials) transmissive to electromagnetic radiation in the desired wavelengths. The carrier <b>680</b> can be continuous over the surface of the sample processing device <b>610</b>, that is, the carrier can be provided with no openings formed therethrough for access to the process chambers <b>650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The sample processing device <b>610</b> and carrier <b>680</b> are exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, where it can be seen that the loading chambers <b>630</b> can extend beyond the periphery of the carrier <b>680</b>. As such, the portion of the sample processing device <b>610</b> containing the loading structures <b>630</b> can be removed from the remainder of the sample processing device <b>610</b> after distributing the sample material to the process chambers <b>650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The carrier <b>680</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref> can also provide advantages in the sealing or isolation of the process chambers <b>650</b> during and/or after loading of sample materials in the process chambers <b>650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is an enlarged view of a portion of the bottom surface of the carrier <b>680</b>, that is, the surface of the carrier <b>680</b> that faces the sample processing device <b>610</b>. The bottom surface of the carrier <b>680</b> includes a number of features including main conduit support rails <b>683</b> that can extend along the length of the main conduits <b>640</b> in the associated sample processing device <b>610</b>. The support rails <b>683</b> can, for example, provide a surface against which the main conduits <b>640</b> of the sample processing device <b>610</b> can be pressed while the conduit <b>640</b> is deformed to isolate the process chambers <b>650</b> and/or seal the conduits <b>640</b> as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In addition to their use during deformation of the main conduits <b>640</b>, the support rails <b>683</b> can also be relied on during, e.g., thermal processing to apply pressure to the conduits <b>640</b>. Furthermore, the use of support rails <b>683</b> can also provide an additional advantage in that they provide for significantly reduced contact between the sample processing device <b>610</b> and the carrier <b>680</b> while still providing the necessary support for sealing of the main conduits <b>640</b> on device <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Contact between the carrier <b>680</b> and device <b>610</b> can be reduced or minimized when the assembly is to be used in thermal processing of sample materials, for example as with polymerase chain reactions (PCR). As such, the carrier <b>680</b> can be characterized as including a carrier body that is spaced from the sample processing device <b>610</b> between the main conduits <b>640</b> when the support rails <b>683</b> are aligned with the main conduits <b>640</b>. The voids formed between the carrier body and the sample processing device <b>610</b> can be occupied by air or by, for example, a compressible and/or thermally insulating material. According to various embodiments, the carrier <b>680</b> can be made from plastic and can have a layer of compressible foam attached to or abutting the surface facing the sample processing device <b>610</b>, for reducing thermal transmission between the sample processing device <b>610</b> and the carrier <b>680</b>. According to various embodiments, the foam layer can be a silicone foam.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Also depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> are a number of optional compression structures <b>684</b> which, in the exemplified embodiment, are in the form of collars arranged to align with the process chambers <b>650</b> on the sample processing device <b>610</b>. The collars define one end of each of the openings <b>682</b> that extend through the carrier <b>680</b> to allow access to the process chambers <b>650</b> on sample processing device <b>610</b>. The compression structures <b>684</b>, for example, collars, are designed to compress a discrete area of the device proximate each of the process chambers <b>650</b> on the sample processing device <b>610</b> when the two components (the sample processing device <b>610</b> and the carrier <b>680</b>) are compressed against each other.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">That discrete areas of compression can provide advantages such as, for example, improving contact between the device <b>610</b> and the thermal block proximate each of the process chambers. That improved contact can enhance the transfer of thermal energy into and/or out of the process chambers. Further, the improvements in thermal transmission can be balanced by only limited thermal transmission into the structure of the carrier <b>680</b> itself due, at least in part, to the limited contact area between the sample processing device <b>610</b> and the carrier <b>680</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Another advantage of selectively compressing discrete areas of the device <b>610</b> is that weakening of any adhesive bond, delamination of the adhesive, and/or liquid leakage from the process chambers <b>650</b> can be reduced or prevented by the discrete areas of compression. This advantage can be particularly advantageous when using compression structures in the form of collars or other shapes that surround at least a portion of the process chambers on the sample processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The collars in the exemplified embodiment are designed to extend only partially about the perimeter of the process chambers <b>650</b> and are not designed to occlude the feeder conduit entering the process chamber <b>650</b>. Alternatively, however, collars could be provided that are designed to occlude the feeder conduits, thereby potentially further enhancing isolation between the process chambers during thermal processing of sample materials.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The collars <b>684</b> can optionally provide some reduction in cross-talk between process chambers <b>650</b> by providing a barrier to the transmission of electromagnetic energy, for example, infrared to ultraviolet light, between the process chambers <b>650</b> during processing and/or analysis of the process chambers <b>650</b>. For example, the collars <b>684</b> can be opaque to electromagnetic radiation of selected wavelengths. Alternatively, the collars <b>684</b> can inhibit the transmission of electromagnetic radiation of selected wavelengths by diffusion and/or absorption. For example, the collars <b>684</b> can include textured surfaces to enhance scattering, and/or the collars <b>684</b> can include materials incorporated into the body of the collar <b>684</b> and/or provided in a coating thereon that enhance absorption and/or diffusion.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The carrier <b>680</b> can include force transmission structures to enhance the transmission of force from the upper surface of the carrier <b>680</b>, that is, the surface facing away from the sample processing device, to the compression structures, for example, in the form of collars <b>684</b> in the exemplary embodiment, and, ultimately, to the sample processing device itself.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> depicts a portion of an illustrative embodiment of a force transmission structure. The force transmission structure is provided in the form of an arch <b>685</b> that includes four openings <b>682</b> and is operably attached to collars <b>684</b>. The force transmission structure defines a landing area <b>687</b> located between the openings <b>682</b> and connected to the collars <b>684</b> such that a force <b>686</b> applied to the landing area <b>687</b> in the direction of the sample processing device is transmitted to each of the collars <b>684</b>, and, thence, to the sample processing device (not shown). In the depicted embodiment, the landing areas are provided by the crowns of the arches <b>685</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The arch <b>685</b> can transmit the force evenly between the different collars <b>684</b> attached to the arch <b>685</b>, which are essentially provided as hollow columns supporting the arch <b>685</b> (by virtue of openings <b>682</b>). This basic structure is repeated over the entire surface of the carrier <b>680</b> as seen in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Advantages of providing landing areas on the force transmission structures include the corresponding reduction in contact between the carrier <b>680</b> and a platen or other structure used to compress the sample processing device using the carrier <b>680</b>. That reduced contact can provide for reduced thermal transmission between the carrier <b>680</b> and the platen or other structure used to compress the sample processing device. In addition, the force transmission structures and corresponding compression structures on the opposite side of the carrier can all contribute to reducing the amount of material in the carrier <b>680</b>, thereby reducing the thermal mass of the carrier <b>680</b> and, in turn, the assembly of the carrier <b>680</b> and a sample processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> illustrates another optional feature of carriers used in connection with the present invention. The carrier <b>680</b>&#x2032; is depicted with an optical element <b>688</b>&#x2032;, for example, a lens, that can assist in focusing electromagnetic energy directed into the process chamber <b>650</b>&#x2032; or emanating from the process chamber <b>650</b>&#x2032;. The optical element <b>688</b>&#x2032; is depicted as integral with the carrier <b>680</b>&#x2032;, although it should be understood that the optical element <b>688</b>&#x2032; can be provided as a separate article that is attached to the carrier <b>680</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> illustrates yet another optional feature of carriers that can be used. The carrier <b>680</b>&#x2033; includes an alignment structure <b>687</b>&#x2033; that can be used to assist guiding a pipette <b>611</b>&#x2033; or other sample material delivery device into the appropriate loading structure on the sample processing device <b>610</b>&#x2033;. The alignment structure <b>687</b>&#x2033; can be removed with the loading structures on the sample processing device <b>610</b>&#x2033; as described herein. The alignment structure <b>687</b>&#x2033; can be generally conical as depicted to guide the pipette <b>611</b>&#x2033;, if it is slightly off-center from an inlet port, into the loading structure on sample processing device <b>610</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As an alternative the molded carrier depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-31</figref>, the carrier can be in the form of a sheet of material in contact with one side of the sample processing device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is an exploded view of one illustrative sample processing device <b>710</b> and a carrier <b>780</b> that can be used in connection with the sample processing device <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The sample processing device <b>710</b> includes a set of process arrays <b>720</b>, each of which includes process chambers <b>750</b> that, in the depicted sample processing device <b>710</b>, are arranged in an array on the surface of the sample processing device <b>710</b>. The carrier <b>780</b> includes a plurality of openings <b>782</b> formed therein that preferably align with the process chambers <b>750</b> when the sample processing device <b>710</b> and carrier <b>780</b> are compressed together.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The carrier <b>780</b> can be manufactured of a variety of materials, although it can be preferred that the carrier be manufactured of a compressible material, for example, a sheet of compressible foam or other substance. In addition to compressibility, the compressible material can exhibit low thermal conductivity, low thermal mass, and/or low compression set, particularly at temperatures to which the sample processing device may be subjected. One class of suitable foams can include, for example, silicone based silicone foams.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">If the carrier <b>780</b> is manufactured from compressible material, there may be no need to provide relief on the surface of the carrier <b>780</b> facing the sample processing device <b>710</b> to prevent premature occlusion of the conduits in the process arrays <b>720</b>. If, however, the carrier <b>780</b> is manufactured of more rigid materials, it can be desirable to provide some relief in the surface of the carrier <b>780</b> for the conduits in the process arrays <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Similar to the carrier <b>680</b> described above, a carrier <b>780</b> such as that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> can provide selective compression of the sample processing device by not compressing the sample processing device in areas occupied by process chambers <b>750</b> due to the absence of material located above the process chambers <b>750</b>. As a result, the carrier <b>780</b> can provide several additional advantages. For example, the weakening of the adhesive bond, delamination of the adhesive, and/or liquid leakage from the process chambers <b>750</b> can be reduced or prevented by the compression applied to the sample processing device <b>710</b> surrounding the process chambers <b>750</b>. In addition, thermal leakage from, for example, a thermal block against which the assembly can be urged, can be reduced if the material of the carrier <b>780</b> is provided with desirable thermal properties, for example, low thermal mass, low thermal conductivity, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">According to various embodiments, openings <b>782</b> can provide protection from cross-talk between process chambers <b>750</b> by providing a barrier to the transmission of electromagnetic energy, for example, light, between the process chambers <b>750</b> during processing and/or analysis of the process chambers <b>750</b>. For example, the carrier <b>780</b> can be opaque and/or non-transmissive of electromagnetic radiation of selected wavelengths. Alternatively, the carrier can inhibit the transmission of electromagnetic radiation of selected wavelengths by diffusion and/or absorption. For example, the openings <b>782</b> can include textured surfaces to enhance scattering. Moreover, the carrier <b>780</b> can include materials incorporated into the body of the carrier <b>780</b>, and/or provided in a coating thereon, that can enhance absorption and/or diffusion of selected wavelengths of electromagnetic energy.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">According to various embodiments, the carriers described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-34</figref> can be fixedly attached to the sample processing device, or the carriers can be separate from the sample processing device. If separate, the carriers can be removably attached to, or brought into contact with, each sample processing device in a manner that facilitates removal from an sample processing device without significant destruction of the carrier. As a result, the carrier can be used with more than one sample processing device. Alternatively, the carrier can be firmly affixed to the sample processing device, such that both components can be discarded after use. In some instances, the carrier can be attached to the system used to process the sample processing device, for example, a platen of a thermocycling system, such that as a sample processing device is loaded for thermal processing, the carrier can be placed into contact with the sample processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Both of the carriers described above are examples of means for selectively compressing together the first side and the second side of a sample processing device, about each process chamber. The compression can occur simultaneously about each process chamber. Many other equivalent structures that accomplish the function of selectively compressing the first side and second side of a sample processing device together about each process chamber can be envisioned by those of skill in the art. In some configurations, the means for selectively compressing, for example, the resilient carrier <b>780</b>, can apply compressive force over substantially all of the sample processing device outside of the process chambers. In other embodiments, the means for selectively compressing can apply compressive forces in only a localized area about each of the process chambers in the sample processing device, for example, carrier <b>680</b> with its associated collars.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Any system incorporating a means for selectively compressing can be used to attach the means for selectively compressing to the sample processing device or to a platen or other structure that is brought into contact with the sample processing device during processing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> depicts one thermal processing system that can be used in connection with the sample processing devices in a block diagram format. The system includes a sample processing device <b>710</b>&#x2032; located on a thermal block <b>708</b>&#x2032;. The temperature of the thermal block <b>708</b>&#x2032; is preferably controlled by a thermal controller <b>706</b>&#x2032;. On the opposite side of the sample processing device <b>710</b>&#x2032;, the means for selectively compressing, in the form of carrier <b>780</b>&#x2032;, is located between the sample processing device <b>710</b>&#x2032; and a platen <b>704</b>&#x2032;. The platen <b>704</b>&#x2032; can be thermally controlled, if desired, by a thermal controller <b>702</b>&#x2032; that can, in some instances, be the same as controller <b>706</b>&#x2032; controlling the temperature of the thermal block <b>708</b>&#x2032;. The sample processing device <b>710</b>&#x2032; and the means for selectively compressing <b>780</b>&#x2032; can be compressed between the platen <b>704</b>&#x2032; and thermal block <b>708</b>&#x2032; as indicated by arrows <b>701</b>&#x2032; and <b>702</b>&#x2032; during thermal processing of the sample processing device <b>710</b>&#x2032;.</p>
