<p id="p-0020" num="0034">The objective of the invention has been achieved by the invention and embodiments thereof as defined in the claims and as described below.</p>

Each of the uncovered parts (which provide the contacting surfaces) having a longitudinal extension preferably with a minimum length, and the uncovered parts being located sequentially along the longitudinal extension of the end-section of the cable.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0038">In the present context the term &#x2018;cable&#x2019; is used for a part of the &#x2018;cable system&#x2019; comprising the electrical conductors and corresponding electrical insulation between adjacent electrical conductors (and optionally further layers related thereto). A &#x2018;cable system&#x2019; according to the invention thus comprises a &#x2018;cable&#x2019; in the above sense and a thermal insulation surrounding the cable wherein the cable is located.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0039">In an embodiment, the cable is eccentrically located relative to the central longitudinal axis of the thermal insulation over at least a part of its longitudinal extension.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0040">The terms innermost/outermost relative to the cable is taken to mean, respectively, closer to/farther away from the cable former. Alternatively, it may be taken to mean, respectively, closer to/farther away from the central longitudinal axis of the end-section of the cable.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0041">The numbering of the electrical phases 1, 2, . . . , N is not intended to imply any particular properties or mutual relationships to the phases (such as e.g. size or angle relationships). In general, the electrical phases may be arranged in any order. In practice, the order providing the lowest electrical loss may be found by optimization, e.g. by variation of the phase angles of neighbouring electrical phases, the material, number, form, winding angles, etc. of the electrical conductors constituting the electrical phases.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0042">The term &#x2018;uncovered part&#x2019; of the cable is in the present context taken to mean a length of the cable, where the electrical insulation normally surrounding an electrical phase (or a neutral conductor) is removed to provide electrical access to the electrical phase (or neutral conductor) in question.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0043">The term &#x2018;current lead&#x2019; and &#x2018;branch current lead&#x2019; are used interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0044">In an embodiment of the termination unit at least one of the electrical connections between a contacting surface and a neutral conductor/electrical phase comprises an electrical field control system totally or partly surrounding the contacting surface and providing an equi-potential volume at the respective phase voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0045">In one embodiment a cooling fluid is adapted to be directed inside said equi-potential volume. The cooling fluid may in principle be any cooling fluid providing the necessarily cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0046">As it can bee understood this cooling arrangement of the present invention provide a highly reliable cooling which stabilise the system and result in relatively high current ratings. Due to this stable and reliable cooling arrangement several different cooling fluids may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0047">In an embodiment wherein the end-section comprises at least one current lead base, the termination unit is arranged such that a cooling fluid will exchange heat with said at least one current lead base above said current lead and above said contacting surface. Thereby an additional cooling effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0048">The current lead base provides transition from current lead to phase or neutral conductor. The current lead base may be provided by the electrically connection between the (branch) current lead and the neutral conductor/electrical phase.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0049">In the equi-potential volume cooling fluid may preferably heat exchanges with the current lead base. Additionally in may heat exchanges with one or more additional electrically conductive elements applied in the electrical connection between a contacting surface and a branch current lead. In an embodiment the additional electrically conductive elements comprises one or more current sleeves arranged to be in good electrical contact with relevant contacting surface of the conductor(s), one or more current clamps contacting said current sleeves, and optionally additional connecting elements connecting said current lead base with the clamps.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0050">The current lead base and other electrically conductive elements enclosed in said equi-potential volume may in an embodiment contain provisions for heat exchange with cooling fluid, said heat exchange realised by forced flow cooling through and/or passed holes, grooves, fins, profiles but not limited to. The current sleeve and/or current clamp may have relatively large contacting surface and adapted dimensions may be arranged such that the exact position in longitudinal direction is not critical but allows a robust longitudinal tolerance.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0051">In one embodiment the equi-potential volume is realised by a number of insulator pieces and having a conductive and/or semiconductive inner surface for field controlling reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0052">In an embodiment of the termination unit the equi-potential volume contains a branch current lead connected to at least one of the elements, a current lead base, a current clamp, and a current sleeve, the branch current lead ultimately being connected to the contacting surface of the neutral conductor or one of the electrical phases, and wherein at least one of said elements preferably having provision for cold thermal anchoring by forced flow cooling (such as grooves, holes, profiles and flanges) past and/or through the current lead base, current clamp, current sleeve and/or the interface between either of said elements, said electrical phase preferably being a conductor selected from a superconductive, a hyper-conductive and a conventional conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0053">In an embodiment the contacting surfaces being located sequentially along the longitudinal extension of the end-section of the cable and are arranged according to a modular concept by ensuring that a the contacting surface of each of the neutral conductor and electrical phases at least over a part of the lengths of their contacting surfaces are located at a substantially equal radial distance from the central longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0054">This embodiment the termination unit has the additional benefit of providing a connection which can be used for different cable types and for different phase conductors in the same cable type.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0055">The radial distance from the central longitudinal axis of a contacting surface of the neutral conductor/electrical phase(s) may be regulated using a regulating insert, the regulating insert may e.g. be an adaptive insert as described below but it may also regulate the radial distances from the central longitudinal cable axis to a contacting surface such that these distances remains unequal. The structure of the regulating insert may be as described for the adaptive insert below, but without the restriction that the contacting surfaces should be adapted to substantially same radial distances from the central longitudinal cable axis.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0056">In an embodiment the contacting surfaces of the end-section of the cable being located with substantially equal longitudinal distance between them. Thereby the termination unit may be even more cost effective to produce, because the amount of different elements used can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0057">Substantial equal longitudinal distance as well as substantially equal radial distance may be obtained by any means. In an embodiment the substantially equal radial distances are obtained by radial adaptive inserts (e.g. fiber-reinforced epoxy plastic such as the material sold under the trade name G10&#x2122;) that have substantially identical outer radial dimensions, and where said radial adaptive inserts are applied to the contacting surface of each phase and neutral equalising their dimension with respect to longitudinal and specifically radial dimension in the end-section of the cable.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0058">In an embodiment the substantially equal radial distance from the central longitudinal axis of the end-section of the cable of the contacting surfaces of the neutral conductor and electrical phases is substantially provided by individual adaptation of inner radial dimensions of such adaptive inserts.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0062">The adaptive inserts may have any desired thickness to provide the desired adapting.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0063">The adaptive inserts provide the advantage of facilitating the connection of branch current leads to the electrical phases or neutral of the end-section of the cable. They further facilitate a modular build-up of the termination unit, including the thermally insulating enclosure. For example as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0064">The adaptive inserts may further provide mechanical support to the end-section of the cable, and provide a protection against heat damage of the underlying layers of the end-section of the cable during processing (e.g. soldering) and mounting of the end-section of the cable, e.g. in a termination unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0127" num="0141">Embodiments of this invention sets out to enable an easy and standardised connection to the a superconducting cable (ac or dc) including power in and out of the cable, controlled individual cooling of the cable, the cable end section, the current leads and the inside of the termination enclosure. Further, compensation of cable and termination thermal contraction, easy assembly as well as effective cost and effective production of the termination unit(s)/module(s) may be facilitated by the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a coaxially arranged multi-phase (here triax) cable <b>100</b> comprising N=3 phases and a neutral (screen), eccentrically located in a thermally insulating envelope <b>102</b>C. The three phases (referred to as phase 1, 2, 3 or <b>100</b>R, <b>100</b>S, <b>100</b>T) and the neutral are placed concentrically around each other, in this case with the innermost located is phase 1, the one located in the middle is phase 2 and the outermost located is phase 3 surrounded by the neutral and finally the thermally insulation envelope, <b>102</b>C. The cable <b>100</b> is impregnated with a cooling fluid, <b>101</b>, e.g. liquid Nitrogen, in that the space between the inner wall of the thermally insulating envelope and the central opening of the cable (i.e. inner volume of the central former <b>103</b> which here supports phase 1) is filled with a cooling fluid <b>101</b>. Between each phase and between phase 3 and the neutral, a cryogenic dielectric is applied. This invention applies to both AC and DC cables. The cable is e.g. applicable for DC transmission, if the three phases are substituted with minus (phase 1), zero (phase 2), plus (phase 3) and neutral conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0143">In order to terminate this rather complex structure, embodiments of this invention are designed to address and solve a number of issues relating to terminating the electrically conducting as well as the thermally insulating layers. One embodiment of a termination unit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where all phases (here 3) and the neutral are terminated in one complete construction. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a complete vacuum-insulated termination unit (could alternatively or in addition be foam insulated) housing <b>202</b> with an optional thermal compensation <b>221</b> between the sequentially branched-off phases or neutral. Further, all the main body branches (i.e. the parts of the thermally insulating envelope branching off from the longitudinal direction of the end-section of the cable) are (here) similar and at ground potential and at 90&#xb0; to the longitudinal direction of the end-section of the cable. Alternatively, the stand-offs could be different (e.g. between neutral and electrical phases), e.g. individually adapted and not necessarily perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the end-section of the cable. On top of all 4 branches, an intermediate section <b>211</b> is attached with the function of controlling the fluid level as well as ensuring a thermal anchor at ambient or elevated temperature for the electrical insulator, <b>212</b>. Above the thermal anchor section <b>211</b>, a standard electrical insulator, <b>212</b>, is applied. This is (here) omitted on the neutral. Above the electrical insulator <b>212</b>, the current lead is terminated in a top bolt, <b>214</b>, at ambient temperature and at grid voltage inside optional warm cover <b>213</b>. Said current lead can comprise a flexible section (cf. e.g. <b>714</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Between different parts of the branched-off electrical phases or neutral, sealing flanges <b>222</b> are mounted (cf. e.g. between a branch of the termination housing <b>202</b> and a thermal anchor section <b>211</b>, between a thermal anchor section <b>211</b> and a warm cover-section <b>213</b> and between a warm cover-section <b>213</b> and a top bolt <b>214</b>. The thermally insulating envelope <b>202</b>D connected to a cryostat <b>202</b>C is shown to be modularly constructed and to comprise 4 identical T-sections. At both ends, special parts are needed, at the interface to the cable an adapter-piece <b>225</b> and at the other end a closing end-piece for terminating the thermally insulating envelope <b>202</b>D in the longitudinal direction of the end-section of the cable, both pieces optionally housing in- and/or out-lets for cooling fluid and/or monitoring sensors <b>281</b>. Further, an optionally movable support structure <b>298</b> is shown comprising wheels or rollers for allowing the termination unit to move and thereby adapt to thermal expansion or shrinkage of the cable. As it can be seen, due to this T-section structure the branch current leads in the branches being individually insulated from the thermally insulation envelope by individual electrical insulators. The termination housing <b>202</b> and the individually insulatings which insulate the branches constitute here the total thermal envelope <b>202</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0144">In this embodiment the T-housing has a transition piece, <b>225</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, interfacing the termination unit with the cable thermal envelope. This transition section can be individually evacuated in the field, so the termination unit and the cryostat can be prefabricated and pre-evacuated. The transition piece may be foam insulated as well as vacuum insulated.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0145">Other embodiments of a termination unit are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> where the modular approach is featured. In this case the idea is to build a complete cable termination unit by connecting a number of (e.g. 2 or 3 or 4 or more) similar modules thus improving production efficiency. Each modular envelope element <b>302</b>, <b>402</b> is supplied with a sealing flange <b>322</b>, <b>422</b> at each end for being coupled to another envelope element. Each modular envelope element has one or more in- and/or out-lets for cooling fluid and/or monitoring sensors <b>381</b>, <b>481</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows vacuum insulated modular termination housings, <b>302</b>. In this case, the branches for the electrical phases (two rightmost) are identical but different from that of the neutral (leftmost). Optional thermal contraction compensation elements <b>321</b> are shown at various locations on termination housing <b>302</b>. Each branch is coupled to a fluid-level control section comprising a thermal anchor at ambient temperature <b>311</b> via a sealing flange <b>322</b>, which again (also via a sealing flange <b>322</b>) is coupled to an electrical insulator section <b>312</b>. The electrical insulator section <b>312</b> is optional and included depending on function (neutral or phase) and depending on voltage rating. Above the electrical insulator, at high potential, is the current termination cover <b>313</b>, which is coupled to a top bolt <b>314</b> via a sealing flange <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an embodiment of the modular approach where the branches are minimised, i.e. where the cold to ambient transition is integrated into the voltage transition, insulator <b>412</b>. Further, it illustrates that the different sections (fluid level and thermal anchor section <b>411</b>, electrical insulator section <b>412</b> and current termination cover-section <b>413</b>) can be connected in different ways.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the thermal anchor section <b>511</b> at ambient temperature and at ground potential implemented by a heater <b>585</b>. Alternatively, this embodiment is realised by any combination of a controlled heater, a heat radiation source, an infra-red lamp, a fan, cooling ribs or similar.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> demonstrates the application of thermal sensors <b>684</b>, fluid level gauge <b>682</b>, pressure gauge <b>683</b> as well as vacuum gauge <b>681</b> for the vacuum insulation. Similarly a flow detector could be applied close to or in a neutral branch. <b>601</b> is the cooling fluid. The end-section of the cable is denoted by reference numeral <b>600</b>. The current lead <b>614</b> is shown to be connected to a current sleeve <b>616</b> having electrical contact to the contacting surface of electrical phase (or neutral) via a current clamp <b>615</b> mounted around and having electrical contact to the current sleeve <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows details of a flexible branch current lead. The element is built up by several parts and sections in order to ease the installation of the branch current lead. This, however, does not prevent the branch current lead from being implemented in one complete assembled piece. In this case, however, it would be necessary to build up the termination housing around the current and voltage element in the field instead of, like in this case, insert and connecting the different parts and sections inside the completed termination housing and insulation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, the current lead consists of a stiff part <b>714</b>C, a flexible part <b>714</b>B for compensating the thermal contraction, a top bolt part <b>714</b>A that constitute a standard interface with the grid, a hermetic top bolt pass-through <b>722</b> enabling a pressure difference between internal and external, a current lead that interfaces with a current clamp <b>715</b>. Easily accessible connections <b>714</b>D between the flexible part <b>714</b>B and the stiff parts <b>714</b>A and <b>714</b>C of the current lead are shown and may be implemented by a removable lid in <b>713</b>, cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0151">Individually, these parts can be joined optionally with bolts or soldering/brazing/welding or glueing. The seat surface area is maximised to obtain a low resistant connection. In the said embodiment the current clamps <b>715</b> contact to the current sleeve <b>716</b> that is the actual current termination of a phase conductor. In this case the current sleeve and the phase conductor are connected by soldering. In this embodiment the connecting between the current sleeve and the clamp as well as between the clamp and the lead are provided by bolting the elements together. In another embodiment the same parts can be solder connected, either of the parts can be omitted or any combination of soldering and bolting together can be applied in order to minimise connection resistance and provide ease of assembly. In this example all parts are made of Cu but could be any other material or compound of material with an appropriate electrical resistance (including at cryogenic temperatures).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>shows a module forming a current branch element of a termination unit comprising the end-section of the cable <b>800</b>, a sleeve <b>816</b>, a clamp <b>815</b>, a current lead seat assembly (current leas base) <b>814</b>, <b>814</b>E, and alternative means for heat exchange in the form of cooling channels, <b>818</b>. The electrical phase conductor and the sleeve are solder connected. The sleeves, the clamps and the current leads can be similar for all the phases.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0153">In the ground and/or neutral connection these parts may be similar but will typically be of a more lean design in order to minimise heat leak from the ambient to the cryogenic section. Relating to all the electrically conducting parts each of them can be independently omitted, connected by soldering, brazing, welding, melted, glued, exploded or any other chemi-physical means or connected by bolting, clamping or any other mechanical means. In order to improve electrical and/or mechanical contact the parts can be surface treated to obtain a particular physical appearance and/or coated to inhibit corrosion or chemisorbed contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0154">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>, an example is given on the current sleeve being adapted to the superconducting tapes minimising the mechanical strain as well as optimising the electrical contact by having a smooth conical interface between conductor <b>800</b> and current sleeve <b>816</b> (cf. left part of the sleeve <b>816</b>). In this example, the connection is made by soldering. The sleeve is positioned and centred around the underlying (phase or former) with a regulating insert <b>817</b> that could be made of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) or other electrically insulating material operational at low cryogenic temperature. In this embodiment, the regulating insert may also constitute an adaptive insert and serve the purpose of presenting an equal radial dimension to the current sleeve <b>816</b> so that the same sleeve unit can be used for all phases as well as for the ground connection (neutral connection). Often, however, the ground may be differently designed. The clamp has longitudinal holes <b>818</b> for passing cooling fluid <b>801</b> through. In this way the clamps serve as heat exchanger and ultimately as efficient thermal anchor at cryogenic temperatures. Alternatively, the holes and thereby the thermal anchor could be located in the current lead seat <b>814</b>E, in the sleeve <b>816</b> or any combination of locations (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>). As it is indicated the interface between current lead seat <b>814</b>E and top part <b>815</b>A of current clamp may be zig-zag shaped.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0156">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>, the field-control system is provided in the form of an electrical field-control element (<b>956</b>, <b>951</b>, <b>952</b>) built up from individual parts in order to ease the installation and in order to separate the functions of each element. Apart from the generic dielectric of the cable, <b>957</b>, the dielectric of the branch consists of the regulating insert <b>917</b> (which can be electrically insulating) between conductor <b>900</b> and sleeve <b>916</b>, a prefabricated horizontal dielectric <b>950</b> made from e.g. G10-type fiber-reinforced epoxy plastic, forming a compound dielectric together with the cooling fluid and guiding the coolant flow. In this illustration the element <b>950</b> also constitutes a longitudinal spacer/stand-off between two phases or phase to neutral. Thereby substantially equal longitudinal distance between the contacting surfaces can be obtained. A prefabricated vertical dielectric <b>952</b>, made from e.g. G10, is located between the vertical branch wall of the termination housing, <b>902</b>, and the current lead, <b>914</b>.

Between the vertical dielectric <b>952</b>, the outer <b>953</b> and inner <b>954</b> filler is cooling fluid, the fluid also optionally impregnating the dielectric and/or the filler. The horizontal dielectric <b>951</b> (ULTEM&#x2122;) has a double function as facilitating the transition from phase to ground (housing) of one phase (e.g. <b>900</b>R) at the same time being part of the compound dielectric (dielectric <b>950</b>, <b>951</b> and cooling fluid <b>901</b>) and field-control element(s) (<b>956</b>) of the transition between one phase (<b>900</b>R) and the succeeding phase (<b>900</b>S) of the conductor <b>900</b>. Further, the element <b>951</b> provides increased creep distance at the horizontal opening, <b>959</b>.

<p id="p-0144" num="0158">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>two embodiments of cooling fluid in/out are shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the cooling fluid is injected with the option of adjusting the central flow in relation to the annular flow.
