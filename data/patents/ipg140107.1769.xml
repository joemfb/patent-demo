<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to the field of autogenous bone collection. More particularly, the present invention relates to a device for collecting autogenous bone from a surgical site and extruding the collected bone where desired.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Orthopedic or other surgical procedures involving bone often generate bone chips or particulates that may be harvested and used, for example by implanting the harvested bone back into the patient from which it was derived, as an autogenous graft material. Prior art bone and tissue collection systems are known which include a collection filter disposed in a suction line of the system. In such systems having the filter in the path of the only suction line, suction is removed from the surgical site while the filter medium and/or collected tissue is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite some work in the area, there is a need for an autogenous bone collection system that permits the physician to selectively switch between a material capture mode and a material rejection mode without having to remove a bone capture filter from the suction line or from the housing assembly. There is additionally a need for a selective bone capture system wherein the bone capture filter may be removed without pausing the suction applied to the surgical site. There is a further need for a filter cartridge and bone delivery system that reduces the risk of contamination of the collected bone material.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is also a need for a bone delivery system that accepts a filter cartridge from a filtering system and extrudes the bone material contained therein into the surgical site, even if the bone is highly compressed and dense. There is additionally a need for a delivery system that allows for accurate delivery of the bone tissue to the desired surgical site.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These objects, and others, are addressed by the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a bone collection system that has first and second operational modes for selectively collecting or bypassing to waste tissue materials travelling through the system. Thus, one embodiment of the present inventions relates to a bone collection system comprising a vacuum source, a suction nozzle assembly, a filter and a bypass tube. The filter and bypass tube are connected in parallel between the suction nozzle assembly and the vacuum source. The nozzle assembly includes a switch-actuated-valve which connects the suction nozzle to the vacuum source via either the filter or the bypass tube. The filter is desirably incorporated in a removable filter cartridge having an internal chamber for tissue collection, the chamber having an extrusion opening and a variable volume, wherein reduction in the chamber volume extrudes collected tissue materials from the tissue opening. For example, the chamber may have a wall defined by a translatable plunger for reducing the chamber volume.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment of the present inventions provides a removable filter cartridge for use in a bone collection system. The removable filter cartridge of this embodiment comprises a housing including an inner chamber, defined by the housing back wall and sidewalls. An exit port is in communication with the inner chamber through the sidewall. A filter medium including mesh sized to capture bone material while permitting fluid passage is located in the inner chamber, in fluid communication with the exit port. A filter cap including an entry port is removably engaged with the front end of the filter cartridge housing. A plunger base is slidably located within the filter cartridge housing and is initially placed against the back wall of the housing. In another embodiment, a bore extends through the back wall of the cartridge housing, adjacent the plunger base.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another embodiment of the present inventions concerns a bone delivery system for extruding bone collected in a removable filter cartridge. A removable filter cartridge including a plunger base located in the inner chamber of the filter cartridge is positioned in a delivery device. A ram is aligned with a bore through the back wall of the filter cartridge housing. In one particular embodiment, squeezing the delivery device handle advances the ram through the bore and forces the plunger base forward. Bone from the inner chamber is extruded through an opening at the front end of the delivery device.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the inventions, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the inventions is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications of the principles of the inventions as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the inventions relate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a selective filtering collection device is provided which includes a suction nozzle, suction nozzle assembly and a vacuum source. Disposed in parallel between the suction nozzle assembly and the vacuum source are a filter cartridge and a filter bypass tube. A switch on the suction nozzle assembly may be actuated to provide vacuum to the suction nozzle either through the bypass tube or through the filter cartridge. When vacuum is applied through the filter cartridge, bone material is collected.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is shown a side view of a selective filtering system <b>20</b> for selectively controlling the direction of the suction flow to facilitate the collection of bone. The selective filtering system <b>20</b> can be connected to a vacuum pump <b>45</b>. Selective filtering system <b>20</b> includes a suction nozzle assembly <b>21</b>, connected to which is the suction nozzle <b>22</b>. Preferred suction nozzle assembly <b>21</b> is designed to be held in the hand of a physician during use. A selector switch <b>24</b> located on the suction nozzle assembly <b>21</b> selectively actuates a valve <b>29</b> in the suction nozzle assembly <b>21</b> to direct vacuum from pump <b>45</b> through one of two discharge openings <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>. Selector switch <b>24</b> includes a two position switch, the position of which controls the discharge opening in communication with the suction nozzle <b>22</b>. Alternatively, selector switch <b>24</b> may be a spring-biased switch, which toggles the valve <b>29</b> from a first position to a second position while the switch <b>24</b> is depressed by the physician. Other types of switches for toggling the valve <b>29</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Discharge openings <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are connected to filter tube <b>27</b> and bypass tube <b>28</b>, respectively. Filter tube <b>27</b> is connected to a bone collection filter cartridge <b>30</b> via entry port <b>31</b>. Another piece of filter tubing <b>33</b> is connected to the side exit port <b>32</b> of the bone collection filter cartridge <b>30</b>. Optionally as will be discussed below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the filter cartridge <b>30</b> may be a self-contained removable cartridge. Additionally, the filter cartridge <b>30</b> is preferably made of a biocompatible material. If plastic is chosen, the filter cartridge <b>30</b> may be made of transparent or translucent plastic material that will enable a visual determination of the level of material captured within the filter cartridge <b>30</b> without having to open the filter cartridge <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Both the filter tube <b>33</b> and filter bypass tube <b>28</b> are connected to the inputs of the &#x201c;Y&#x201d; connector <b>40</b>. From the &#x201c;Y&#x201d; connector, suction line <b>41</b> connects the selective filtering system to a vacuum pump <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In operation, the selective filtering system <b>20</b> permits autogenous bone collection as follows. During a bone drilling or other bone-generating surgical procedure, pump <b>45</b> is switched on and vacuum is applied to the system via suction line <b>41</b>. Fluid containing bone and/or soft tissue is drawn into the suction nozzle <b>22</b> of the selective filter system <b>20</b> in the direction of arrows <b>23</b>. According to the physician's desire to retain the material for later use, the selector switch <b>24</b> is set by the operator to provide suction to the suction nozzle <b>22</b> via either discharge opening <b>25</b> or discharge opening <b>26</b>. When the selector switch <b>24</b> is set to one position, vacuum is provided to the suction nozzle <b>22</b> via bypass tube <b>28</b>, from where the material containing fluid is suctioned directly to a waste canister at the vacuum pump <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the selector switch <b>24</b> is set to its other position, vacuum is provided to the suction nozzle <b>22</b> via filter tubes <b>27</b> and <b>33</b> and through the filter cartridge <b>30</b>. The material bearing fluid is then drawn through the bone collection filter cartridge <b>30</b>. Bone is collected in the bone collection filter cartridge <b>30</b> for later use, e.g. for reintroduction to the same or a different surgical site. The waste fluid is suctioned of to the waste container at the vacuum pump <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Using the selective filtering system <b>20</b> a physician is able to selectively choose when the suction will be filtered for bone retrieval or for waste. By having this choice, the quality of bone collected is much better and has less soft tissue content. Further, the present system advantageously permits the collection filter to be removed from the suction line without disrupting the surgical procedure, as the operator can maintain suction pressure at the suction nozzle <b>22</b> even during the removal of the filter by switching the suction path via the selector switch <b>24</b>. Thus, when a first collection filter is full, it may be exchanged in favor of a new collection filter without substantial disruption of the ongoing procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a side view of one embodiment of a removable bone collector filter cartridge <b>130</b> that may be used as the filter cartridge <b>30</b> of the selective filtering system <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an exploded view of the filter cartridge of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The removable filter cartridge <b>130</b> includes an outer cartridge housing <b>132</b> and an inner cartridge filter <b>133</b>. Outer cartridge housing may be made from a variety of biocompatible metals or plastics, by machining or injection molding. The inner cartridge filter <b>133</b> is preferably a mesh material fabricated from metal, polymeric materials or combinations thereof. In the present embodiment, the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b> is preferably substantially cylindrical and fitted to the inner chamber <b>131</b> of the outer cartridge housing <b>132</b>, which would also be substantially cylindrical to accept the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b>. However, this is not meant to be limiting, as other filter and inner chamber cross-sections may be used. The size of the interstices between the filaments of the mesh of the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b> can vary depending on the desired use of the filter cartridge <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A filter plunger base <b>134</b> sits at the base of the filter cartridge <b>130</b>, inside the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b>. Filter plunger base <b>134</b> is additionally made of a biocompatible material, and may be made of a variety of biocompatible metals or plastics, or more preferably, is made of an elastomeric material having a medium to high durometer hardness. The filter plunger base <b>134</b> has a diameter less than the inner diameter of the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b>, permitting the filter plunger base <b>134</b> to slide the entire length of the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b>, when actuated by the delivery mechanism. Preferably, the diameter of the filter plunger base <b>134</b> is just slightly less than the inner diameter of the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b> and is similar in shape to the cross-section of the inner chamber <b>131</b> of the outer cartridge housing <b>132</b>. For example, in the present embodiment using a cylindrical inner chamber, a generally circular filter plunger base would be used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Annular bore or ram aperture <b>135</b> is in communication with the filter plunger base <b>134</b> through the rear wall of the outer cartridge housing <b>132</b>. Initially, the aperture <b>135</b> is sealed for use during the bone collection process to maintain the sanitary condition of the inner filter cartridge <b>133</b> and filter plunger base <b>134</b>. However, in use, a ram on the delivery device is aligned with the ram aperture <b>135</b> and, when advanced by the delivery mechanism, breaks the seal on the ram aperture <b>135</b> and advances the filter plunger base <b>134</b> through the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally the cartridge filter <b>130</b> includes a front entry port <b>136</b> and a side exit port <b>137</b>, containing entry and exit apertures <b>136</b><i>a </i>and <b>137</b><i>a</i>, respectively. The front entry port <b>136</b> is located on the removable filter tip <b>139</b>. Removable filter tip <b>139</b> includes a thread (not shown) which mates with thread <b>138</b> to secure the filter tip <b>139</b> to the outer cartridge housing <b>132</b>. This is not meant to be limiting, as the removable filter tip may be secured to the filter cartridge housing by other means, such as a snap fit.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Fluid and bone material enter the filter cartridge <b>130</b> through the entry aperture <b>136</b><i>a</i>, where it passes directly into the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b>. The inner cartridge filter <b>133</b> separates and collects the bone material from the fluid. The fluid portion is diverted out the side exit aperture <b>137</b><i>a</i>, through the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b>. The desired bone material is collected on the inner wall of the inner cartridge filter <b>133</b>. Additionally, fluid and bone material cannot exit the filter cartridge out the rear aperture <b>135</b>, due to the filter plunger base <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As noted above, other inner chamber cross sectional shapes may be used. For example, if formed using a mold, the cross section of inner chamber <b>131</b> may be square or may be partially rounded with one or more flattened sides, etc. In such a case a flat filter screen may be placed in and/or adhered to the flat side of the inner chamber <b>131</b> bearing the exit port <b>137</b>. Additionally, if a flat filter screen is used, a channel may be made in the inner chamber to receive the flat filter screen and maintain the screen in front of the exit port at all times. Alternatively, a square or other shaped inner filter cartridge may be used. Correspondingly, the outer edge of the filter plunger base <b>134</b> would be designed to correspond to the cross-section of the inner chamber <b>131</b> (i.e., square, partially rounded with one or more flattened sides, etc.) permitting the filter plunger base <b>134</b> to slide through the inner chamber <b>131</b>, extruding bone out the entry end of the filter cartridge <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When used in a selective filter system, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, if the filter is full or the surgeon determines that there is a need for autogenous bone, the filter cartridge <b>130</b> is removed by disconnecting the filter tubes attaching the entry and exit ports of the filter cartridge to the filter system. This can be done without removing suction from the system by switching the suction through the bypass tube of the selective filtering system (bypass tube <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). After removing the filter cartridge <b>130</b>, the entry end cap filter tip <b>139</b> of the filter cartridge <b>130</b> is unscrewed from cartridge thread <b>138</b>, exposing the inner filter medium and collected bone for use by the physician.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> there is shown a partial side perspective view of a bone collector delivery device <b>200</b> including a removable bone collector filter cartridge, which may be a removable bone collection filter cartridge as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a partial side perspective view of a bone collector delivery system including a removable bone collector filter cartridge in the fully extruded position.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The delivery device <b>200</b> includes a delivery housing <b>210</b> having a recess <b>220</b> therein. Recess <b>220</b> is adapted to closely receive a filter cartridge, such as filter cartridge <b>130</b>. The delivery housing <b>210</b> additionally has an extrusion aperture <b>215</b> at the distal end in communication with the open end of the filter cartridge <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The delivery device <b>200</b> additionally includes a ratchet handle <b>240</b> and a ram <b>250</b>. Ratchet handle <b>240</b> provides a mechanical advantage in the advancement of the ram <b>250</b>, and may include ratchet gearing or springs (not shown) which, when the handle members <b>240</b><i>a </i>and <b>240</b><i>b </i>are grasped and squeezed together, the ratchet gear drives the ram <b>250</b> in the direction of arrow <b>260</b>. When the handle is released, the ram <b>250</b> is returned to its resting position.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In operation, the bone collection filter cartridge (<b>30</b> or <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>) is disengaged from the selective filtering collection device and the filter tip (<b>139</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is removed. The inner filter medium need not be removed by the physician, nor does the bone material need to be spooned out. This reduces the risk of contamination of the bone material by reducing the handling of the material used. The filter cartridge is then loaded into the delivery device recess <b>220</b>. Alternatively, the filter tip <b>139</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can be retained in attachment with the filter cartridge, and the delivery device recess <b>220</b> adapted to receive the cartridge/filter tip assembly. In this fashion, the filter tip <b>129</b> may serve to provide a shape and/or dimension to the bone when extruded from the cartridge as discussed further below. In this regard, the filter tip <b>129</b>, or another similar filter tip especially designed for the extrusion, can be configured to provide an extruded bone mass optimized for delivery to a given surgical site. For example, for relatively deep surgical sites, the filter tip can provide a small diameter, elongate tube for delivery of the extruded bone mass to the site.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After receiving the filter cartridge <b>230</b>, the handle <b>240</b> of the delivery device <b>210</b> is depressed. As the handle <b>240</b> is depressed, ram <b>250</b> is ratcheted into the cartridge via the sealed cartridge aperture <b>235</b> opposite the entry side of the bone collection filter cartridge <b>230</b>. The ram <b>250</b> pushes a plunger base <b>134</b> that is located within the inner diameter of the filter medium. As the handle <b>240</b> is ratcheted, the bone is extruded through the opening <b>215</b> in the housing <b>210</b>. Opening <b>215</b> is in communication with the entry end of the filter cartridge <b>230</b>, when the filter cartridge is placed in the recess <b>220</b>. The bone is then extruded back into the surgical site, eliminating the need to use allograft bone, other bone substitute materials, or going to a separate surgical site to harvest additional bone. The delivery device <b>200</b> is capable of accurately extruding compressed, dense bone straight from the filter cartridge due to its leveraged ratchet mechanism. After the bone is extricated from the filter, releasing the handle returns the ram <b>250</b> on the delivery device to its resting position and the filter cartridge can be removed and discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to all of the Figures, in certain embodiments of the invention, kits are provided containing element(s), potentially disposable element(s), for use with a bone collection device and optionally then with a bone delivery device <b>200</b>. For example, such kits may include a single, disposable filter cartridge <b>230</b>, or a plurality of filter cartridges <b>230</b> optionally having varying internal volumes suited to collect bone in connection with surgical procedures that generate varying amounts of bone. In this fashion, a physician can assure that the filter cartridge <b>230</b> will be substantially filled with bone from the surgical procedure so that an efficient extrusion-delivery operation can be carried out with minimal if any bone waste. Moreover, one or more filter tips <b>139</b> can be provided in the kit, and wherein a plurality of tips <b>129</b> are provided they may include different tips adapted to extrude differently-dimensioned bone masses. For example, a first filter tip <b>139</b> may deliver a relatively large-diameter extruded cylinder, and a second filter tip <b>139</b> may be adapted to deliver a relatively small-diameter extruded cylinder. In addition or alternatively, one filter tip <b>139</b> may include a relatively short delivery tube, and another may include a relatively long delivery tube (for example to deliver bone to a deep surgical site). The suction nozzle assembly <b>21</b> may also be included in such kits, along with any or all of the other components described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>.</p>
