<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional intermediate-transfer type image forming device includes a main casing, a plurality of photosensitive drums, an endless belt, a plurality of primary transfer rollers, and a secondary transfer roller. The endless belt is arranged in confrontation with the plurality of photosensitive drums. The plurality of primary transfer rollers is adapted to transfer a toner image formed on each photosensitive drum to the endless belt. The secondary transfer roller is adapted to transfer the toner image transferred onto the endless belt to a sheet of paper. In one such conventional image forming device, the secondary transfer roller is fixed to the main casing. In order to remove the secondary transfer roller from the main casing, a user needs to use a tool.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in one such conventional image forming device, a bias voltage is applied to the secondary transfer roller, thereby increasing a resistance applied to the secondary transfer roller. This causes degradation of transfer accuracy. Therefore, an image forming device having a configuration such that a secondary transfer roller is easily removable and replaceable is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide an image forming device capable of easily removing a secondary transfer roller (a secondary transfer member) from a main casing for replacement of the secondary transfer roller.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to attain the above and other objects, the present invention provides an image forming device including: a main casing; a plurality of photosensitive bodies; a first roller; a second roller; an endless belt; a plurality of primary transfer members; a cleaning unit; and a secondary transfer member. The plurality of photosensitive bodies is rotatably supported in the main casing and juxtaposed with each other in a juxtaposed direction with a space between neighboring photosensitive bodies. The second roller is spaced apart from the first roller in the juxtaposed direction. The endless belt is in contact with the plurality of photosensitive bodies and stretched around the first roller and the second roller. The endless belt is configured to circulate around the first roller and the second roller in a circulating direction. The plurality of primary transfer members is in confrontation with the plurality of photosensitive bodies interposing the endless belt between the plurality of primary transfer members and the plurality of photosensitive bodies. The cleaning unit is configured to collect residual toner remaining on the endless belt, and detachable from and attachable to the main casing. The secondary transfer member is in confrontation with the first roller interposing the endless belt between the secondary transfer member and the first roller. The secondary transfer member is provided at the cleaning unit such that the secondary transfer member is detachable from the main casing upon detachment of the cleaning unit from the main casing and attachable to the main casing upon attachment of the cleaning unit to the main casing.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The drawer <b>50</b> is disposed above the endless belt <b>63</b> and below the scanner unit <b>40</b>. The drawer <b>50</b> is mounted in the main casing <b>10</b> and movable relative to the main casing <b>10</b> in a frontward/rearward direction. The drawer <b>50</b> can be pulled frontward through the opening <b>12</b> of the main casing <b>10</b>. More specifically, the main casing <b>10</b> has side plates, each provided with a rail for supporting the drawer <b>50</b>. Each rail extends in the frontward/rearward direction and has a rear end extending diagonally rearward and downward. When the drawer <b>50</b> is pulled outward from the main casing <b>10</b>, each rail guides the drawer <b>50</b> so that the drawer <b>50</b> is spaced apart from the endless belt <b>63</b>. The drawer <b>50</b> is movable between an accommodated position inside the main casing <b>10</b> and a pulled-out position outside the main casing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The drawer <b>50</b> includes four photosensitive drums <b>51</b>, four chargers (shown without reference numerals), and four developer cartridges <b>52</b>. The four photosensitive drums <b>51</b> are juxtaposed with each other in the frontward/rearward direction with a space between neighboring photosensitive drums <b>51</b>. The drawer <b>50</b> has right and left side walls <b>53</b> to which the four photosensitive drums <b>51</b> are rotatably supported.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each developer cartridge <b>52</b> is detachably mounted in the drawer <b>50</b> and supported to the right and left side walls <b>53</b>. The developer cartridge <b>52</b> includes a well-known developing roller (shown without a reference numeral), a well-known supply roller (shown without a reference numeral), a well-known thickness-regulation blade (shown without a reference numeral), and a well-known toner accommodating portion (shown without a reference numeral).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The transfer unit <b>60</b> is disposed below the drawer <b>50</b>. The transfer unit <b>60</b> includes a drive roller <b>61</b>, a follow roller <b>62</b>, the endless belt <b>63</b>, four primary transfer rollers <b>64</b>, the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b>, and a backup roller <b>66</b>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The toner carried on the surface of the developing roller is supplied to the electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>51</b>. Hence, a visible toner image corresponding to the electrostatic latent image is formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>51</b>. The toner images in each color carried on the surfaces of the respective photosensitive drums <b>51</b> are sequentially transferred onto the endless belt <b>63</b> so as to be superimposed on one another. While the sheet S conveyed from the sheet supply unit <b>30</b> passes through the transfer position between the endless belt <b>63</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b>, the toner images carried on the endless belt <b>63</b> are transferred onto the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The cleaning unit <b>70</b> is adapted to collect residual toner remaining on the endless belt <b>63</b>. More specifically, the cleaning unit <b>70</b> collects residual toner not transferred onto the sheet S at the transfer position between the endless belt <b>63</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b> and thus remaining on the endless belt <b>63</b>. The cleaning unit <b>70</b> will be described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The fixing device <b>80</b> is disposed above the cleaning unit <b>70</b>. The fixing device <b>80</b> includes a heat roller <b>81</b> and a pressure roller <b>82</b>. The pressure roller <b>82</b> is arranged in confrontation with the heat roller <b>81</b> to press the heat roller <b>81</b>. In the fixing device <b>80</b>, while the sheet S onto which the toner images are transferred passes between the heat roller <b>81</b> and the pressure roller <b>82</b>, the toner images are thermally fixed onto the sheet S. After the toner images have been fixed onto the sheet S in the fixing device <b>80</b>, a plurality of discharge roller pairs (shown without reference numerals) conveys the sheet S outward the main casing <b>10</b> to discharge the sheet S onto the discharge tray <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x3c;Structure of Cleaning Unit&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, a structure of the cleaning unit <b>70</b> will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The cleaning unit <b>70</b> is integrally provided with a first cleaning roller <b>71</b>, a collecting roller <b>72</b>, a first blade <b>73</b>, the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b>, a second cleaning roller <b>74</b>, a second blade <b>75</b>, a waste toner accommodating portion <b>76</b>, an auger <b>77</b>, and a conveying belt <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cleaning unit <b>70</b> is directly mounted on the main casing <b>10</b>. The cleaning unit <b>70</b> is detachable from and attachable to right and left side walls of the main casing <b>10</b> without using any tools (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The secondary transfer roller <b>65</b> constituting a part of the transfer unit <b>60</b> is provided integrally with the cleaning unit <b>70</b>. The secondary transfer roller <b>65</b> is detachable from the main casing <b>10</b> upon detachment of the cleaning unit <b>70</b> from the main casing <b>10</b> and attachable to the main casing <b>10</b> upon attachment of the cleaning unit <b>70</b> to the main casing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With this configuration, the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b> can be replaced at the time of replacement of the cleaning unit <b>70</b>. This configuration facilitates replacement of the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first cleaning roller <b>71</b> is arranged so as to interpose the endless belt <b>63</b> with the backup roller <b>66</b>. That is, the first cleaning roller <b>71</b> is in contact with an outer peripheral surface of the endless belt <b>63</b>. The first cleaning roller <b>71</b> is positioned downstream of the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b> and upstream of the plurality of photosensitive drums <b>51</b> in the circulating direction of the endless belt <b>63</b>. A bias voltage for collecting residual toner is applied across the first cleaning roller <b>71</b> and the backup roller <b>66</b>. Hence, residual toner remaining on the endless belt <b>63</b> is captured on the first cleaning roller <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The collecting roller <b>72</b> rotably contacts the first cleaning roller <b>71</b>. The collecting roller <b>72</b> is adapted to collect the toner carried on the first cleaning roller <b>71</b>. The toner carried on the collecting roller <b>72</b> is scraped off by the first blade <b>73</b> arranged in contact with the collecting roller <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second cleaning roller <b>74</b> rotatably contacts the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b>. The second cleaning roller <b>74</b> is adapted to collect residual toner carried on the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b>. The toner carried on the second cleaning roller <b>74</b> is scraped off by the second blade <b>75</b> arranged in contact with the second cleaning roller <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The waste toner accommodating portion <b>76</b> is adapted to accommodate residual toner therein. The toner scraped off by the second blade <b>75</b> falls down into the waste toner accommodating portion <b>76</b> disposed below the second blade <b>75</b>. The toner scraped off by the first blade <b>73</b> also falls down into the waste toner containing portion <b>76</b> via a conveyance mechanism such as the auger <b>77</b> disposed below the first blade <b>73</b>. Hence, both of the residual toner collected by the first cleaning roller <b>71</b> and the residual toner collected by the second cleaning roller <b>74</b> are accommodated in the waste toner accommodating portion <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With this configuration, the single waste toner accommodating portion <b>76</b> accommodates therein both of the residual toner collected by the first cleaning roller <b>71</b> and the residual toner collected by the second cleaning roller <b>74</b>. In comparison with a case where two waste toner accommodating portions are provided, removal of waste toner is facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The waste toner accommodating portion <b>76</b> is designed so as to have a capacity taking service life of the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b> into consideration. When the waste toner accommodating portion <b>76</b> is full of residual toner, the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b> has been degraded to some extent. Hence, the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b> can be replaced at the right time. Unnecessary replacement of the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b> can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the cleaning unit <b>70</b> has a first casing <b>70</b>A, a second casing <b>70</b>B, and a connecting portion <b>70</b>C. The first casing <b>70</b>A and the second casing <b>70</b>B are arranged in confrontation with and spaced apart from each other in the frontward/rearward direction. The connecting portion <b>70</b>C connects the first casing <b>70</b>A and the second casing <b>70</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first casing <b>70</b>A is formed in a generally rectangular parallelepiped shape and elongated in the rightward/leftward direction. The first casing <b>70</b>A defines an internal space in which the first cleaning roller <b>71</b>, the collecting roller <b>72</b>, the first blade <b>73</b>, and the auger <b>77</b> are disposed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The auger <b>77</b> is adapted to convey collected residual toner in the rightward/leftward direction. The toner is conveyed rightward (toward the connecting portion <b>70</b>C) from a left side of the first casing <b>70</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The second casing <b>70</b>B is formed in a generally rectangular parallelepiped shape and elongated in the rightward/leftward direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The second casing <b>70</b>B has a vertical length greater than that of the first casing <b>70</b>A. The second casing <b>70</b>B defines an internal space in which the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b>, the second cleaning roller <b>74</b>, and the second blade <b>75</b> are disposed. The waste toner accommodating portion <b>76</b> constitutes a bottom section of the second casing <b>70</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The connecting portion <b>70</b>C has a front portion connected to a right portion of the first casing <b>70</b>A and a rear portion connected to a right portion of the second casing <b>70</b>B. The connecting portion <b>70</b>C defines an internal space in communication with the internal space of the first casing <b>70</b>A as well as the internal space of the second casing <b>70</b>B. The conveying belt <b>78</b> is disposed in the internal space of the connecting portion <b>70</b>C, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 4</figref>. The conveying belt <b>78</b> is adapted to convey toner from the first casing <b>70</b>A side to the second casing <b>70</b>B side.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The conveying belt <b>78</b> includes a pair of rollers <b>78</b>A, <b>78</b>B, an endless belt <b>78</b>C stretched around the pair of rollers <b>78</b>A, <b>78</b>B, and a plurality of protrusions <b>78</b>D protruding outward from the endless belt <b>78</b>C. With this configuration, as the conveying belt <b>78</b> circulates, the plurality of protrusions <b>78</b>D capture toner to convey the toner rearward.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A drive source (not shown) such as a motor is provided in the main casing <b>10</b>. The auger <b>77</b>, each roller of the cleaning unit <b>70</b> (for example, the first cleaning roller <b>71</b>), and at least one of the pair of rollers <b>78</b>A, <b>78</b>B are connected to the drive source via gears (not shown), so that a drive force from the drive source is transmitted thereto for rotating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>A, and <b>3</b>B, the second casing <b>70</b>B has a front portion provided with a plurality of guide ribs B<b>1</b> at an upper portion thereof. More specifically, the plurality of guide ribs B<b>1</b> is positioned between the first casing <b>70</b>A and the second casing <b>70</b>B. The plurality of guide ribs B<b>1</b> is adapted to guide the sheet S conveyed between the endless belt <b>63</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b>. The sheet S is guided by the plurality of guide ribs B<b>1</b> to be conveyed at a downstream side in a sheet conveying direction.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, when the sheet S is jammed around the plurality of guide ribs B<b>1</b>, the jam can be cleared by removing the cleaning unit <b>70</b> from the main casing <b>10</b>. More specifically, the first casing <b>70</b>A and the connecting portion <b>70</b>C form an L-shape, and the jammed sheet S can be caught by the L-shaped portion to be easily removed out of the main casing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Various modifications are conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A color printer <b>100</b> as an image forming device according to a first modification of the present invention will be described while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 7</figref>. In the following description, only parts differing from those of the above-described embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above-described embodiment, the cleaning unit <b>70</b> is directly mounted in the main casing <b>10</b>, and detachable from and attachable to the main casing <b>10</b>. However, the color printer <b>100</b> includes a main casing <b>110</b> in which a cleaning unit <b>170</b> is detachably mounted in a drawer <b>150</b>. The cleaning unit <b>170</b> is detachable from and attachable to the main casing <b>110</b> via the drawer <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The drawer <b>150</b> is movable between the accommodated position and the pulled-out position and adapted to support the plurality of photosensitive drums <b>51</b>. The drawer <b>150</b> has right and left side walls <b>153</b> and a rear wall <b>154</b>. Each of the right and left side walls <b>153</b> extends rearward of the cleaning unit <b>170</b> and has a rear end portion connected to the rear wall <b>154</b>. The rear wall <b>154</b> has a rear surface on which a handle <b>155</b> is provided. The cleaning unit <b>170</b> is disposed at a rear portion of the drawer <b>150</b>. The cleaning unit <b>170</b> is supported to the drawer <b>150</b>, thereby being supported to the main casing <b>110</b> via the drawer <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The main casing <b>110</b> has a rear cover <b>115</b> movable between an open position and a closed position. A user holds the handle <b>155</b> to pull the drawer <b>150</b> rearward, thereby removing the drawer <b>150</b> from the main casing <b>110</b> through the rear cover <b>115</b>. Due to the configuration of the drawer <b>150</b>, the drawer <b>150</b> cannot be pulled outward from the main casing <b>110</b> through the front cover <b>13</b>. Therefore, a handle (reference numeral omitted) provided at a front portion of the drawer <b>150</b> and the front cover <b>13</b> can be dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, the main casing <b>110</b> has side plates, each provided with a rail for supporting the drawer <b>150</b>. Each rail extends in the frontward/rearward direction and has a front end extending diagonally frontward and downward. With this configuration, when the drawer <b>150</b> is at the accommodated position inside the main casing <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and pulled outward from the main casing <b>10</b>, the drawer <b>150</b> can be pulled rearward through the rear cover <b>115</b> after each photosensitive drums <b>51</b> has been separated from the endless belt <b>63</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, because the drawer <b>150</b> is moved upward so as to be spaced away from the endless belt <b>63</b> when being pulled outward from the main casing <b>110</b>, a fixing device <b>180</b> is configured to be pivotally movable upward and downward so as not to interfere with the drawer <b>150</b>. Incidentally, a user may manually move the fixing device <b>180</b>. Alternatively, the color printer <b>100</b> may be provided with an interlocking mechanism for retracting the fixing device <b>180</b> upward in interlocking relation to the opening movement of the rear cover <b>115</b>. Hence, the fixing device <b>180</b> may be automatically moved by the interlocking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the cleaning unit <b>170</b> is detachably mounted in the drawer <b>150</b>. In comparison with a case where a cleaning unit is fixed to a drawer, it is unnecessary to replace the whole drawer <b>150</b> in order to replace the cleaning unit <b>170</b>. Accordingly, replacement of the cleaning unit <b>170</b> can be easily performed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the above-described embodiment, the photosensitive drum <b>51</b> is employed as a photosensitive body. However, a belt-like photosensitive body is also available.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the above-described embodiment, the drive roller <b>61</b> is a first roller and the follow roller <b>62</b> is a second roller. However, the drive roller <b>61</b> may be the second roller and the follow roller <b>62</b> may be the first roller.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the above-described embodiment, the primary transfer roller <b>64</b> serves as a primary transfer member and the secondary transfer roller <b>65</b> serves as a secondary transfer member. However, as the transfer member, an electrically-conductive brush and an electrically-conductive leaf spring plate are also available as far as a transfer bias voltage can be applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, in the above-described embodiment, a first cleaning member and a second cleaning member are the first cleaning roller <b>71</b> and the second cleaning roller <b>74</b>, respectively. However, as the cleaning member, an electrically-conductive brush and an electrically-conductive leaf spring plate are also available as far as a collection bias voltage can be applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, the sheet S can be an OHP sheet instead of thick paper, a postcard, and thin paper.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, in the above-described embodiment, the image forming device is the color printer. However, any image forming devices other than the color printer, such as a copying machine and a multifunction device, are also available.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">While the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the embodiment thereof, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p>
