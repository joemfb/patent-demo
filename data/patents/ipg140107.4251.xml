<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present embodiments generally relate to content addressable memory (CAM) devices, and more particularly to quaternary and ternary CAM cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Content addressable memory (CAM) devices are frequently used in network switching and routing applications to determine forwarding destinations for data packets. A CAM device can be instructed to compare a selected portion of an incoming packet (e.g., a destination address extracted from the packet header) with CAM words (e.g., forwarding address) stored in an array within the CAM device. If there is a matching entry stored in the CAM array, the index of the matching CAM word can be used to access a corresponding location in an associated memory device to retrieve a destination address and/or other routing information for the packet.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A CAM device includes a CAM array having a plurality of CAM cells organized in a number of rows and columns. Each row of CAM cells, which can be used to store a CAM word, is coupled to a corresponding match line that indicates match results for the row. Each column of CAM cells is typically coupled to one or more data lines or data line pairs that can be used to drive data into a selected CAM row during write operations and/or for providing a search key to the CAM rows during compare operations. During a compare operation, the search key (e.g., the comparand word) is provided to the CAM array and compared with the CAM words stored therein. For each CAM word that matches the search key, a corresponding match line is asserted to indicate the match result. If any of the match lines are asserted, a match flag is asserted to indicate the match condition, and a priority encoder determines the match address or index of the highest priority matching entry in the CAM array.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">CAM arrays typically include either binary CAM cells that store binary data values (i.e., a logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; or a logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; value) or ternary CAM cells that store ternary data values (i.e., a logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; value, a logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; values, or a don't care value). Ternary CAM cells store a data bit and a mask bit. For example, when a mask bit within a ternary CAM cell is inactive (e.g., set to a logic 1 value), the ternary CAM cell operates as a conventional binary CAM cell storing an &#x201c;unmasked&#x201d; data bit. When the mask bit is active (e.g., set to a logic 0 value), the ternary CAM cell is treated as storing a &#x201c;don't care&#x201d; value, which means that all compare operations performed on the actively masked ternary CAM cell will result in a cell match condition.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a well-known quaternary CAM cell <b>100</b> of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,590 issued to Montoye, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Quaternary CAM cells, which are also referred to as XY CAM cells, include two storage cells <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> coupled to a compare circuit <b>130</b>. The two data bits X and Y can collectively represent four possible states: &#x201c;0&#x201d;, &#x201c;1&#x201d;, &#x201c;don't care&#x201d;, and a fourth state which may be left unused or may indicate &#x201c;invalid,&#x201d; as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d; states correspond to the logic states represented, for example, by a conventional binary CAM cell. For each of these states, if the comparand data (e.g., provided to CAM cell <b>100</b> via complementary comparand lines CL and CLB) matches the data stored in CAM cell <b>100</b>, compare circuit <b>130</b> does not discharge the match line ML, which indicates a match condition. Conversely, if the comparand data does not match the data stored in CAM cell <b>100</b>, compare circuit <b>130</b> discharges ML (e.g., toward ground potential) to indicate the mismatch condition. For the &#x201c;don't care&#x201d; state, the logic low values for X and Y maintain respective transistors <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> in non-conductive states, thereby preventing compare circuit <b>130</b> from discharging ML. In this manner, data stored in CAM cell <b>100</b> is masked from the compare operation, thereby forcing a match condition for CAM cell <b>100</b>, regardless of the comparand data. For the &#x201c;invalid&#x201d; state, the logic high values for X and Y maintain respective transistors <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> in conductive states. During a compare operation, one of the complementary comparand data bit pair provided on CL/CLB will be logic high, thereby causing compare circuit <b>130</b> to discharge ML to indicate the mismatch state, regardless of the comparand data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Note that the XY CAM cell <b>100</b> stores a data value as a complimentary bit pair, where the Y bit stores the binary data value and the X bit stores the complemented binary data value. This allows XY CAM cell <b>100</b> to perform faster compare operations than conventional ternary CAM cells.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, to keep up with demand for ever-increasing search rates, it would be desirable to increase the speed of XY CAM cells. It would also be desirable to reduce the footprint and capacitive loading of XY CAM cells.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Fast quaternary (XY) and ternary CAM cells including compare circuits having a reduced stack are disclosed. These CAM cells can be used in a wide variety of CAM architectures and applications for which speed is important. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, specific nomenclature is set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details may not be required to practice the present embodiments. In other instances, well-known circuits and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid obscuring the present embodiments unnecessarily. Additionally, the interconnection between circuit elements or blocks may be shown as buses or as single signal lines. Each of the buses may alternatively be a single signal line, and each of the single signal lines may alternatively be a bus. Further, the logic levels assigned to various signals in the description below are arbitrary, and therefore may be modified (e.g., reversed polarity) as desired. Accordingly, the present embodiments are not to be construed as limited to specific examples described herein but rather include within their scope all embodiments defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">More specifically, CAM cells architected in accordance with present embodiments include a compare circuit that has a fewer number of pull-down transistors coupled between the match line and ground potential than conventional CAM cells, which in turn increases the speed of compare operations performed by such CAM cells. More specifically, by reducing the size of the pull-down stack of the CAM cell's compare circuit, the capacitive load on the match line is reduced, which in turn allows the match line to be charged and discharged more quickly than CAM cells having larger compare stacks. In addition, reducing the number of pull-down transistors between the match line and ground potential also reduces the resistance of the compare stack, which increases search speeds. Further, the reduced match line capacitance resulting from the fewer number of pull-down transistors in the compare stack may also reduce power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a CAM device within which CAM cells of present embodiments may be implemented. CAM device <b>200</b> includes a CAM array <b>210</b>, an address decoder <b>220</b>, a comparand register <b>230</b>, a read/write circuit <b>240</b>, a priority encoder circuit <b>250</b>, and match logic <b>260</b>. CAM array <b>210</b> includes any number of rows of CAM cells (not shown for simplicity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), where each row of CAM cells can be configured to store a data word. Further, while CAM array <b>210</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as a single CAM array, it may include any number of CAM array blocks that can be independently searched.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One or more instructions and related control signals may be provided to CAM device <b>200</b> from an instruction decoder (not shown for simplicity) to control read, write, compare, and other operations for CAM device <b>200</b>. Other well-known signals that can be provided to CAM device <b>200</b>, such as enable signals, clock signals, and power connections, are not shown for simplicity. Further, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each row of CAM cells in CAM array <b>210</b> may have one or more validity bits to indicate whether the corresponding row (or any segment thereof) of CAM cells stores valid data.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each row of CAM cells (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for simplicity) in CAM array <b>210</b> is coupled to address decoder <b>220</b> via a corresponding word line WL, and to match latches <b>212</b>, to priority encoder <b>250</b>, and to well-known match logic <b>260</b> via a corresponding match line ML. For simplicity, the word lines and match lines are represented collectively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Address decoder <b>220</b> is well-known, and includes circuitry to select corresponding rows in CAM array <b>210</b> for read, write, and/or other operations in response to an address received from an address bus ABUS using the word lines WL. For other embodiments, addresses may be provided to address decoder <b>220</b> from another suitable bus and/or circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The match lines ML provide match results for compare operations between comparand data (e.g., a search key) and data stored in CAM array <b>210</b>. Priority encoder <b>250</b>, which is well-known, uses the match results indicated on the match lines and latched in the match latches <b>212</b> to determine the matching entry that has the highest priority number associated with it and generates the index or address of this highest priority match (HPM). In addition, priority encoder <b>250</b> may use the validity bits from CAM array <b>210</b> to generate the next free address that is available in CAM array <b>210</b> for storing new data. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for some embodiments, priority encoder <b>250</b> may provide the next free address to the address decoder <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Match logic <b>260</b>, which is well-known, uses the match results indicated on the match lines to generate a match flag (MF) indicative of a match condition in CAM array <b>210</b>. If there is more than one matching entry in CAM array <b>210</b>, match logic <b>260</b> may generate a multiple match flag MF to indicate a multiple match condition. In addition, match logic <b>260</b> may use the validity bits from CAM array <b>210</b> to assert a full flag when all of the rows of CAM cells in CAM array <b>210</b> are filled with valid entries.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each column of CAM cells (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for simplicity) in CAM array <b>210</b> is coupled to comparand register <b>230</b> via one or more corresponding comparand lines CL, and is coupled to read/write circuit <b>240</b> via one or more corresponding bit lines BL. For simplicity, the comparand lines CL and bit lines BL are represented collectively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Comparand register <b>230</b> is well-known, and is configured to provide a search key (e.g., a comparand word) received from a comparand bus CBUS to CAM array <b>210</b> during compare operations with data stored therein. For other embodiments, the search key can be provided to CAM array <b>210</b> via another bus and/or circuit. Read/write circuit <b>240</b> includes well-known write drivers to write data received from a data bus DBUS to CAM array <b>210</b> via the bit lines BL, and includes well-known sense amplifiers to read data from CAM array <b>210</b> onto DBUS. For other embodiments, read/write circuit <b>240</b> may be coupled to a bus other than DBUS. Further, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for simplicity, CAM device <b>200</b> can include a well-known global mask circuit (e.g., coupled to the comparand register <b>230</b>) that can selectively mask the bits of the search key provided to the CAM array <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a more detailed block diagram of the CAM array <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. CAM array <b>210</b> is shown to include a plurality of CAM cells <b>202</b> organized in any number of rows and columns. The CAM cells <b>202</b> can be any suitable type of CAM cell including, for example, binary CAM cells, ternary CAM cells, and/or quaternary CAM cells. As noted above, each row of CAM array <b>210</b> may also include one or more validity bits. Each row of CAM cells <b>202</b> is coupled to a match line ML and to a word line WL. Each word line WL is driven by address decoder <b>220</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to select one or more rows of CAM cells <b>202</b> for writing or reading. Each match line ML is coupled to priority encoder <b>250</b> via a corresponding match latch <b>212</b>, which together form the match latches <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The match latches <b>212</b> are clocked by a match latch clock signal CLK_mL in a well-known manner. Each column of CAM cells <b>202</b> in CAM array <b>210</b> is coupled to read/write circuit <b>240</b> via a complementary bit line pair BL/BLB, and to comparand register <b>230</b> via a complementary comparand line pair CL/CLB.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Prior to compare operations, the match lines ML are pre-charged (e.g., to logic high), and each set of complementary comparand line pairs CL/CLB are driven to the same predetermined logic level (e.g., to logic high). Then, during compare operations, the comparand register <b>230</b> provides the search key (e.g., the comparand word) to the CAM cells <b>202</b> by driving each pair of complementary comparand lines CL/CLB to opposite logic states indicative of the corresponding bit of the search key. For example, to provide a logic low comparand bit (C) to a column of CAM cells, the corresponding comparand line CL is driven to a first logic state (e.g., logic low) and the corresponding complementary comparand line CLB is driven to a second logic state (e.g., logic high); conversely, to provide a logic high comparand bit C to the column of CAM cells, the corresponding comparand line CL is driven to the second logic state (e.g., logic high) and the corresponding complementary comparand line CLB is driven to the first logic state (e.g., logic low). Thereafter, if all the CAM cells <b>202</b> in a particular row match the corresponding bits of the search key, then the match line ML remains in its logic high state to indicate the match condition. Conversely, if one or more of the CAM cells <b>202</b> in the row do not match the corresponding bit of the search key, then mismatching CAM cells <b>202</b> discharge the match line ML (e.g., toward ground potential) to indicate the mismatch condition.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a quaternary (XY) CAM cell <b>400</b> in accordance with the present embodiments. The XY CAM cell <b>400</b> includes two memory cells <b>410</b><i>x </i>and <b>410</b><i>y </i>coupled to a compare circuit <b>420</b>. The memory cells <b>410</b><i>x </i>and <b>410</b><i>y </i>can be any suitable type of storage cell including, for example, an SRAM cell, a DRAM cell, an EEPROM cell, a flash memory cell, a latch, or a register. For some embodiments, memory cells <b>410</b> are formed using cross-coupled CMOS inverter circuits, as known in the art. The first memory cell <b>410</b><i>x </i>stores a first data bit &#x201c;X&#x201d;, and the second memory cell <b>410</b><i>y </i>stores a second data bit &#x201c;Y&#x201d;. Together, the two data bits X and Y can collectively represent a data value D having four possible states: &#x201c;0&#x201d;, &#x201c;1&#x201d;, &#x201c;don't care&#x201d;, and a fourth state which may be left unused or may indicate &#x201c;invalid,&#x201d; as depicted in the truth table <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">More specifically, the logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d; states correspond to the logic states represented by a conventional binary CAM cell. For each of these states, if the comparand data (e.g., provided to CAM cell <b>400</b> via complementary comparand lines CL and CLB) matches the data stored in CAM cell <b>400</b>, the compare circuit <b>420</b> does not discharge the match line ML, which remains in its charged state to indicate a match condition. Conversely, if the comparand data does not match the data stored in CAM cell <b>400</b>, compare circuit <b>420</b> discharges ML (e.g., toward ground potential) to indicate the mismatch condition. For the &#x201c;don't care&#x201d; state, the logic low values for X and Y cause compare circuit <b>420</b> to remain in a non-conductive state, thereby preventing the match line from discharging. In this manner, the data value D stored in CAM cell <b>400</b> is masked from the compare operation, thereby forcing a match condition for CAM cell <b>400</b>, regardless of the comparand data. For the &#x201c;invalid&#x201d; state, the logic high values for X and Y cause the compare circuit <b>420</b> to remain in a conductive state to discharge the match line to indicate a mismatch condition, irrespective of the comparand data.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An exemplary compare operation between a comparand bit C and a data value D stored in the CAM cell <b>400</b> is now described. During a pre-charge phase of the compare operation, the match line ML is pre-charged to logic high (e.g., towards VDD) by a suitable pre-charge circuit (not shown for simplicity), and the comparand lines CL/CLB are both pre-charged to logic high (e.g., towards VDD). The logic high state of CLB turns on NMOS transistor <b>423</b><i>x </i>and turns off PMOS transistor <b>422</b><i>x</i>. The conductive state of transistor <b>423</b><i>x </i>pulls the gate of match line pull-down transistor <b>421</b><i>x </i>(e.g., at node Nx) low towards ground potential, thereby maintaining transistor <b>421</b><i>x </i>in a non-conductive state to isolate the match line ML from ground potential. The non-conductive state of transistor <b>422</b><i>x </i>isolates the first memory cell <b>410</b><i>x </i>from node Nx, thereby preventing the value of X from being pulled low to ground potential by the conductive NMOS transistor <b>423</b><i>x</i>. Similarly, the logic high state of CL turns on NMOS transistor <b>423</b><i>y </i>and turns off PMOS transistor <b>422</b><i>y</i>. The conductive state of transistor <b>423</b><i>y </i>pulls the gate of match line pull-down transistor <b>421</b><i>y </i>(e.g., at node Ny) low towards ground potential, thereby maintaining transistor <b>421</b><i>y </i>in a non-conductive state to isolate the match line ML from ground potential. The non-conductive state of transistor <b>422</b><i>y </i>isolates the second memory cell <b>410</b><i>y </i>from node Ny, thereby preventing the value of Y from being pulled low to ground potential by the conductive NMOS transistor <b>423</b><i>y. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Then, during an evaluation phase of the compare operation, the comparand bit C is provided in a complementary manner to the XY CAM cell <b>400</b> via comparand lines CL and CLB. If a comparand line is driven to logic high, then the corresponding selective pull-down circuit <b>425</b> is disabled and does not discharge the match line ML. Conversely, if a comparand line is driven to logic low, then the corresponding selective pull-down circuit <b>425</b> is enabled and selectively discharges the match line ML in response to the corresponding data bit provided by the associated memory cell <b>410</b>. If both CL and CLB are driven to logic high (e.g., to achieve a column-masking function), then both selective pull-down circuits <b>425</b><i>x </i>and <b>425</b><i>y </i>are disabled and together prevent the match line ML from discharging, thereby causing the CAM cell <b>400</b> to indicate a match condition on ML irrespective of the data value D.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For one example, if the comparand bit is logic high (e.g., C=1 and <o ostyle="single">C</o>=0), then CL is driven to logic high and CLB is driven to logic low. The logic high state of CL disables the second selective pull-down circuit <b>425</b><i>y </i>(in the manner described above), and prevents the second data bit Y stored in second memory cell <b>410</b><i>y </i>from affecting the compare operation. The logic low state of CLB enables the first selective pull-down circuit <b>425</b><i>x </i>(in the manner described above), and allows the first data bit X stored in first memory cell <b>410</b><i>x </i>to selectively discharge the match line ML. Thus, if the data bit stored in the cell <b>400</b> is logic high (e.g., D=1), as indicated by X=0 and Y=1, then the logic low value (X=0) output by first memory cell <b>410</b><i>x </i>propagates through pass gate <b>422</b><i>x </i>to node Nx. In response to X=0, NMOS pull-down transistor <b>421</b><i>x </i>does not turn on, and therefore the match line ML remains in its charged state to indicate the match condition between C=1 and D=1. Conversely, if the data bit is logic low (e.g., D=0), as indicated by X=1 and Y=0, then the logic high value (X=1) output by first memory cell <b>410</b><i>x </i>propagates through pass gate <b>422</b><i>x </i>to node Nx. In response to X=1, NMOS pull-down transistor <b>421</b><i>x </i>turns on and discharges the match line ML low toward ground potential to indicate the mismatch condition between C=1 and D=0.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The XY CAM cell <b>400</b> operates in a complementary manner for compare operations in which the comparand bit is logic low (e.g., C=0 and <o ostyle="single">C</o>=1), where CL is driven to logic low and CLB is driven to logic high. More specifically, the logic low state of CL enables selective pull-down circuit <b>425</b><i>y </i>(in the manner described above), and allows the second data bit Y stored in second memory cell <b>410</b><i>y </i>to selectively discharge the match line ML. The logic high state of CLB disables selective pull-down circuit <b>425</b><i>x </i>(in the manner described above), and prevents the first data bit X stored in first memory cell <b>410</b><i>x </i>from affecting the compare operation. Thus, if the data bit is logic low (e.g., D=0), as indicated by X=1 and Y=0, then the logic low value (Y=0) output by second memory cell <b>410</b><i>y </i>propagates through pass gate <b>422</b><i>y </i>to node Ny. In response to Y=0, NMOS pull-down transistor <b>421</b><i>y </i>does not turn on, and therefore the match line ML remains in its charged state to indicate the match condition between C=0 and D=0.

The compare circuit <b>640</b> includes pass transistors <b>641</b>A and <b>641</b>B, and includes pull-down transistors <b>642</b> and <b>643</b>. Transistor <b>641</b>A is coupled between complementary comparand line CLB and a node N, and transistor <b>641</b>B is coupled between the node N and comparand line CL.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The CAM cell <b>602</b> has fewer transistors than the CAM cell <b>601</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, and the compare circuit <b>640</b> has only 2 transistors connected in series between the match line ML and ground potential. As a result, the capacitance on match line ML is also smaller as compared to the CAM cell <b>601</b>. However, there are several drawbacks of CAM cell <b>602</b>. First, the current and time associated with driving the complementary comparand lines CL and CLB may be significantly higher for CAM cell <b>602</b> than for CAM cell <b>601</b>. For example, because pass transistors <b>641</b>A and <b>641</b>B are controlled by complementary data bits D and <o ostyle="single">D</o>, respectively, one of the pass transistors <b>641</b>A and <b>641</b>B may undesirably turn on during the pre-charge phase. Therefore, the charging circuitry (not shown) for CL and CLB drives not only the capacitance of the comparand lines, but also the source/drain capacitance of one of the pass transistors <b>641</b>, the gate capacitance seen by the node N, and any associated parasitic capacitances. These extra capacitances adversely affect the performance and the scalability of the CAM cell <b>602</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a block diagram of a TCAM cell <b>700</b> in accordance with some embodiments. TCAM cell <b>700</b> includes a data cell <b>710</b>, a mask cell <b>720</b>, and a compare circuit <b>730</b>. Both data cell <b>710</b> and mask cell <b>720</b> can be implemented with any suitable type of storage cell including, for example, an SRAM cell, DRAM cell, Flash memory cell, STT cell, and so on. The TCAM cell <b>700</b> can store three possible states: &#x201c;0&#x201d;, &#x201c;1&#x201d;, or &#x201c;don't care.&#x201d; Thus, when TCAM cell <b>700</b> stores a &#x201c;0&#x201d; or a &#x201c;1,&#x201d; TCAM cell <b>700</b> operates in a manner similar to binary CAM cells. For example, during compare operations when TCAM cell <b>700</b> stores a &#x201c;0&#x201d; or a &#x201c;1,&#x201d; if the comparand bit C matches the data bit D stored in data cell <b>710</b>, then compare circuit <b>730</b> does not discharge the match line ML, which remains in its pre-charged state to indicate the match condition. Conversely, if the comparand bit C does not match the data bit D, then compare circuit <b>730</b> discharges the match line ML (e.g., toward ground potential) to indicate the mismatch condition. To store a don't care state, an active mask bit is stored in mask cell <b>720</b> to prevent compare circuit <b>730</b> from discharging the match line ML, regardless of the values of D and C.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In accordance with the present embodiments, compare circuit <b>730</b> includes two NMOS match line pull-down transistors <b>733</b>A and <b>733</b>B, two PMOS pass transistors <b>731</b>A and <b>731</b>B, two NMOS gating transistors <b>732</b>A and <b>732</b>B, and an NMOS mask discharge transistor <b>735</b>. The mask transistor <b>735</b> is controlled by the mask cell <b>720</b>. A first group of transistors <b>731</b>A, <b>732</b>A, and <b>733</b>A forms a first selective pull-down circuit <b>740</b>A that selectively discharges the match line ML in response to a comparison between the comparand bit C provided on CL and the data bit D stored in the data cell <b>710</b>, and a second group of transistors <b>731</b>B, <b>732</b>B, and <b>733</b>B forms a second selective pull-down circuit <b>740</b>B that selectively discharges the match line ML in response to a comparison between the complemented comparand bit <o ostyle="single">C</o> provided on CLB and the complemented data bit <o ostyle="single">D</o>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">More specifically, for the first selective pull-down circuit <b>740</b>A, the NMOS match line pull-down transistor <b>733</b>A is coupled between the match line ML and the discharge transistor <b>735</b>, and has a gate tied to a first node (Na) that selectively receives the data bit D via PMOS pass transistor <b>731</b>A in response to the comparand bit C. Thus, the gate of match line pull-down transistor <b>733</b>A is selectively driven by D in response to C. The NMOS gating transistor <b>732</b>A is coupled between the gate of match line pull-down transistor <b>733</b>A (e.g., node Na) and ground potential. The common gates of transistors <b>731</b>A and <b>732</b>A are coupled to the comparand line CL, and receive the comparand bit C during compare operations.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For the second selective pull-down circuit <b>740</b>B, the NMOS match line pull-down transistor <b>733</b>B is coupled between the match line and the discharge transistor <b>735</b>, and has a gate tied to a second node (Nb) that selectively receives <o ostyle="single">D</o> via the PMOS pass transistor <b>731</b>B in response to <o ostyle="single">C</o>. Thus, the gate of match line pull-down transistor <b>733</b>B is selectively driven by <o ostyle="single">D</o> in response to <o ostyle="single">C</o>. The NMOS gating transistor <b>732</b>B is coupled between the gate of match line pull-down transistor <b>733</b>B (e.g., node Nb) and ground potential.

The NMOS mask discharge transistor <b>735</b> is coupled between the common sources of transistors <b>733</b>A-<b>733</b>B and ground potential, and has a gate coupled to one side of the mask cell <b>720</b> (e.g., to the side that provides the complement of the value of the mask bit stored in the mask cell).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">If there is a mismatch condition during compare operations, and the mask cell <b>720</b> stores an inactive mask bit (e.g., M=0 and <o ostyle="single">M</o>=1) that turns on mask discharge transistor <b>735</b>, then the match line ML is discharged low toward ground potential either through a first discharge path formed by transistors <b>733</b>A and <b>735</b> or through a second discharge path formed by transistors <b>733</b>B and <b>735</b>. Thus, each discharge path in compare circuit <b>730</b> has only two series-connected transistors, as in the case of CAM cell <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> and CAM cell <b>603</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. However, unlike CAM cells <b>602</b> and <b>603</b>, the complementary data bits (D and <o ostyle="single">D</o>) and the complementary comparand bits (C and <o ostyle="single">C</o>) are provided to and processed by compare circuit <b>730</b> in a differential manner, which can improve performance over CAM cells <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> by providing balanced impedances. Therefore, in accordance with present embodiments, the TCAM cell <b>700</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> incorporates the advantages of differential compare circuitry and a shortened, two-transistor pull-down stack.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">An exemplary compare operation between a comparand bit C and a data value D stored in the CAM cell <b>700</b> is now described. During a pre-charge phase of the compare operation, the match line ML is pre-charged to logic high (e.g., towards VDD) by a suitable pre-charge circuit (not shown for simplicity), and the comparand lines CL/CLB are both pre-charged to logic high (e.g., towards VDD). The logic high state of CL turns on NMOS transistor <b>732</b>A and turns off PMOS transistor <b>731</b>A. The conductive state of transistor <b>732</b>A pulls the gate of match line pull-down transistor <b>733</b>A (e.g., at node Na) low towards ground potential, thereby maintaining transistor <b>733</b>A in a non-conductive state to isolate the match line ML from ground potential. The non-conductive state of transistor <b>731</b>A isolates the data cell <b>710</b> from node Na, thereby preventing the value of D from being pulled low to ground potential by the conductive NMOS transistor <b>732</b>A. Similarly, the logic high state of CLB turns on NMOS transistor <b>732</b>B and turns off PMOS transistor <b>731</b>B. The conductive state of transistor <b>732</b>B pulls the gate of match line pull-down transistor <b>733</b>B (e.g., at node Nb) low towards ground potential, thereby maintaining transistor <b>733</b>B in a non-conductive state to isolate the match line ML from ground potential. The non-conductive state of transistor <b>731</b>B isolates the data cell <b>710</b> from node Nb, thereby preventing the value of <o ostyle="single">D</o> from being pulled low towards ground potential by the conductive NMOS transistor <b>732</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Then, during an evaluation phase of the compare operation, the comparand bit C is provided in a complementary manner to the TCAM cell <b>700</b> via comparand lines CL and CLB. For this example, the mask bit M is set to an inactive state (e.g., M=0 and <o ostyle="single">M</o>=1), thereby turning on mask discharge transistor <b>735</b> so that the match line pull-down transistors <b>733</b>A and <b>733</b>B can selectively pull the match line ML to ground potential in response to the compare operation. If a comparand line is driven to logic high, then the corresponding selective pull-down circuit <b>740</b> is disabled and does not discharge the match line ML, as described above. Conversely, if a comparand line is driven to logic low, then the corresponding selective pull-down circuit <b>740</b> is enabled and selectively discharges the match line ML in response to the corresponding data bit D and the comparand bit C. For example, if CL is driven to logic low (e.g., in response to C=0), the logic low state of CL turns off NMOS transistor <b>732</b>A and turns on PMOS transistor <b>731</b>A, thereby allowing the logic state of D to propagate through transistor <b>731</b>A to node Na and selectively turn on match line pull-down transistor <b>733</b>A, thereby selectively discharging the match line ML in response to the logic state of D. If both CL and CLB are driven to a logic high (e.g., to achieve a column-masking function), then both selective pull-down circuits <b>740</b>A and <b>740</b>B are disabled and together prevent the match line ML from discharging, thereby causing the CAM cell <b>700</b> to indicate a match condition on ML irrespective of the data value D.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For one example, if the comparand bit is logic high (e.g., C=1 and <o ostyle="single">C</o>=0), then CL is driven to logic high and CLB is driven to logic low. The logic high state of CL disables the first selective pull-down circuit <b>740</b>A (in the manner described above), and prevents the data bit D from affecting the compare operation. The logic low state of CLB enables the second selective pull-down circuit <b>740</b>B, and allows the complemented data bit <o ostyle="single">D</o> stored in the data cell <b>710</b> to selectively discharge the match line ML via match line pull-down transistor <b>733</b>B. Thus, if the data bit is logic high (e.g., D=1), then the logic low value of <o ostyle="single">D</o> propagates through pass gate transistor <b>731</b>B to node Nb. In response thereto, NMOS pull-down transistor <b>733</b>B does not turn on, and therefore the match line ML remains in its charged state to indicate the match condition between C=1 and D=1.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Conversely, if the data bit is logic low (e.g., D=0), then the logic high value of <o ostyle="single">D</o> propagates through pass gate transistor <b>731</b>B to node Nb. In response thereto, NMOS pull-down transistor <b>733</b>B turns on and discharges the match line ML low toward ground potential to indicate the mismatch condition between C=1 and D=0.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The TCAM cell <b>700</b> also operates in a complementary manner for compare operations in which the comparand bit is logic low (e.g., C=0 and <o ostyle="single">C</o>=1). More specifically, the logic low state of CL enables selective pull-down circuit <b>740</b>A (in the manner described above), and allows the data bit D to selectively discharge the match line ML. The logic high state of CLB disables selective pull-down circuit <b>740</b>B (in the manner described above), and prevents the complemented data bit <o ostyle="single">D</o> from affecting the compare operation. Thus, if the data bit is logic low (e.g., D=0), then the logic low value of D propagates through pass transistor <b>731</b>A to node Na. In response thereto, NMOS pull-down transistor <b>733</b>A does not turn on, and therefore the match line ML remains in its charged state to indicate the match condition between C=0 and D=0. Conversely, if the data bit is logic high (e.g., D=1), then the logic high value of D propagates through pass transistor <b>731</b>A to node Na. In response thereto, NMOS pull-down transistor <b>733</b>A turns on and discharges the match line ML low toward ground potential to indicate the mismatch condition between C=0 and D=1.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In accordance with the present embodiments, the compare circuit <b>730</b> of TCAM cell <b>700</b> includes only two transistors (e.g., transistors <b>733</b> and <b>735</b>) in each pull-down path between the match line and ground potential, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In contrast, the TCAM cell <b>601</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> includes three series-connected transistors (e.g., transistors <b>631</b>, <b>632</b>, and <b>633</b>) in each pull-down path between the match line and ground potential. As a result, the TCAM cell <b>700</b> of present embodiments is faster than the TCAM cell <b>601</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. More specifically, because the compare circuit <b>730</b> employs double stack pull-down elements (e.g., transistors <b>733</b> and <b>735</b>) between the match line and ground potential, the TCAM cell <b>700</b> puts less pull-down resistance and less capacitive loading on the match line than the 3-stack pull-down elements (e.g., transistors <b>631</b>, <b>632</b>, and <b>633</b>) employed in the TCAM cell <b>601</b>, and therefore is faster than TCAM cell <b>601</b>. Further, because each CAM cell <b>700</b> puts less capacitive loading on the match line, a CAM array such as CAM array <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can employ more CAM cells <b>700</b> in each row without degrading performance, as compared to CAM cells <b>601</b>. Further, the reduced match line capacitance resulting from fewer pull-down transistors in the compare stack of CAM cell <b>700</b> may reduce power consumption, as compared with TCAM cells <b>601</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>

Conversely, when mask cell <b>720</b> stores an inactive mask bit (M=0), mask discharge transistors <b>834</b>A and <b>834</b>B are turned off and allow a comparison between D and C to proceed and affect the match line ML.

Conversely, if a comparand line is driven to logic low, then the corresponding selective pull-down circuit <b>840</b> is enabled and selectively discharges the match line ML in response to the comparison between the data bit D and the comparand bit C. If both CL and CLB are driven to a logic high (e.g., to achieve a column-masking function), then both selective pull-down circuits <b>840</b>A and <b>840</b>B are disabled and together prevent the match line ML from discharging, thereby causing the CAM cell <b>800</b> to indicate a match condition on ML irrespective of the data value D.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">For one example, if the comparand bit is logic high (e.g., C=1 and <o ostyle="single">C</o>=0), then CL is driven to logic high and CLB is driven to logic low.

TCAM cell <b>900</b> includes a data cell <b>710</b>, a mask cell <b>720</b>, and a compare circuit <b>930</b>. The data stored in the data cell <b>710</b> is applied to a compare circuit <b>930</b> in a differential manner as D and <o ostyle="single">D</o>. The mask bit stored in the mask cell <b>720</b> is also applied to the compare circuit <b>930</b> in a differential manner as M and <o ostyle="single">M</o>. The mask cell <b>720</b> can be configured, together with the data cell <b>710</b>, to disable the compare circuit <b>930</b> from discharging a match line ML, leaving the match line ML always logic high. Thus, the TCAM cell <b>900</b> can be configured to store three possible states: &#x201c;0&#x201d;, &#x201c;1&#x201d;, or &#x201c;don't care,&#x201d; as depicted in the truth table <b>950</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In accordance with the present embodiments, the compare circuit <b>930</b> includes a single match line pull-down transistor <b>934</b>, two pass transistors <b>931</b>A and <b>931</b>B, two gating transistors <b>932</b>A and <b>932</b>B, and two control transistors <b>933</b>A and <b>933</b>B. A first group of transistors <b>931</b>A, <b>932</b>A, and <b>933</b>A forms a first selective pull-down control circuit <b>940</b>A that controls the match line pull-down transistor <b>934</b> and selectively discharges the match line ML in response to a comparison between the complemented comparand bit ( <o ostyle="single">C</o>) provided on CLB, the data bit (D) stored in the data cell <b>710</b>, and the mask bit (M) stored in the mask cell <b>720</b>.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">More specifically, the NMOS match line pull-down transistor <b>934</b> is coupled between the match line ML and ground potential, and has a gate tied to a pull-down or discharge node (Np) that selectively receives control signals from match line pull-down control circuits <b>940</b>A and <b>940</b>B. For the first selective pull-down control circuit <b>940</b>A, the PMOS control transistor <b>933</b>A is coupled between the pull-down node Np and a first node (Na), and has a gate to receive the mask bit M from mask cell <b>720</b>. The NMOS gating transistor <b>932</b>A is coupled between ground potential and the first node Na, which in turn selectively receives D from data cell <b>710</b> via PMOS pass transistor <b>931</b>A. PMOS pass transistor <b>931</b>A and NMOS gating transistor <b>932</b>A are connected in series, and have gates coupled to the complementary comparand line CLB. For the second selective pull-down control circuit <b>940</b>B, PMOS control transistor <b>933</b>B is coupled between the pull-down node Np and a second node (Nb), and has a gate to receive the complemented mask bit <o ostyle="single">M</o> from mask cell <b>720</b>.

PMOS pass transistor <b>931</b>B and NMOS gating transistor <b>932</b>B are connected in series, and have gates coupled to the complementary comparand line CL. Thus, as explained in more detail below, the gate of the single match line pull-down transistor <b>934</b> is responsive to (1) a logical combination of the data bit D, the mask bit M, and the complemented comparand bit <o ostyle="single">C</o>, and (2) a logical combination of the complemented data bit <o ostyle="single">D</o>, the complemented mask bit <o ostyle="single">M</o>, and the comparand bit C.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When a match condition occurs, the match line ML is discharged through a single match line pull-down transistor <b>934</b>. Therefore, according to the present embodiments, TCAM cell <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> incorporates both advantages of differential compare circuitry and a shortened, one-transistor pull-down path. It is further observed that the CAM cell <b>900</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> has the same, reduced overall transistor count in its compare circuit <b>930</b> as the compare circuit <b>730</b> of CAM cell <b>700</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">For other embodiments, PMOS control transistors <b>933</b>A and <b>933</b>B can be NMOS transistors, in which case the gate of transistor <b>933</b>A receives <o ostyle="single">M</o> and the gate of transistor <b>933</b>B receives M.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">An exemplary compare operation between a comparand bit C and a data value (represented by the data bit D and the mask bit M, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) stored in the CAM cell <b>900</b> is now described. During a pre-charge phase of the compare operation, the match line ML is pre-charged to logic high (e.g., towards VDD) by a suitable pre-charge circuit (not shown for simplicity), and the comparand lines CL/CLB are both pre-charged to logic high (e.g., towards VDD). The logic high state of CL turns on NMOS transistor <b>932</b>B and turns off PMOS transistor <b>931</b>B, thereby pulling node Nb low to ground potential. Therefore, although one of the control transistors <b>933</b>A and <b>933</b>B may be turned on because of the complementary mask bit M and <o ostyle="single">M</o>, in the case that <b>933</b>B is turned on, the conductive state of transistor <b>933</b>B pulls the gate of match line pull-down transistor <b>934</b> (e.g., at node Np) low towards ground potential, thereby maintaining transistor <b>934</b> in a non-conductive state to isolate the match line ML from ground potential. The non-conductive state of transistor <b>931</b>B isolates the data cell <b>710</b> from node Nb, thereby preventing the value of <o ostyle="single">D</o> from being pulled low to ground potential by the conductive NMOS transistor <b>932</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Similarly, the logic high state of CLB turns on NMOS transistor <b>932</b>A and turns off PMOS transistor <b>931</b>A, thereby pulling node Na low to ground potential.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Then, during an evaluation phase of the compare operation, the comparand bit C is provided in a complementary manner to the TCAM cell <b>900</b> via comparand lines CL and CLB.

For one example, if the comparand bit is logic high (e.g., C=1 and <o ostyle="single">C</o>=0), then CL is driven to logic high and CLB is driven to logic low. The logic high state of CL turns off pass transistor <b>931</b>B and turns on gating transistor <b>932</b>B of the second selective pull-down control circuit <b>940</b>B, thereby preventing the complemented data bit <o ostyle="single">D</o> from affecting the compare operation.

In contrast, the conventional XY CAM cell <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes two series-connected transistors (e.g., transistors <b>131</b>-<b>132</b> and <b>133</b>-<b>134</b>) in each pull-down path between the match line and ground potential. As a result, the XY CAM cell <b>1100</b> of present embodiments is faster than the conventional XY CAM cell <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. More specifically, because the compare circuit <b>1130</b> employs a single stack pull-down element between the match line and ground potential, the XY CAM cell <b>1100</b> puts less pull-down resistance and less capacitive loading on the match line than the 2-stack pull-down elements employed in the conventional XY CAM cell <b>100</b>, and therefore a CAM array such as CAM array <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can employ more CAM cells <b>1100</b> in each row without degrading performance, as compared to employing conventional CAM cells <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In addition, Applicant notes that the compare circuit <b>1130</b> of XY CAM cell <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> includes only 4 transistors, while the compare circuit <b>420</b> of XY CAM cell <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes 6 transistors. Further, while XY CAM cell <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes two match line pull-down transistors <b>421</b><i>x </i>and <b>421</b><i>y</i>, XY CAM <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> includes only one match line pull-down transistor <b>1133</b>, and therefore XY CAM cell <b>1100</b> will put less capacitive loading on the match line and may consume less power than XY CAM cell <b>400</b>. Further, because compare circuit <b>1130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> includes fewer transistors than compare circuit <b>1030</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, XY CAM cell <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> may have a smaller footprint than XY CAM cell <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">For still other embodiments, pass transistors <b>1131</b>A and <b>1132</b>B can be NMOS transistors, for example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. Thus, the XY CAM cell <b>1101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is similar to the XY CAM cell <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, except that pass transistors <b>1131</b>A and <b>1132</b>B are NMOS transistors, the <o ostyle="single">X</o> and <o ostyle="single">Y</o> connections are reversed (as compared to XY CAM cell <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>), and the comparand signal gating line (CL&#x2022;CLB) of CAM cell <b>1101</b> is replaced with a comparand signal gating line (CL|CLB) that provides a logical NOR combination of the C and <o ostyle="single">C</o> bits. By employing only NMOS transistors, XY CAM cell <b>1101</b> may occupy less silicon area than XY CAM cell <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, for example, because dual-well process technologies are not necessary for the CAM cell compare circuit <b>1130</b>. Compare operations for XY CAM cell <b>1101</b> are similar to those of XY CAM cell <b>1100</b>, except that the comparand line pair CL and CLB of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> are pre-charged to logic low (e.g., towards ground potential) during the pre-charge phase of the compare operation, and then are selectively driven to logic high (e.g., towards VDD) during the evaluation phase of the compare operation. Pre-charging the comparand line pair CL and CLB to logic low rather than to logic high can be advantageous, for example, because this ensures that node Np will always be low.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a block diagram of an XY CAM cell <b>1200</b> according to yet another embodiment. The XY CAM cell <b>1200</b>, which is similar to XY CAM cell <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, is modified to include a second compare circuit <b>1230</b> that allows CAM cell <b>1200</b> to perform two compare operations with the data value stored therein at the same time, or alternatively in a sequential (e.g., staggered) manner. More specifically, the XY CAM cell <b>1200</b> can simultaneously compare the stored data value D with a first comparand bit (C<b>1</b>) provided on a first pair of complementary comparand lines CL<b>1</b>/CL<b>1</b>B and with a second comparand bit (C<b>2</b>) provided on a second pair of complementary comparand lines CL<b>2</b>/CL<b>2</b>B, where the first pair of complementary comparand lines CL<b>1</b>/CL<b>1</b>B provides the first comparand bit C<b>1</b> and its complement <o ostyle="single">C<b>1</b></o> to the first compare circuit <b>1130</b>, and the second pair of complementary comparand lines CL<b>2</b>/CL<b>2</b>B provides the second comparand bit C<b>2</b> and its complement <o ostyle="single">C<b>2</b></o> to the second compare circuit <b>1230</b>. Match conditions between the data value and the first comparand bit C<b>1</b> are provided on a first match line ML<b>1</b> by the first compare circuit <b>1130</b>, and match conditions between the data value and the second comparand bit C<b>2</b> are provided on a second match line ML<b>2</b> by the second compare circuit <b>1230</b>. The comparand signal gating lines CL<b>1</b>&#x2022;CL<b>1</b>B and CL<b>2</b>&#x2022;CL<b>2</b>B provide logical AND combinations of C<b>1</b>&#x2022;C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>&#x2022;C<b>2</b>, respectively, to the corresponding compare circuits <b>1130</b> and <b>1230</b> in a manner similar to that described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The second compare circuit <b>1230</b> includes one NMOS match line pull-down transistor <b>1233</b>, two PMOS pass transistors <b>1231</b>A and <b>1231</b>B, and one NMOS gating transistor <b>1232</b>. The first pass transistor <b>1231</b>A and gating transistor <b>1232</b> form a first selective pull-down circuit that controls the match line pull-down transistor <b>1233</b> to selectively discharge the second match line ML<b>2</b> in response to a comparison between the complemented second comparand bit ( <o ostyle="single">C<b>2</b></o>) provided on CL<b>2</b>B and the <o ostyle="single">Y</o> bit, and the second pass transistor <b>1231</b>B and gating transistor <b>1232</b> form a second selective pull-down circuit that controls the match line pull-down transistor <b>1233</b> to selectively discharge the second match line ML<b>2</b> in response to a comparison between the second comparand bit (C<b>2</b>) provided on CL<b>2</b> and the <o ostyle="single">X</o> bit. Together, first selective pull-down circuit and second selective pull-down circuit form a second match line pull-down control logic <b>1240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">More specifically, the NMOS match line pull-down transistor <b>1233</b> is coupled between the second match line ML<b>2</b> and ground potential, and has a gate coupled to a second pull-down node (Np<b>2</b>) that receives signals from the second match line pull-down control logic <b>1240</b>. For the second match line pull-down control logic <b>1240</b>, the first PMOS pass transistor <b>1231</b>A is coupled between the second pull-down node Np<b>2</b> and second memory cell <b>1020</b> to receive the <o ostyle="single">Y</o> bit, and has a gate to receive the complemented second comparand bit <o ostyle="single">C<b>2</b></o> from CL<b>2</b>B during compare operations. The second PMOS pass transistor <b>1231</b>B is coupled between the second pull-down node Np<b>2</b> and first memory cell <b>1010</b> to receive the <o ostyle="single">X</o> bit, and has a gate to receive the second comparand bit C<b>2</b> from CL<b>2</b> during compare operations. The NMOS gating transistor <b>1232</b> is coupled between the second pull-down node Np<b>2</b> and ground potential, and has a gate coupled to second comparand gating line (CL<b>2</b>&#x2022;CL<b>2</b>B).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Compare operations for XY CAM cell <b>1200</b> are performed in a manner similar to that described above with respect to CAM cell <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, except that XY CAM cell <b>1200</b> can perform two compare operations at the same time (or alternately in a sequential or staggered manner). Thus, during the pre-charge phase of the compare operation, the first and second match lines ML<b>1</b> and ML<b>2</b> are both pre-charged to logic high (e.g., towards VDD) by suitable pre-charge circuits (not shown for simplicity), and the both sets of complementary comparand lines CL<b>1</b>/CL<b>1</b>B and CL<b>2</b>/CL<b>2</b>B are pre-charged to logic high (e.g., towards VDD). In this manner, during the pre-charge phase, the first compare circuit <b>1130</b> isolates the first match line ML<b>1</b> from ground potential, and the second compare circuit <b>1230</b> isolates the second match line ML<b>2</b> from ground potential.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Then, during the evaluation phase of the compare operation, the first comparand bit C<b>1</b> is provided to the XY CAM cell <b>1200</b> in a complementary manner via comparand lines CL<b>1</b> and CL<b>1</b>B, and the second comparand bit C<b>2</b> is provided to the XY CAM cell <b>1200</b> in a complementary manner via comparand lines CL<b>2</b> and CL<b>2</b>B. If a comparand line is driven to logic high, then the corresponding selective pull-down circuit in compare circuits <b>1130</b>/<b>1230</b> is disabled and does not discharge its associated match line ML. Conversely, if a comparand line is driven to logic low, then the corresponding selective pull-down circuit in compare circuits <b>1130</b>/<b>1230</b> is enabled and selectively discharges its associated match line ML in response to the corresponding data bit provided by the associated memory cell. More specifically, if both CL<b>1</b> and CL<b>1</b>B are driven to logic high (e.g., to achieve a column-masking function), then both selective pull-down circuits in compare circuit <b>1130</b> are disabled and together prevent the first match line ML<b>1</b> from discharging, thereby causing the CAM cell <b>1200</b> to indicate a match condition on ML<b>1</b> irrespective of the data value. Similarly, if both CL<b>2</b> and CL<b>2</b>B are driven to logic high (e.g., to achieve a column-masking function), then both selective pull-down circuits in compare circuit <b>1230</b> are disabled and together prevent the second match line ML<b>2</b> from discharging, thereby causing the CAM cell <b>1200</b> to indicate a match condition on ML<b>2</b> irrespective of the data value.</p>
