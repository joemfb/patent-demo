<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,730 describes a generator comprising two plates made of a ferromagnetic material provided with a plurality of arms, the said plates being mounted on a shaft around which an electric coil is wound, the said generator also comprising a movable portion that can be rotated about the said shaft and provided with a permanent magnet comprising several poles. In this generator, the magnet of the movable portion is placed relative to the arms of the said plates in order to establish a magnetic field through the coil and of which the intensity can be varied as a function of the rotation of the said movable portion. The variation of this magnetic field therefore makes it possible to generate at the terminals of the coil an electric power dependent on the speed of variation of the said magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0009">A drawback of this generator is that it is not suitable for being activated by means of an operating member of a remote control, in particular an operating member that can occupy two positions for, for example, controlling the opening or the closure of a switch.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0034">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the electric power-generating device <b>1</b> comprises a first main portion made of a ferromagnetic material comprising a core <b>5</b>, a first pair of branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and a second pair of branches <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. One end of the said branches is fixed to the core <b>5</b>, so as to obtain a magnetic coupling between the said branches and the said core. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, only the upper branches <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> of each pair can be seen. The lower branches <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> of each pair can, for their part, be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> of the first pair of branches are placed relative to the core <b>5</b> in order to form a first magnetic circuit comprising closure ends <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> placed at the free end of the said branches. In the same manner, the branches <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of the second pair of branches are placed relative to the core <b>5</b> in order to form a second magnetic circuit comprising closure ends <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> placed at the free end of the said branches. Therefore, the core <b>5</b> is common to the first and to the second magnetic circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0035">The closure of the first and/or of the second magnetic circuit can be achieved with the aid of permanent magnets by placing them between the closure ends <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of a pair of branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. These permanent magnets form a second main portion of the generating device which is described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0036">When these permanent magnets are polarized in order to create a magnetic field between the closure ends <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of the first and/or of the second magnetic circuit, a magnetic flux flows in the core <b>5</b>. The generation of electricity is therefore achieved by a relative movement of the magnetic circuits relative to these permanent magnets in order to close the first and/or the second magnetic circuit. This relative movement makes it possible to vary the magnetic flux flowing in the core <b>5</b>. A coil <b>21</b> made of copper wound around a plastic carcass placed around the core <b>5</b> makes it possible to gather the electric power obtained by variation of magnetic flux in the core.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0037">The electricity-generating device <b>1</b> therefore comprises a mechanism for movement of a movable portion in order to close the first and/or the second magnetic circuit. In the embodiment shown, this movable portion consists essentially of the first main portion, that is to say the core <b>5</b> and the branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> coupled magnetically to the said core. This movement of the movable portion is, in this instance, a rotation about an axis of rotation <b>20</b> supporting the core <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0038">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the electric power-generating device <b>1</b> comprises the second main portion, mentioned above, the said second main portion comprising a first group of magnets and a second group of magnets in order to close the first and the second magnetic circuit in respectively a first stable position and a second stable position of the movable portion <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. The first group of magnets comprises two permanent magnets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> which are placed so as to close respectively the first and the second magnetic circuit in a first stable position of the movable portion. The permanent magnets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> of this first group of magnets are polarized in order to increase the magnetic flux in the core in the first stable position of the movable portion. In this instance, the permanent magnets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> of the first group of magnets are polarized in the same direction which makes it possible, when the movable portion is in the first stable position, to double the magnetic flux in the core <b>5</b>. The second group of magnets also comprises two permanent magnets <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> which are placed so as to close respectively the first and the second magnetic circuit in a second stable position of the movable portion. The permanent magnets <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> of the second group of magnets are polarized so as not only to increase, but also to reverse, the magnetic flux in the core in the second stable position of the movable portion. In this instance, the permanent magnets <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> of the second group of magnets are polarized in one and the same direction, this direction being opposite to the direction of polarization of the magnets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> of the first group of magnets. This configuration makes it possible, when the movable portion is in the second stable position, to double the magnetic flux in the core <b>5</b> relative to a magnetic flux generated by a single magnet and to reverse this magnetic flux in the core <b>5</b> relative to that obtained in the first stable position of the movable portion. By virtue of this arrangement of the permanent magnets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> of the second main portion, the transition between the first and the second stable position of the movable portion, in one direction or in the other, is accompanied by a reversal of the magnetic flux resulting from a variation in the said flux that is substantially equal to four times the magnetic flux generated by one of the permanent magnets. The quantity of electric power generated in the electric coil <b>21</b> is therefore increased in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0039">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the permanent magnets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> are housed in the openings of a plastic carcass formed by two plates <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>. The coil <b>21</b> and its plastic carcass is inserted between these two plates <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> and placed around the core <b>5</b>. Two sheets <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> made of plastic or another non-magnetic material make it possible to protect the permanent magnets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> and form gap surfaces between the said magnets and the closure ends <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of the branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> forming with the core <b>5</b> the two magnetic circuits described above.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0040">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> of the first pair of branches and the branches <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of the second pair of branches are mounted fixedly on the core <b>5</b> and extend radially in directions substantially opposite to the axis of rotation <b>20</b>. This arrangement of the branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> makes it possible to reduce the space requirement of the generating device, notably its dimensions on an axis parallel to the axis of rotation <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0041">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the upper branches <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> of each pair of branches are formed in a single piece <b>41</b> comprising an opening <b>43</b> making it possible to fit the said piece <b>41</b> into the core <b>5</b>. In the same manner, the lower branches <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> of each pair of branches are formed in a single piece <b>45</b> comprising an opening <b>47</b> making it possible to fit the said piece <b>45</b> into the core <b>5</b>. The pieces <b>41</b>, <b>45</b> can be qualified as paddles. The section of the core <b>5</b> coincides with the shape of the openings <b>43</b>, <b>47</b> in order to make it possible to secure the branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> to the said core. Advantageously, the sections of the core <b>5</b> and of the openings <b>43</b>, <b>47</b> have a break of symmetry of revolution about the axis <b>20</b> so as to ensure a simultaneous rotation of all the branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. The core <b>5</b> and the pieces <b>41</b>, <b>45</b> form the movable portion of the generating device <b>1</b>. The branches of one and the same pair of branches extend in substantially parallel directions and are substantially of the same length so that the closure ends of the said branches are facing one another. In this manner, the first and the second magnetic circuit formed by the core <b>5</b> and respectively the first and the second pair of branches can be closed by inserting a permanent magnet between the closure ends of each pair of branches.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0042">In the embodiment shown, the movable portion consists essentially of the first main portion, that is to say in this instance of the magnetic circuits formed by the branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and the core <b>5</b>. In other embodiments not shown, the movable portion could essentially consist of the second main portion, that is to say of the permanent magnets designed to close the magnetic circuits of the first main portion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0043">In order to move the movable portion between the first and the second stable position, the generating device <b>1</b> comprises a movement mechanism by rotation of the movable portion <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> about the axis of rotation <b>20</b>. The movement mechanism comprises control means and priming and driving means coupled to the said control means in order to establish a priming of the said mechanism. The priming and driving means interact with the movable portion in order to drive it between the first stable position and the second stable position in one direction or in the other.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0044">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the priming and driving means comprise a first flange <b>51</b> and a second flange <b>52</b> mounted so as to rotate about the axis of rotation <b>20</b>. These flanges may also be qualified as coupling flanges. Each flange <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> comprises a circular opening <b>55</b> in order to be fitted onto the core <b>5</b>. The circular shape of the opening <b>55</b> of the flanges <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> allows the said flanges to rotate about the core in one direction or in the other. Each flange <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> comprises a ring <b>64</b> secured to the said flange and placed coaxially about the core <b>5</b>. The edges of the ring <b>64</b> extend in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation. A notch <b>65</b> is arranged on the edges of the ring <b>64</b> of the first and of the second flange <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> in order to receive respectively a driving branch <b>11</b> of the first pair of branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and a driving branch <b>14</b> of the second pair of branches. The first flange <b>51</b> interacts with the driving branch <b>11</b> of the first pair of branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> of the movable portion in order to rotate the said movable portion in a first direction <b>53</b>. The second flange <b>52</b> for its part interacts with the driving branch <b>14</b> of the second pair of branches of the movable portion in order to rotate the said movable portion in a second direction <b>54</b> opposite to the first direction <b>53</b>. More precisely, the first flange <b>51</b> and the second flange <b>52</b> comprise a shoulder <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> formed by one of the edges of the notch <b>65</b> arranged in the ring <b>64</b> of the said flanges, the said shoulder being provided with a bearing face extending parallel to the axis of rotation <b>20</b> and interacting with the edge of the driving branch <b>11</b>, <b>14</b> of respectively the first pair of branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and the second pair of branches <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0045">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the priming and driving means are coupled to the control means in order to establish a priming of the said mechanism. The control means comprise a priming arm <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> mounted securely to each flange <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and extending radially relative to the axis of rotation <b>20</b>. The priming arm <b>71</b> of the first flange <b>51</b> and the priming arm <b>72</b> of the second flange <b>52</b> are designed to rotate respectively the first flange <b>51</b> in the second direction <b>54</b> and the second flange <b>52</b> in the first direction <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0046">The generating device <b>1</b> comprises power-accumulation means interacting with the priming and driving means <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> in order to store the priming power generated by the travel or the movement of the control means <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0047">This priming power is generated during at least one portion of the travel or of the movement of the control means <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>. In this instance, the power-accumulation means comprise a spring <b>81</b> mounted between the priming arms <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> of the first and of the second flange <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0048">The generating device <b>1</b> comprises a lock <b>83</b> interacting with the priming and driving means <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> in order to lock the movable portion <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> during the priming of the movement mechanism and to unlock the said movable portion at the end of travel or of movement of the control means <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>. More precisely, the lock <b>83</b> comprises a lever mounted so as to pivot about a lock spindle <b>85</b> that is parallel and slaved relative to the axis of rotation <b>20</b>, the said lever comprising a first lock arm <b>87</b> and a second lock arm <b>89</b> interacting with an anchoring arm <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> respectively of the first and of the second flange <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>. During the priming, that is to say during at least one portion of the travel or the movement of the priming arm <b>72</b>, <b>71</b> respectively of the second flange <b>52</b> or of the first flange <b>51</b>, the lock <b>83</b> makes it possible to immobilize respectively the first flange <b>51</b> or the second flange <b>52</b>. At the end of travel or of movement of the priming arm <b>72</b>, <b>71</b> respectively of the second flange <b>52</b> or of the first flange <b>51</b>, the lock <b>83</b> makes it possible to release respectively the first flange <b>51</b> or the second flange <b>52</b>. The result of this is that the priming power accumulated by the spring <b>81</b> during the priming is released and that the released flange can drive, by virtue of this power, the movable portion from one stable position to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0049">More precisely, the first and the second lock arm <b>87</b>, each comprise a sliding face <b>101</b> extending from a free end of the said lock arm to the lock spindle <b>85</b>, the said sliding face <b>101</b> interacting with the end of the anchoring arm <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> respectively of the first and of the second flange <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> in order to hold the lock <b>83</b> in a position allowing the anchoring arm <b>92</b>, <b>91</b> respectively of the second or of the first flange <b>52</b>, <b>51</b> to be immobilized. The first and the second lock arm <b>87</b>, <b>89</b> each comprise a notch <b>103</b> placed between the said sliding face <b>101</b> and the lock spindle <b>85</b>, the said notch <b>103</b> interacting with the end of the anchoring arm <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> respectively of the first or of the second flange <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> in order to immobilize the said anchoring arm and to switch the lock <b>83</b> into a position allowing the anchoring arm <b>92</b>, <b>91</b> respectively of the second or of the first flange <b>52</b>, <b>51</b> to be released.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0050">The operation of the generating device <b>1</b> is explained in detail in the following with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. In these figures, the flange <b>51</b> of the generating device has been slightly truncated in order to clearly show the ring <b>64</b> of the said flange <b>51</b> and the shoulder <b>61</b> making it possible to rotate the driving branch <b>11</b>, and therefore the movable portion <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> in the first direction <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0051">Initially, the movable portion <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of the generating device is in a first stable position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this first stable position, the closure ends <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of the branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> are closed by the permanent magnets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> polarized in the same direction. In this manner, the magnetic flux flowing through the core, and therefore the electric coil <b>21</b>, is substantially equal to twice the magnetic flux generated by each magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0052">The priming arm <b>72</b> of the second flange <b>52</b> is initially moved in order to rotate the flange <b>52</b> in the direction <b>53</b>. Only the priming arm <b>72</b> and the anchoring arm <b>92</b> of this second flange <b>52</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. This rotating in the direction <b>53</b> can be achieved by means of an operating member interacting with the priming arms <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0053">This rotation of the second flange <b>52</b> in the direction is not accompanied by a rotation of the movable portion <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. Specifically, the notch arranged in the ring <b>64</b> of the second flange <b>52</b> to receive the driving branch <b>14</b> of the movable portion is wider than the said branch in the same way that the notch arranged in the ring <b>64</b> of the first flange <b>51</b> to receive the driving branch <b>11</b> of the movable portion is wider than the said branch <b>11</b>. Moreover, the shoulder <b>62</b> of the second flange <b>52</b> rests on an edge of the driving branch <b>14</b> allowing only one rotation in a direction <b>54</b> opposite to the direction <b>53</b>. Therefore, the second flange <b>52</b> cannot drive the movable portion in the direction <b>53</b> and the said movable portion therefore remains in the first stable position.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0054">In parallel, the rotation of the second flange <b>52</b> in the direction <b>53</b> is accompanied by the rotation of the anchoring arm <b>92</b> secured to the said flange <b>52</b>. The result of this is that the end of the anchoring arm <b>92</b> slides along the sliding face <b>101</b> of the second locking arm <b>89</b>, which makes it possible to hold the lock <b>83</b> in a position allowing the immobilization of the anchoring arm <b>91</b> of the first flange <b>51</b>. The anchoring arm <b>91</b> of the first flange <b>51</b> is therefore immobilized and the rotation of the said first flange is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0055">Throughout the whole travel of the priming arm <b>72</b> of the second flange <b>52</b> in the direction <b>53</b>, the said priming arm is brought towards the priming arm <b>71</b> of the first flange <b>51</b> and the spring <b>81</b> placed between the ends of the two priming arms is progressively bowed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0056">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at the end of travel of the priming arm <b>72</b>, the end of the anchoring arm <b>92</b> engages in the notch <b>103</b> of the second lock arm <b>89</b>, which makes it possible to immobilize the said lock arm. In parallel, the lock <b>83</b> switches into a position allowing the release of the anchoring arm <b>91</b> of the first flange <b>51</b>. The result of this is that the rotation of the first flange <b>51</b> is no longer hampered and that the spring <b>81</b> will be able to release its energy by rotating the first flange <b>51</b> in the direction <b>53</b>. This rotation of the first flange <b>51</b> in the direction <b>53</b> is accompanied by a sudden rotation of the movable portion <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> in the same direction. Specifically, the shoulder <b>61</b> of the first flange <b>51</b> which is resting on an edge of the driving branch <b>11</b> will make it possible to drive the movable portion into the second stable position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0057">In this second stable position of the movable portion <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, the closure ends <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of the branches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> are closed by the permanent magnets <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> polarized in the same direction but in an opposite direction to the magnets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>. In this manner, the magnetic flux passing through the core, and therefore the electric coil <b>21</b>, is substantially equal to twice the magnetic flux generated by each magnet but is oriented in the opposite direction. Since the electric power generated by the coil <b>21</b> is proportional to the speed of variation of the magnetic flux in the core, this power is thereby increased by virtue of the sudden rotation of the movable portion from the first stable position to the second stable position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0058">The generating device <b>1</b> operates in the same manner for switching from the second stable position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to the first stable position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Therefore, the generating device <b>1</b> is reversible, that is to say that it allows the generation of one and the same quantity of power when the control means <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are controlled in one direction or in the other. It is sufficient in this case to move the priming arm <b>71</b> of the first flange <b>51</b> in order to rotate the said flange <b>51</b> in the direction <b>54</b>. This rotation of the first flange <b>51</b> is accompanied by the rotation of the anchoring arm <b>91</b> secured to the said flange, the end of which slides along the sliding face <b>101</b> of the first lock arm <b>87</b>. The result of this is that the lock <b>83</b> is held in a position allowing the anchoring arm <b>92</b> of the second flange <b>52</b> to be immobilized. Throughout the whole travel of the priming arm <b>71</b> of the first flange <b>51</b> in the direction <b>54</b>, the said priming arm is moved towards the priming arm <b>72</b> of the second flange <b>52</b> and the spring <b>81</b>, placed between the ends of the two priming arms, is progressively bowed. At the end of travel of the priming arm <b>71</b>, the end of the anchoring arm <b>91</b> is engaged in the notch <b>103</b> of the first lock arm <b>87</b>, which makes it possible to immobilize the said anchoring arm. In parallel, the lock <b>83</b> switches into a position allowing the anchoring arm <b>92</b> of the second flange <b>52</b> to be released. The result of this is that the spring <b>81</b> will be able to release its power, rotating the second flange <b>52</b> in the direction <b>54</b>. This rotation of the second flange <b>52</b> in the direction <b>54</b> is accompanied by a sudden rotation of the movable portion <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> in the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0059">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the remote control <b>201</b> makes it possible to remotely control slaved means not shown, in this instance means comprising two control states, such as a switch comprising an open position and a closed position. For this, the remote control <b>201</b> comprises an operating member <b>203</b> making it possible to remotely actuate the slaved means into one or the other of the control states. In order to supply the remote control means with electric power, the remote control <b>201</b> comprises a generating device <b>1</b> as described above, the said device being placed beneath the operating member <b>203</b> as is particularly clearly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As has been described above, the generating device <b>1</b> comprises control means consisting of two priming arms <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>. In the embodiment shown, the control means <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> of the generating device are coupled to the operating member <b>203</b> by two pins <b>205</b>, <b>207</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the pin <b>205</b> rests on the priming arm <b>71</b> in order to rotate it in the direction <b>53</b>. In the same manner, the pin <b>207</b> rests on the priming arm <b>72</b> to rotate it in the opposite direction <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0060">The generating device and the remote control according to the invention therefore make it possible to generate electric power from the movement of the control means or of the operating member coupled to the said control means. The generating device therefore allows a standalone operation of the remote control.</p>
