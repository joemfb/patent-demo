<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Our co-pending application Ser. No. 11/027,647, filed Dec. 30, 2004, and incorporated in its entirety herein by reference, discusses a system of interacting with a virtual representation of a real world product. According to this system, a user can buy a toy such as <b>100</b> which is associated with a special code. The toy <b>100</b> exists in the real world, and the code forms a key to the virtual world <b>110</b>. The user enters the code <b>105</b> on a website and enters the virtual world <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The virtual world <b>110</b> provides activities and views with which the user can interact. The virtual world, as part of the interaction, provides a virtual replica <b>115</b> of the actual toy <b>100</b>. Users can carry out various activities on the website using their virtual version of the toy. For example, the user can form a house with rooms, furniture, things, clothing, and other things. The user can also carry out activities to earn cash, and purchase virtual items using that cash.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present application describes additional aspects, actions and activities and additional structure, for adding to a website of the type described in our co-pending application, and as shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. More specifically, the present application involves a system and method that facilitate an online social networking environment in which users interact such as, for example, by creating pages and content for the pages that relate to their respective characters rather than to personal information about the users.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Unlike conventional online social networking environments which focus on each user's personal information including personal photographs, age, gender, appearance, opinions, interests, location, and the like, the subject application allows users to socially interact by way of their particular characters. This is accomplished in part by the generation or creation of content entirely based on and around the characters' personas and virtual existences rather than the users. Thus, characters can be developed to learn and improve skills and traits and, in general, can interact with one another in a social environment without divulging users' personal information. The following figures demonstrate various aspects and embodiments of the application in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an item <b>100</b> is associated with a code <b>105</b>. The code <b>105</b> can be entered to provide access to a website <b>110</b>. The website displays a virtual replica <b>115</b> that has an appearance that is recognizable as being a similar item to the item <b>100</b>, responsive to the entry of the code <b>105</b>. For example, the item <b>115</b> may be a cartoonized version of the item <b>100</b>. The website <b>110</b> may allow a user to have a room, furniture in the room, and carry out activities in the room. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the user interacts with the website to provide these activities. It should be understood, however, that the aspects described herein are not limited to use with the system described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. These aspects can be used with other kinds of websites. For example, any website that allows user interaction can be used with this system. An embodiment describes social networking using the special website illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the basic structure of the embodiment. A website is formed by a number of page creation processes that each create pages based on data and desired characteristics. A virtual representation of a character <b>200</b> is shown on the website <b>110</b>. The character <b>200</b> as well as other characters <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, are owned by the social networking user, that is, the person who is hosting the social networking part. Each or only some of the characters may have been personalized. According to this embodiment, the characters can be trained. The training of the characters allows them to obtain and/or improve certain characteristics, such as running, etc. The training can be, however, a less formal training, in which simply interacting with the character(s) in a specified way changes the characteristic of the character.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The characters may also compete based on their characteristics. Those characters which are better trained may have the best performance in their trained characteristics. If the competition was solely about their performance as evidenced by the trained characteristics, the character with the best performance would likely win the competition.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Another aspect, however, is the aspect of creating a hybrid event.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The training may allow the user to train many different characteristics&#x2014;agility, track and field, intelligence, fashion, strength, and weight lifting, as well as others. Because of the different kinds of training that can be carried out, some of the characters may be better at some trained items than others. While one character may be better at strength, another character may be better at fashion. One character may be better at swimming, and another may be better at baseball.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to another embodiment, only a certain amount of training per day per activity is allowed, to encourage the users to return to the training site on a regular basis, e.g., every day. In this embodiment, therefore, better trained characters are better competitors. Training is limited to amounts per day, so owners who return to the site more often have better-trained characters that are likely to be more prepared for competition or better or stronger when competing.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Certain kinds of training can unlock new characteristics. For example, the character may not be allowed to swim until it has taken 20 hours of swimming lessons.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An event creator allows forming a competition as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. By executing the &#x201c;form a competition&#x201d; button, a number of different widgets can be displayed. The competition itself can be, for example, a hybrid triathlon formed by the widgets as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Once having selected &#x201c;form a competition&#x201d; at <b>300</b>, the user can select the different skills in the competition to carry out a desired competitive spirit or example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a &#x201c;forming the competition&#x201d; which includes the skills of swim <b>302</b>, run <b>304</b>, and skate <b>306</b>. The competition that is eventually formed will include these three skills.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Other people and their characters can compete in the competition. The competition may also include a &#x201c;scoring mechanism&#x201d; button <b>308</b>, which specifies the kind of scoring that is carried out. A prize can be selected by &#x201c;prize&#x201d; button <b>310</b>. In an embodiment, the website can allow accumulating rewards. Those rewards can be offered as a prize for the competition. For example, the event creator may use some of their virtual cash as a prize item for winning the competition, or just for competing. As an alternative, the user can purchase items, including rare items with their virtual cash, and use those purchased rare items as a prize for winning the competition. If the items are truly hard to find, they may create more of an impetus for the competition.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The user can also charge an entrance fee, for example, as a fee for joining the virtual competition. The entrance fee can be set by the user, who can enter or select a desired value as the entrance fee via a text field, list box, pull-down menu, radio buttons, or any other such data entry object, generally referred to as entrance fee object <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A &#x201c;list box&#x201d; or other suitable form field tool allowing the user to invite friends <b>320</b> can also be provided. In addition, the user can post a general invitation <b>322</b>, for example in certain kinds of chat rooms, or advertise the invitation process. Different options for the general invitation can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">This event creator widget, however, is just one example of a social widget: widgets that can be used to create customized social events of different types. This is a specialized form of social networking, and one that has never been previously suggested by the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to current conventions, social networking is all about &#x201c;me&#x201d;&#x2014;telling the world about things you have done, things you want, etc. However, this version of social networking allows a different form of social networking via events. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the event creator being a social networking vehicle for hybrid events, other style event creation vehicles can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The social network can also be used to find new people to come to the events, and by so doing, facilitates meeting new friends within the social network. As in the above, any of the social network items can be advertised, prizes can be provided, and people can be invited.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an event showcase that can be formed, for example, using one or more of the event creation widgets. The event showcase may be used to provide a special page indicative of the event, as an attempt to get other people to attend the event. In the event showcase of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a house tour is being hosted where the event host is providing a tour of their customized house. Different parts of the tour can be advertised on the event showcase. The event showcase may be separate, for example, from the user's personal page, and can have links <b>405</b> to their personal page. It can also have &#x201c;shout boxes&#x201d; that allow the user to announce their event or its attributes. Here, the shout box <b>410</b> can announce &#x201c;I'm having a house tour&#x201d;. Other shout boxes can analogously be selected. For example, other boxes might include &#x201c;I'm showing off my pet&#x201d;, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, one or a plurality of or all of these shout boxes may be only available with scripted messages to avoid profanities and other undesirable language or content.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A &#x201c;comment wall&#x201d; <b>420</b> is also provided. In this embodiment, the comment may use a virtual representation of one of the owners' virtual items as the talking head associated with the comment. As with other items in the social networking embodiment, the users can show a picture of their virtual representations instead of a picture of them personally.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiment, the event showcase can be built by a user, by taking different items such as the shout box <b>450</b>, and dragging each of those on to the event showcase home page. Each box has a different function, and the user may be allowed to edit some or all of the boxes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The shout box <b>450</b> may allow displaying a number of different messages. The room box <b>452</b> may allow setting characteristics of the site. For example, <b>454</b> is a prize box that can be edited, and may include options for awarding prizes. The prize may be awarded randomly to, for example, the 17th person who attends, or it may be selected as a sweepstakes, or may be done in some other analogous way. Many different analogous controls can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an embodiment, the pages may be formed on a grid as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The grid <b>500</b> forms the basis of a page in the social networking environment. The grid allows determining the placement of objects on the screen, and automatically snaps the inserted objects to the grids. This feature will ensure that layouts will be neater, while still permitting flexibility in design. Note that the page can also include tabs to navigate easily to other associated pages.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The embodiment uses a grid made up of 10px by 10px squares. All elements applied to the grid conform to the size limitations of the grid; with no half-grid pieces, e.g., no 10px by 5px pieces. The engine may add spacing around objects to ensure that a full 10px by 10px square is used.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">While the grid influences placement and alignment of the objects, it still allows control over placement of those objects. On an administrative level, all objects are movable. All pages can be modified through the admin tool. From a user perspective, however, this may not be the case. Objects on the grid will be self-determined; that is, whether an object is movable or editable is a value of the object itself, and something that can be turned on or off by an administrator. So while ultimately all widgets are movable, the ability to move the widget is controlled by the user who makes the page.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A number of tools are also provided for forming the pages.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A Template provides structure for the objects on the page. Templates are used for both system-owned and user-owned pages. Some user-owned pages have the potential to have their templates changed. Templates refer strictly to the layout of the objects on the grid and do not specify any cosmetic features, such as color or font. This may include templates for various &#x2018;canned&#x2019; functions; event pages; triathalon pages, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Themes represent the cosmetic elements of a layout, including font type, font color, background colors, background images, etc. Each object has definable cosmetic features. A theme applies these changes to all of the objects simultaneously. Ultimately, users can be able to create custom themes and adjust cosmetic aspects of the objects themselves on an individual basis, not necessarily within the constraints of a theme.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A widget is a self-contained object that has various adjustable properties. These properties include where the widget exists on the page, its size, cosmetic aspects, and the content to which it is linked. Widgets exist in a display mode and in an edit mode. The widget is accessed in the edit mode, wherein editing of the page by the user is permitted. Edit mode provides customization options for the content of the widget. Cosmetic choices are also available at a later point through a Design toggle associated with the widget.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Editable Layouts provide the user with a medium to design their own layouts for the editable pages. This includes choosing the types of widgets (objects) for the page, their sizes, where they go, and what cosmetic elements are expressed on an individual element basis.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the start page with the &#x201c;stuff&#x201d; bar <b>610</b>, pets <b>620</b>, and &#x201c;things to do&#x201d; bar <b>630</b>. The &#x201c;my page&#x201d; actuation is part of the things to do menu included on the &#x201c;my page&#x201d; actuation shown as <b>600</b>. Operating the &#x201c;my page&#x201d; actuation <b>600</b> brings the operator to the &#x201c;hub&#x201d; screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the hub of the &#x201c;my page&#x201d; actuation. This is the central location that introduces the users to the &#x201c;my page&#x201d; social networking section. Each user has their own hub, which provides the entry point for all users to their personal page(s).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The hub includes both personal information and system information via a push section <b>700</b> which provides the system generated content, and a pull section <b>701</b> which is generated based on the content of the users and their selected best friends or, &#x201c;BFFs&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The push section of the hub includes the featured ad <b>705</b>, &#x201c;cool stuff to check out&#x201d; <b>710</b> which may be the featured items from the system, a &#x201c;search&#x201d; bar <b>715</b> that allows &#x201c;finding other stuff&#x201d;, a &#x201c;menu&#x201d; bar <b>720</b>, and a link to the &#x201c;preferences&#x201d; bar <b>725</b>. Featured items are placed within the push section, e.g., in the &#x201c;cool stuff&#x201d; section <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The pull section <b>701</b> includes the friends list and its management <b>731</b>, a newsfeed <b>735</b> describing actions that the best friends are doing as part of a feed, and a personalized list of upcoming events <b>740</b>. As with other things on the social networking site, everything in the pull section is preferably based only on things that happen on the site. The friends are only site based friends, the newsfeed only includes actions that are occurring on the site, and the events are only events that occur on the site. Each of these is only related to an occurrence that happens on the site, thereby providing no personal information about the users.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The newsfeed content <b>735</b> is determined by selected actions of the user's best friends. The user can select who are their &#x201c;best friends&#x201d; (BFFs), and can also select which activities to track by newsfeed. For example, the selection can include virtual pet adoptions, game high scores, content updates, event creation(s) of friends, virtual pet birthdays, and badges and other awards earned. Note again&#x2014;each of the tracked activities is based on the activities that are occurring on the website, not personal information about the user themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The news items can also link to the specific user's &#x201c;my page&#x201d;, for example, or the more &#x201c;about me&#x201d; page. Each news item preferably expires after a certain time, for example after two weeks.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The menu bar <b>720</b> is a dynamic menu bar that updates depending on whether the user is visiting the hub or visiting their own page or visiting another user's page. The dynamic menu bar includes a home button, a &#x201c;my page&#x201d; button, a &#x201c;more about me&#x201d; button, and a link to &#x201c;my stuff&#x201d;, &#x201c;my creations&#x201d;, and &#x201c;my events&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to an embodiment, the menu bar <b>720</b> changes depending on the viewed locations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> respectively show the menu bars when on your own page; and when visiting another user's page. When on one's own page, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the user gets tabs for &#x201c;my page&#x201d; and links for &#x201c;me&#x201d;. However, when visiting another user's page, this splits into two; to show not only your page, but also the user's page, showing more about the user, the user's &#x201c;stuff&#x201d; etc. In essence, the menu bar becomes dynamic, based on whether it is being used on your own page, or being used on another page.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates how the user can carry out a search to find new friends and items for use on the virtual website. The search can be used for users to find other people to connect with. For example, this may be used for users to find other users who are not already on their friends list.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates how the users can look for events by date, time, type of event, and/or event rating. The users can look for rooms by type of room and room rating. Users can also use the search engine to try and make new friends, based on their favorite pet, favorite game, favorite job, favorite class, and/or favorite posts. The users can also search for virtual items. The search can be by the specific shop selling the item, by category, by item, and/or by rating.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Different searches may provide result pages. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an event result page <b>1000</b>. The results have a user name <b>1002</b>, here &#x201c;USR&#x201d;, a type of event <b>1004</b>, here an &#x201c;Kinzathalon&#x201d; event which may be a selectable triathlon, time <b>1006</b>, and date <b>1008</b>. The user is given the chance to sign up for the event via a signup button <b>1010</b>, or allowed to view the page by a view page button <b>102</b>. The user can also return to the previous search to modify it, by button <b>1020</b>, or to do another search by button <b>1022</b>. The stars shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> are determined by page viewers, e.g., by friends and visitors who rank the room design when they view it. In an embodiment, rooms inherently have no stars until ranked by at least one person. The search functionality looks for rooms ranked at a certain level. So, for example, if the search tool is set to 5 stars, only 5 star rooms will be returned.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A room result may return the page shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. This view shows the user, room name, and lets the user view the room and/or view the page. The room rankings as shown are based on ratings from other members.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a result from the &#x201c;favorite&#x201d; search, returning search results of other people who have desired &#x201c;likes&#x201d; within the virtual world. The search results return people who have the likes and dislikes, as specified in the search.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The results are shown&#x2014;here for possible new friends whose favorite pet is a black cat, favorite game is Wacky Zingoz and favorite job is Mr. Birdy's Assistant. This provides a list of users who have that same information.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows organization of the friends list, and in particular shows how this occurs according to social networking.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The general friends are shown at the left, in field <b>1300</b>. A user can drag any name from the general friends column to different sub columns; including friends/family <b>1305</b>, best friends (BFFs) <b>1310</b>, and casual buddies <b>1315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the embodiment, the number of best friends may be limited to some number, e.g., 20 BFFs. The user obtains information about their best friends as part of the newsfeed <b>735</b> on their homepage.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The different groups as organized into columns help determine access for various levels on the homepage. In essence, the groups stand organized in series of circles. The friends/family <b>1305</b> may be the innermost circle, then your best friends <b>1310</b>, then your casual buddies <b>1315</b>, and then random friends. This circle can be used as part of the privacy setting. For example, a user can set their visibility to best friends. This will allow visibility to both family and best friends. If the circle is also set to gaming and trading, then family, best friends and gaming and trading will all be included.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates the privacy setting capability. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the user selects to whom their page is visible, to whom the &#x201c;about me&#x201d; is visible, as well as who else can view their &#x201c;my stuff,&#x201d; &#x201c;my creations,&#x201d; and &#x201c;my events.&#x201d; The circle organization allows a user to set their page to be invisible to one group of people, but visible to all classes below that one group of people. All of this is available in a drop-down menu. Another aspect shown as <b>1350</b> provides information to the friends about when different things occur. For example, this allows you to let your friends know when you adopt a pet, get a high score, earn a badge, or when your pets have a birthday. This may be done for all pets or only for some pets. The &#x201c;my page plus&#x201d; may be additional information that may be available only after parents have visited the parents area.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, viewability or access to a user's pages can be limited to
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0076">Family only&#x2014;only friends labeled as Family can see the page;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0077">BFFs&#x2014;only friends labeled as Family and BFF can see the page;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0078">Trading/Gaming buddies&#x2014;only friends labeled as Family, BFF and Trading/Gaming buddies can see the page;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0079">All friends&#x2014;all friends on the friends list can see the page;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0080">Everyone&#x2014;everyone in the entire virtual world can see the page;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0081">Just Me&#x2014;no one, other than the owner of the page, can see the page.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates the view mode for the &#x201c;my page&#x201d; creator. Any of the items including shout boxes, comment boxes, room design boxes, collection boxes wish list, or any other, can all be formed by widgets.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0083">The different widgets can be created within a template, or can be dynamically placed in locations on the page as desired. When in edit mode, any of the different widgets can be selected. A widget can be edited to change its content.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0084">The widget can be removed from edit mode and returned to view mode in which the widget can be viewed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0085">A tagline <b>1501</b> provides a desired phrase on the page. This can be a drop down interface allowing users to select content from a pool of available taglines, e.g., &#x2018;canned&#x2019; lines, random lines and semi-personalized lines that are filled in with site information. Taglines will not divulge personal information of any sort, but rather use content obtained through activity on the site and through pets and feature codes.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0086">The status widget <b>1505</b> tells the location and/or status of the user. This may allow selection of that information from a number of different possible pull-down menus. The status widget can tell a status that the user chooses to display, such as &#x201c;playing in the arcade&#x201d;. The user may also control this to indicate different things about what the user is doing.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0087">A pet widget <b>1515</b> allows viewing the pet in a number of different modes, corresponding to different view modes for the pet. The pet's name may be integrated into the tag line.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0088">The room widget <b>1520</b> shows the user's room. Pets or other items can also be selected. The user can also select their favorite item on a &#x201c;favorite&#x201d; widget. The user can select their mood from a number of different moods on the mood widget <b>1510</b>. The default mood may be happy, but the user can select other moods. The user can also select a &#x201c;welcome&#x201d; widget that displays a welcome message. An item widget may display a featured item or other similar item. An &#x201c;event&#x201d; widget can advertise an event. A &#x201c;shout box&#x201d; widget allows displaying one of several different messages. An &#x201c;add a comment&#x201d; widget allows different people to leave comments about the site or the user. An &#x201c;add-to-friends&#x201d; widget allows the user to add people to their friends list. A &#x201c;badges&#x201d; widget allows showing the different badges that the user has. The user can also have an &#x201c;other pets&#x201d; widgets to show the other pets they have. A &#x201c;member since&#x201d; widget can be used to show how long the user has been a member. A &#x201c;number of pets&#x201d; widget can show how many pets the user has. The &#x201c;pets favorites&#x201d; widget can show the pets favorite food and the &#x201c;pets birthday&#x201d; widget can show the birthday. A &#x201c;high score&#x201d; widget can show the user's highest score. A &#x201c;banner&#x201d; widget may show more about the user via a banner message. Other widgets are also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0089">Again, this is unlike other social networking sites in that rather than showing off the user's personal information about themselves personally, this system shows off the virtual room or information and not your own (i.e., the user's) personal room or information. This system allows searching of information about virtual representations who are citizens of Webkinz World, such as the virtual representation's favorite game or favorite job, for example, that would allow identification of, or contact to be established with the user's virtual persona on the site, rather than the user him or her self. Social networking sites like Facebook&#xae; require information about yourself. The present system has no real personal information, only virtual information. In this system, unexpectedly, you show your room&#x2014;again, unlike Facebook&#xae;, this is the room that you created during the rest of your site activities and hence this, not your personal information, is what you show to others. Facebook&#xae; requires you to enter information about your own activities, but the present system allows you to create the content of the website.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0090">Special days may also be defined; e.g., triathlon day, showing off your room day, or other events or occasions. Unlike providing personal information about yourself, this system is all about the virtual world. The safeguard is inherent because this is all about the site, and all the information comes from the site. This provides users with a greater ability to express themselves and create online identities in a controlled, secure environment. It extends the social networking aspect of the site; letting users browse profiles and discover new friends, though without exposing personally identifiable information. For instance, the invite function provides the ability to allow the virtual representation belonging to the user to meet new virtual representations belonging to other people.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0091">The content on these networks may be, as previously described, a variable depending on a time and date and other parameters. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> illustrate section schedulers that allow defining templates and layouts for the hub sections described above. These layouts can be defined along with timing for the layouts and content to be associated with the layouts. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> illustrate how a hub scheduler can operate. A schedule can be created for either a template for use as a theme. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows the template creator, which can create a template for displaying different kinds of content. In these embodiments, the items created by the schedulers can be created by system administrators, for example. The embodiments describe these templates as having been created by system administrators. However, it should be understood that other users may be able to create templates in an analogous way. In addition, while the specification describes creation of templates, it also contemplates the use of these templates.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0092">The button <b>1600</b> can be used to create a new schedule. For example, the new schedule may be shown with a start time for the content <b>602</b> and an end time for the content <b>1604</b>. The template may also be created to have a name shown in <b>1606</b>, which can represent the subject matter of the template, and can signal what the template will look like to the user of the template.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0093">In a similar way, the theme scheduler shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> allows creating a new schedule <b>1610</b>, with a theme name, a start time, and an end time. The scheduler also allows editing the content, e.g., changing the template using edit buttons such as <b>1608</b>. A schedule and/or template or theme can be removed using the remove button <b>1609</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0094">An advantage of the intervals is that seasonal changes can be made to the look and feel of the hub or homepage for a set duration. The duration can be set and automatically executed. For example, the duration might be during the Christmas season (December 1-26<sup>th</sup>). These seasonal contents can be automatically changed, for example, as necessary. For example, they can be automatically changed once a month, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0095">The templates may include a first template category that displays dynamically generated widget content. A second template category displays dynamically generated advertising content.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a scheduled template which has dynamic widget content. There may be different templates offered, where the template shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> may be the default template. The default template may be automatically used for the hub portion of the social networking in the absence of a scheduled template.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0097">Dynamic widget content may automatically be drawn and displayed in areas <b>1750</b> and others. The dynamic widget content may be drawn from a pool of user widgets. For example, highly rated room and item collections may be featured on the user's front page or hub page. This default template may be selected to be an ad template by button <b>1702</b>, or a &#x2018;member of the day&#x2019; template by <b>1704</b>. Different categories can then automatically be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0098">The template may display rooms belonging to others in section <b>1722</b>, and items of others in <b>1725</b>. For example, the user can set the minimum star rating <b>1706</b> for rooms and items. The user can set 4 stars as a minimum star rating that will set the minimum rating before dynamic content will be displayed. When the value is set to 4 stars, for example, only four or five star rooms or item collections will be displayed. The rotation interval <b>1708</b> sets how often dynamic content is changed. The template itself then displays the different features that are selected therein including the user's best friends, news (dynamic), and events (also dynamic). The system allows changing characteristics of the layout, and a preview part <b>1700</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> actually shows the basic preview of the template layout <b>1701</b> on the left part of the screen as it is being laid out.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0099">Other templates can produce other kinds of pages.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0100">The locations of the ad <b>1721</b>, rooms <b>1722</b>, and item collections <b>1723</b> can all be rearranged. In one embodiment, for example, there may be a member of the day section that is placed in the area <b>1721</b>. Ads may be set by dynamically populating them from an available pool of ads, for example in some kind of round-robin technique.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0101">The rotation determines how frequently the content shifts. The system can determine other characteristics. It can determine how many ads are displayed, sizes of the ads, and other parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0102">The scheduled items can also define start time and end time. The start time <b>1730</b> indicates when the theme is first applied. The end time <b>1732</b> defines when the theme ends. Once the item is saved, it is automatically placed in the scheduler.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0103">Templates, once created, can be selected from the template list shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. For example, this list allows creating a new template by using the add button <b>1801</b>, editing, previewing, or deleting templates. The populated list <b>1810</b> may include a scrollable list for example that allows different templates to be viewed. Each template has a name, and a tier <b>1812</b>. For example, the different tiers are shown in the list of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0104">The feature code tier refers to templates that are unlocked through feature codes. These templates can only be used by a user who has entered a specified feature code. In this embodiment, the user obtains a feature code either from buying a product, or in some other way. Once the feature code is entered, it unlocks a specified template, such as the template shown as the event showcase <b>1813</b>. Another embodiment allows these templates to be directly related to the amount of activity a user does on the site. Users who have played more and/or have more pets, will have more options for customizing their site. In addition to the templates being customizable, the elements within the widgets themselves can also be restricted either by feature code, or activity on the site.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0105">A tier called &#x201c;everyone&#x201d; refers to templates that are available to all users. The tier entitled &#x201c;system&#x201d; refers to tiers that are only available to administrative users.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0106">A template can be created using the &#x2018;create a template&#x2019; button <b>1801</b> that brings out the designer templates shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. This allows building templates in a flash interface using a palette of widgets and drag-and-drop portions that can be dropped onto the preview box <b>1900</b>. A widget list <b>1905</b> may be a scrollable list that has a number of different widgets such as room widgets, and the like. The designer templates may be used only by system administrators or by users. A tier for the template <b>1910</b> may also be set.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0107">A number of different widget editors may be used in a similar way. A type <b>1</b> widget editor is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. The type <b>1</b> widget editor allows editing/adding all of the widgets that can include textual elements as well as graphic elements, but does not include content categories. For example, the widget can be selected from the drop-down menu <b>2010</b>. The widget can be, for example, a tagline widget, a status widget, shout box, welcome box, mood, banner, events, high score, or badges widget. Content can then be edited to the selected widget. For example, textual elements are accessed by one set of navigation arrows; graphic elements are accessed by another set of navigation arrows. If the text element is selected, a text box <b>2012</b> is also provided. This also allows setting the different texts that can be displayed with the widget. As in the above example, tiers for the widgets can also be set.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0108">The tiers include the everyone tier; the feature code tier; and others as described above. In addition, however, unlock tiers may also be provided. An unlock tier does not allow a user to use the tier until they have reached a certain criteria, for example until they hit the value <b>600</b> on the Wacky Zingoz game.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a type <b>2</b> widget editor. This involves all of the widgets that have a category specification, followed by content that is specific to that category. For example, the categories shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> include the bathroom, kitchen, and living room categories. Images can also be added and removed. When an image is added, a category <b>2121</b> is associated with that image. Categories must be selected so that they are classified correctly. For example, job-related images might have their category set as &#x201c;favorite jobs&#x201d; so that those images only appear when the user selects &#x201c;the favorite jobs category&#x201d;. The rooms category may be associated with a room.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0110">A comment editor allows adding a comment into, for example, the text box as <b>2140</b>. For example, this may allow adding a comment that is associated with a category. For the rooms category, comments may include comments such as &#x201c;you have amazing rooms&#x201d; or &#x201c;you're a five-star designer&#x201d; or &#x201c;I love your rooms&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0111">The ad management section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> allows administration of the ads that will be appearing in the push section of the site. This includes an ad name <b>2200</b>, as well as link and view information. It also includes start and end times <b>2202</b> and <b>2204</b>. The start time sets the exact time that the ad is put into circulation. The end time sets the time that the ad is removed from circulation.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0112">In an analogous way to the above, the themes can be uploaded, commented, and they are accessibility and degree of access can be set.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0113">The general structure and techniques, and more specific embodiments which can be used to effect different ways of carrying out the more general goals are described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0114">Although only a few embodiments have been disclosed in detail above, other embodiments are possible and the inventors intend these to be encompassed within this specification. The specification describes specific examples to accomplish a more general goal that may be accomplished in another way. This disclosure is intended to be exemplary, and the claims are intended to cover any modification or alternative which might be predictable to a person having ordinary skill in the art. For example, while the above describes certain kinds of widgets, it should be understood that other widgets can similarly be used. Moreover, this can be used on other styles and kinds of websites.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0115">Also, the inventors intend that only those claims which use the words &#x201c;means for&#x201d; are intended to be interpreted under 35 USC 112, sixth paragraph.
