<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to holders for CAD/CAM blanks for use in CAD/CAM systems, and more particularly to holders used in dental CAD/CAM systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the discussion that follows, reference is made to certain structures and/or methods. However, the following references should not be construed as an admission that these structures and/or methods constitute prior art. Applicant expressly reserves the right to demonstrate that such structures and/or methods do not qualify as prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Today, there is a progressively increasing trend in dentistry toward the use of automated technologies for treatment planning, virtual procedures, orthodontics, design and manufacturing of dental restorations both in dental offices (chair side) and dental laboratories (lab side). This trend, sometimes called &#x201c;digital revolution,&#x201d; is most evident in lab side explosion of CAD/CAM technologies. A number of CAD/CAM systems available to dental laboratories has increased nearly ten-fold in the last decade. Currently, there are over 25 dental CAD/CAM systems and quite a few copy-milling systems using mill blanks in a variety of shapes and sizes. Blank shapes vary from simple geometries such as rectangular, cylindrical or hexagonal to more complex such as smart blanks described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,979,496 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Their sizes range from about 0.5&#x2033; to about 4&#x2033; in length or diameter. Mill blanks are available in all 4 types of materials&#x2014;metals, polymers (resins, plastics), ceramics and composites. Ceramic mill blanks can be divided into three major categories: feldspathic (leucite-based and sanidine or feldspar-based), glass-ceramic (lithium silicate, micaceous, etc.), and crystalline ceramic based such as alumina and/or zirconia (soft-sintered or fully dense). All three ceramic categories as well as composite blanks are already available or soon will be available in a variety of shades. Stocking the necessary inventory of shades for each given type of blank adds to economic pressures on the facility operating a CAD/CAM system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While CAD/CAM technology provides dental laboratories with opportunities for improved quality, reproducibility and elimination of human error, most CAD/CAM systems are geared to milling soft-sintered zirconia and thus lacking material selection to be competitive in a supersaturated and fast-paced market. Since the price for a CAD/CAM system, depending on manufacturer and configuration, runs from $50,000 to $500,000 only the largest labs and outsource centers can afford to operate multiple systems to expand their material selection. Most CAD/CAM systems manufacturers do not make their own blocks, rather they purchase them from suppliers such as Ivoclar, Vita or Metoxit, with an established core competency in dental or advanced materials development and manufacturing. Understandably, CAD/CAM materials are fairly expensive adding substantially to CAD/CAM system operating costs. For example, the price of ceramic milling blanks range from about $0.60 to $4.50 per gram of material. Yield per blank as defined in U.S. Pat. No. 6,979,496 is fairly low and most of it goes to waste.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first CAD/CAM systems comprising milling units for chair side or lab side use such as Cerec (Sirona) and Lava (3M/ESPE) were closed systems wherein mill blanks are attached to a stub retainer, projection, mandrel, holder or carrier body, which have a unique patented geometry as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,485,305 and 6,769,912 and can be also protected by a bar-code, thereby preventing interchangeability with other (CAD/CAM) systems. Variations of a work piece (millable part) on a stub assembly are also described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,214,435, 6,669,875, 6,627,327, 6,482,284, 6,224,371, 6,991,853 and 6,660,400, which are hereby incorporated by reference. With advent of the open architecture systems, blank interchangeability between systems has become not only possible but extremely desirable. While the market is currently dominated by closed systems, the market penetration of open systems is steadily increasing. From 25 commercial CAD/CAM systems at least 5 or 6 are utilizing the same D-250 dental 3D scanner and DentalDesigner&#x2122; dental CAD software (3Shape A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). In an open architecture system, the blanks are not bar-code protected and any blank can be used as long as it fits the existing housing (blank holder, chuck, collect, support) of the milling unit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a need exists in the art for enabling blank and holder interchangeability, maximizing yield per blank, and reducing material waste, to maximize the system's versatility, selection of materials and efficiency of operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the present invention is described herein mainly with reference to machining dental prostheses, it should be understood that the present invention is not so limited. For example, the principles of the present invention can be applied to medical devices in general (e.g., implants, replacement joint parts, skeletal replacements, etc.) According to its broader aspects, the present invention can apply to the milling or shaping of essentially any three-dimensional object.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is a primary object of an embodiment of the present invention to provide a holder for affixing a mill blank for the manufacture of a dental article in a housing of a milling unit of a CAD/CAM system, wherein the holder includes a joining surface for joining to the mill blank, a securing shaft connected to the joining surface at its upper end, the securing shaft having a series of lateral surfaces and a bottom surface. The securing shaft includes at least one securing surface for securing to a housing of a milling unit of a CAD/CAM system, wherein the securing surface, in cross-sectional view, extends substantially perpendicular to a radius of the securing shaft extending essentially through the center of the securing surface and comprises a width that is less than the width of a lateral surface. The securing shaft, in cross-sectional view, comprises an essentially polygonal shape with at least two lateral surfaces, wherein at least two of the lateral surfaces are arranged adjacent to each other and extend at right angles to each other. The extension of the radius, which extends through the center of the securing surface, extends through the corner of one of the right angles. The securing surface may exhibit a width in the range of from about 0.3 to about 0.6 the length of a lateral surface. The width of the securing surface may be less than about 0.5 the width of a lateral surface. Moreover, the width of the securing surface may be about (&#x221a;2&#x2212;1) (approximately 0.4142) the width of a lateral surface not adjacent to the securing surface. Alternatively, the width of the securing surface may be approximately the same width of a lateral surface positioned between two securing surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the holder, in cross-sectional view, the securing shaft has a ratio of length to width of approximately 1:1. A transition between adjacent lateral surfaces is formed by the at least one securing surface which extends transversely to both adjacent lateral surfaces at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. The minimum distance between the securing surface and the axis of the securing shaft may be approximately the same as the minimum distance between a lateral surface and the axis of the securing shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a further aspect of the holder, the width of the securing surface is approximately one-third the width of a lateral surface. A line perpendicular to the middle of the width of the securing surface passes through the axis of the securing shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to yet another aspect of the holder, the securing surface extends parallel to the holder axis and is smaller than at least one lateral surface when viewed in the peripheral direction. The securing surface comprises a bevel extending substantially at an angle of 135 degrees from the at least one securing surface, although the position of the bevel is not limited to this angle and it may be positioned at any angle that provides ease of movement of the holder in a housing of a milling unit of a CAD/CAM system. The securing shaft may exhibit a height that is less than the height of the holder and the securing surface may exhibit a height of more than one-half the height of the holder.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a further aspect of the holder, the joining surface may be square-shaped and is passed through by the holder axis. The joining surface may include a flange or platform located at an end of the securing shaft, the flange or platform projecting radially over the securing shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to yet another aspect of the holder, the height of the holder is greater than the distance between opposing lateral surfaces. The holder includes a bottom surface opposing the joining surface, the bottom surface extending substantially parallel to the joining surface for positioning onto a housing of a milling unit of a CAD/CAM system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a further aspect of the holder, the at least one securing surface comprises a first and a second securing surface, the first securing surface and the second securing surface each comprising a bevel, wherein the lateral surfaces of the securing shaft, when viewed in cross-section, are largest in width when the bevels of the first and second securing surfaces are disposed one after the other in the securing shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to yet another aspect of the holder, the mill blank attachable to the holder is rectangular in cross-section and projects over the cross-section of the securing shaft on all sides. The height of the milling blank, viewed from the axial direction, substantially corresponds to the total height of the securing shaft. The mill blank may be mechanically fastened, adhesively secured, or integrally attached to the holder. The mill blank may be fabricated of ceramic, polymer, composite, metal, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to still a further aspect, the holder is directly attachable to the housing of a milling unit of a CAD/CAM system or attachable to at least one intermediate piece that is attachable to the housing of a milling unit of a CAD/CAM system. The holder is preferably secured to clamping hardware, the clamping hardware directly attachable to the housing of a milling unit or to an adapter attachable to the housing of a milling unit of a CAD/CAM system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another aspect of the holder, the at least one securing surface is configured for securing to the clamping hardware by a mechanical component, by interference fit or by snap fit. The mechanical component may have a diameter that substantially corresponds to the diameter of the at least one securing surface. Optionally, the at least one securing surface may include at least one notch or undercut configured for form-fit connection with the clamping hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a further aspect, the holder may be used in any type of CAD/CAM system including, but not limited to, 5-axis or 6-axis milling machines. The holder may be fabricated of a metal, resin, ceramic material or a combination thereof. Examples of three-dimensional objects for manufacturing herein include, but are not limited to, dental articles, such as, a coping, pontic, framework, denture teeth, space maintainer, tooth replacement appliance, orthodontic retainer, denture, post, facet, splint, cylinder, pin, connector, crown, partial crown, veneer, onlay, inlay, bridge, fixed partial denture, implant or abutment.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Securing surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> extend substantially perpendicular to a radius of diameter <b>40</b> extending through the center of the securing surface <b>26</b> or <b>28</b>, which extends through the axis of the securing shaft to a corner of a right angle <b>32</b> or <b>34</b>, respectively. It is preferable that securing surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> extend substantially parallel to the axis <b>41</b> of the securing shaft <b>16</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. It is further preferable that the length and the width of shaft <b>16</b> is substantially similar, as viewed form the cross-sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, i.e., the ratio between the length and width is approximately 1:1, although this is not a limitation of the width and length of shaft <b>16</b>, which can be any length and width. The width of securing surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> is preferably less than the width of a lateral surface, and more preferably about one-third to about one-half the width of a lateral surface. When viewing the securing surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> from a peripheral direction, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, is it preferred that the securing surfaces are smaller than at least one lateral surface, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> or <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The angle at which the securing surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> make with adjacent lateral surfaces is approximately 45 degrees, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, although the angle at which the securing surfaces make with lateral surfaces is not limited to a specific angle.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Joining surface <b>14</b> may be any shape, including polygonal, circular, oval or oblong. Preferably, joining surface <b>14</b> is square-shaped to easily accommodate the cross-sectional rectangular or square shape of a mill blank. Mill blanks are not limited to rectangular and square shapes and may be provided in other polygonal, circular, oval or oblong shapes and/or complex near-net shapes. The mill blank may fit within the area of joining surface <b>14</b> or extend over one or more edges, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The mill blank may be similar or different in height with respect to holder <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows mill blank <b>12</b> with a height similar to the height of holder <b>10</b>. The mill blank may be fabricated of a metal, resin, ceramic material, or a combination thereof. Dental articles that may be milled from the mill blank include, but are not limited to, a coping, pontic, framework, denture teeth, space maintainer, tooth replacement appliance, orthodontic retainer, denture, post, facet, splint, cylinder, pin, connector, crown, partial crown, veneer, onlay, inlay, bridge, fixed partial denture, implant or abutment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 11</figref>, which show CAD/CAM housing assemblies <b>50</b> and <b>50</b>&#x2032;, respectively. Like parts are named with the same reference numbers, whereas different parts for the same purpose are distinguished by an apostrophe symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Holder <b>10</b> can be inserted into a housing of a milling unit directly, or may be inserted into intermediate parts, which are then inserted into a housing of a milling unit. Typically, holder <b>10</b> will be inserted into and secured to a clamping hardware such as clamping chuck <b>36</b>.

If a clamping component is used, it is preferable that the diameter of the clamping component have a diameter similar to the width of securing surfaces <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. Holder <b>10</b> may also be secured to chuck <b>36</b> by interference or press fit. Securing surfaces <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may be further configured to press fit into chuck <b>36</b>. Configurations include, but are not limited to a notch, an undercut or other surface, such as that shown in U.S. Publication 20090075238, which is hereby incorporated by reference, that is configured for snap, press or interference fit into chuck <b>36</b></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Clamping chuck <b>36</b> may be inserted into a housing of a milling unit directly or may be attached to an adapter <b>52</b> or <b>52</b>&#x2032;, which is then inserted into a housing or pallet <b>54</b> or <b>54</b>&#x2032; of a milling unit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 12</figref> showed the assembled housing configurations, <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>&#x2032;.</p>

A sensor on the milling machine reads the RFID tag to determine the material on pallet <b>54</b>&#x2032; prior to the milling operation. A database linked to the milling machine associates a specific CAM file to the block of material and the machine mills the block in accordance with the CAM file.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When a new block is added to the holder and pallet, the information regarding the properties of the block of material may be input by an operator by the use of a barcode type scanner. The RFID tag <b>58</b>&#x2032; is scanned and the control panel is programmed to erase the prior information associated with the previous block of material. The new material information is then entered into the control panel. A database stores the information about the block of material on pallet <b>54</b>&#x2032;. When a new case is ready to be milled, the CAM file associated with the block on pallet <b>54</b>&#x2032; is utilized to mill the block accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Securing shaft <b>16</b> provides a facile means to secure holder <b>10</b> into a housing of a milling unit of a CAD/CAM system. It is adaptable to fit into many different types of CAD/CAM systems with the use of an adapter or similar component.</p>
