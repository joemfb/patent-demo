<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 371 U.S. National Stage of International Application No. PCT/EP2008/004011, filed May 20, 2008. This application claims priority to German Patent Application No. DE 10 2007 032 652.3, filed Jul. 13, 2007, and Application No. DE 10 2007 041 934.3, filed Sep. 4, 2007, the disclosures of which applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a reciprocating piston engine according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Reciprocating piston engines of the type mentioned here are known. They serve in particular as refrigerant compressors for regulating the passenger compartment temperature in motor vehicles. Reciprocating piston engines of this type have at least one piston supported in a moveable manner in a cylinder bore, which piston is set in motion via a pivot element that is swivel-mounted on the drive shaft of the reciprocating piston engine, which element is arranged in a drive chamber. The pivot element is connected to a guide body guided axially on the drive shaft of the reciprocating piston engine as well as also via a driving pin to the drive shaft. With a known reciprocating piston engine it is furthermore provided that spring forces of at least one return spring act on the pivot element. The spring forces thereby act in the direction of a starting position of the pivot element in which it is pivoted at a starting pivot angle to a plane on which the rotation axis of the drive shaft stands upright. The pivot element of the refrigerant compressor, which is preferably embodied without a coupling and thus permanently runs with the drive shaft of a motor vehicle, must have a speed-dependent minimum starting pivot angle so that the pivot element can pivot out at any time when the refrigerant compressor needs to provide a specific cooling capacity. In order to achieve a broad spread of the controlling range of the compressor depending on the drive chamber pressure change, the return spring must have the highest possible spring rigidity. However, it has been shown with the known reciprocating piston engines that a high spring rigidity of the return spring is an impediment to the easy pivoting of the pivot element.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The object of the invention is therefore to create a reciprocating piston engine that does not exhibit the above-referenced disadvantage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To attain this object, a reciprocating piston engine is proposed which has the features referenced in claim <b>1</b>. It is characterized in that at least one further spring element is provided, which acts on the return spring with a preload when the pivot element is in its starting position. This advantageous embodiment makes it possible for the pivot element, preferably embodied as a pivot ring, to pivot out easily and unimpeded when the reciprocating piston engine, such as, for example, a refrigerant compressor, which is referred to below as the RC, for a motor vehicle, is switched on. Vibrations during the start-up of the pivot element or start-up delays are thus virtually ruled out.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A reciprocating piston engine is particularly preferred which is characterized in that the at least one further spring element is a curved disk. The further spring element thereby preferably has a lower spring rigidity than the return spring so that the pivot element starts particularly easily and a spring force characteristic curve results that merges from a flat characteristic curve into a steeper linear spring characteristic curve. A progressive spring force path is thereby created, wherein the pivot element must overcome a low spring force at the start of the reciprocating piston engine.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore a reciprocating piston engine is preferred that is characterized in that the return spring and the at least one further spring element are arranged between the guide body and the shaft of the reciprocating piston engine. This produces a particularly compact embodiment of the reciprocating piston engine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A reciprocating piston engine is also preferred in which the return spring is embodied as a coil spring.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore a reciprocating piston engine is preferred that is characterized in that at least one stop element is provided, which sets the starting pivot angle of the pivot element. The stop element is preferably a spring assembly or at least one belleville spring, but other spring elements can also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With a further preferred reciprocating piston engine, the return spring has a lower spring rigidity than the stop element. This ensures in particular that the return spring does not pivot the pivot element against the force of the stop element into a pivot angle position that has a smaller pivot angle than the starting pivot angle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Finally, a reciprocating piston engine is preferred that is characterized in that the at least one further spring element is arranged in series to the return spring. Preferably, it is also provided that, with an increasing pivot angle, the at least one further spring element together with the return spring produces a progressive spring characteristic curve with low starting spring force which reflects the advantageous starting properties of the reciprocating piston engine proposed here.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an assembly of a reciprocating piston engine with a pivot element <b>1</b>, a shaft <b>3</b> and a guide body <b>5</b> embodied here as a guide sleeve by way of example. The pivot element <b>1</b> is here embodied as a pivot ring, however, the embodiment as a pivot plate or swash plate is also conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The pivot element <b>1</b> is connected to the shaft <b>3</b> via a driving pin <b>7</b>. The upper, that is, radially outer, end of the driving pin <b>7</b> catches in a recess <b>9</b> in the pivot ring <b>1</b>, wherein the pivot element <b>1</b> is connected in a hinged manner to the driving pin <b>7</b> and can pivot around it.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The pivot element <b>1</b> is additionally connected to the guide body <b>5</b> via bearing sleeves <b>11</b> and pins (not discernible here) arranged therein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The driving pin <b>7</b> attached to the shaft <b>3</b> engages through a longitudinal slot <b>13</b> of the guide body <b>5</b>, so that it is rotated with a rotation of the shaft <b>3</b> together with the pivot element <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As already stated, the guide body <b>5</b> is supported on the shaft <b>3</b> in an axially displaceable manner. The maximum displacement of the guide body <b>5</b> on the shaft <b>3</b> is determined by the ends of the longitudinal slot <b>13</b> of the guide body <b>5</b>, which interact with the driving pin <b>7</b> with a maximum displacement of the guide body <b>5</b>. The guide body <b>5</b> is embodied here as a guide sleeve, however, other embodiments of the guide body are also conceivable in order to realize the functionality discernible from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The shaft <b>3</b> is preferably connected without a coupling, preferably via a belt drive to the drive shaft of an internal combustion engine, for example, of a motor vehicle and is thus dependent at all times on the speed thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is arranged in a drive chamber (not shown here) of a reciprocating piston engine.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pivot angle &#x3b1; of the pivot element <b>1</b>, that is, the angle about which the pivot element <b>1</b> is pivoted with respect to a plane on which the rotation axis of the shaft <b>3</b> stands upright, is influenced on the one hand via the compressive forces acting in the drive chamber as well as via inertia forces and spring forces. The decisive factor above all is thereby the relative pressure between the pressure on the drive chamber side of the at least one piston (not shown here) and the suction side pressure of the reciprocating piston engine prevailing on the opposite side of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The regulation of the pressure conditions between the pressure on the drive chamber side and the pressure on the suction side of the piston is preferably carried out via a control valve. The higher the pressure is adjusted on the drive chamber side relative to the pressure on the suction side of the piston, the smaller the stroke width of the piston and thus the pump performance of the reciprocating piston engine.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Based on the influences described above, during the rotation of the shaft <b>3</b>, the pivot element <b>1</b> performs a pivot movement with a variable pivot angle &#x3b1; relative to the plane E, from which an axial movement of the at least one piston and the guide body <b>5</b> results. The mode of operation of a reciprocating piston engine is otherwise adequately known so that we do not need to go into further detail here.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a simplified sectional representation of the assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Identical parts are provided with identical reference numbers, so that in this respect we refer you to the description for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pivot element <b>1</b> and the guide body <b>5</b>, which are connected to one another via the bearing sleeves <b>11</b> (not shown here) and the pins arranged therein, are discernible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The shaft <b>3</b> is also discernible, to which the pivot element <b>1</b> is coupled via the driving pin <b>7</b> (not shown here).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A return spring <b>15</b> is arranged between the inner surface of the guide body <b>5</b> and the circumferential surface of the shaft <b>3</b>, which return spring here is embodied by way of example as a coil spring. A further spring element <b>19</b> is arranged between a wall section <b>17</b>, running perpendicular to the rotation axis of the shaft <b>3</b>, of the guide body <b>5</b> and the return spring <b>15</b>. It is also conceivable to provide several spring elements <b>19</b> and to arrange them in series to the return spring <b>15</b>. The spring element <b>19</b> preloads the return spring <b>15</b> in the starting position of the pivot element <b>1</b>. It should be noted thereby that the spring element <b>19</b> is softer than the return spring <b>15</b>, that therefore lower forces are necessary to compress the spring element <b>19</b> than is the case with the return spring <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As is clear in particular from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the spring element <b>19</b> is embodied by way of example as a curved disk, which has an opening <b>21</b> for accommodating the shaft <b>3</b>. The disk is thereby curved along a virtual diameter line in a quasi U-shaped manner. The spring element <b>19</b> therefore as it were grips around the shaft <b>3</b>, wherein here by way of example the convex curvature of the spring element <b>19</b> to the wall section <b>17</b> of the guide body <b>5</b> and the concave curvature thereof to the return spring <b>15</b> is shown. The diameter of the opening <b>21</b> of the spring element <b>19</b> is preferably selected such that the spring element <b>19</b> can be displaced axially on the shaft <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A stop element <b>23</b> is also discernible from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which stop element on the one hand bears against a locking element <b>24</b>, which is inserted into a groove <b>25</b> made in the shaft <b>3</b>, and on the other hand against a retaining ring <b>29</b> that is supported in an axially moveable manner in a wide groove <b>27</b> made in the circumferential surface of the shaft <b>3</b>. The stop element <b>23</b> is embodied here as a spring assembly purely by way of example, but it is also conceivable instead to provide at least one belleville spring or a rigid spring attached directly to the guide body.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> makes it clear that the stop element <b>23</b> is arranged outside the guide body <b>5</b>. The stop element <b>23</b> is arranged such that it holds the guide body <b>5</b> in a position in which the pivot element <b>1</b> is located in its starting position, in which it therefore is pivoted at a starting pivot angle &#x3b1;<sub>Start </sub>to the plane E. The retaining ring <b>29</b> arranged in the groove <b>27</b> thereby serves as a limit stop for the wall section <b>17</b> of the guide body <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If an adequate force is applied from the right to the stop element <b>23</b>, or to the retaining ring <b>29</b>, the stop element <b>23</b> embodied as a spring assembly and the retaining ring <b>29</b> are displaced in the groove <b>27</b> until the retaining ring <b>29</b> bears against the left end of the groove <b>27</b>. In this position of the guide body <b>5</b> and thus of the pivot element <b>1</b>, the pivot element <b>1</b> is located in its minimum stroke position in which it is pivoted at a minimum angle &#x3b1;<sub>Min</sub>&#x3c;&#x3b1;<sub>Start </sub>to the plane E.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this minimum stroke position, the guide body <b>5</b> is displaced to the maximum to the far left.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the minimum stroke position of the pivot element <b>1</b> it is not easily possible, for example, to start an RC which has previously run depending on the speed of the internal combustion engine. Therefore, as described above, the stop element <b>23</b> must be arranged and embodied such that it displaces the guide body <b>5</b> so far to the right along the shaft <b>3</b> that the pivot element <b>1</b> is pivoted at an angle &#x3b1;<sub>Start</sub>&#x3e;&#x3b1;<sub>Min </sub>to the plane E.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The stop element <b>23</b> therefore preferably has a higher spring rigidity than the return spring <b>15</b> and thus sets the starting position of the pivot element <b>1</b>, or the starting pivot angle &#x3b1;<sub>Start </sub>thereof relative to the plane E. The slight tilt of the pivot element <b>1</b> by the starting pivot angle &#x3b1;<sub>Start </sub>in the clockwise direction is not discernible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> because of the dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If the internal combustion engine is now started and the RC is switched on, the pressure conditions in the drive chamber change through the use of a control valve such that the pivot element <b>1</b> performs a pivot motion at a pivot angle &#x3b1;&#x3e;&#x3b1;<sub>Start </sub>relative to the plane E. The size of the pivot angle &#x3b1; is preset by the control valve, which regulates the pressure in the drive chamber. During the pivoting out of the pivot element <b>1</b>, which otherwise leads to a higher piston stroke and thus to a higher flow rate of the reciprocating piston engine, a displacement of the guide body <b>5</b> takes place axially to the shaft <b>3</b>. The guide body <b>5</b> is thus displaced the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, while the pivot element <b>1</b> pivots out in a clockwise direction and thus has a larger pivot angle &#x3b1; than the starting pivot angle &#x3b1;<sub>Start </sub>with respect to the plane E.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As already mentioned, the maximum displacement of the guide body <b>5</b> to the right is thereby limited by the dimensions of the longitudinal slot <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The pivot element <b>1</b> can thus be pivoted up to a maximum pivot angle &#x3b1;<sub>max </sub>with respect to the plane E, so that if a higher flow rate or a higher output of the air-conditioning system is desired, the pivot angle &#x3b1; of the pivot element <b>1</b> can pivot in a range from &#x3b1;<sub>Start</sub>&#x3c;&#x3b1;&#x3c;&#x3b1;<sub>max</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If the compressive forces in the drive chamber now cause the pivot element <b>1</b>, or the guide body <b>5</b>, to be displaced from their starting positions, the spring element <b>19</b> and the return spring <b>15</b> are compressed by the displacement of the guide body <b>5</b>. Initially, the force causes only a compression of the spring element <b>19</b>, since it preferably has a lower spring rigidity than the return spring <b>15</b>; the RC can thus start up without any difficulty.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The return spring <b>15</b>, which is preloaded by the spring element <b>19</b>, does not start to grip until a further displacement of the guide body <b>5</b>, wherein the spring force of the return spring <b>15</b>, against which the guide body <b>5</b> is displaced, preferably increases in a linear manner.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">From a certain spring force, the additional spring element <b>19</b> is completely compressed, and the spring force of the return spring acts on the guide body <b>5</b> until it is deflected to the maximum, the left end of the longitudinal slot <b>13</b> therefore strikes against the driving pin <b>7</b>. At this moment the pivot element <b>1</b> has reached its maximum pivot angle &#x3b1;<sub>max</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the case of higher rotational speeds of the internal combustion engine, with constant pressure conditions in the drive chamber, the expelled flow rate of the reciprocating piston engine increases so that the pivot angle &#x3b1; has to be reduced if the cooling capacity is to be kept constant. This occurs through an interaction among other things of the pressure in the drive chamber of the RC, the resulting piston forces and the restoring moment of the pivot ring, so that the pivot angle &#x3b1; of the pivot element <b>1</b> is reduced and a displacement of the guide body <b>5</b> to the left occurs. The return spring <b>15</b> thereby presses with its spring force against the wall section <b>17</b> of the guide body <b>5</b>, so that the guide body is ultimately displaced back into its starting position, wherein the pivot element <b>1</b> is aligned again at an angle &#x3b1;<sub>Start </sub>to the plane E.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With even higher rotational speeds of the internal combustion engine and a very low cooling capacity requirement, the pivot angle &#x3b1; must be reduced even further to a pivot angle &#x3b1;<sub>Min</sub>&#x2266;&#x3b1;<sub>Start</sub>, in order to guarantee a constant flow rate. The guide body <b>5</b> is thereby displaced to the left against the force of the stop element <b>23</b>, whereby the retaining ring <b>29</b> is likewise displaced to the left against the spring force of the stop element in the groove <b>27</b>. The guide body <b>5</b> is displaced to the left to the maximum when the retaining ring <b>29</b> strikes the left end of the groove <b>27</b>. The pivot element <b>1</b> is then located in its minimum stroke position, where the pivot element <b>1</b> is therefore pivoted at an angle &#x3b1;<sub>Min </sub>to the plane E, or lies therein. Due to manufacturing tolerances, the minimum pivot angle &#x3b1;<sub>Min </sub>can thereby also have values less than zero, wherein no more stroke is given at a pivot angle &#x3b1;<sub>Min</sub>=0. Then a pressure cushion forms between the piston and the suction valve, which pressure cushion prevents the piston striking the suction valve.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Overall, compared to the return spring <b>15</b>, the at least one further spring element <b>19</b> builds up a much lower spring force that must be overcome at the start of the machine, so that an easy, unhindered pivoting of the pivot element <b>1</b> is guaranteed. Shortly after the low spring force of the spring element <b>19</b> has been overcome, the spring force characteristic curve can thereby merge into the steeper preferably linear spring force characteristic curve of the return spring <b>15</b>. The spring element <b>19</b> and the return spring <b>15</b> together thus produce a progressive spring characteristic curve during pivoting, starting from small pivot angles. The spring element <b>19</b> thus preferably has a lower spring rigidity than the return spring <b>15</b>, so that a particularly soft transition between the starting position of the pivot element <b>1</b> at a starting pivot angle &#x3b1;<sub>Start </sub>and higher pivot angles &#x3b1; is given.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present invention therefore makes it possible to realize in an advantageous manner through a further spring element <b>19</b>, which acts on the return spring <b>15</b> with a preload in a starting position of the pivot element <b>1</b>, much improved start-up characteristics with much softer transitions of the individual spring forces, and to avoid undesirable vibrations.</p>
