<p id="p-0003" num="0001">This application is a national stage application of International Application No. PCT/JP2009/053793, filed 24 Feb. 2009, which claims priority to Japanese Application Nos. 2008-060558, filed 11 Mar. 2008; and 2008-291591, filed 14 Nov. 2008, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a rolling mill for flat products having work rolls driven by electric motors and backup rolls supporting the rolling reaction force applied to the work rolls and a rolling method for flat products using the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">In a rolling mill for flat products having work rolls driven by electric motors and backup rolls supporting the rolling reaction force applied to the work rolls, the method has been employed of shifting the work roll axial center positions and backup roll axial center positions to give a certain length of rolling direction offset and generating a horizontal direction (unless particularly stated to the contrary, the &#x201c;horizontal direction&#x201d; indicates the rolling direction) force component of the rolling reaction force to push the work rolls and thereby roll flat products of stable shapes. Various proposals have been made in the past.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">For example, Japanese Patent No. 2796465 discloses a cross roll rolling milling of a structure pushing the work roll chocks in the horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">However, the rolling mill of this Japanese Patent No. 2796465 is of a structure pushing only the work roll chocks, so there was the problem that it was not possible to suppress fluctuation in the amount of work roll offset due to looseness of the work roll bearings present between the work roll chocks and the work rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Japanese Patent No. 2972401 discloses a rolling mill for flat products providing support rollers for supporting the work rolls in the horizontal direction at the entrance and exit sides of the rolling mill.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">The work rolls of the rolling mill of this Japanese Patent No. 2972401 assume small sized work rolls for rolling hard materials and ultrathin materials. They are not directly driven by electric motors, but are indirectly driven through the backup rolls. In the case of indirect drive, due to the transmission of the drive force, a large horizontal force acts on the work rolls from the backup rolls. Due to the interaction with the horizontal direction force of the rolling load, this becomes a cause of instability. In particular, in the case of small sized work rolls, the horizontal direction deflection of the work rolls becomes large whereby this instability is aggravated, so it was necessary that both smaller size of the work rolls and increase of the rigidity be achieved by the horizontal direction support rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">However, this rolling mill is designed for elimination of deflection and minimization of the size of the work rolls by greatly increasing the rigidity of the small sized work rolls, so the problems of zero point adjustment used as the standard in control of rolling and maintenance of the zero point adjustment state are not solved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Japanese Patent No. 2885102 discloses a rolling mill for flat products providing support rollers for support in the horizontal direction at one sides of the work rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">However, the rolling mill of this Japanese Patent No. 2885102, like the rolling mill of Japanese Patent No. 2972401, is a rolling mill of an indirect drive type using small sized work rolls. In the same way as Japanese Patent No. 2972401, due to the small sized rolls, the roll rigidity is small and deflection in the horizontal direction easily occurs. If a difference in deflection occurs between the upper and lower work rolls, the rolling becomes instable, so to increase the work roll rigidity in the horizontal direction and control the system so that no difference in deflection occurs between the upper and lower work rolls, horizontal direction support rollers are provided at the upper and lower work rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The support rollers used in this rolling mill are structured to support the work rolls by giving forces in a direction opposite to the horizontal direction force component of the rolling reaction force generated due to offset of the work rolls, so were not able to stabilize the axial center positions of the work rolls. Further, in the same way as the work rolls of Japanese Patent No. 2972401, the problems of zero point adjustment used as the standard in control of rolling and maintenance of the zero point adjustment state are not solved.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">Japanese Patent No. 2966172 discloses a rolling mill for flat products providing intermediate rolls for giving horizontal direction deflection at one side or both sides of the work rolls. This positively applies deflection to the work rolls so as to control the shape of the rolling material by the profiles of the work rolls (in particular the surface relief in the pass line direction of the rolled material). For this reason, the intermediate rolls are structured tapered. The work rolls are made to deflect along this, so a bending force is given to the bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">However, the axial ends of the work rolls used in the rolling mills of this Japanese Patent No. 2966172 are structured to give the horizontal direction bending force for support in load control. There was the problem that the structures did not strictly control the work roll offset positions. Further, the problems of zero point adjustment and maintenance of the zero point adjustment state, that is, the inability to determine the reference points in rolling control, remained.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 10-277619 discloses a rolling mill for flat products imparting a horizontal force to one of the upper and lower work rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">The rolling mill of this Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 10-277619 is a rolling mill in which the axial centers of the work rolls are offset from the axial centers of the backup rolls in the rolling exit side direction wherein when the rolled material leaves the rolling mill, the upper and lower work rolls contact if the roll gap is small and the difference in size of the upper and lower work rolls will cause the large sized roll to move in the rolling entrance direction, so to prevent this, a horizontal force imparting device is set at the large sized side roll and the large sized work roll is pushed in the rolling exit side direction.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">However, the horizontal force is given by the invention of Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 10-277619 assuming application to only the large sized work roll when the rolled material leaves the rolling mill and the upper and lower work rolls contact, so for example when the upper work roll is large sized and the lower work roll is not given a horizontal force imparting device, a difference will arise in the offset between the upper and lower work rolls and cause warping of the rolled material. In addition, there was the problem that a slight cross angle and thrust force are generated between the lower work roll and the lower backup roll and meandering and camber occur.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">WO01/064360 discloses a rolling mill provided with a first pushing device giving a upper and lower direction balance force or bender force to the rolls through roll bearing boxes of the work rolls of the rolling mill and second pushing device giving a pushing force in a direction perpendicular to the rolling roll axis in the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">However, the external forces due to these pushing devices are given through the bearing boxes, so in the same way as Japanese Patent No. 2796465, there was the problem that it was not possible to suppress fluctuation in the work roll offset due to looseness of the work roll bearings present between the work roll bearing boxes and the work rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">Further, in a work roll driven four-stage rolling mill or six-stage rolling mill, to stabilize the positions of the work rolls in the horizontal plane, for example, in a hot rolling final rolling mill with work rolls of a diameter of 800 mm and backup rolls of a diameter of 1600 mm, the practice has been to set the rolling direction offset of the work roll axial center positions and the backup roll axial center positions to 6 to 13 mm or so, give the rolling load horizontal direction force component, that is, the offset force component, to the work rolls, and push the work roll chocks against the project blocks of the rolling mill housing or work roll chock support members connected to the backup roll chocks to stabilize the work roll position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">However, the offset force component is a force component of the rolling load, so is instantaneously applied when the rolled material is taken in. Therefore, there were the problems that a upper and lower and a left and right difference occurred in the work roll offset and led to warping of the rolled material or generation of a thrust force between the work rolls and backup rolls.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021">The present invention has as its object to solve the problems in the prior art explained above and provide a rolling mill for flat products and rolling method for flat products which strictly eliminates the difference in offsets of the work rolls at the upper and lower and left and right (work side WS/drive side DS) of the rolling mill occurring during rolling and in the kiss roll state of zero point adjustment work before rolling and eliminates the problems of warping of the flat products and meander and camber etc. due to thrust force occurring between the work rolls and backup rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">The inventors engaged in intensive studies regarding the above-mentioned problems and as a result discovered that the fluctuations in the offset of the upper and lower work rolls during rolling are greatly related in the problems of the warping of the rolled material and meander and camber&#x2014;problems leading to grave trouble in flat product rolling operations.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">For example, they discovered that the upper and lower difference of the work roll offset of a rolling mill fluctuates by about 0.2 mm, that the warping and waviness of the rolled material greatly changes, and that the left and right difference of the work roll offset (difference of work side WS and drive side DS) fluctuates by about 0.2 mm, so the thrust coefficient between the work rolls and backup rolls is about 0.004, that is, a significant thrust force of about 4 tf is generated for 1000 tf rolling load.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">The thrust force acting between the work rolls and backup rolls is governed by the structure and dimensions of the rolling mill as well, but manifests itself as substantially the same degree of left-right difference of the rolling load. For example, when performing the roll position zero point adjustment of the roll gap control devices at the drive side and work side by outputs of rolling load measurement use load detection devices, the thrust force between the work rolls and backup rolls becomes outside disturbance, accurate roll position zero point adjustment cannot be performed, and problems such as meander and camber are also caused. Further, even during rolling, the left and right difference in the rolling load due to the thrust force induces left and right differences in the rolling rate and meander of the rolled material through the left and right difference in mill deformation. Furthermore, the left and right difference in the work roll offset itself becomes slight error in the angle of entry of the rolled material in the horizontal plane, so continuing rolling in this state leads directly to meander of the rolled material. Therefore, the present invention provides technology considering looseness of the work roll bearings and deformation of the work roll necks as well and strictly eliminating upper and lower and left and right differences in work roll offset to realize stable rolling.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">Further, the offset force component is a force component of the rolling load, so is instantaneously applied when the rolled material is taken in. In that instant, due to looseness of the work roll chocks and bearings, looseness of the work roll bearings, deformation of the work roll necks, etc., the work rolls move in the horizontal direction by about 1 mm in the direction of the offset force component.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">The inventors discovered that the unevenness of the shape of the front end of the rolled material and the unevenness of the surface roughness of the work rolls at this time caused the behavior of the frictional force acting between the work rolls and rolled material to become uneven at the upper and lower and left and right, that the instantaneous horizontal direction movement of the work rolls aggravated this, that a difference arise in the work roll offset at this time at the upper and lower and/or left and right, and that this led to warping of the rolled material or occurrence of thrust force between the work rolls and backup rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">Therefore, they thought that by making the work roll offset &#xbd; or less of the current amount, preferably zero, and making the offset force component caused instantaneously at the time of entry of the rolled material component &#xbd; or less of the current amount, preferably zero, and giving horizontal direction forces necessary for stabilizing the work roll horizontal direction positions from before the start of rolling by special devices, they could stabilize the work roll positions at the time of entry of the rolled material and could prevent warping or meander and camber.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">The inventors completed the present invention based on this basic thinking for solving the problems.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">As a result, the inventors provide a rolling mill for flat products and a rolling method for flat products which provide devices for applying substantially horizontal direction external forces to the work rolls without regard as to the rolling direction offset force and thereby strictly eliminate the difference in offset of work rolls at the upper and lower and left and right (work side WS/drive side DS) of the rolling mill occurring in the kiss roll state of the zero point adjustment work before rolling and during rolling and eliminate the problem of warping of the flat products or meander or camber due to the thrust force acting between the work rolls and backup rolls.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view illustrating a first embodiment in the rolling mill for flat products of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">The rolling mill for flat products of the present invention has work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> driven by electric motors (not shown), backup rolls <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> contacting the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and supporting the rolling reaction force applied to the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, and devices for applying substantially horizontal direction external forces (work roll press rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b>) at positions of at least one location each at the work side and drive side across a center of the rolling mill in the width direction, for a total of two or more locations, for the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">Further, as explained above, to reduce the horizontal offset component force to &#xbd; or less of the past, it is important to make the value of the rolling direction offset of the work roll axial center position and backup roll axial center position divided by the sum of the work roll radius and backup roll radius 0.0025 or less.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">Rolling mills for flat products include project block type rolling mills shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and backup roll chock hold-in type rolling mills shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>). In the case of a project block type rolling mill, the horizontal direction external forces applied to the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are supported through the work roll chocks <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, and <b>34</b> by the rolling mill housing project blocks <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, while in the case of an backup roll chock hold-in type rolling mill, they are supported by the work roll chock support members <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, and <b>84</b> connected to the backup roll chocks.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">As the devices for applying substantially horizontal direction external forces to the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, for example, the work roll press rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) are provided. These work roll press rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b> push the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. By pushing the work rolls, in the case where the rolling mill is a project block type (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>)), the looseness between the shafts of the work rolls and bearings, the looseness of the bearings themselves, the looseness between the bearings and the bearing housings (roll chocks), and the looseness between the roll chocks and project blocks are absorbed and the high rigidity rolling mill housing project block surfaces can be made the reference surface. When the rolling mill is an backup roll chock hold-in type (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>)), the looseness between the shafts of the work rolls and bearings, the looseness of the bearings themselves, the looseness between the bearings and the bearing housings (roll chocks), the looseness between the roll chocks and the work roll chock support members, and the looseness between the work roll chock support members and the rolling mill housing window surface are absorbed and the high rigidity rolling mill housing window surface can be made the reference surface.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">In this way, it is possible to push against the high rigidity rolling mill housing member to stabilize the axial center positions, so it is possible to strictly eliminate the difference in offset of the work rolls at the upper and lower and left and right (work side WS/drive side DS) of the rolling mill occurring during rolling or in the kiss roll state of the zero point adjustment work before rolling including at the time of entry of the rolling material. Further, by making the value of the rolling direction offset of the work roll axial center position and backup roll axial center position divided by the sum of the work roll radius and backup roll radius 0.0025 or less, it is possible to reduce the horizontal direction offset force component to &#xbd; or less of the past, so it is possible to stabilize the axial center positions of the work rolls including at the instant when the rolling materials enter and possible to eliminate the problems of warping of the flat products and meander and camber due to the thrust force occurring between the work rolls and backup rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">The devices for applying substantially horizontal direction external forces to the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), preferably provided at positions applying force near ends of the work roll barrels. For example, by providing the work roll press rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) at positions applying force near the ends of the work roll barrels, external forces can be easily applied and it is possible to prevent horizontal direction deflection of the work rolls due to external forces.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">Further, by making the parts contacting the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> the roller type, it is possible to apply external force without scratching the work rolls. Further, it is possible to apply the substantially horizontal direction external forces in the tilted state even if the work rolls move up and down during rolling.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">In the present invention, the devices applying the horizontal direction external forces (horizontal force application devices) may be provided at either the entrance side or exit side of the rolling mill so long as at one side of the work rolls. In the present invention, the work roll offset is extremely small (preferably zero) and the horizontal direction offset force component becomes extremely small. Further, the horizontal direction external forces applied by the press rollers are always larger than the offset force component, so the position set at may be either the entrance side or exit side of the rolling mill. However, when obtaining a significant offset, it is preferable that the direction of the offset force component and the direction of the horizontal direction external forces match.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">Further, horizontal force application devices may be set to face both sides of the work rolls, but in this case it is necessary to make one horizontal force larger than the other and the composite force has to be conveyed through the work roll chocks to the rolling mill housing. The above explanation applies to the intermediate rolls and backup rolls described below in the same way as the horizontal external force application devices of the work rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">Note that, the present invention can be applied to not only a four-stage rolling mill having work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and backup rolls <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> (4Hi mill) such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) but also a five-stage rolling mill or a six-stage rolling mill (6Hi mill) having work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, intermediate rolls <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>, and backup rolls <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>c</i>). In the case of a five-stage rolling mill or six-stage rolling mill having intermediate rolls <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>, the &#x201c;backup rolls&#x201d; in the present invention also mean the intermediate rolls <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> directly supporting the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">Further, the expression &#x201c;external force&#x201d; applied to the work rolls in the present invention is used in the sense of 1) acting independently from the rolling load and 2) attachment of a device for applying force to the housing or another structure outside the work rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view illustrating a second embodiment in the rolling mill for flat products of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">The second embodiment in the rolling mill for flat products of the present invention is characterized in that the mill has, in addition to the above-mentioned devices for applying substantially horizontal direction external forces to the work rolls, devices for applying substantially horizontal direction external forces (backup roll press rollers <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>93</b>, and <b>94</b>) at positions of at least one location each at the work side and drive side across a center of the rolling mill in the width direction, for a total of two or more locations, for the backup rolls <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">In the case of the 4Hi mill shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and the 6Hi mill shown in (<i>b</i>), for example, the backup roll press rollers <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>93</b>, and <b>94</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) are provided. By using these backup roll press rollers to apply substantially horizontal direction external forces to the backup rolls, it is possible to push the backup rolls <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> against the high rigidity rolling mill housing members to stabilize the axial center positions, so it is possible to further reduce the warping of the flat products and the meander and camber due to the thrust force occurring between the work rolls and backup rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">In the case of the prior art giving the work rolls offset in the rolling exit side direction, an offset force acts on the work rolls in the rolling direction and acts on the backup rolls in the direction opposite to rolling. As a result, the reference surface determining the horizontal direction positions of the work rolls becomes the exit side surface of the housing window, and the reference surface determining the horizontal direction positions of the backup rolls becomes the entrance side surface of the housing window. In this case, to maintain the parallelness of the work rolls and backup rolls in the horizontal plane, it is necessary to manage the parallelness of the entrance side surface and exit side surface of the housing window at a high precision. Difficulties arise in the method of measurement of parallelness and error easily occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">As opposed to this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when applying horizontal forces to the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and backup roll <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> in the same direction, for example, the rolling exit side direction, the reference surface determining the horizontal direction position becomes the exit side surface of the housing window for both the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and the backup rolls <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> and it becomes easy to maintain the parallelness of the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and the backup rolls <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> in the horizontal plane at a high precision.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0111">Further, the layout of the load detection devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> of the press rollers is a preferable embodiment and may be switched by the pressures of the hydraulic cylinders giving the pushing forces.

<p id="p-0113" num="0114">The eighth embodiment in the rolling mill for flat products of the present invention is characterized in that the devices for applying substantially horizontal direction external forces to the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> (work roll pushing use hydrostatic bearings <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, and <b>124</b>) are hydrostatic bearing types able to transmit force to the work rolls through fluid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0115">By making the devices for applying substantially horizontal direction external forces to the work rolls <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> hydrostatic bearing types able to transmit force to the work rolls through oil, water, or other fluid pressure, it is possible to apply external force to the work rolls in a noncontact state, so there is no worry about scratching the work rolls and the external force application devices are also no longer worn much at all.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an embodiment of the rolling method for flat products of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0117">The embodiments of the rolling mills for flat products used in the rolling method for flat products of the present invention are as explained above, so the explanations are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">First, in the roll position zero point adjustment work before starting the rolling work, the roll gap control devices of the rolling mill for flat products are operated in the roll rotating state to set the kiss roll state and the total value of the work side load measurement value and drive side load measurement value of the rolling load measurement use load detection devices <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> is set to a predetermined zero point adjustment load (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, S-<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0119">Next, the horizontal direction external forces applied from the work side and drive side horizontal direction external force application devices to the work rolls are adjusted so that the outputs of the work roll horizontal direction load detection devices <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> become values predetermined for the work side and drive side (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, S-<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0120">Next, the balance of the work side and drive side at the roll position is adjusted to determine the roll position zero point so that the work side load measurement value and drive side load measurement value of the rolling load measurement use load detection devices <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> become equal while maintaining the work side WS/drive side DS load balance of the work roll horizontal direction load detection devices <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, S-<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0121">Further, rolling work is performed based on this roll position zero point (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, S-<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0122">By adjusting the horizontal direction external forces applied from the work side and drive side horizontal direction external force application devices to the work rolls so that the outputs of the work roll horizontal direction load detection devices <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> become values predetermined for the work side and drive side, it is possible to make the horizontal direction forces applied to the work roll necks and work roll bearings even left and right. As a result, it is possible to hold the work rolls strictly parallel with the backup rolls. Further, by adjusting the balance of the work side and drive side of the roll position to determine the roll position zero point so that the work side load measurement value and drive side load measurement value of the rolling load measurement use load detection devices <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> become equal while maintaining this state, an accurate roll position zero point free of thrust force or other disturbance is obtained. By performing the rolling work based on this roll position zero point, it is possible to prevent meander or camber of the flat products.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0123">Note that, in the present invention, the kiss roll state at the time of roll position zero point adjustment is also predicated on the rolls being in a rotating state.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0124">Further, usually, the roll gap control zero point adjustment is performed when changing work rolls, so the work rolls can be considered to have the symmetric left and right profiles of right after grinding, but the adjustment is not necessarily performed for the backup rolls right after changing them, so consideration must be given to the fact that they are generally asymmetric left and right due to uneven wear during use etc.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0125">When setting the kiss roll state in this state, the left and right unbalance in the diameters of the backup rolls cause the offset force components acting from the backup rolls to the work rolls to become asymmetric left and right. Through the changes in the work roll necks and bearing clearances, this results in the axes of the work rolls being inclined slightly in the horizontal plane. As a result, thrust force is generated between the work rolls and backup rolls. This disturbs the left-right balance of the rolling load detection use load detection devices <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>. If performing the zero point adjustment at the roll position in this state, accurate adjustment is no longer possible. This becomes a cause of meander and camber.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0126">As opposed to this, as described in (12), if adjusting the horizontal direction external forces applied to the work rolls so that the outputs of the work roll horizontal direction load measurement use load detection devices <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> become the same at the work side WS and drive side DS, the horizontal forces applied to the work roll necks and work roll bearings become equal at the drive side and the work side, so it is possible to maintain the axes of the work rolls in a posture the same as the state with no uneven wear of the backup rolls. Therefore, no thrust force occurs between the rolls and accurate roll position zero point adjustment becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0127">Further, as described in (13), by adjusting the horizontal direction external forces applied from the work side and drive side horizontal direction external force application devices to the work rolls so that the outputs of the work roll horizontal direction load detection devices <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> become values predetermined for the work side WS and drive side DS and controlling the horizontal direction external forces so as to maintain this state while rolling, it is possible to hold the left and right horizontal direction external forces equal, so it is possible to prevent meander or camber of the flat product due to occurrence of thrust force during rolling.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0128">Above, the explanation was given with reference to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, but, as explained above, the work roll horizontal direction load detection devices are preferably set so as to correspond to the upper and lower work rolls. Therefore, in the above explanation as well, it goes without saying that the zero point adjustment work and rolling control are performed based on the output values of the work roll horizontal direction load detection devices set at the upper and lower.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0129">Further, when providing the backup rolls or intermediate rolls with horizontal direction force imparting devices as well in the same way as the work rolls, it is also possible to set the horizontal direction load detection devices at the backup rolls or intermediate rolls. By performing the zero point adjustment of the rolling position including the output detected by these detection devices and adjusting the horizontal direction external forces applied from the work side and drive side horizontal direction external force application devices to the work rolls, intermediate rolls, backup rolls so that the outputs of these horizontal direction load detection device become values predetermined for the work side WS and drive side DS and rolling while controlling the horizontal direction external forces so as to maintain this state, it is possible to hold the left and right horizontal direction external forces equal, so it is possible to prevent meander or camber of the flat product occurring due to the thrust force during rolling more accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0130">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a rolling mill for flat products and rolling method for flat products which can strictly eliminate the difference in offset of work rolls at the upper and lower and left and right (work side WS/drive side DS) of the rolling mill occurring during rolling or in the kiss roll state of the zero point adjustment work before rolling and eliminate the problem of warping of the flat products or meander or camber due to the thrust force acting between the work rolls and backup rolls. Remarkable effects in industry are exhibited.</p>
