<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The instant invention relates to barrier devices useful in aquatic environments to contain materials, such as oil, floating on the surface of the water, as well as inland based environments, such as along roadways and construction sites; and more particularly to a multi-purpose rotational barrier unit which is constructed to maintain it original configuration during roll-over as a result of rough seas and to rotate independently relative to adjacently attached units if in a larger barrier wall assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The recent oil well disaster in the Gulf Coast of Mexico and the oil disaster a little over 20 years ago in the Prince William Sound illustrate the huge economic and ecological impact such spills have on the regional areas as well as nationally. While such large oil spills have been relatively infrequent, given the rise of new industrial powers in Asia and the continuous needs of the leading economic powers, the world-wide global demand for oil is expected to increase sharply. While the current political atmosphere calls for reduction in oil usage and replacement of hydrocarbons as the primary fuel source, newer green technology is currently underdeveloped, and other fuels, such as natural gas, may be too costly to implement immediately. As such, oil companies continue to find new sources of oil, which includes developing deep water well sites.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although large oil spills tend to draw the national media's attention, other sources of spills and leaks of potentially harmful materials into the nation's waterways can be just as disastrous to the environment and local economies. Materials can be released during normal transportation as a result of damage to the hulls of ships or tankers. Contaminants such as silt, debris or other pollutants can be released into bodies of water as a result of dredging operations or construction projects undertaken at or near such bodies of water. Industrial manufacturing and processing in factories also contribute to aquatic pollution through release of its industrial wastes. Finally, while most of the contamination sources listed above are man-made, natural disasters such as floods, storms, or mudslides contribute to polluting aquatic environments.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Regardless of the source of contamination, the medical, economical, and environmental consequences of such spills can be devastating. Other than prohibiting the type of activity that causes the spills, the primary method of handling such actions is through the use of timely containment and clean-up measures. Because many contaminates will initially remain floating in the water at the spill site for a limited time, delivery of containment devices rapidly to the area is imperative for proper clean-up, ensuring that currents do not disperse the spill site over a larger area. Once in the ocean currents, effectively cleaning the containment becomes difficult if not impossible. The typical containment systems utilize barriers or boom systems. Such systems are placed at or near the spill site and are specifically devised to isolate and limit the flow of contamination outside the affected area. Most boom systems contain a buoyant cylindrical section that rests at or near the surface of the water. Attached to the cylindrical section and extending into the water is a skirt, made of water-impervious material made of non-oil absorbent materials. These typical boom systems are somewhat effective at containing spills in calm waters. However, in rough seas or stormy weather, the configuration of the boom limits the effectiveness in containing the spills. Typically encountered in rough or stormy seas are continuous wave surges having large wave sizes. Large waves tend to push the contaminated water over and above the cylindrical section of the boom. Moreover, the continued wave action may act to reorient the cylindrical portion and the skirt of the boom, thereby reducing its effectiveness. Additionally, when rough water is anticipated, these booms have to be deflated, dismantled and demobilized, significantly adding to the cost of deployment and maintenance of these types of oil containment booms.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,731,452 and 7,407,341 teach a floating wall of interconnected barrier units which can be readily recognized by operators of vessels and others as a warning structure delineating a restricted area. The barrier units have a shape similar to Jersey barriers, see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,059,362, U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,101, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,538, commonly used at construction sites or along roadways as dividers. The individual barrier units include a top wall, a bottom wall, opposed end walls, and opposed side walls interconnected to form a hollow interior which is partially or completely filled with a foam material. A ballast weight is secured to each barrier unit to maintain them in an upright position in the water. Cables, couplers and/or other connectors are employed to mount adjacent barriers end-to-end to form a barrier wall which can encircle a vessel or otherwise isolate an area within a seaport to provide security. While the device contains ballast for maintaining an upright position, unless the units are completely anchored to the sea bed, the ballast utilized can not prevent roll-over. Fastening to the sea bed is costly and may encounter the need for environmental impact studies prior to securing. Should the individual units topple, the device is constructed in such a manner that the original positioning of the units is not maintained, resulting in the device having a sideways or upside down configuration. Moreover, since each unit is interconnected together and cannot rotate independently from its neighboring unit, roll over of one unit effectively results in multiple units, or the entire wall, being rolled over as well.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The British Petroleum disaster in the Gulf of Mexico highlighted another shortcoming related to a quick containment response. In the very beginning of the disaster, obtaining enough oil booms to properly contain such a large spill was problematic; as either the materials were stored in locations too remote from the accident site to be immediately effective, or production of new booms was too slow as it took time for the factories to produce the large amount of material. Once the disaster had been cleaned up, any amount of unused materials that was produced requires costly storage and transporting options, and may not be helpful should a similar disaster occur in another area.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, what is needed in the art is an improved containment device that 1) resists roll over when placed in an aquatic environment, 2) maintains its original conformation should roll over occur, thereby minimizing any reduction in containment capability when placed in rough or stormy seas, 3) attaches to other units to form a variable-length barrier wall system, and 4) provides units within the system that are interconnected in a way which permits rotation independently from adjacent units, thereby maintaining positional integrity of the entire system even if one of the units succumbs to roll over.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The instant invention describes a multi-purpose rotational barrier unit and a system of interconnected barrier units which function in multiple environments, including aquatic environments and land-based environments. In an aquatic environment, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit is constructed and arranged to provide containment of a material, such as oil, floating within oceans, seas, inlets, or lakes. The instant invention provides a device which has a design configuration which provides hydro-dynamic stability in strong currents and high waves. The device is designed to roll over but maintain its original configuration in the rolled over state, thus reducing the amount of spill escaping the contained area. The instant invention also provides for a device which, when connected to other barrier units to form a large wall system, can rotate in rough seas independently from either adjacent barrier units or units indirectly attached as part of the overall system but positioned some distance away. The advantage of the instant invention, therefore, is that it is designed to perform containment at a location that may include rough surf or sea conditions. As a result, each of the individual units are able to move independently of adjacent units during surges which result in horizontal motion, heaves as a result of vertical motion, and roll-over or twisting about the horizontal axis. When not needed in an aquatic environment, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit can be used in roadways or construction sites to prevent two objects, whether it is automobiles or people, from interacting.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an illustrated example of the instant invention, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit comprises a plurality of equally dimensioned walls interconnected to form side walls and a bottom wall. Connected to the side walls and the bottom wall are two opposing end walls which define a hollow interior portion. The opposing end walls contain one or more rotation members for providing rotational movement around a center axis when connected to one or both opposing side walls with an identical barrier unit. The rotation members are constructed and arranged to provide the barrier unit rotational movement which is independent from the movement of other barrier units directly attached to its opposing walls or units which may indirectly be attached as part of a larger barrier wall system. When placed in an aquatic environment, the interior portion of the device is constructed to provide ballast support and help maintain the unit in an upright position. The device contains optional attachments for providing enhanced functionality, such as the inclusion of a material absorbing structure assembly for providing limited absorbing capabilities, and netting located at various positions along or in between the devices for enhanced containment. When not in use in an aquatic environment, the barrier device can be used in construction sites or along roadways to protect workers or pedestrians from dangerous encounters.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An alternative embodiment of the instant invention includes three equally dimensioned walls. The walls interconnect to form two side walls and one bottom wall, thus forming a generally triangular shape having a first top edge and two side edges. Each of the equally sized walls contains one or more longitudinally segmented surfaces. Two opposing end walls are connected to the equally sized walls, thus forming a hollow interior which is constructed and arranged to act as a ballast to reduce the barrier unit from roll-over as a result of rough waves, strong winds, or stormy weather. When in non-aquatic environments, the hollow interior can act to stabilize and provide support for the device. Each of the opposing end walls contains one or more rotation members for providing rotational movement around a center axis when connected on one or both ends with an identical barrier unit. The rotation members are constructed and arranged to provide the barrier unit with rotational movement which is independent from the movement of the directly attached barrier units, or indirectly attached barriers connected as part of a larger barrier wall system. Particularly in an aquatic environment, rotation of the barrier about the center axis point results in the barrier maintaining its structural configuration in an upright position. The device contains optional attachments for providing enhanced functions, such as the inclusion of a material absorbing structure assembly for providing limited absorbing capabilities, and netting located at various positions along or in between adjacent devices for enhanced containment. When not in use in an aquatic environment, the barrier device can be used in construction sites or along roadways to protect workers or pedestrians from dangerous encounters.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms, there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described a presently preferred, albeit not limiting, embodiment with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the present invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>, an illustrative embodiment of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit is shown and indicated by the number <b>10</b>. The multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> can be made from various materials, such as low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, heavy duty polyethylene, high impact styrene, polycarbonates, or similar material known to one of skill in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> is integrally molded polyethylene, manufactured in one piece. The multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>, however, can be constructed using other techniques known to one of skill in the art, including rotational molding or blow molding techniques, and may be constructed of several individual components and connected together. To increase longevity, the barrier unit <b>10</b> may also include or be constructed of materials which make the device resistant to the weather, leaching, and biodegradation, and retain their mechanical and chemical properties under low and/or high temperatures. Use of ultraviolet light inhibitors may be used to provide the barrier unit <b>10</b> with further protection from weather conditions. The barrier material may also be constructed of or coated with materials which contain fire retardant properties.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> comprises three (3) equally sized walls, side walls <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> and bottom wall <b>16</b>. The bottom wall <b>16</b> forms the floor of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit. The side wall <b>12</b> contains a first end <b>18</b>, a second end <b>20</b>, and two opposing edges <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> extending between the first end <b>18</b> and the second end <b>20</b>. The side wall <b>14</b> contains a first end <b>26</b>, a second end <b>28</b> and two opposing edges <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> extending therebetween. The bottom wall <b>16</b> contains a first end <b>34</b>, a second end <b>36</b>, and two opposing edges <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> extending therebetween. The distance between the opposing edges, for example between <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, or <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, defines the length of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> and can be designed in variable distances, including, but not limited to, 6 feet, 8 feet, 10 feet, 12 feet or 20 feet. The walls <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b> are interconnected, thus forming the exterior surface <b>42</b> of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>. The side wall <b>12</b> connects to the side wall <b>14</b> to form edge <b>44</b> and with bottom wall <b>16</b> to form edge <b>46</b>. The sidewall <b>14</b> connects to the bottom wall <b>16</b> to form an edge <b>48</b>. One or more of the longitudinal edges <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b>, although illustrated in a pointed manner may contain an additional angled surface to provide a partially flat surfaced edge. The distance between the edges, such as <b>44</b> and <b>48</b> or <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, defines the side length of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> and could be constructed to various, non-limiting sizes, including 32 inches, 42 inches, 48 inches, and 54 inches. A pair of opposing end walls <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> interconnects with the side walls <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, and bottom wall <b>16</b>, thereby forming an inner hollow interior <b>54</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As an optional feature, the multi-purpose barrier unit <b>10</b> may include end lips <b>55</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The end lips <b>55</b> are made of an integrally molded polyethylene material and are preferably located at both ends of the barrier unit, i.e. part of the opposing walls <b>50</b> or <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Each of the walls is constructed of a thickness to accommodate a material which may act as ballast for sea applications, or to prevent or limit movement should the device be placed on land, such as along a roadway or construction site. Given the enclosed nature of the hollow interior <b>54</b>, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> is constructed to house a material therein. While the preferred material is a liquid such as water, the device may also accommodate solid materials such as sand or salt. The type of material and amount placed within depends on the intended environment of use. To aid the user in filling the hollow interior <b>54</b> with water, a filling access aperture <b>56</b> is placed along a portion of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>. The filling access aperture <b>56</b> is illustrated along the top portion of a side wall in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, however, aperture <b>56</b> can be placed anywhere on the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>. While a preferable shape is illustrated as rounded having a diameter of 4 inches, the diameter size as well as the aperture shape can be varied depending on the needs of the user. The filling access aperture <b>56</b> is constructed and arranged to interconnect with a fill plug <b>58</b>. The fill plug can be made of any material and is designed to seal the filling access aperture <b>56</b> through any means known to one of skill in the art, including a screw type or plug/snap type fitting. In a preferred, albeit non-limiting embodiment, the device contains a 4 inch diameter PVC plastic screw type fitting fill plug <b>58</b> having a rubber, plastic or neoprene &#x201c;O&#x201d; ring to seal and prevent leaks. The fill plug <b>58</b> serves the dual purpose of keeping the filled liquid within the hollow interior <b>54</b> as well as preventing other materials, such as dirt, debris, or water, from entering within once the desired amount of liquid to be filled within has been reached. By keeping outside materials from entering the interior <b>54</b>, the risk of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> becoming too heavy and decreasing the effectiveness of the device is minimized. The multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> may contain one or more slit openings <b>57</b> to allow air to pass through the barrier thereby preventing the barrier from roll-over during periods of high winds or stormy weather. The multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> may contain one or more slots to allow thongs to easily pass through for lifting the units by a fork lift. The slots also allow for water to pass under the barrier for drainage at roadway/construction sites applications.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Along the side wall <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> is a variable sized and shaped drainage aperture <b>60</b> constructed and arranged to interconnect with a drainage plug <b>62</b>. Similar to the fill plug <b>58</b>, the drainage plug <b>62</b> can be made of any material and is designed to seal the drainage aperture <b>60</b> through any means known to one of skill in the art, including screw type, plug or snap type fitting. In a preferred, albeit non-limiting embodiment, the device contains a 2 inch diameter PVC plastic screw type fitting drainage plug <b>62</b> having a rubber, plastic or neoprene &#x201c;O&#x201d; ring to seal and prevent leaks.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">To aid in the drainage of the liquid filled within, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> may optionally be constructed to contain walls which include one or more sloping portions. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a preferred embodiment includes the bottom wall <b>16</b> which contains variable thickness to provide sloping, or curvature, <b>64</b>. The bottom wall <b>16</b> could be constructed to contain a continuous slope downward from the one end to the other end, i.e. from end adjacent side wall <b>14</b> to the end adjacent side wall <b>12</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The sloping portion terminates at or near the drainage aperture <b>60</b>. The bottom wall <b>16</b> may be constructed to contain a plurality of sloping portions <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> directed toward the center, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this configuration, the sloping portions <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> terminate at the drainage aperture <b>60</b> which is positioned at or near the center bottom of the bottom side wall <b>12</b> or <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the bottom wall <b>16</b> could be constructed to contain either one longitudinal continuous slope downward from end <b>38</b> to its opposing end <b>40</b> or a plurality of sloping sections terminating in a centrally located drainage aperture (not illustrated). Embedded within the bottom wall <b>16</b> is one or more weighted objects <b>70</b>. While such feature is optional, the one or more weighted objects <b>70</b> are of sufficient size and weight and placed at various positions along the length of bottom wall <b>16</b> to provide adequate ballast for sea applications to help maintain the barrier in the upright position. In land based applications, weighted objects <b>70</b> prevent or minimize vertical and/or horizontal movement.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While a single multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> can be used to divide a particular area, one of the advantages of the instant invention rests in the fact that two or more multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B can be interconnected to form an extended length barrier system, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, a rotating member, illustrated herein as a polyaxial joint, such as ball and socket assembly <b>74</b>, aids in connecting the ends of a first multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>A to a second multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>B. The rotation members are preferably located on each of the opposing end walls <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> and are constructed and arranged to provide the first multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>A angular or rotational motion about its center axis which is independent from the movement of the adjacently connected second multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>B. As a result of the rotating member, rotation of the barrier about the center axis results in a barrier maintaining its structural configuration in the upright position. In an aquatic environment, the initial starting point includes a portion of the bottom wall <b>16</b> resting at or below the water level with all or a portion of the side walls <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> extending above the water level, preferably at a distance of between 15 inches and 2.5 feet above the surface water. This distance is dependent upon the size of the barrier unit in use. As the water environment becomes rough and the barrier gets pounded by wave actions, the barrier may eventually roll over. As a result of the roll over, one of the side walls enters below the water surface and becomes the new bottom wall. Because the original bottom wall has the same shape and dimensions as the other walls, it now assumes the position of a side wall. As a result, the original structural configuration is maintained and the device remains in an upright position.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a preferred embodiment, the ball and socket assembly <b>74</b> is embedded into and fastened to the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> at its center axis <b>75</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the ball and socket assembly <b>74</b>, which is preferably embedded into opposing end walls or if utilized within the end lips, includes a seating member <b>76</b> containing a partially, spherically-shaped socket <b>78</b>. The spherically shaped socket <b>78</b> is constructed and arranged to receive a spherical head portion <b>80</b> of a rod <b>82</b>. The spherical head portion <b>80</b> may be secured to the spherical socket <b>78</b> by one or more apertured plates <b>84</b> which secure to seating member <b>76</b> by fastening members such as a galvanized hex bolt <b>86</b> and nuts <b>88</b>, and neoprene washers <b>90</b> to prevent leaking. The ball and socket assembly <b>74</b> is preferably made of materials which resist corrosion, including but not limited to stainless steel or galvanized materials. Welded to, or attached to by other mechanisms known to one of skill in the art, the opposite end of the spherical head portion <b>80</b> of rod <b>82</b> is a second connecting member, illustrated herein as an anchor shackle <b>84</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, or clevis with pin, <b>85</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. The clevis with pin <b>85</b> may also be designed to provide independent rotation from the rotation of the rod <b>82</b> through use of an articulating clevis fastener, see embodiment sold by Midwest Control Products, Bushnell, Ill., and described in U.S Patent Application Publication 2008/0240848. In this manner, anything connected to the articulating clevis may rotate independent from the rotation generated by the ball and socket assembly. While the ball and socket assembly <b>74</b> is an illustrative example, the instant invention can include the use of one or a combination of other connecting elements, including eye hook plates, screws, bolts, clips, adhesives, staples, and/or other types of joints or fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Each of the side walls <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may optionally include an access panel <b>92</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, preferably located at each side end. The access panel <b>92</b> may be an opening of a size sufficient to allow tools, materials, or a human hand entry should the ball and socket assembly <b>74</b> need adjustment or repairs. An access panel plug or cap, such as a screw or push in type, may be inserted within the access panel opening, to prevent unwanted material from contacting the ball and socket assembly. In a preferred embodiment, the access panel plug or cap is a screw plastic screw type plug containing rubber, plastic, or neoprene &#x201c;O&#x201d; rings to seal and prevent leaks.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a linking member, illustrated herein as a linked chain <b>94</b>, is used to connect a first multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>A to a second multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>B. The linked chain <b>94</b> is constructed of various materials, including but not limited to, corrosive resistant plastics, zinc coated materials, galvanized materials, or stainless steel, and attaches to the ball and socket assembly <b>74</b> positioned along the center axis <b>75</b> of the first multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>A. The linked chain <b>94</b> is illustrative of a preferred embodiment of a linking member. Use of a chain is not to be perceived as a limiting example, as the linking member could be a rope, bungee chord, cable, wire, rubber band, or the like. A first end <b>96</b> of the linked chain <b>94</b> attaches to the ball and socket assembly <b>74</b> positioned at the center axis point of the first multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>A through the use of the shackle <b>84</b>, articulated clevis <b>85</b>, or the like. The opposing end <b>98</b> of the linked chain <b>94</b> attaches to the ball and socket assembly <b>74</b> of the second multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>B positioned at the center axis point <b>75</b> through the use of an anchor shackle, articulated clevis, or the like <b>98</b>. Connections at the center axis provide each of the tri-rotational barrier units to rotate freely and independently from each other. The linked chain <b>94</b> is variably sized, can be constructed of various lengths, and has a rated capacity sufficient to carry its intended loads.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> illustrates two multi-purpose rotational barrier units, <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B, linked together in an alternative manner as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. Multiple linked chains attach to the integrally molded polyethylene end lip <b>55</b> of the multi-purpose rotational barrier units, <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B through looped hook <b>100</b> or through a looped hook <b>100</b> secured to a looped hook plate <b>101</b> and shackle <b>84</b>. The looped hook plate <b>101</b> is secured to the integrally molded polyethylene end lip <b>55</b> via hex bolts <b>86</b>, nuts <b>88</b>, and washers <b>90</b>. The opposite ends of both of the linked chains <b>94</b> attach to second shackles <b>84</b>. Shackles <b>84</b> secure to a dumbbell shaped member <b>105</b>. Each linked chain, therefore, can rotate independent from each other. Should the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>A rotate causing its chain to rotate as well, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>B, and its link chain, are maintained in an upright position and will not rotate as result of the rotation generated by barrier unit <b>10</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>A may optionally include a continuous recessed channel slot <b>102</b>, for securing a plastic fabric netting material <b>103</b> between the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>A and the second multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>B. Such connection may be particularly useful in calm aquatic environments, such as a lake. The continuous recessed channel slot <b>102</b> is sized and shaped to receive a plate <b>104</b> having a continuous spherical shaped rod <b>106</b>. For illustrative purposes, the continuous recessed channel slot <b>102</b> is shown positioned within the end lip <b>55</b>. However, the continuous recessed channel slot <b>102</b> may be positioned along any of the walls <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> or <b>16</b>. Attachment of adjacent barrier units in this manner, therefore, provides a connection in which rotation of each unit is dependent upon the rotation of the connected unit and may be useful in locations which do not require all units to rotate independently of other units. Although not illustrated, the multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>A may contain other means for attaching to a second barrier unit known to one of skill in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, the barrier units may include dumb bell shaped deformations (not illustrated) positioned at the top and at each end of the barrier units. The dumb bell shaped deformations can be sized and shaped to accommodate a separate heavy PVC plastic dumb bell attachment device. The devices can be used to connect barriers together for roadside/construction site applications. Additionally, two devices may simply be attached using an eye hook plate and an anchor shackle.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> contains one or more lifting hook assembly <b>108</b>, illustrated herein as a looped object <b>110</b> secured to plate <b>112</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. The lifting hook assembly <b>108</b> can be secured to any portion of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>, but is preferably secured to one or both of the opposing end walls <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, at or near edge <b>44</b> through fastening means common to one of skill in the art, such as bolts <b>86</b> or screws. The lifting hook assembly <b>108</b> is constructed to provide a mechanism for the lifting or pulling of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> onto transportation means, such as trucks, barges, or boats, for transfer of the units to various sites. The rated capacity of the lifting hook assembly <b>108</b> can be varied and depend upon the size and length of the barrier being lifted or pulled. A rated capacity of approximately 11,000 pounds, however, should be sufficient to handle a barrier which is fully filled with water. While the hook is illustrated as generally triangular in shape, such shape is not limiting and could contain other curved shapes as well. The lifting hook assembly <b>108</b> can be made of any material, including, but not limited to, zinc plated, galvanized, or stainless steel materials.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">One or more second connecting members, illustrated herein as eye hooks <b>114</b>, are embedded into or are surface mounted to various points along the multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>. Where multiple eye hooks <b>114</b> are used, they are preferably spaced at various intervals and of adequate on center spacing to allow for attachments of various enhanced features, to be described later. The eye hooks <b>114</b> can be integrally molded within the multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b> during the manufacturing process or they can be surface mounted using bolts or screws. The eye hooks <b>114</b> can be made from various plastic materials, or metal fabrications, such as zinc coated or galvanized or stainless steel materials. Each of the eye hooks can be varied in size and are constructed to the rated capacity of the anticipated loads they are designed to carry.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Several additional features are optionally included as part of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>. In addition to filling the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> with water, one or more weighted objects <b>116</b> can be attached to one or more portions of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>, preferably to the bottom center. Each of the weighted objects <b>116</b> are attached to the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> using the eye hooks <b>114</b>, anchor shackles <b>84</b>, or combinations thereof, or other fastening means known to one of skill in the art. The weighted objects are not limited to a particular size, shape, or weight limit. The weighted objects <b>116</b> are designed to 1) provide proper ballast for the variously sized multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>, and 2) to right the multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b> should the barrier unit be rolled as a result of a wave action. In this manner, therefore, the weights are designed to prevent the units from being turned upside down as a result of rough aquatic environments. Although the weighted objects <b>116</b> are preferably made of iron, other non-limiting materials, such as plastics, rubber, steel, or lead may also be used without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">One or more flotation device, illustrated herein as flexible, inflatable balloons or foam balls <b>118</b> are attached to the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> to provide each of the barrier units with flotation. While such flotation devices <b>118</b> are optional, inclusion of such devices further provides the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> with additional means to resist roll over during transportation or heavy wave action while at the intended site. In addition to, or in place of the inflatable balloons or foam balls, commercially available oil booms or hair net booms may be attached to the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> to provide additional enhanced oil absorbent/containment capabilities. Attachment of one or more flotation devices <b>118</b> is preferably at or near the opposing ends <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, at or near end lip <b>55</b>, and/or along one or more of the three walls <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. The one or more flotation devices <b>118</b> may also be positioned between two interconnected multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>. Connection to the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> is accomplished using the eye hooks <b>114</b>, the linked chains <b>94</b>, ropes, or other fastening mechanisms such as industrial grade plastic ties.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">While the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> functions primarily as a barrier, separating one area from another, attachment of variously sized absorbent nets, illustrated herein as an oil absorbent net <b>120</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>), allows the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> to function both as an oil containment barrier and a limited oil absorbing device. The oil absorbent net could be constructed in the form of but not limited to: interwoven oil absorbing fibers, or hair net, such as cotton or polypropylene, one or more oil absorbent pads, or a polypropylene filled sock enclosed within a mesh outer sleeve. The oil absorbent net could also be in the form of a silt fence or oil absorbent material connected to stretchable plastic netting. In any form, the oil absorbent net <b>120</b> attaches to the top of, or at the sides of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit using the eye hooks <b>114</b>, the linked chains <b>94</b>, or a continuous channel strut (not illustrated) to provide a leak proof attachment, or other fastening mechanisms such as industrial grade plastic ties. While the netting is illustrated as being capable of absorbing oil, such netting can be modified to absorb other contaminants, such as chemicals, or waste, or debris.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition to the netting <b>120</b> being positioned between barrier units <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B, the netting <b>120</b> may be positioned above the barrier unit and/or below the barrier unit. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11C</figref>, the netting <b>120</b> is illustrated attached to a post <b>122</b>. The post <b>122</b> attaches to a portion of the barrier using screws/bolts and extends above edge <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the post <b>122</b> with netting <b>120</b> is illustrated attached to the bottom contour of bottom wall <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>), preferably at the center, through a continuous channel strut <b>121</b>. In this manner, netting <b>120</b> extends downward from the barrier unit <b>10</b> and provides barrier functionality below the units. Use of a post <b>122</b>, however, is not necessary. Because the device contains two side edges <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, one netting may be attached along edge <b>46</b> and/or a second netting may be attached along edge <b>48</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. Attachment along one or both edges may be combined with attachment of netting <b>120</b> along the center of bottom wall <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In place of the absorbent net, a material absorbent structure assembly <b>124</b> can be utilized and preferably positioned between two multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, for absorbing materials, such as oil, as they pass in between two adjacently connected units. The material absorbent structure assembly <b>124</b>, as illustrated herein, consists of two support structures illustrated as a first post <b>126</b> and a second post <b>127</b>. Each of the posts <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> contain a linking member opening <b>128</b> and <b>130</b>, respectively, which are sized to receive a linking member, illustrated herein as a linked chain <b>94</b>. The linked chain <b>94</b> passes through the linking member openings <b>128</b> and <b>130</b> such that a first end <b>132</b> of the linked chain <b>94</b> connects to the ball and socket assembly <b>74</b> located on the multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>A while the opposing end <b>134</b> connects to the ball and socket assembly located on the multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>B. While neither of the posts <b>126</b> or <b>127</b> is directly connected to the multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>A or <b>10</b>B, the posts connect indirectly to the multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>A or <b>10</b>B at the ball and socket assembly via shackles or an articulated clevis. Connection in this manner allows either of the posts to freely swivel around the center axis point of each of the multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B. The linked chain may also contain one or more hex bolts, nuts, shackles, or other fastener devices inserted within the chain (not illustrated) in order to prevent the posts from side to side sliding along the length of the chain, thereby keeping the posts properly orientated and spaced apart while the posts freely tilt and rotate around the center axis.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition to the main linked chain, two additional chains <b>94</b><i>a </i>and <b>94</b><i>b</i>, placed above and below the linked chain <b>94</b> may optionally be utilized. One end of the chains <b>94</b><i>a </i>and <b>94</b><i>b </i>attaches to post <b>126</b> through a connecting element illustrated as a shackle <b>84</b>. The shackle <b>84</b> is attached to the hook member <b>123</b> of the eye plate <b>125</b> which is secured to the post through hex bolts <b>86</b>, nuts <b>88</b>, and washers (not illustrated). The opposite end of chains <b>94</b><i>a </i>and <b>94</b><i>b </i>attach to post <b>127</b> in the same manner. The size and shape of the fastening elements, such as the shackles or eye hook plates, are constructed of sufficient size to handle the desired load weights. Each of the posts <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> may optionally contain eye hooks <b>114</b> attached to the bottom part of the posts. The eye hook <b>114</b> allows additional attachments to be connected to the material absorbent structure assembly <b>124</b>, such as an additional linked chain <b>94</b><i>c </i>attached to a weighted object <b>116</b>, non-attached linked chain <b>94</b><i>d</i>, or anchor shackles (not illustrated). The attached weighted object <b>116</b> provides ballast for the material absorbent structure assembly <b>124</b>. The material absorbent structure assembly is designed to be collapsible and rotatable, preferably independent of the barrier unit.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">To prevent the flow of materials, such as oil slicks, in the water from passing from one side of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b> to the other side, a reinforced plastic netting <b>136</b>, such as safety or tree fencing, can also be attached to posts <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>. The reinforced plastic netting <b>136</b> may also be designed to pass through the ball and socket assembly as well. Preferably, the reinforced plastic netting <b>136</b> is wrapped behind and around the sides of each of the posts and the ends of the netting are placed along the front (oil side) of the barriers. The reinforced plastic netting <b>136</b> can be designed with a plurality of openings to allow water to pass through but prevent, or limit, the passage of oil to the other side. The reinforced plastic netting <b>136</b> can be attached to the posts using any known mechanism known to one of skill in the art, including nail, staples, or industrial grade plastic ties. The reinforced plastic netting <b>136</b> may alternatively be constructed of a solid, stretchable plastic material with no openings (not illustrated). In either form, the reinforced plastic netting <b>136</b> may be used as a backup material for attaching such items as oil absorbing materials or silt fencing placed between the barriers.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref>, an alternative embodiment of multi-purpose rotational barrier unit is shown and indicated by the number <b>200</b>. The multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>200</b> is constructed and arranged to dissipate side impacting loads, such as those generated by rough water waves, in an upward direction to lessen translational forces on the unit, thereby decreasing the tendency of the unit to rotate or topple over. The multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>200</b> comprises multiple, equally sized walls, side walls <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>, and bottom wall <b>216</b> which defines the floor of the barrier unit. The side wall <b>212</b> and the side wall <b>214</b> intersect to form a first longitudinal edge <b>218</b>. The bottom wall <b>216</b> intersects with the side wall <b>214</b> to form a second longitudinal edge <b>220</b> and with side wall <b>212</b> to form a third longitudinal edge <b>222</b>. One or more of the longitudinal edges <b>218</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>222</b>, although illustrated in a pointed manner, may contain an additional angled surface to provide a partially flat surfaced edge. The distance between the longitudinal edges, such as between edge <b>218</b> and edge <b>222</b>, defines the side lengths, which are equally sized, of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>200</b>. A pair of opposing end walls <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> interconnects with the side walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, and bottom wall <b>216</b>, thereby forming an inner hollow interior <b>228</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Since each of the walls are identical in configuration, only the side wall <b>212</b> is described in detail herein, it being understood that the side wall <b>214</b> and the bottom wall <b>216</b> are formed with identical features. The side wall <b>212</b> contains a first end <b>230</b>, a second end <b>232</b>, and two opposing edges <b>234</b> and <b>236</b>. The distance between the two opposing side walls <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> defines the length of the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>200</b>. While the general shape of each the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>200</b> in cross section is generally triangular, the side wall <b>212</b> contains inwardly tapering and outwardly diverging portions relative to the edge <b>218</b> or <b>222</b>, thereby forming a side wall with a plurality of edges and longitudinally extending segmented surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the non-limiting example, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>200</b> contains four segmented longitudinal surfaces. The first longitudinally extending surface <b>238</b> diverges from edge <b>218</b> towards the second end <b>232</b>, terminating in a first intermediate edge <b>240</b>. A second longitudinally extending surface <b>242</b> diverges from the first intermediate edge <b>240</b> and terminates in a second intermediate edge <b>244</b>. A third longitudinally extending surface <b>246</b> diverges from the second intermediate edge <b>244</b> and terminates in a third intermediate edge <b>248</b>. Diverging from the third intermediate edge <b>248</b> is a fourth longitudinally extending surface <b>250</b>. The fourth longitudinally extending surface <b>250</b> terminates at the longitudinal edge <b>222</b>. Each of the longitudinally extending surfaces <b>238</b>, <b>242</b>, <b>246</b>, and <b>250</b> can be constructed and arranged to diverge from its corresponding edge at various increments, thus forming tapered areas as well as widened areas.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">While the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>200</b> may differ from the embodiment described previously based on the configurations of each of the side walls and bottom wall, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>200</b> contains each of the same features as described for the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>. It being understood that while some features are illustrated below, all features and their functionality which have been previously described applies to the embodiment illustrated as <b>200</b> and will not be described in detail. Moreover, any features newly described are equally applicable to any embodiments described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>200</b> contains: a filling access aperture <b>252</b> having the same features and functionality of the previously described filling access aperture <b>56</b> to aid the user in filling the hollow interior (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, <b>228</b>) with water; a rotating member <b>254</b>, preferably a ball and socket assembly constructed and arranged to provide angular or rotational motion about its center axis which is independent from the rotation of an adjacently attached second multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>10</b>B to its front and/or back; and one or more attachments, including flotation devices <b>256</b>, lifting hooks <b>258</b>, eyelet hooks <b>260</b> having a weighted object <b>262</b> connected via a linked chain <b>264</b>, and oil absorbent nets or assemblies, not illustrated. The multi-purpose rotational barrier unit <b>200</b> may optionally contain solid, integrally molded polyethylene end lips <b>266</b> which are preferably positioned at both ends of the unit, thus forming an equilateral triangle shape at the ends. The end lips <b>266</b> provide additional support when used in land based operations, but allow the device to maintain the same roll over resistant contour should the device be placed in aquatic environments. The end lips <b>266</b> may also contain a continuous recessed channel slot as described previously. In a more preferred, embodiment, the integrally molded polyethylene end lips <b>266</b> provide an air pocket <b>268</b>. The air pocket <b>268</b> provides flotation and prevent roll over when used in both land and aquatic operations.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In use, the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit, referred to as <b>10</b>, but represents any of the embodiments described or illustrated in the application, in combination with one or more of the attachments, i.e. weights, linked chains, flotation devices, oil absorbent structures, or nettings, are attached together in a manner as detailed previously to form an extended barrier system. Multi-purpose rotational barrier units of the same size can be attached together using many different units having different lengths, thus making use of readily available barrier units from local supplies. Because the barrier units can be manufactured in various lengths, any number of combinations of attached sequences can be formed. Moreover, individual multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b> can be attached together in variously numbered increments. For example, barrier units in 5-10 increments can be attached together and towed to potential spill sites by a number of small tow boats or by larger barges. Once at the site, the barrier unit increments can be connected to other barrier unit increments already at the location to form a larger barrier wall system. If needed, the barriers can be filled with water, either using sea water on site or through the use of fresh water stored on the transportation barges.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Connections of the barrier units are not limited to a linear format. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a plurality of multi-purpose rotational barriers units <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C, illustrated in block form for simplicity, illustrate a 90 degree segmented bend between the barriers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a plurality of multi-purpose rotational barriers units <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C, connected together to form a 180 degree bend. As such, multiple barrier units can be attached together to meet curved containment radii incrementally. To aid in forming a tight connection in such formations, the barriers ends may contain an optional 45 degree bend. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a graphic depiction of numerous multi-purpose rotational barrier units connected together to form a 1000 feet barrier wall system. The barrier walls can be anchored to the sea floor using anchoring systems known to one of skill in the art, or to structures A and B, such as docks, posts, buoys, moorings, steel sheet piles, pre-cast concrete piles, or pressure treated wood piles. For shore line applications, steel sheet piles, precast concrete piles, or round pressure treated wood piles or moorings spaced 200 feet to 1000 feet on center could be used. The spacing can vary depending upon the size and length of the barrier units selected and the anticipated forces to be exerted on the barrier wall. The barrier wall system of the instant invention can be used 100 to 200 yards off shore along a beach or marsh coast line to reduce tar balls, oil spills on the beaches and other coastal environments.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The anchoring system is designed to accommodate a predetermined amount of force dependent on the wave/current forces the multi-purpose rotational barrier unit is designed to resist. It is anticipated that the drag forces of the current may cause the multi-purpose rotational barrier units <b>10</b> to form a parabolic shape as a result of tension force exerted upon the system. The tension forces are transferred to the piles in such a way so as to balance the net drag force acting on the barrier unit walls. It is anticipated that the tension force placed upon the barrier wall system of 1,000 feet in a 2 knot current perpendicular to the placement of the barrier walls, with piles or moorings spaced 400 feet on center, could reach well past 10,000 pounds. The tension force may also be carried into the vertical direction as the barrier units roll over as a result of wave actions, first at the lower edges then towards the upper edge. The location of the tension forces constantly shifts from the lower edge to the upper edge causing the barriers to destabilize and roll over in the waves. Because of the design features of the instant invention, the walls of the multi-purpose rotational barrier units are hydro dynamically stable in strong currents and high waves. While the individual barrier units are designed to roll over, the design of the equally shaped walls allows the units to maintain the same configuration integrity in the rolled over state, thus maintaining an ability to act as a barrier because the amount of material traveling between the two sides of the barrier is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition to being placed in open sea waters, the multi-purpose rotational barriers units can be placed at the mouth of inlets and lakes. The barriers can be used at boat docks facilities as a flotation wall and be placed around boat docks while they undergo construction or repair operations. They can further be used as temporary protective or guidance walls useful in off-loading and on-loading passengers. The multi-purpose rotational barriers units can be used at the sites of oil drilling platforms by connecting to cylindrical or the tri-pod steel girder truss support columns. To form larger diameter containment areas, additional structural girder support beams could be built or attached to the tri-pod columns. The multi-purpose rotational barrier units could then be connected to the beams to form a barrier around the oil rig platform. The multi-purpose rotational barrier units can also be attached to oil tankers leaking oil. By attaching the multi-purpose rotational barrier units to the ends of the ship, a floating barrier wall forms to minimize exposure of the leaking oil. Because of the design of the multi-purpose rotational barrier units, when not being used in aquatic environments, they can be utilized along a roadway or at construction sites to protect workers or other pedestrians. The barriers could be placed adjacent to roads or around excavation sites, and attached together using the dumbbell attachment devices, as described previously, or other securing means, such as steel iron pins/sleeves (not illustrated), between barriers if needed.
