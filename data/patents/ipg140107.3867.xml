<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Handheld devices and mobile devices are currently in wide use. Such devices can include, for example, cellular telephones, smart phones, personal digital assistants, multimedia players, palmtop computers, slate or tablet computers and even laptop computers. Many of these devices can easily be connected, over a wide area network (such as the Internet) to services that can be delivered from servers or other remote locations, worldwide.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some of these devices, and particularly the handheld devices, have relatively small display screens. When an application runs in such a space-constrained environment, icons are often used to represent a particular concept and allow for rapid recognition by the user. An icon is a small typographical picture or symbol on a graphical user interface that represents something else, such as a program, command, file, directory (also referred to as a folder) or a device (such as a hard disc drive), etc. The symbol can be a picture or graphic, text or a combination. The symbol is displayed on a computer screen and can be used to navigate a computer system or a mobile device. An icon functions as an electronic hyperlink or file shortcut to access the program or data that it represents.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In many current systems, icons are pre-rendered at design time to correspond, intuitively, to the item that they represent.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in some systems, the items that are to be represented by an icon are created dynamically. For instance, in some customer relations management (CRM) systems, customers can create their own objects, and can also generate customized labels for those objects. Thus, the objects, the icons that represent those objects, and the labels, may not be known at design time so the objects (or other dynamically created items) can only be represented by icons at runtime, or during customization by the customer, or at least after design time.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some current systems, in order to generate an icon that represents an item that was not know at design time, the designer simply pre-defines a plurality of different pictures that can be used at runtime. Then, when the dynamically created item (and its label) is created after design time, the creator selects or specifies which picture is to represent which dynamically created item. Of course, it is impossible to predict all of the different types of items that might be created, and so it can be very difficult to include enough pictures so that one will intuitively represent each of the dynamically created items.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other current approaches, when a label is generated for the dynamically created item, the icon used to represent that item simply includes the entire text of the label. However, where the labels are long, this can present problems for displaying an icon on a relatively small display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Where the text of the label is used instead of, or in addition to a picture, the text can be miniaturized to fit within a display field of an icon that can be adequately displayed on a relatively small display screen. However, this often results in an icon that has text displayed on it, where the text is undesirably small, making it difficult to read.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another conventional approach is to predefine labels, at design time, for the dynamically created items. Again, however, it is nearly impossible to think of a sufficient number of labels such that one can intuitively represent every dynamically created item.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In attempting to generate an icon for a dynamically created item (at the time the dynamically created item is created) one might attempt to simply take the text entered in creating the label for that item, and use only a portion of that text (such as a truncated version of the text or an abbreviation) as the icon. For instance, if the text in the label for an object is &#x201c;customer&#x201d; one may attempt to generate an icon by simply deleting some of the letters from that text to arrive at an icon with the letters &#x201c;cust&#x201d;. While, at first blush, this may appear to be an adequate solution, it can present problems as well. For instance, when the letters in a word or label are truncated in this fashion, they can provide undesirable results. For example, if the text in the label is &#x201c;association&#x201d;, and the rule for generating the icon is to truncate the text after the first three letters, this can result in an informal, or even vulgar, display. The problem can be even compounded when the application in which the icon is deployed is to be used internationally. Even if the truncated letters do not result in an undesirable display in the source language, they can be interpreted differently in different languages, and they may result in an undesirable display in another language.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, where a label for an item to be represented by an icon is customized, the icon is generated to dynamically display a substantial entirety of the label. Thus, at some point, the entire label is displayed, even though only a portion of the label is eventually displayed in the icon.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For instance, the label is scrolled across a display field of the icon. Where the label includes text, the label can be scrolled beginning at the end of the word and ending at the beginning of the word. In this way, the user can see the entire label represented by the icon, before the final display (e.g., of the first few letters) is rendered. In another embodiment, the entire label is first displayed within the icon in relatively small letters, and the display is then changed to dynamically give the perspective of zooming in on just a smaller portion of the label.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a customer relations management (CRM) system <b>10</b>. The dynamic display of an icon described herein can be used in a wide variety of different systems. For instance, it can be deployed in any system where a user customizes labels for classifications of things that are represented by icons. Some examples of these things can be database tables, user names, or any of the other items that can be represented by icons. However, for the sake of example, the dynamic display of icons described herein will be described in the context of CRM system <b>10</b>, without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that CRM system <b>10</b> includes entity creation component <b>12</b>, CRM data store <b>14</b>, and other CRM components <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows that CRM system <b>10</b> is connected to a client device <b>18</b>, such as through network <b>20</b> or directly (as illustrated by arrow <b>22</b>). Client device <b>18</b> is illustratively a mobile device that has components for running the client related features of CRM system <b>10</b> on client device <b>18</b>. These components are collectively labeled as client CRM system <b>24</b>. Client device <b>18</b> also illustratively includes display device <b>26</b>, such as a display screen for displaying graphical user interface items thereon. It will be noted that a variety of different embodiments of client device <b>18</b> are described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref>, and some examples can include cellular telephones, smart phones, personal digital assistants, slate computers, or tablet computers, multimedia players, other handheld or palmtop devices, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates an alternative embodiment in which client CRM system <b>24</b> is hosted (or provided as a service over network <b>20</b>) by CRM system <b>10</b>. This is indicated by client CRM system <b>24</b> being shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">CRM system <b>10</b> is shown connected to a user interface component <b>28</b> that provides user interface displays to user <b>30</b> either directly (as indicated by arrow <b>32</b>) or over a network <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">CRM system <b>10</b> illustratively operates to manage a company's interactions with customers clients, and sales prospects. This management involves using CRM system <b>10</b> to organize, automate and synchronize business processes. In one embodiment, these processes can involve sales activities and also marketing, customer service and technical support. Thus, CRM system <b>10</b> illustratively provides technology and support for creating customer accounts, creating sales accounts, monitoring contacts and leads and a wide variety of other business-related activities that are related to such things as sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In providing these features, CRM system <b>10</b> includes entity creating component <b>12</b> that, itself, includes label creation component <b>36</b>. Entity creation component <b>12</b> allows a user <b>30</b> to create his or her own objects or entities for use by other CRM components <b>16</b>. For instance, entity creation component <b>12</b> allows user <b>30</b> to create a new customer object that can be used to represent a customer. It also allows the user to create new contact objects that represent potential customers, and lead objects that may also represent potential customers. Similarly, entity creation component <b>12</b> allows user <b>30</b> to create sales objects that represent sales or pending transactions, or account objects that represent the account of an individual client or company. Of course, entity creation component <b>12</b> can be used by user <b>30</b> to create substantially any other object that can be used in the operation of CRM system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Label creation component <b>36</b> allows user <b>30</b> to generate a label for a newly created object (or entity). In one embodiment, label creation component <b>36</b> provides a user interface display through UI component <b>28</b>, to user <b>30</b> that includes an input box that allows the user to input or specify a symbol to be used as a label. The symbol can be a picture, another type of graphic or iconographic symbol or text or a combination of these. Where the label is to include text, the input mechanism can be a text box which allows the user to generate the label for a particular entity or object by typing the label into the text box. The user interface display also illustratively allows user <b>30</b> to identify the entity type, enter data associated with that entity, and provide a variety of other attributes for the entity or object that was created. Entity creation component <b>12</b> then illustratively creates an entity record (such as entity record <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that represents the entity or object that was just created by user <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that one illustrative entity record includes attributes that include label <b>42</b> (which corresponds to the text or other symbol entered by using label creation component <b>36</b>) entity type attribute <b>44</b> that identifies the type of the entity just created, data <b>46</b> that includes data (either entered at creation time, or later, or both) represented by the entity just created, and other attributes <b>48</b>, as desired by user <b>30</b>. In addition, in one embodiment, entity creation component <b>12</b> allows the user to set an attribute <b>50</b> that indicates whether this particular entity will be enabled for display on mobile devices. That is, the user can select whether this particular entity will be represented by an icon on mobile device displays, and be accessible through a mobile device <b>18</b> connected to CRM system <b>10</b>. Of course, attributes <b>40</b>-<b>50</b> are illustrative only, and other or different attributes can be used as well. In any case, once the entity record <b>40</b> is created, entity creation component <b>12</b> illustratively stores it in CRM data store <b>14</b> for later use by CRM system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It may happen that the display device <b>26</b> on client device <b>18</b> (on which an icon representing entity record <b>40</b> is to be displayed) may be relatively small. In that case, it may be difficult, as described in the background, to sufficiently display an icon that the user can intuitively associate with this particular entity record <b>40</b>. Therefore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of the operation of client CRM system <b>24</b> (either on client device <b>18</b> or in CRM system <b>10</b>) in rendering the display of an icon representing entity record <b>40</b> on display device <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that client CRM system <b>24</b> first receives an indication to display the icon for entity record <b>40</b>. This is indicated by block <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For instance, it may be that the user launches a CRM application, or a particular CRM function, where displaying the icon representing entity record <b>40</b> is appropriate. That is, assume that the user has opened the sales records for a particular client, using client CRM system <b>24</b>. In that case, assume that the user of client device <b>18</b> has also requested to see the customer accounts for customers within a certain geographic region. Then, icons for an entity record <b>40</b> corresponding to each of those customers will be displayed on display device <b>26</b>, for selection by the user. Thus, client CRM system <b>24</b> will have received an indication from the user (or from the application) to display an icon for the given entity record <b>40</b> being discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Client CRM system <b>24</b> then determines whether the particular entity is one in which the dynamic display capability can be used. For instance, client CRM system <b>24</b> may illustratively examine attribute <b>50</b> in entity record <b>40</b> to determine whether it has been enabled for display on a mobile device. Of course, system <b>24</b> can look at a wide variety of any other types of metadata corresponding to a given entity record to make this determination. For instance, it may be that the dynamic display is only used where the label has reached a sufficient length. By way of example, if the label is a text label and the text label is only three letters, then it may be displayable, even on a relatively small screen, with sufficient size so that dynamic display is not needed. Of course, system <b>24</b> can determine whether dynamic display is to be used in a variety of other ways as well. Determining whether the dynamic display is to be used is indicated by block <b>62</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If, at block <b>62</b>, it is determined that the dynamic display is not to be used, then client CRM system <b>24</b> generates a static display of the icon, simply showing the label for that icon in a display box, or other display field, on the icon. This is indicated by block <b>64</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If, however, at block <b>62</b>, it is determined that dynamic display is to be used for the icon representing a given entity record that is to be displayed on display device <b>26</b>, then client CRM system <b>24</b> first displays the icon by rendering a box or other display portion (or display field) to the display device <b>26</b>. This is indicated by block <b>66</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Then, client CRM system <b>24</b> dynamically displays the label for the given icon that was input by the user when the entity record represented by this icon was created. The label input by the user is dynamically displayed within the rendered box on display device <b>26</b>. This is indicated by block <b>68</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and can take a variety of different forms.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A number of exemplary different forms of generating a dynamic display are discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-12C</figref>. Briefly, however, the dynamic display can be progressive in which the label is scrolled across the rendered box so that the user eventually sees the entirety of the label but only a portion is displayed at any given time, or it can be displayed using a zoom feature in which the user first sees the entirety of the label but then the label is enlarged (given the appearance of zooming in on it) so that only a portion of the label is seen and not the entirety of the label. For instance, where the label is a text label, only the first several letters of the text label are visible within the display field, or the dynamic display can be generated in other ways as well.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows one embodiment for progressively displaying the label to generate the dynamic display within an icon. In the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the client CRM system <b>24</b> first identifies the particular icon to be displayed and accesses the label <b>42</b> for the entity record represented by that icon and then renders only a selected portion of the label in the rendered box, and not the entire label. That is, in an example where the text label is &#x201c;accounts&#x201d;, system <b>24</b> only renders several letters of the label &#x201c;accounts&#x201d; and not the whole word. This is indicated by block <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Then, system <b>24</b> changes the selected portion of the label rendered to obtain a newly selected portion. This is indicated by block <b>72</b>. By way of example, assume that system <b>24</b> first generates the box (or display field) for the icon for the &#x201c;accounts&#x201d; entity record but displays only the last three letters &#x201c;unt&#x201d; in the rendered box for the icon. Then, at block <b>72</b>, system <b>24</b> changes the label so that it is displaying the last four letters &#x201c;count&#x201d; in the box. This gives the appearance of scrolling the display from the back of the label (in this case a word) to the front of the label. Displaying the newly selected portion is indicated by block <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, client CRM system <b>24</b> then determines whether the entire label has been displayed or whether there is more to display. This is indicated by block <b>76</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Continuing with the same example, assume that system <b>24</b> determines that there is more text to display in the &#x201c;account&#x201d; label. In that case, processing returns to block <b>74</b> where system <b>24</b> again changes the portion of the text label that is to be displayed in the box. In this instance, assume that system <b>24</b> has changed it to the first several letters &#x201c;accou&#x201d; and that newly identified portion is then displayed in the rendered box as indicated by block <b>74</b>. By progressively displaying only a portion of the label and then continuously changing the portion displayed and redisplaying that new portion, this gives the appearance of scrolling the label across the rendered box until the whole label has been displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Once client CRM system <b>24</b> determines that there is no more of the label to be displayed, it simply, in one embodiment, maintains display of the current portion of the label as a static display. For instance, where system <b>24</b> has scrolled the &#x201c;accounts&#x201d; text label across the rendered box from the end of the word until the beginning of the word so that only the letters &#x201c;accou&#x201d; are currently being displayed, then it simply pauses and maintains that display until further action is received from the user. This is indicated by block <b>78</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Of course, additional scrolling can be performed as well.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a more detailed flow diagram illustrating the progressive display described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a plurality of screen shots of a displayed icon using the progressive display described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> will now be described in conjunction with one another. They will be described using an icon display for an exemplary entity record that has a text label &#x201c;account&#x201d;, although it will be appreciated that the same technique can be used for substantially any label.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, client CRM system <b>24</b> first identifies a direction to scroll the text of the label. In the embodiment being discussed, the icons are typographic icons, meaning that they are icons with type arranged on them. Therefore, it may be desirable to scroll the text in a particular direction. For instance, if the language being used is a language that is read from left to right, then it may be desired to scroll the text from the end of the text to the beginning of the text. In this way, the user can progressively view the entire text label, but the final display of the text label may be the first few letters of the text label. Alternatively, if the language is a language that is read from right to left, then the label may be progressively scrolled across the icon box from left to right to give the same affect. Similarly, where the language is read from top to bottom or bottom to top, the direction of the scroll may change accordingly. In addition, other directions can be used as well. For instance, regardless of the direction that the text is read, it may be always scrolled from left to right or right to left. Of course, it may be scrolled diagonally, up or down, or the direction can change within the display field of the icon. For instance, the text may first be scrolled in a direction that is diagonally upward and then, halfway through the display field, it can be scrolled in a direction that is diagonally downward. Of course, other scrolling directions can be used as well. Identifying a direction to scroll the text in the label is indicated by block <b>80</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, system <b>24</b> dynamically displays the text to give the illusion of scrolling the text within the display field in the identified direction (identified at block <b>80</b> above). In the embodiment being discussed, the scrolling begins with the end of the text label and proceeds to the start of the text label, although it could begin at the start and proceed to the end as well. In any case, scrolling the text in the identified direction is indicated by block <b>82</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows a number of specific embodiments for the scrolling direction including right-to-left as indicated by block <b>84</b>, left-to-right is indicated by block <b>86</b>, top-to-bottom as indicated by block <b>88</b>, bottom-to-top as indicated by block <b>89</b>, diagonally in any direction as indicated by block <b>90</b>, and other directions as indicated by block <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">One example of scrolling the text is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a plurality of successive screen displays for the icon that represents the &#x201c;account&#x201d; entity record. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that the first screenshot simply includes the rendered box (or display field) <b>94</b> for the icon, with no text in it. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> then shows that, in this embodiment, the scroll is to proceed from left to right, starting with the end of the word and proceeding to the beginning of the word. Therefore, in the next screenshot, box <b>94</b> includes the letter &#x201c;t&#x201d; because it is the final letter in the text label &#x201c;account&#x201d;. This is indicated by block <b>96</b>. The text is continually scrolled through the icon box from the end of the word to the beginning of the word until only the first five letters of the word &#x201c;account&#x201d; are shown. This is indicated by blocks <b>98</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At that point, client CRM system <b>24</b> can continue to display the icon in one of a variety of different ways. For instance, client CRM system <b>24</b> can simply stop scrolling and maintain a static display such as that shown in box <b>104</b>. This is indicated by block <b>106</b>. Alternatively, system <b>24</b> can simply pause the scrolling so that the icon shown at block <b>104</b> is maintained on display device <b>26</b> momentarily, and then the display can proceed back to box <b>94</b> and the scrolling can repeat through boxes <b>96</b>-<b>104</b>. This is indicated by blocks <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and this gives the visual impression that the &#x201c;account&#x201d; text label is continuously scrolled from the end of the word to the beginning, and that scroll is repeated every so often. This is also indicated by blocks <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Alternatively, after the scroll is momentarily paused at block <b>104</b>, the scroll can be reversed. That is, the text label can then be scrolled in a direction from right to left as indicated by blocks <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and <b>128</b>. This gives the impression of the icon scrolling the &#x201c;accounts&#x201d; label from the end of the word to the beginning of the word, pausing momentarily and then reverse scrolling the text label from the beginning of the word to the end of the word. This scrolling can then be repeated as indicated at block <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Reversing the scroll direction is also indicated by block <b>132</b> in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Once the processing reaches either blocks <b>114</b> or <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, then system <b>24</b> determines whether it is to continue the scrolling process. For instance, it may continuously repeat scrolling until some further user interaction is received, or it may simply maintain a static display after the text scrolling has been completed. If scrolling is to be repeated, then processing returns to the output of block <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. If not, then a static display is maintained. This is indicated by block <b>134</b> in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and similar items are similarly numbered. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows that the symbol used as the label includes both text, and a picture or other graphic or non-text symbol represented by the box preceding the text. Of course, the label could be only a picture or other non-text symbol as well.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a different type of dynamic display, other than the progressive display described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, instead of a scrolling feature, a zooming feature is used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows successive screen shots that show the display field for the textual icon representing the &#x201c;account&#x201d; entity record. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> will now be described in conjunction with one another. Of course, while they are described with respect to displaying the text label &#x201c;account&#x201d; the processing may be the same for any other label and the &#x201c;account&#x201d; text label is used by way of example only. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, system <b>24</b> first displays the entire text label within the rendered box (or display field) for the icon. This is indicated by block <b>136</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and is shown at screenshot <b>138</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> that the entire text label &#x201c;account&#x201d; is displayed within the rendered box. However, it may be that this requires the size of the font used to display &#x201c;account&#x201d; to be undesirably small, especially on a small screen device.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Therefore, system <b>24</b> controls the display in the icon box to give the illusion of zooming in on the text &#x201c;account&#x201d; so that, eventually, only the first portion of the text remains displayed in the icon box. This is indicated by block <b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and is shown by the progressive displays <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. These displays show that the font size of the text displayed in the icon box continues to grow until only the first three letters of the text label &#x201c;acc&#x201d; fill the entire icon box. It can thus be seen that by using this dynamic display, the user is first shown the entire text label, but then the text label is continuously increased in size (giving the illusion that the icon box is zooming in on the text label) until only the first several letters of the text label are visible within the icon box.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At that point, system <b>24</b> can control the display in a number of different ways. For instance, it can simply stop as indicated by block <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and maintain a static display such as that shown by box <b>148</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Alternatively, system <b>24</b> can pause the display momentarily as indicated by block <b>152</b> and then repeat the display generated at boxes <b>138</b>-<b>140</b>. This is indicated by block <b>154</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. That is, system <b>24</b> can continue to display the icon by reverting back to displaying the entire text label (at block <b>138</b>) and then zooming in on the text label again as indicated by boxes <b>142</b>-<b>148</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Pausing and then repeating the zoom process is indicated by blocks <b>156</b> and <b>158</b> in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Alternatively, after the display shown in icon box <b>148</b> is generated, system <b>24</b> can reverse the zoom process so that the displays are generated in reverse order from boxes <b>148</b> to <b>138</b>. This is indicated by block <b>160</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Reversing the zoom is also indicated by block <b>162</b> in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">System <b>24</b> then determines whether the zooming display is to be continued. If so, and processing reverts to either block <b>158</b> or <b>162</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and the zoom process is either repeated or reversed and zooming continues. This is indicted by block <b>164</b> in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and similar items are similarly numbered. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows that the symbol used as the label includes both text and a picture or other graphic or non-text symbol represented by the box preceding the text. Of course, the label could be only a picture or other graphic or non-text symbol as well.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one illustrative embodiment, system <b>24</b> can combine zooming and scrolling. For instance, after the zooming dynamic display (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) is generated, and, the icon box display is that shown by box <b>148</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, then system <b>24</b> can scroll the text label as discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. This is indicated by block <b>166</b> in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Of course, it will be noted that system <b>24</b> can first scroll and then zoom the text display so that it can alternate scrolling and zooming or any other combinations of dynamic display as well. Zooming and then scrolling is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as but one example of this.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of the operation of system <b>24</b> where a user provides an input to modify the icon behavior. That is, in various embodiments, client device <b>18</b> can include user input mechanisms (such as a touch sensitive screen, keypads, user input buttons, or actuators, or other user interface elements) that allow a user to interact with the icon. In various embodiments, functionality is provided by system <b>24</b> to allow the user to provide a user input to modify the dynamic display behavior of a given icon. A variety of different ways for doing this are described with respect to the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and are shown in the pictorial user interface displays of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-12C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">While the behavior modification described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is described in terms of the user providing a touch sensitive gesture, the same functions can be performed with respect to the user providing other user inputs such as through a hardware keypad or other user input mechanisms. Modifying the icon behavior is described with respect to the user input being a touch sensitive gesture for the sake of example only.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> first shows that, once the icon is displayed with the dynamic textual display, device <b>18</b> receives a user input to modify the icon behavior. This is indicated by block <b>168</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. It can take a wide variety of different forms. For instance, where the display device <b>26</b> of client device <b>18</b> is a touch sensitive display, then the user input may be a touch gesture on the display device. Alternatively, the user input may take the form of the actuation of a soft button, or a hardware button, or other hardware input, such as a scroll button, or such as by manipulating a pointer on display device <b>26</b> and selecting a feature from a dropdown menu, activating a radio button, or a wide variety of other user inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Once the user input is received, system <b>24</b> determines whether the user input is a touch gesture on a touch sensitive screen. This is indicated by block <b>70</b>. For instance, where display device <b>26</b> is a relatively small screen, and the user touches an icon, the user touch may block the user's ability to view the label of the icon. That is, the user's finger may be covering almost the entire icon. Therefore, in one embodiment, if the user input is a touch sensitive gesture relative to the icon (as determined at block <b>170</b>), then client CRM system <b>24</b> adjusts the display so that the user's touch does not block the icon. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows one embodiment of this. For instance, the dashed box <b>172</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates the position on a user interface display screen <b>174</b> of an icon displaying the &#x201c;accounts&#x201d; text label. When the user's finger <b>176</b> touches that icon, then system <b>24</b> adjusts the position of the icon upward, in the direction generally indicated by arrow <b>178</b>, so that the icon appears just above the user's finger <b>176</b>, as indicated by icon <b>180</b>, so the user's finger does not block the icon. In one embodiment, the icon <b>180</b> is still maintained in close proximity to the touch gesture so that the user intuitively knows that he or she is still controlling that particular icon <b>180</b>. Adjusting the display so the user touch does not block the icon is indicated by block <b>182</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">System <b>24</b> then modifies the icon behavior based on the user input. This is indicated by block <b>184</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For instance, it may be that by moving the user's finger in the up or down direction, the user can control the speed at which the dynamic display proceeds. That is, if the icon is using the dynamic display according to a display pattern that exhibits a scrolling behavior, the user moving his or her finger in a predetermined direction may control the speed of the scroll. If the icon is using the dynamic display according to a display pattern that exhibits a zooming behavior, the user moving his or her finger in that direction may control the speed of the zoom. Adjusting the dynamic display speed based on the user input is indicated by block <b>186</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The user input may also indicate the user's desire to change the dynamic display direction. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, if the user moves his or her finger <b>176</b> in the direction generally indicated by arrow <b>188</b>, then the direction of the dynamic display (e.g., the scroll) can be moved in that direction as well. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, if the user moves his or her finger <b>176</b> in the direction generally indicated by arrow <b>190</b>, then the scroll direction is changed in that direction so that the beginning of the &#x201c;account&#x201d; text is displayed in icon <b>180</b>. Of course, the same can be done with respect to the zoom features. If the user moves his or her finger in one direction, then this can correspond to a &#x201c;zoom in&#x201d; direction. Alternatively, if the user moves his or her finger in a different direction, this can correspond to a &#x201c;zoom out&#x201d; direction. Adjusting the dynamic display direction based on the user input is indicated by block <b>192</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The user input can also directly correspond to a position of the text being displayed in the icon, instead of simply changing direction. That is, assume that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 10C</figref>, when the user moves his or her finger <b>176</b> in a direction indicated by arrow <b>188</b>, that does not change the direction of the scroll, but changes the absolute position of the text within icon <b>180</b>. If the user moves finger <b>176</b> to the left, then the last several letters in the &#x201c;account&#x201d; text will be displayed in a static way until the user does something else. If the user then moves finger <b>176</b> to the right (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>) then the first few letters of the &#x201c;account&#x201d; text will be displayed in a static way, until the user provides another input. This gives the perception that the user's finger is tethered to text so that the text can be moved through icon box <b>180</b> simply by moving finger <b>176</b> in either direction. Adjusting the position of the label text being displayed based on the user input is indicated by block <b>194</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Adjusting the icon behavior in other ways, based on the user input, is indicated by block <b>196</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-12C</figref> show a number of alternative embodiments for doing this.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> show an embodiment in which the user input is a different kind of touch gesture. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the user places two fingers <b>176</b> and <b>200</b> (such as the index finger and thumb) on the touch sensitive screen. In that case, system <b>24</b> moves the display icon <b>180</b> upwardly so that the user's fingers are not blocking the icon. Then, the user can move fingers <b>176</b> and <b>200</b> in a pinching movement where the fingers are brought closer together as indicated by arrows <b>202</b> or the user can move fingers <b>176</b> and <b>200</b> in a spreading motion where the fingers are moved further apart from one another as indicated by arrows <b>204</b>. This gesture can be used to control the dynamic display in any of a wide variety of different ways.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the dynamic display is the zoom in and zoom out display discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. By exercising the pinching gesture indicated by arrows <b>202</b>, the user can control system <b>24</b> to zoom in on the text in icon <b>180</b>, in one embodiment. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> and system <b>24</b> has zoomed in on the first several letters of the &#x201c;account&#x201d; text label.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Then, by moving the fingers in the opposite direction indicated by arrows <b>204</b>, the user can control system <b>24</b> to zoom out on the text label and display the entire label. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> where icon <b>180</b> now displays the entire text label &#x201c;account&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> show another alternative embodiment for controlling system <b>24</b> to modify the icon behavior. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, icon <b>180</b> is a movable box. As the user moves finger <b>176</b> in either direction, the entire icon <b>180</b> moves and displays different texts. This gives the impression that the text of the label is already written on the display screen of display device <b>26</b>, but it is only revealed when icon <b>180</b> travels over it. This can be analogized to icon <b>180</b> being the beam of a flashlight. When the beam hits the letters in the text label, those letters become visible. Otherwise, they are not visible.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Thus, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, icon <b>180</b> shows the first three letters of the &#x201c;account&#x201d; text label. When the user moves finger <b>176</b> in the direction generally indicated by arrow <b>210</b>, the position of the icon <b>180</b> changes on screen <b>26</b> in the corresponding direction. This is indicated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. It can be seen that the position of icon <b>180</b> on screen <b>26</b> has shifted and the corresponding text being displayed within icon <b>180</b> has also changed to the central three letters of the &#x201c;account&#x201d; text label. As the user continues to move finger <b>176</b> in the direction indicated by arrow <b>210</b>, the position of icon <b>180</b> continues to shift in that direction as well, and the text revealed in icon <b>180</b> shifts to the end of the text label &#x201c;account&#x201d; to eventually reveal only the last three letters. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>. As the user moves his or her finger back and forth in either direction, the &#x201c;flashlight beam&#x201d; of icon <b>180</b> moves in that direction and reveals different, corresponding parts of the text label.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In another embodiment, particular dynamic display patterns for a given entity record <b>40</b> can vary based on the type of entity record or based on any other portion or attributes of metadata. For instance, some entity records may better be scrolled while others are better displayed using zoom functionality. Similarly, the background color or the color of the text may be changed based on the type of entity record or based on any other item of metadata. Therefore, when system <b>24</b> is generating the icons to dynamically display the text label, the colors of the words and backgrounds or any other typographical elements can be changed based on the metadata and the entity record, or in other ways, as well.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> show a number of different embodiments for client device <b>18</b>.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It will also be noted that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, client CRM system <b>24</b> can reside elsewhere, other than on client device <b>18</b>. While the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that client CRM system <b>24</b> resides on client device <b>18</b>, it could be embodied elsewhere as well, such as in a cloud computing environment. Cloud computing provides computation, software, data access, and storage services that do not require end-user knowledge of the physical location or configuration of the system that delivers the services. In various embodiments, cloud computing delivers the services over a wide area network, such as the internet, using appropriate protocols. For instance, cloud computing providers deliver applications over a wide area network and they can be accessed through a web browser or any other computing component. Business software (such as some components of CRM system <b>10</b>) as well as the corresponding data, can be stored on servers at a remote location. The computing resources in a cloud computing environment can be consolidated at a remote data center location or they can be dispersed. Cloud computing infrastructures can deliver services through shared data centers, even though they appear as a single point of access for the user. Thus, the functions described herein can be provided from a service provider at a remote location using a cloud computing architecture. Alternatively, they can be provided from a conventional server, or they can be installed on client device <b>18</b> directly.</p>
