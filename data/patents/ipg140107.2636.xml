<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a composition for forming a gate insulating film for a thin-film transistor, and further to an organic transistor produced using the composition for forming a gate insulating film for a thin-film transistor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">At present, there is developed, as a flexible device such as electronic paper, an electronic device using a plastic substrate such as a polycarbonate and a polyethylene terephthalate. From the problem that these plastic substrates are slightly elongated/contracted during heat application, an enhancement of heat resistance (low thermal expansion characteristics) thereof has become an urgent necessity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, in order to relieve a thermal stress itself applied on a plastic substrate, a production process of an electronic device that is performed at lower temperatures is also developed. One of processes for which a high temperature is mostly required in the production of electronic devices is a process of forming/curing a gate insulating film of an organic transistor, and it is required that the production process of a gate insulating film is performed at lower temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Here, as the method for forming a gate insulating film at lower temperatures, there are disclosed a method of anodizing the surface of an electrode (see Patent Document 1), a method by a chemical vapor deposition method (see Patent Document 2), and the like. However, a production process of these methods is cumbersome.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, a material capable of being easily formed into a film by application by a spin coating method, a printing method, and other applying methods, is desired. As an example of production of a gate insulating film by application, there is a method including applying a solution containing poly-4-vinylphenol and poly(melamine-formaldehyde) by spin-coating and then curing the solution at 200&#xb0; C. (see Non-patent Document 1). However, in this method, the treating temperature is as high as 200&#xb0; C., and at this temperature, the effects of a thermal expansion of a plastic substrate remarkably materialize, so that it is difficult to apply this method to the production of electronic paper or the like for which a fine pixel is required.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, a soluble polyimide is known as one of insulating materials which can be produced at a relatively low temperature and for which high insulation properties can be expected. A polyimide has generally a high thermal decomposition temperature and high electric resistance, so that the polyimide is widely used as an insulating material for an electronic device. For example, there is disclosed a method using a polyimide cured at 180&#xb0; C. as a gate insulating film for a high-precision organic transistor (see Non-patent Document 2).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, particularly in a thin-film transistor excellent in mechanical flexibility represented by an organic transistor, for the purpose of reducing the production cost, the formation of an electrode or a wiring by irradiation with an ultraviolet ray having high energy is performed.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, in order to obtain a highly reliable organic transistor, quality required for an insulating film material is extremely high, that is, capable of being produced by a simple process, for example, at a relatively low temperature such as 180&#xb0; C. or less, and having high solvent resistance, high light resistance, and high insulation properties.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, even though in a production process of an organic transistor, it is important to perform an insulating film producing process at lower temperatures, it cannot be mentioned that there are many options of the insulating film material capable of being produced by application and by a process at 180&#xb0; C. or less and having advantageous electrical characteristics. Moreover, even a soluble polyimide that has been regarded as capable of satisfying all of these conditions has problems of having a low solubility in a solvent for the application and of having low light resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel composition for forming a gate insulating film taking into consideration also electrical characteristics after other processes such as wiring by irradiation with an ultraviolet ray and the like during the production of an organic transistor using a gate insulating film, particularly from the viewpoint of practicality.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As a result of assiduous research intended to overcome these disadvantages, the inventors of the present invention have found that a gate insulating film can easily be formed by forming a cured film from a composition containing a compound having two or more blocked isocyanate groups in one molecule thereof and a compound containing a specified repeating unit having a triazine-trione ring, and the formed gate insulating film has satisfactory insulation properties and characteristics excellent in solvent resistance and light resistance that have been unsatisfactory with respect to a conventional insulating film material.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Hereinafter, the present invention is described more in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The composition for forming a gate insulating film for a thin-film transistor of the present invention contains as the component (i), an oligomer compound or a polymer compound containing a repeating unit having a structure in which a nitrogen atom of a triazine-trione ring is bonded to a nitrogen atom of another triazine-trione ring through a hydroxyalkylene group, and as the component (ii), a compound having two or more blocked isocyanate groups in one molecule thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">[Component (i)]</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The component (i) used in the present invention is an oligomer compound or a polymer compound containing a repeating unit having a structure in which a nitrogen atom of a triazine-trione ring is bonded to a nitrogen atom of another triazine-trione ring through a hydroxyalkylene group, and is preferably a compound containing a repeating unit of Formula (1):</p>

</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In Formula (1), R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are independently a C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl group, a C<sub>3-6 </sub>alkenyl group, a monovalent organic group containing a C<sub>6-10 </sub>aromatic ring, a trifluoromethyl group, or a pentafluoroethyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, and A<sub>3 </sub>are independently a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, or an ethyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">n is an integer of 2 to 500.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Examples of the C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl group include a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n-pentyl group, an isopropyl group, and a cyclohexyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Examples of the C<sub>3-6 </sub>alkenyl group include an ally group, a 2-butenyl group, a 3-butenyl group, and a 2-pentenyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Examples of the monovalent organic group containing a C<sub>6-10 </sub>aromatic ring include a phenyl group, a benzyl group, and a naphthyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For the oligomer compound or the polymer compound used in the present invention, it is required to have high transparency in an ultraviolet region. This is because the gate insulating film for an organic transistor is necessary to be excellent in light resistance for the purpose of preventing the degradation of insulation properties due to irradiation with an ultraviolet ray. Here, the light resistance means that the insulation properties of the gate insulating film are not degraded even when the gate insulating film is irradiated with an ultraviolet ray having a wavelength of 254 nm in a high energy amount (several J/cm<sup>2</sup>) that is necessary for changing hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the gate insulating film. Accordingly, it is considered that when the gate insulating film is transparent regarding a wavelength of around 254 nm, the gate insulating film does not absorb energy, so that the degradation of the insulation properties thereof is difficult to be caused.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described above, it is preferred that also in a repeating unit of Formula (1), the substituents of R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are substituents having high transparency in an ultraviolet region. Optimal examples of such a substituent include an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a fluoroalkyl group, and an alicyclic group such as a cyclohexyl group. An aromatic group such as a phenyl group, a benzyl group, and a naphthyl group can also be used so long as the transparency is not impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The optimal molecular weight of the oligomer compound or the polymer compound used in the present invention is not particularly limited. However, when the molecular weight is too small, the solvent solubility of the compound becomes too high, so that there is a fear that the compound cannot endure a production process of a transistor. On the other hand, when the molecular weight is too large, the solvent solubility becomes too low, so that there is a fear that a composition for forming a gate insulating film for a thin-film transistor with a high solid content concentration cannot be obtained. Therefore, a preferred molecular weight is, for example, 1,000 to 200,000, preferably 5,000 to 50,000, as the weight average molecular weight (in terms of polystyrene).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Although the method for obtaining the oligomer compound or the polymer compound used in the present invention is not particularly limited, by subjecting, for example, a compound of Formula (8) below and a compound of Formula (9) below to a condensation-polymerization reaction in an appropriate organic solvent, the compounds can be obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Like an ordinary condensation-polymerization reaction, as the molar ratio becomes closer to 1:1, the polymerization degree and the molecular weight of the generated compound increase.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Although the thus obtained reaction solution may be used as it is for the composition for forming a gate insulating film for a thin-film transistor, the reaction solution contains a reaction catalyst, an unreacted monomer, and the like, so that it is preferred that the reaction product is recovered, washed, and then used for the composition for forming a gate insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As the recovery of the reaction product, a method including charging the reaction solution into a stirred poor solvent to precipitate the reaction product and filtering the precipitated reaction product, is simple. The poor solvent used at this time is not particularly limited and examples of the poor solvent include methanol, hexane, heptane, ethanol, toluene, water, and ether. It is preferred that after the precipitate is filtered and recovered, the reaction product is washed with the above poor solvent. The recovered reaction product can be dried under normal pressure or reduced pressure at normal temperature or by heating so that the recovered reaction product is brought into a powder state.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">By repeating twice to ten times such an operation that the above reaction product in the powder state is further dissolved in a good solvent, followed by reprecipitation in a poor solvent, impurities in the reaction product can also be further reduced.

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">By applying the composition for forming a gate insulating film for a thin-film transistor of the present invention on a general-purpose plastic substrate such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate, polyether sulfone, polyethylene naphthalate, and polyimide, a glass substrate, or the like by a dipping method, a spin coating method, a transfer printing method, a roll coating method, an inkjet method, a spraying method, a brush-applying method, or the like and then by pre-drying the composition on a hot plate, in an oven, or the like, a coating film can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Then, by subjecting this coating film to heating treatment (baking), a cured film capable of being used as a gate insulating film is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Although the method for the above heating treatment is not particularly limited, examples thereof include a method of performing the heating treatment using a hot plate or an oven in an appropriate atmosphere, that is, in air, an inert gas such as nitrogen, vacuum, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The baking temperature is preferably 40&#xb0; C. or more, more preferably 150&#xb0; C. or more, from the viewpoint of reducing a remaining solvent in the coating film. Taking into consideration the heat resistance of a plastic substrate, baking is performed more desirably at 180&#xb0; C. or less.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Baking may be performed by varying the baking temperature in two or more steps. By performing baking stepwise, the uniformity of the cured film can further be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The thus obtained gate insulating film of the present invention has a film thickness of preferably 5 to 5,000 nm, more preferably 50 to 1,000 nm, most preferably 200 to 600 nm. When the gate insulating film is too thin, the film causes a dielectric breakdown in a low electric field and thus, a transistor containing such a gate insulating film cannot function as the transistor. On the other hand, when the gate insulating film is too thick, a high voltage becomes necessary for functioning as a transistor, and therefore, the gate insulating film is desirably formed in the above range of film thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Here, when by one process of application and heating treatment, a cured film (gate insulating film) having a desired thickness cannot be obtained, the process of application and heating treatment may be repeated until the gate insulating film obtains a desired film thickness.</p>

It was found that the insulating film composed of the composition A had a specific resistance of 1&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>&#x3a9;cm, which is a specific resistance not less than 10<sup>15 </sup>&#x3a9;cm required for the insulating film for an electronic device, so that the insulating film exhibits excellent characteristics.

<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Using the same procedure as that in Example 3, a gate insulating film composed of the composition A was obtained.

<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Here, for calculating the exposing amount on the gate insulating film, the illuminance of an ultraviolet ray was measured using an illuminometer (manufactured by OAI, MODEL 306) in which a probe for Deep UV having a peak sensitivity at 253.7 nm was fitted and the measured illuminance was 45 to 50 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Next, on a substrate having an insulating film irradiated with an ultraviolet ray at 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, an aluminum electrode was laminated using the same procedure as that in Example 3 to prepare a sample for evaluating light resistance.</p>

<heading id="h-0035" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">To a glass substrate (2.5 cm square, 0.7 mm thickness) with ITO, the composition A prepared in Example 1 was dropped from a syringe with a filter having a pore diameter of 0.2 &#x3bc;m and the composition was subjected to heating treatment (pre-drying) for 5 minutes to volatilize the organic solvent. Next, the resulting coating film was baked on a hot plate of 180&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes to obtain a gate insulating film having a film thickness of about 400 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The capacitance C of the gate insulating film was found to be 7.7&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>(F/cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Next, on the gate insulating film, a semiconductor layer was formed.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">First, poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (hereinafter, called P3HT) was dissolved in m-xylene in a concentration of 2% by mass to prepare a coating solution of P3HT, and in a nitrogen atmosphere, the coating solution was applied on the above gate insulating film by a spin coating method. Then, in order to completely volatilize the solvent, the resulting coating film was subjected to heating treatment at 105&#xb0; C. in a vacuum state for 60 minutes to prepare a semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Further, on the semiconductor layer (P3HT film), gold was laminated in a thickness of about 80 nm using a vacuum deposition apparatus to form a source/drain electrode having a channel length L of 90 &#x3bc;m and a channel width W of 2 mm to complete an organic transistor. Here, the cross sectional view of an organic thin-film transistor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> corresponds to the organic transistor of Example 5.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">At this time, the conditions during the vacuum deposition of the electrode were at room temperature, at a vacuum degree of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Pa or less, and at a deposition rate of gold of 0.1 nm/sec or less.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">As described above, the characteristics of the drain current and the gate voltage of the electrical characteristics of the obtained organic transistor in vacuum were evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In detail, the source/drain voltage (VD) was set at &#x2212;40 V and a value of the current after retaining the voltage for 1 second until the current was satisfactorily stabilized while changing the gate voltage (VG) from +30 V to &#x2212;40 V with a 2 V step, was recorded as a measured value of the drain current. Here, for the measurement, a semiconductor parameter analyzer (HP4156C; manufactured by Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was used.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">As the thus measured characteristics (V<sub>G</sub>&#x2212;I<sub>D </sub>characteristics) of the drain current relative to the gate voltage, when the gate voltage was decreased to minus, a large increase of the drain current was obtained, so that P3HT operated as a p-type semiconductor. The result is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Generally, the drain current I<sub>D </sub>in a saturated state can be expressed by the equation below. That is, the mobility &#x3bc; of an organic semiconductor can be obtained from the slope of a graph made by plotting a square root of an absolute value of the drain current I<sub>D </sub>on the ordinate axis and plotting the gate voltage V<sub>G </sub>on the abscissa axis.
<br/>

</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In the above equation: W is a channel width of the transistor; L is a channel length of the transistor; C is a capacitance of the gate insulating film; V<sub>T </sub>is a threshold voltage of the transistor; and &#x3bc; is a mobility. The mobility &#x3bc; of P3HT was calculated based on this equation and was found to be 2&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs. The threshold voltage was found to be +3V and the ratio (on/off ratio) of an on state and an off state was found to be in the order of 10<sup>3</sup>. Here, the hysteresis was not observed. Until here, all of the evaluations of the organic transistor were performed in vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Next, the organic transistor was exposed to the atmosphere for 1 minute, and in the same manner as described above, the characteristics of the drain current and the gate voltage were evaluated. The result thereof is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Although the drain current value shifted to a high current side, the on/off ratio and the hysteresis did not change and advantageous characteristics thereof were obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">In other words, it was exhibited that the gate insulating film obtained from the composition A is applicable as a gate insulating film for an organic transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The above result is summarized in Table 2.</p>
