<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to sensors for detecting corrosion in electrically conductive materials, and more particularly to a multi-electrode sensor fabricated in thin-film form.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Corrosion is a natural process, and at the molecular level, involves a metal atom M being oxidized. The atom loses one or more electrons and leaves the bulk metal, M&#x2192;M<sup>m+</sup>+me<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. The lost electrons are conducted through the bulk metal to another site where they reduce (i.e. combine with) a reducible species such as a dissolved gas or a positively charged ion G<sup>+</sup> that is in contact with the bulk metal, N+ne<sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x2192;N<sup>n&#x2212;</sup> and G<sup>m+</sup>+me<sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x2192;G.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The site where metal atoms lose electrons is called the anode, and the site where electrons are transferred to the reducible species is called the cathode. These sites can be located close to each other on the metal's surface, or far apart depending on the circumstances. When the anodic and cathodic sites are continuous, the corrosion is more or less uniform across the surface. When these sites are far apart, the anodic sites corrode locally.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A corrosion path is essentially an electric circuit, because there is a flow of current between the cathode and anode sites. In order for a current to flow, Kirchoff's circuit laws require that a circuit be closed and that there exists a driving potential (voltage). Part of the corrosion circuit is the base metal itself; the rest of the circuit exists in an external conductive solution (i.e. an electrolyte) in contact with the metal. This electrolyte takes away the oxidized metal ions from the anode and provides a reduction species (either nonmetalic atoms or metallic ions) to the cathode. Both the cathode and anode sites are immersed in an electrolyte for the corrosion circuit to be complete.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In corroding systems, potential gradients can be created by a number of mechanisms. These include differences in the free energy or the related electrochemical potentials for different reactions and gradients in the concentration of charged species in the solution. When two electrodes exhibiting differing potentials are electrically connected, a current flows in the external circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are various approaches to monitoring corrosion. Electrochemical approaches rely on the above-described electrochemical corrosion principles and the measurement of potentials or currents to monitor corrosion damage.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An emerging corrosion monitoring technology makes use of multi-electrode array sensors. Examples of such sensors are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,593 to Tan, entitled &#x201c;Method and Apparatus for Measuring Localized Corrosion and Other Heterogeneous Electrochemical Processes&#x201d;, and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,683,463 to L. Yang, entitled &#x201c;Sensor Array for Electrochemical Corrosion Monitoring&#x201d;. These arrays may be used to study spatio-temporal patterns at corrosion sites on metals.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following description is directed to a &#x201c;coupled multi-electrode array sensor&#x201d;, fabricated using techniques that result in a planarized sensor design. In other words, as compared to other multi-electrode sensor designs, the electrodes and leads are approximately planar, a result of being fabricated &#x201c;bottom up&#x201d; upon the same backing.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The design facilitates use of the sensor under paint or other coatings or under insulation, to detect corrosion of a metal surface under paint or some other type of coating, as well as in occluded regions (crevices) previously unreachable by coupled multielectrode array sensors. For purposes of this description, the sensor is described as being located in a &#x201c;subsurface&#x201d;, which means a location that is under or in a coating or under some other type of overlying material.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An advantage of the invention is that corrosion under a coating can be detected without the need to strip the coating. The sensor can be embedded under the coating to reliably measure the corrosion rate, and to provide early warning of corrosion. The design of the sensor excludes the need to penetrate a coating to measure corrosion, and when attached to the appropriate electronics, the sensor may transmit real time corrosion rate signals, via a non contact (wireless) signal, such as a radio frequency signal. The use of the sensor saves time in detecting corrosion problems. It also provides real time assessment of structural integrity so that maintenance can be scheduled before breakdowns occur.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Corrosion monitoring of a particular structure can be done using one or more sensors at strategically placed locations in conjunction with a variety of receiver types. Various examples of receivers are a hand held monitoring device, a device on-board a vehicle whose metallic structure is being monitored, or a remote monitoring station.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A feature of localized corrosion under coatings is that it occurs in isolated areas. It often consists of areas of small lateral dimension compared to depth. The sensor described herein is particularly suited for this type of detection. Unlike galvanic sensors, it need not operate at an electrochemical potential that is raised relative to the corrosion condition under paint or other coatings.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the basic principle of operation of a coupled multi-electrode sensor <b>10</b>. Sensor <b>10</b> is a &#x201c;wire electrode&#x201d; type sensor, such as those described in the patents referenced in the Background.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Multiple sensing electrodes <b>11</b> are typically made from the same material as used for a given test material, that is, the material whose corrosion (or other electrochemical process) is of interest. At least a portion of a surface of each electrode <b>11</b> is exposed to the corrosion. The electrodes <b>11</b> are electrically isolated from each other by an insulating material <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The electrodes <b>11</b> are connected to a common node (coupling joint <b>12</b>) through resistors <b>13</b>. Each electrode <b>11</b> is connected to an associated resistor <b>13</b>. As explained below, the electrical circuitry (including resistors <b>13</b> and their common coupling node <b>12</b>) is used with additional instrumentation to measure the electrical activity to an from the electrodes <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When a metal undergoes non-uniform (heterogeneous) corrosion, particularly localized corrosion such as pitting corrosion or crevice corrosion, electrons are released from the anodic sites where the metal corrodes and travel to the cathodic sites where the metal corrodes less or does not corrode.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a coupled multi-electrode sensor, there are multiple miniature electrodes. Statistically, some of the electrodes have properties like the anodic sites and others have properties like the cathodic sites of the corroding metal. When the electrodes are electrically isolated from each other but coupled together by connecting each of them to a common joint through an external circuit, the electrodes with anodic properties simulate the anodic areas, and the electrodes with cathodic properties simulate the cathodic areas of the corroding metal. Electrons released from the anodic electrodes are forced to flow through the external circuit to the cathodic electrodes. Thus, anodic currents flow into the more corroding electrodes, and cathodic currents flow out of the less corroding or non-corroding electrodes. The resulting electrical currents are measured, and the localized or non-uniform corrosion rates are determined by an appropriately programmed analyzer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Using a coupled multi-electrode sensor, such as sensor <b>10</b>, corrosion sensing directly measures actual corrosion in real time. The corrosion phenomena triggers the currents; no external electrical stimuli is required. The electrical activity between electrodes is monitored, rather than actively probed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a planarized coupled multi-electrode sensor <b>20</b> in accordance with the invention. As explained below, sensor <b>20</b> is planarized in the sense that its electrode surfaces and their electrical connections are approximately planar. However, the principles of operation are the same as for the generalized description of the coupled multi-electrode sensor <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each electrode is structurally identical, so that the measured electrical responses of the electrodes can be easily compared and analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, sensor <b>20</b> has four electrode pads <b>21</b> fabricated upon a thin backing <b>23</b> in a square pattern. However, in other embodiments, there may be any number of electrode pads <b>21</b> in any arbitrary or geometric pattern. An electrical lead <b>22</b> connects each pad <b>21</b> to auxiliary electronic circuitry, such as described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As described above, the pads <b>21</b> and electrodes <b>22</b> permit sensor <b>20</b> to simulate a single metal electrode for corrosion monitoring purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Backing <b>23</b> may be a thin film material, with an example of a suitable material being a polymer. Typical characteristics of backing <b>23</b> are that it is flexible, non electrically conductive, and chemically inert. A specific example of a suitable thin film backing <b>23</b> is a polyimide, such as the KAPTON&#xae; polyimide manufactured by E.I. duPont de Nemours and Company.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Typically, electrodes <b>21</b> are fabricated from material similar to the material whose corrosion is being monitored. Examples of such materials are iron, aluminum, magnesium, and their alloys. For example, for monitoring a carbon steel structure, electrode pads <b>21</b> would be made from carbon steel. In some situations, it may be appropriate to use a material that is analogous to the material of interest, or any material at all, in the sense that the electrical activity between electrodes will provide the desired information about the electrochemical environment, regardless of the particular composition of the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Electrode pads <b>21</b> may be disk-shaped, but other pad geometries are possible. Electrode pads <b>21</b> may be made in geometries as small as 100 micrometers in thickness or even smaller, which facilitates placement of the sensor into small crevices.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Where backing <b>23</b> is a thin film, electrodes <b>21</b> may be deposited using thin film deposition techniques, such as evaporation or sputtering, used for depositing metals as thin films. Alternatively, the electrode pads <b>21</b> and/or leads <b>22</b> may be machined or otherwise formed from a larger piece of material, then attached to the substrate <b>23</b>. The attachment of pads <b>21</b> to leads <b>22</b>, if separately fabricated, may be by means of a conductive epoxy.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As an alternative to a thin film, backing <b>23</b> may be made from a more rigid substrate material such as a silicon or ceramic material. In the case of a silicon backing material, conventional fabrication techniques such as those used for the manufacture of integrated circuits could be used for substrate formation (for backing <b>23</b>), and for patterning and deposition of the electrodes <b>21</b> and leads <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated, the circuit layout of sensor <b>20</b> has an electrical lead <b>22</b> to be made to each electrode <b>21</b>. These leads <b>22</b> are electrically insulated from each other by being non touching and by being separated by a non conductive material. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, these leads <b>22</b> are &#x201c;on-chip&#x201d; in the sense that they are on the same backing as the electrodes. Leads <b>22</b> extend to the perimeter of the array to permit connection to external electrical leads, which in turn, permit electrical activity between the electrode pads <b>21</b> to be monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In general, electrodes and/or leads <b>22</b> may be fabricated in or on backing <b>23</b> in any number of ways. However, as explained below, regardless of the fabrication method, eventually at least a portion of each electrode pad <b>21</b> is exposed to the corrosion environment.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The electrical leads <b>22</b> are insulated from the environment being monitored. This eliminates galvanic corrosion and maintains electrical integrity of the sensor <b>20</b>. As an example of suitable insulation, sensor <b>20</b> could be coated with or embedded or sealed in a non conductive material, with only pads <b>21</b> exposed to the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate another example of a thin film sensor <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, there are six electrode pads <b>31</b>, each having an associated lead <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As in the case of sensor <b>20</b>, sensor <b>30</b> has electrode pads <b>31</b> and leads <b>32</b> fabricated upon, or attached to, a thin film or other planar backing <b>33</b>. At least a portion of each pad <b>31</b> is exposed to the corrosive environment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sensor <b>30</b> is shown as being &#x201c;wired-out&#x201d; to resistors <b>34</b> between the electrodes <b>31</b>. As explained above, quantitative measurements are taken by measuring the voltage across resistors <b>34</b>. Resistors <b>34</b> are electrically connected to a common node, which is then electrically connected to a transmitter <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates resistors <b>34</b> and transmitter <b>35</b> as not being attached to backing <b>33</b>. However, in various embodiments, resistors <b>34</b> and/or transmitter <b>35</b> may be physically integrated parts of sensor <b>30</b> or may be physically separate components. For example, resistors <b>34</b> could be fabricated on backing <b>33</b> as an integrated circuit with leads <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Transmitter <b>35</b> communicates wirelessly to a receiver <b>36</b>, which is part of a larger processor-based corrosion analyzer <b>37</b>. The communications between transmitter <b>35</b> and receiver <b>36</b> could be implemented with known RF communications techniques. An advantage of connecting the leads through resistors is that the transmitted signals represent voltages across the resistors associated with the electrodes. In various embodiments, a voltmeter or ammeter could be used to measure electrical activity, as discussed in the patents referenced in the Background.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Corrosion analyzer <b>37</b> can be a desktop type system, or it can be a handheld device. For example, a mini-controller or PDA type device with a wireless modem could be programmed to receive signals from the sensor and to analyze the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view of sensor <b>30</b>, illustrating its flat (planar) design. The actual thickness can be 100 micrometers or less. This thin dimension permits sensor <b>30</b> to be inserted into crevices and other small spaces, and facilitates its placement under paints and other coatings. A typical size of sensor <b>30</b> is 1&#xd7;1 centimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The design of sensors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> (and other variations) permits the electronic circuitry to be miniaturized and integrated into the thin film package. This facilitates embedding of the sensor under coatings such as paint, with transmission of a signal representing corrosion to a remote receiver via a non-contact method. The high sensitivity of the sensor enables simple, inexpensive, and quick discriminative evaluation of different types of coatings.</p>
