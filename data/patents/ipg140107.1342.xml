<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a liquid discharge head and a method of manufacturing the same, and more particularly, to an ink jet recording head for performing recording by discharging ink on a recording medium and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">RERATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Examples of a method which uses a liquid discharge head for discharging a liquid include an ink jet recording method of performing recording by discharging ink on a recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An ink jet recording head adopted by the ink jet recording method generally includes an intricate discharge port, a liquid flow path, and a plurality of energy generating elements provided to part of the liquid flow path for generating energy to be used for discharging a liquid. Conventionally, a method of manufacturing the above-mentioned ink jet recording head is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,606.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The method of manufacturing an ink jet recording head disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,606 is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a pattern <b>4</b> is formed, with the use of a dissoluble resin, on a substrate <b>1</b> which includes an electrothermal transducing element <b>2</b> as an energy generating element for generating energy for discharging a liquid. An ink flow path is formed according to the pattern <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the substrate <b>1</b>, a desired number of the electrothermal transducing elements <b>2</b> are provided. When heat is generated by the electrothermal transducing elements <b>2</b>, a bubble grows in an ink adjacent to the electrothermal transducing elements <b>2</b>, whereby the ink is discharged as a liquid droplet due to the energy generated by the bubble.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Connected to the electrothermal transducing elements <b>2</b> are control signal input electrodes (not shown) for causing the electrothermal transducing elements <b>2</b> to operate. Also, for the purpose of increasing durability of the electrothermal transducing elements <b>2</b>, the substrate <b>1</b> generally has various functional layers provided thereon, the functional layers including a protective layer covering the electrothermal transducing elements <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To form the ink flow path pattern <b>4</b>, a dissoluble positive photosensitive resist is deposited by a spin coat method and patterned by using a photolithography technique.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For a material of the above-mentioned photosensitive resist, a photodecomposable polymeric compound derived from vinylketone, such as polymethyl isopropyl ketone or polyvinylketone, may be used desirably.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">After that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a coating resin layer <b>5</b> and a water repellent material <b>6</b> are formed, by a spin coat method, on the dissoluble resin material layer having the ink flow path pattern <b>4</b> formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this case, a photosensitive material is used for the coating resin layer <b>5</b> so as to allow an ink discharge port <b>7</b> to be formed easily and accurately by photolithography. Further, the coating resin layer <b>5</b> is required to have a high mechanical strength as a structural material of a recording head, adhesion to the substrate <b>1</b>, and a resistance to ink, as well as resolution for patterning an intricate pattern of the ink discharge port <b>7</b>. For this reason, a cationic polymerizable curing product of an epoxy resin is used for the coating resin layer <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the above-mentioned photosensitive coating layer <b>5</b> and the water repellent material <b>6</b> are pattern-exposed through a mask <b>10</b>, to thereby form the ink discharge port <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The photosensitive coating resin layer <b>5</b> is of a negative type designed to shield a portion which is to constitute the ink discharge port <b>7</b>, with the mask <b>10</b> (of course, the photosensitive coating resin layer <b>5</b> also shields a portion to be electrically connected, which is not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A conventional photolithographic technique can be used in all of the above-mentioned steps to carry out positioning, which attains a remarkably improved accuracy in comparison with a method in which an orifice plate (a plate which has a discharge port already formed therein) is prepared separately and laminated to the substrate <b>1</b>. The photosensitive coating layer <b>5</b> thus pattern-exposed may be subjected to heat treatment as necessary, in order to promote the reaction. In this case, the photosensitive coating layer <b>5</b> is constituted by an epoxy resin solid at ordinary temperatures as described above, and cationic polymerization initiator seeds occurring upon the pattern exposure are minimally diffused accordingly, thereby attaining an excellent patterning accuracy and shape. Then, the pattern-exposed photosensitive coating layer <b>5</b> is developed with the use of a suitable solvent, to thereby form the ink discharge outlet <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the manner as described above, a flow path forming member (the photosensitive coating layer <b>5</b> which has an ink flow path wall and the ink discharge port <b>7</b> formed therein) is created.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, the flow path forming member created as described above is protected against damage by using a protective material <b>8</b> such as a cyclized rubber which protects a face in which the ink discharge port <b>7</b> is to be opened, that is, the face of the flow path forming member being on the side opposite to the substrate <b>1</b>. Then, the back side (a surface opposite to a surface on which the electrothermal transducing element <b>2</b> is disposed) of the substrate <b>1</b> is subjected to chemical etching through, for example, a resist pattern formed thereon, to thereby form an ink supply opening <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Lastly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, the dissoluble resin <b>4</b> forming the ink flow path is dissolved by using a solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The substrate <b>1</b> having the ink flow path and the ink discharge port formed thereon as described above is provided with an electrical connection (not shown) for driving a member for supplying ink and the electrothermal transducing elements <b>2</b>, to thereby complete an ink jet recording head.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In recent years, printers are required to be capable of producing images of higher quality and higher definition than ever. Along with this, for the purpose of discharging an ink liquid droplet in smaller dot, it is necessary to make an ink discharge head more intricate, while reducing the volume of a space which is provided to part of the ink flow path for accommodating the energy generating element and communicating with the discharge port (hereinafter, the space is referred to as &#x201c;discharge portion&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, according to the above-mentioned technology, the discharge portion and the ink flow path are equal in height. Accordingly, if the discharge portion is decreased in height, the ink flow path is reduced in volume, which reduces a refill speed (an ink filling speed to the energy generation element chamber) at the time of discharging an ink liquid droplet. As a result, ink in the discharge portion may all be discharged before the discharge portion is refilled with ink, leading to a problem that the discharge amount of ink liquid droplets fluctuates.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively, if the ink flow path is increased in width in order to increase the refill speed, it is impossible to arrange the discharge ports at high density. Accordingly, even if ink is discharged in a finer liquid droplet, a printing rate is greatly reduced, leading to a reduction in discharge efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In view of the above-mentioned circumstances, the present invention has been made, and it is an object of the invention to provide a liquid discharge head and a method of manufacturing the same capable of increasing a refill speed and stabilizing an amount of liquid droplet to be discharged, to thereby improve the efficiency in discharging a liquid droplet.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A method of manufacturing a liquid discharge head according to an example of the present invention is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention provides a method of manufacturing a liquid discharge head including: a discharge port for discharging a liquid; and a flow path forming member for forming a flow path for liquid communicating with the discharge port, the method of manufacturing a liquid discharge head including: forming a first pattern for forming the flow path on the substrate; forming a first coating layer which covers the first pattern; partially removing the first coating layer to expose said first pattern; forming a second pattern for forming the flow path on the first coating layer, such that the second pattern contacts with the exposed first pattern through the hole; forming a second coating layer for covering the second pattern; and removing the first pattern and the second pattern to form the flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention also provides a liquid discharge head, including a plurality of ink flow paths with respect to one discharge portion, the plurality of ink flow paths being independent of one another. In the liquid discharge head, the flow paths overlap with one another on a substrate through a flow path forming member. With the above-mentioned structure, it is possible to increase a refill speed while discharging a liquid droplet in a stable amount. Accordingly, it is possible to provide a liquid discharge head capable of enhancing discharge efficiency.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the following, embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A liquid discharge head according to the present invention is applicable to a device including a printer, a copy machine, a fax machine having a communications system, a word processor having a printer section, and further to an industrial recording device obtained by combining various processing devices into modules. The liquid discharge head can be used, for example, for the purposes of fabricating a biochip, printing an electronic circuit, and discharging by spraying an atomized drug.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">By using the above-mentioned liquid discharge head, it is possible to perform recording on various recording media which are formed of materials including paper, yarn, fiber, cloth, leather, metal, plastic, glass, wood, and ceramics. The term &#x201c;recording&#x201d; used in the specification of the present invention refers not only to attaching meaningful images such as characters or figures to a recording medium, but also to attaching meaningless images such as patterns to a recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Also, the term &#x201c;liquid&#x201d; should be construed in a broad sense, and refers to a liquid which is applied on a recording medium to thereby create an image, a design, or a pattern, used to process the recording medium, and used to treat ink or the recording medium. In this case, the ink or the recording medium is subjected to treatment in order to solidify a colorant included in the ink attached to the recording medium or to make the colorant insoluble, to thereby improve the stability, recording quality, or brightness of color, and give greater durability to the image.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the following description, like numerals may be used to designate like or identical members in function, and a description thereof may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic perspective view illustrating an example of the liquid discharge head according an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the liquid discharge head of the present invention includes an energy generating element (not shown) for generating energy used for discharging a liquid and a discharge port <b>7</b> for discharging a liquid in response to the generated energy. According to this embodiment, a member forming the discharge port <b>7</b> is integrally formed with a flow path forming member <b>5</b> forming a flow path (not shown) which communicates with the discharge port <b>7</b>. A substrate <b>1</b> may be formed of, for example, a Si wafer having a crystal axis (<b>100</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2H</figref> are cross-sectional diagrams taken along the line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2H</figref> illustrate a method of manufacturing the liquid discharge head according to the embodiment of the present invention. The manufacturing method according to this embodiment is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2H</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a first pattern <b>4</b> is formed on the substrate <b>1</b> made of silicon. The substrate <b>1</b> includes the energy generating element <b>2</b>. The first pattern <b>4</b> serves as a pattern for forming a flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this embodiment, an electrothermal transducing element is used as the energy generating element, however, a piezoelectric element may also be used without causing any problem. The operating principles of those elements are described as follows. In the case where the electrothermal transducing element is used as the energy generating element <b>2</b>, the electrothermal transducing element heats a nearby liquid, thereby changing the state of the liquid and generating discharge energy. In the case where the piezoelectric element is used for example, mechanical vibrations of the piezoelectric element generate discharge energy. Connected to those elements are control signal input electrodes (not shown) for causing those elements to operate. Also, for the purpose of increasing durability of those energy generating elements, the substrate <b>1</b> generally has various functional layers such as a protective layer covering the electrothermal transducing element, provided thereon. Needless to say, those functional layers may be provided with no problem.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A photosensitive material is desirably used for a resist material forming the first flow path pattern <b>4</b> so as to allow a flow path to be accurately patterned in terms of position with respect to the electrothermal transducing element <b>2</b>. In this embodiment, polymethyl isopropenyl ketone (PMIPK) is used as a positive photosensitive resist (positive photosensitive resin). To form a resist layer, the material is dissolved in an appropriate solvent and deposited by a spin coat method or a roll coat method, to thereby form a coating film. At this time, the PMIPK is exposed to ultraviolet light in a photosensitive wavelength range of 260 nm to 300 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, on the dissoluble resin material layer forming the first flow path pattern <b>4</b>, a coating resin layer <b>5</b>A for forming a part of flow path forming member is provided by a spin coat method or a roll coat method. Then, the coating resin layer <b>5</b>A is pattern-exposed through a mask <b>10</b>, to thereby form a communicating portion (channel portion) <b>17</b> for allowing a first flow path <b>13</b> to communicate with the discharge port <b>7</b> and a second flow path <b>14</b>. Namely, the first pattern <b>4</b> is exposed from the communicating portion <b>17</b>. In the step of forming the coating resin layer <b>5</b>A, it is necessary to impart properties of preventing the first flow path pattern <b>4</b> of a dissoluble resin from being deformed to the coating resin layer <b>5</b>A. That is, in the case where the coating resin layer <b>5</b>A is to be formed by dissolving a coating resin in a solvent and applying the solution onto the first flow path pattern <b>4</b> by spin-coating or a roll-coating, it is necessary to select a solvent which does not dissolve the first flow path pattern <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The above-mentioned coating resin layer <b>5</b> is needed to have a high mechanical strength as a structural material of a flow path wall, adhesion to the substrate <b>1</b>, and a resistance to a solvent. Also, for the coating layer <b>5</b>, it is desirable to use a photosensitive material which can be patterned by photolithography, so as to allow the communicating part communicating with the discharge portion to be accurately patterned in terms of position with respect to the energy generating elements <b>2</b>. Further, it is necessary to deposit the coating resin layer <b>5</b> to a thickness sufficient enough to completely cover the first flow path pattern <b>4</b> of a dissoluble resin.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this embodiment, the inventors have found that, as the result of intensive studies, a cationic polymerization curing product of an epoxy resin has an excellent strength, adhesion, and a resistance to a solvent as a structural material, and exhibits an excellent patterning property when the epoxy resin is solid at ordinary temperatures, as shown in Resin Composition 1 below. Further, for forming the coating resin layer <b>5</b> by spin-coating, a resin composition 1 described below is dissolved in a methyl isobutyl ketone/xylene mixture solvent at a concentration of 60 wt %.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As a dissoluble resin for forming the second flow path pattern <b>3</b>, a positive resist <b>11</b> called PMMA is used. To obtain PMMA, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) are subjected to radical polymerization to obtain a binary copolymer (P(MMA-MAA)=90 to 70:10 to 30) and dissolving the copolymer in a cyclohexanone solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a reaction formula for forming a thermal crosslink film by a dehydration condensation reaction of the binary copolymer (P(MMA-MAA)) of the PMMA. In the dehydration condensation reaction, the binary copolymer is heated at 180 to 200&#xb0; C. for 30 to 120 minutes to form a crosslink film further enhanced in strength. The crosslink film is formed of a positive resist which is insoluble in a solvent, but is made soluble in a solvent only at a portion irradiated with an electron beam such as DUV light. In particular, the PMMA is reactive to ultraviolet light in a photosensitive wavelength range of less than 260 nm, while the PMIPK is reactive to ultraviolet light in a photosensitive wavelength range from 260 nm to 300 nm, which makes it possible to selectively subject the PMMA and the PMIPK to exposure by varying the wavelength of the exposure light.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the positive resist <b>11</b> is partially separated from the first flow path pattern <b>4</b> by the coating resin layer <b>5</b>A, and contacts with said first flow path pattern <b>4</b> through the communicating portion <b>17</b>. In this embodiment, two portions of positive resist <b>11</b> contact with the first flow path pattern <b>4</b> in a route from the supply opening <b>9</b> to the energy generating element <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Then, by using an exposure device for irradiating DUV light, to which a filter is provided as a wavelength selecting unit for removing ultraviolet light having a wavelength equal to or more than 260 nm, the resist <b>11</b> is irradiated exclusively with ultraviolet light having a wavelength of less than 260 nm as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. In this manner, the second flow path pattern <b>3</b> can be formed without subjecting the first flow path pattern <b>4</b> to exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E and 2F</figref>, the second photosensitive coating resin layer <b>5</b>B used in the second step is applied and pattern-exposed through the mask <b>10</b>, to thereby form the discharge port <b>7</b>. In this embodiment, the discharge port <b>7</b> is formed in the second photosensitive coating resin layer <b>5</b>A. However, the discharge port may be formed in the first photosensitive coating resin layer <b>5</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is desirable that the photosensitive coating resin layer <b>5</b>B used in this step be formed of a material similar to Resin Composition 1 applied in the second step (i.e., a negative photosensitive resin which includes a cationic polymerizable chemical compound and a cationic photopolymerization initiator), in terms of adhesiveness and mechanical strength. However, it is not necessary to use the same material for the photosensitive coating resin layer <b>5</b> as described above, when adhesiveness, mechanical strength, and pattern characteristics can be satisfactorily attained with respect to the coating resin layer provided underneath thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to this embodiment, in order to improve the discharge stability, a water repellent material (not shown) is provided on the coating resin layer <b>5</b>. The water repellent material can be patterned simultaneously with the coating resin layer <b>5</b>. The water repellent material may be provided in a liquid form by a curtain coat (direct coat) method, or may be provided as being laminated in a form of a dry film. The water repellent material in this case is similar to the water repellent material <b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1F</figref>. Also, the discharge portion <b>7</b> needs to be patterned with accuracy in terms of position with respect to the communicating portion communicating with the discharge port formed in the second step.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, a supply opening <b>9</b> which serves as an opening through which a liquid is supplied is formed in the substrate <b>1</b> by subjecting the silicon to anisotropic etching using TMAH. In this case, to protect the water repellent material and the coating resin layer <b>5</b> serving as a flow path forming member created in the fifth step against damage, a protective material <b>8</b> such as cyclized rubber is used, which protects a face in which the ink discharge port <b>7</b> is to be opened, the face of the flow path forming member being opposite to the substrate <b>1</b>. The protective material <b>8</b> is removed after the formation of the supply opening <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Lastly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, the first flow path pattern <b>4</b> and the second flow path pattern <b>3</b>, which are soluble to a solvent, are dissolved. Those flow patterns are easily dissolved by dipping the substrate <b>1</b>, which has the flow path forming member formed therein, into a solvent, or by spraying a solvent onto the substrate <b>1</b>. Further, ultrasonic waves may be simultaneously used to further reduce the dissolution time.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The substrate <b>1</b> having the flow path and the discharge port formed as described above is further provided with a member for supplying a liquid or an electrical connection to an electric wiring member (not shown) for driving the electrothermal transducing element <b>2</b>, to thereby complete the liquid discharge head.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to the above-mentioned manufacturing method, it is possible to form the flow path in various shapes by changing the shapes of the first pattern <b>4</b> and the second pattern <b>3</b>, the positional relation therebetween, and a portion at which the first pattern <b>4</b> and the second pattern <b>3</b> contact with each other.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The liquid discharge head of this embodiment includes a discharge portion <b>12</b> communicating with the discharge port <b>7</b>, a first flow path <b>13</b> communicating with discharge portion <b>12</b>, and a second flow path <b>14</b> communicating with discharge portion <b>12</b>. The first flow path <b>13</b> and the second flow path <b>14</b> are provided with respect to one discharge portion <b>12</b> (a space for accommodating each energy generating element <b>2</b>), and the first flow path <b>13</b> and the second flow path <b>14</b> each communicate with the discharge portion. The first flow path <b>13</b> extends from the supply opening <b>9</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>) to the discharge portion <b>12</b> so as to contact with a surface of the substrate <b>1</b> on which the energy generating element <b>2</b> is formed. The second flow path <b>14</b> is provided substantially in parallel with the flow path pattern <b>13</b> through a flow path forming member <b>5</b> so as to be located above the surface on which the energy generating element <b>2</b> is formed, and extends from the supply opening <b>9</b> to the discharge portion <b>12</b>, similarly to the first flow path <b>13</b>. The invention is not limited to the arrangement that the discharge port is provided at a position opposed to the energy generating element <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this embodiment, the discharge portion <b>12</b> has a shape that a cross-sectional area thereof parallel to the substrate is changed step-by-step. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the discharge portion <b>12</b> is provided with a first discharge portion <b>15</b> closer to the energy generating element <b>2</b> and a second discharge portion <b>16</b> which is closer to the discharge port <b>7</b> and has a cross-sectional area parallel to the substrate <b>1</b> smaller than the first discharge portion <b>15</b>. The discharge port <b>7</b> has a cross-sectional area parallel to the substrate <b>1</b> smaller than the second discharge portion <b>16</b>. The first discharge portion <b>15</b> accesses the first flow path <b>13</b> and the second discharge portion <b>16</b> accesses the second flow path <b>14</b>. In this embodiment, a boundary (D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref>) between the first discharge portion <b>15</b> and the second discharge portion <b>16</b> is a portion which has a cross-sectional area parallel to the substrate of discharge portion <b>12</b>, becoming small. A height (a length in a direction toward the discharge port <b>7</b> from the substrate <b>1</b>) of the first discharge portion <b>15</b> is equal to a height of the first flow path <b>13</b>. The structures of and the relation among the discharge portion, discharge port, flow path and the like mentioned above may be employed in the second embodiment and onward embodiments. The invention is not limited to the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the liquid discharge head as described above, a liquid is pushed out toward the discharge port <b>7</b> side and the supply opening side <b>9</b> due to a pressure generated by a bubble grown by heat generated by the energy generating element <b>2</b>, to thereby discharge a liquid droplet. At this time, the generated bubble breaks liquid meniscus at the discharge port <b>7</b> to communicate with outside, because the distance L between the surface of the substrate <b>1</b> on which energy generating element <b>2</b> is formed and a surface at which the discharge port <b>7</b> is opened in the flow path forming member is made extremely short to discharge a liquid in smaller dots. As a result, the discharge port <b>7</b> discharges a fine liquid droplet of, for example, 1 picoliter. When the bubble communicates with atmospheric air, a flow resistance on the discharge port <b>7</b> side is lower than a flow resistance to a flow pushed out toward the supply opening <b>9</b> side, whereby the liquid is discharged with stability. Meanwhile, the first and second flow paths <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> refill the discharge portion <b>12</b> with a liquid. At this time, the liquid is refilled not only by the first flow path <b>13</b> but also by the second flow path <b>14</b>, the discharge portion <b>12</b> is refilled quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above, even if the volume of the discharge portion <b>12</b> and the cross-sectional area of the first flow path <b>13</b> are reduced in order to reduce the distance L, there is no fear that the refill speed decrease because the second flow path <b>14</b> for separately connecting to the discharge portion <b>12</b> is provided. Accordingly, it is possible to solve the problem that all the liquid has been discharged before the discharge portion <b>12</b> is refilled, leading to fluctuations in the discharge amount.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Also, there is an advantage that the width of the first flow path <b>13</b> can be increased to a certain degree that can keep a predetermined alignment density of the discharge ports <b>7</b>, and the second flow path <b>14</b> can also be increased when the refill speed does not reach a desired rate even when the first flow path <b>13</b> is increased in width.</p>
