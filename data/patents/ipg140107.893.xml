<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/201,059, filed on Dec. 5, 2008, entitled APPARATUS TO CONTROL FLUID FLOW, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to fluid flow control devices and, more particularly, to apparatus to control fluid flow.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Industrial processing plants use control devices in a wide variety of applications. For example, a level controller may be used to manage a final control mechanism (i.e. valve and actuator assembly) to control the level of a fluid in a storage tank. Many process plants use a compressed gas, such as compressed air, as a power source to operate such control devices. In certain hydrocarbon production facilities, compressed air is generally not readily available to operate the control devices. Natural gas is often used as the supply gas to operate these control devices. However, many control devices may bleed natural gas to the atmosphere, which is costly due to the value of the natural gas and the environmental controls and regulations associated with such exhaust gases. Thus, minimizing or eliminating the bleed of natural gas to the atmosphere by the control devices is an important concern.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is generally understood that typical level controllers used in the hydrocarbon production industry may be single stage, low-bleed pneumatic devices operated by natural gas. To minimize the consumption of natural gas during operation, such level controllers are designed to include a dead band to reduce amounts of bleed gas. However, such designs generally have low operational sensitivity or gain resulting in large vessel spans or oversized sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is also common to improve the gain of such single stage devices by fashioning a dual-stage pneumatic control device to produce the desired response characteristic with higher output sensitivity. The first stage, often called the signal stage, converts a mechanical or fluid pressure input signal to a pressure output. The signal stage has a low volume flow rate and a low-pressure output that provides the response and control characteristics for the desired process control application. A second stage, often called the amplifier stage, provides high pneumatic capacity and responds to the output of the signal stage to achieve the desired response characteristics while providing a higher output flow rate and/or pressure necessary to operate the final control mechanism. Many of these devices do not provide control action proportional to an input signal and/or suffer from excessive loss of supply gas, such as natural gas, during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrate a known direct-acting, dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>1</b> that includes a reverse-acting signal stage A comprising a signal stage valve <b>110</b> coupled to a reverse-acting amplifier stage B having an amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> (as explained in greater detail below). In operation, an input signal (such as a motion or displacement) from a mechanical device, such as a linkage connected to a displacer in a fluid tank (not shown), may be applied to a valve stem tip <b>135</b> of the signal stage valve <b>110</b> to initiate a pneumatic control signal to the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b>. However, it should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the input signal might also be derived from any number of well-known inputs including pressure signals and other direct mechanical forces.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> of the amplifier stage B is the four-mode pneumatic relay disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,974,625, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Those desiring more detail should refer to U.S. Pat. No. 4,974,625. This relay provides user selectable direct or reverse and proportional or snap-acting operational modes. One of ordinary skill in the art appreciates that a direct or reverse acting mode refers to the relationship of the output signal with respect to an input signal such that, for example, direct mode means the output signal increases with an increasing input signal. Whereas a proportional or snap-acting mode refers to the response of the output signal such that, for example, proportional means changes in the output signal are substantially linear with respect to an input signal change and snap-acting means changes in the output signal are bi-stable and non-linear with respect to an input signal change.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although the pneumatic relay disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,974,625 may provide four modes, the dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may disadvantageously utilize only two modes of operation&#x2014;direct and reverse/snap-acting modes. This is because the dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>1</b> provides very little feedback or proportioning force between the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> and the signal stage valve <b>110</b>. That is, there is no specific mechanism to feedback output pressure from a signal diaphragm <b>90</b> of the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> to offset the applied input force at the valve stem tip <b>135</b> of the signal stage valve <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> of the control device <b>1</b> includes a series of input and output ports that communicate with respective chambers formed within the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b>. By selectively controlling the fluid communication between various input and output ports through the user selectable switches, the single amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> may provide the multiple operational modes previously described to interface with various control elements.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to accommodate the operational modes in the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b>, an input port <b>11</b> communicates with a chamber <b>15</b> and an output port <b>12</b>. A pressure outlet <b>17</b> communicates with a chamber <b>16</b>; an input port <b>13</b> communicates with a chamber <b>18</b>, an output port <b>14</b> communicates with chamber <b>20</b> and the pressure outlet <b>17</b> may be connected to a final control mechanism such as a valve and actuator assembly (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cut-away illustration of the port switches of the amplifier stage B of the control device <b>1</b> used to select the various operational modes. First and second generally triangular-shaped port switches <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are pivotally mounted on the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> by pins <b>71</b> and <b>73</b>, respectively. The port switches <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are sectioned to reveal serpentine channels <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>, respectively, which pneumatically couple the various input and output ports of the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> from a pressure inlet <b>78</b> and the pressure outlet <b>17</b> to provide alternate modes of operation. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first port switch <b>70</b> is positioned such that the input port <b>13</b> is in communication with the pressure inlet port <b>78</b>, and the input port <b>11</b> is vented to atmosphere. The second port switch <b>72</b> is shown to vent the output port <b>14</b>. It should be appreciated from U.S. Pat. No. 4,974,625 that this switch configuration places the amplifier relay stage <b>10</b> in a reverse/snap-acting mode, which when combined with the reverse-acting signal stage valve <b>110</b> provides a direct/snap-acting pneumatic control device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">That is, a decrease in pressure in a chamber <b>88</b> results in movement of a cage assembly <b>59</b> to the left with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which provides an increasing output pressure at the pressure outlet <b>17</b>. Thus, in operation when an increasing input signal moves the stem tip <b>135</b> of the signal stage valve <b>110</b>, the reverse-acting mode of the signal stage valve <b>110</b> provides a decrease in its output pressure in passageway <b>82</b> and consequently a decrease in pressure in the chamber <b>88</b> to provide a direct-acting pneumatic control device <b>1</b>. The alternate switch configuration for the control device <b>1</b> couples the input port <b>11</b> to the pressure inlet port <b>78</b> and the input port <b>13</b> is vented to atmosphere with the second port switch <b>72</b> configured to couple port <b>14</b> to the output port <b>12</b>. This alternate configuration places the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> in a direct/snap-acting mode and, therefore, the pneumatic control device <b>1</b> operates in a reverse/snap-acting mode. The remaining possible switch configurations for the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> render the relay inoperable because there is no feedback mechanism present in the described embodiment of control device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the signal stage valve <b>110</b> includes a single plug <b>130</b>, a first valve seat <b>120</b> and a second valve seat <b>122</b>. In a first state, a first plug end <b>132</b> does not engage the first valve seat <b>120</b> and a second plug end <b>134</b> engages the second valve seat <b>122</b>. In a second state, the first plug end <b>132</b> engages the first valve seat <b>120</b> and the second plug end <b>134</b> does not engage the second valve seat <b>122</b>. In an intermediate state, neither plug end <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> engages either of the respective valve seats <b>120</b> and <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In operation, a linkage may apply a force to the valve stem tip <b>135</b> to move it toward the amplifier relay <b>10</b> or to the right (with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The rightward movement of the valve stem tip <b>135</b> causes movement of the stem <b>130</b> of the signal stage valve <b>110</b> that results in the first plug end <b>132</b> and the second plug end <b>134</b> being simultaneously separated from their respective first and second valve seats <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> in the intermediate state. During this separation, the supply gas, such as natural gas, from a supply port <b>85</b> is vented or bled through the second valve seat <b>122</b> to the atmosphere past valve stem tip <b>135</b>. This venting to atmosphere of the supply gas is often called transition bleed, which may cause excessive loss of supply gas, such as natural gas, to the atmosphere. When the rightward movement of the stem <b>130</b> continues, the stem <b>130</b> ultimately engages the first plug end <b>132</b> with the first valve seat <b>120</b> and the transition bleed ceases, and the fluid pressure within a through feedback passage <b>114</b> of the signal stage valve <b>110</b> and the chamber <b>88</b> of the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> is at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The change from supply gas pressure to atmospheric pressure within the chamber <b>88</b> results in the diaphragm cage assembly <b>59</b> being moved toward the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by a spring <b>48</b> in the chamber <b>16</b>. The cage assembly <b>59</b> includes a valve seat <b>30</b> and valve plug <b>40</b>. The leftward movement of the valve seat <b>30</b> and the valve plug <b>40</b> causes a valve plug <b>38</b> to engage a valve seat <b>42</b> and terminate the transmission of supply gas to the output port <b>12</b>. The valve seat <b>30</b> is then moved away from the valve plug <b>40</b> as the diaphragm cage assembly <b>59</b> moves to the left so that fluid pressure in the chamber <b>16</b> flows through the T-shaped opening to the chamber <b>18</b> to vent the fluid pressures from the chambers <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">While the use of the signal stage valve <b>110</b> with the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> provides sensitivity to the input signal from the linkage, it also provides a significant transition bleed of natural gas during the operation of the dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>1</b>. It should also be appreciated that one way to reduce the transition bleed and maintain most of the gain of the dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>1</b> is to couple together two amplifier stage relays <b>10</b> for serial operation. However, coupling the two amplifier stage relays <b>10</b> together to create a tandem device increases the cost and results in a relatively larger, dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, while certain designs may provide a feedback force to the above-described device, it may be less desirable. One approach is to provide a diaphragm between the stem <b>130</b> and the valve body <b>112</b> in the signal stage valve <b>110</b>. However, the diaphragm has to be clamped or retained at its inner and outer diameters, which results in a larger signal stage that subsequently requires undesirable changes in the linkage and the displacer.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An example fluid flow control apparatus described herein includes a signal stage comprising a signal stage relay having a supply plug being operatively connected to a valve seat at a first end and an exhaust seat at a second end and a seal operatively coupled to the supply plug such that the seal provides a feedback area to apply a fluid pressure feedback force to the exhaust seat.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In yet another example, a dual-stage fluid flow control apparatus described herein includes a signal stage having a proportional output, the signal stage comprising a signal stage relay including a supply plug having a first end adjacent a valve seat and a second end adjacent an exhaust seat, a signal stage input post is adapted to couple the signal stage to a control device, and means for urging a seat load across the supply plug toward either the valve seat or the exhaust seat. An amplifier stage comprising an amplifier stage relay is operatively connected to the signal stage via a signal passage, the amplifier stage having a fluid supply responsive member adapted to move a relay member to provide an amplified fluid supply output such that a shift in the seat load across the valve seat and the exhaust seat provides a predetermined engagement of either the valve seat to the first end of the supply plug or the exhaust seat to the second end of the supply plug to provide either a proportional or snap-acting and a direct or reverse acting output of the amplifier stage relative to an input signal at the signal stage input post.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In yet another example, a fluid flow control apparatus described herein includes a signal stage having a proportional output.

The amplifier stage relay having a fluid supply responsive member adapted to move a relay member to provide an amplified fluid supply output such that a shift in the seat load across supply plug of the signal stage closes the exhaust seat of the signal stage prior to opening the valve seat of the signal stage to substantially eliminate a transition bleed in the signal stage.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In general, the example apparatus and methods described herein may be utilized for controlling fluid flow in various types of fluid flow processes. An example fluid flow control apparatus includes a dual-stage fluid control device having a compact, low bleed signal stage with proportional output to improve the control of fluid flow. Additionally, while the examples described herein are described in connection with the control of product flow for the industrial processing industry, the examples described herein may be more generally applicable to a variety of process control operations for different purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cut-away illustration of an example direct-acting dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>200</b> comprising a signal stage having signal stage relay <b>300</b> and an amplifier stage further comprising an amplifier stage relay <b>210</b>. The direct-acting signal stage relay <b>300</b> provides a signal stage C and the direct-acting amplifier stage relay <b>210</b> provides an amplifier stage D of the example dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>200</b>. The amplifier stage relay <b>210</b> of the amplifier stage D is similar to the four-mode pneumatic relay valve disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,974,625 and the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, including the port switches <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Those components in the amplifier stage relay <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that are the same as or similar to the components in the amplifier stage relay <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> have the same reference numerals increased by 200.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As described in detail below, it should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the signal stage relay <b>300</b> improves the operation of the previously described dual-stage relay illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by providing a throttling or proportioning action, thereby permitting utilization of the four modes available in the amplifier stage relay <b>210</b> while substantially reducing the transition bleed associated with signal stage valve <b>110</b>. A throttling or proportional/direct mode of operation is described below as an example operation of the control device <b>200</b>. Those desiring more detail or description should refer to U.S. Pat. No. 4,974,625, which describes therein the other three modes of operation of a four-mode pneumatic relay valve similar to the amplifier <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the signal stage relay <b>300</b> of the signal stage C includes a relay body <b>312</b> having a through feedback passage <b>314</b>, a transverse port <b>316</b>, an inlet <b>318</b>, a first valve seat <b>320</b>, and a second valve seat <b>322</b>. The second valve seat <b>322</b> is located on an exhaust seat <b>325</b> having a seal or an o-ring <b>326</b> engaging and sealing against an inner surface <b>317</b> of the through feedback passage <b>314</b>. As described in greater detail below, the o-ring <b>326</b> provides an effective area on which fluid pressure in the feedback passage <b>314</b> of the signal stage relay <b>300</b> may act to create a feedback force to provide the throttling or proportioning action in the control device <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be appreciated that at a quiescent point in the throttling or proportional mode, valve plugs <b>330</b>, <b>240</b> and <b>238</b> are in a &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position. That is, closed position means the valve is &#x201c;substantially in contact with&#x201d; the valve seat. However, one skilled in the art appreciates that for such a valve seating surface, for example, a metal-to-metal valve seat arrangement, in a closed position with the limited seat loads available such valve-seat arrangements are known to leak small quantities of fluid (i.e. not bubble tight). This leakage at the seats yields a fluid flow to provide throttling action of the pneumatic control device in operation. That is, unlike a snap-acting operation wherein the valves are substantially moving into and out of contact with the valve seats, a throttling or proportional mode is, in part, defined by shifts in corresponding seat load to modify a pressure balance across the relay components. The shifting seat loads provide a modification in seat leakage during quiescent operation to shift the pressure balance across the signal stage C and the amplifier stage D in proportion to supply input and sensor feedback. It should also be appreciated that other materials of construction having sufficient hardness will yield similar leakage flows during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the exhaust seat <b>325</b> has an input post <b>327</b> and is retained within the through feedback passage <b>314</b> by an end cap <b>329</b>. The supply valve plug <b>330</b> is located in the through feedback passage <b>314</b> and includes a first plug end <b>332</b> adjacent (e.g., situated immediately adjacent) the first valve seat <b>320</b> and a second plug end <b>334</b> adjacent (e.g., situated immediately adjacent) the second valve seat <b>322</b>. The exhaust seat <b>325</b> includes a shoulder <b>336</b> that receives a spring <b>340</b>. The spring <b>340</b> also engages a shoulder <b>313</b> to urge the exhaust seat <b>325</b> into engagement with the end cap <b>329</b> and away from the second plug end <b>334</b>. A second spring <b>344</b> engages a valve body shoulder <b>315</b> and the first plug end <b>332</b> to urge the first plug end <b>332</b> into engagement with the first valve seat <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The signal stage relay <b>300</b> is positioned within an opening <b>280</b> in an end cover <b>236</b> of the amplifier stage relay <b>210</b>. An end cover <b>236</b> includes a signal passage <b>282</b> that fluidly couples the transverse port <b>316</b> of the signal stage relay <b>300</b> with a signal chamber <b>288</b> defined partially by a signal diaphragm <b>290</b> located between the end cover <b>236</b> and an intermediate piece <b>239</b>. The end cover <b>236</b> also includes a supply port <b>285</b> that provides supply gas to the inlet <b>318</b> of the signal stage relay <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a quiescent operational mode, the first plug end <b>332</b> is in contact with the first valve seat <b>320</b> and the second plug end <b>334</b> is in contact with the second valve seat <b>322</b>. A supply gas is provided to the signal stage relay <b>300</b> via the supply port <b>285</b> and the inlet <b>318</b>. The first plug <b>332</b> is seated at the first valve seat <b>320</b> with sufficient seat load so that the supply gas is substantially prohibited from passing the first valve seat <b>320</b> and the seat load of the second plug end <b>334</b> is seated at the second valve seat <b>322</b> of the exhaust seat <b>325</b> so supply gas is substantially prohibited from exhausting from the exhaust seat <b>325</b>. However, as previously explained, in throttling or proportional mode, at a quiescent operating point, both first and second valve plug ends <b>332</b> and <b>334</b>, when engaged with the respective valve seats <b>320</b> and <b>322</b>, substantially prohibit fluid flow, with only a leakage flow present. The slight leakage creates a proportional, shifting pressure balance across the signal and amplifier stages C and D to modify the respective seat loads in proportion to the supply fluid wherein a feedback force is coupled through a linkage connected to a displacer in a fluid tank (not shown). The input signal may be derived from any number of well-known inputs including pressure signals and direct mechanical forces.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, the supply plug <b>330</b> is shown in its left most position, with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in contact with the first valve seat <b>320</b>. In operation, such as a level control application, a buoyant force is applied to a displacer by a fluid in the fluid tank, an input or mechanical linkage provides an input force to the input post <b>327</b> of the exhaust seat <b>325</b>. The input force or signal increases the leakage flow across the first valve seat <b>320</b>. This action also causes the seat load of the second valve seat <b>322</b> to sealingly engage the second plug end <b>334</b> and decrease leakage flow through feedback passage <b>314</b> to the atmosphere, and then the first plug end <b>332</b> to increase leakage flow from the first valve seat <b>320</b> to enable a limited quantity of supply gas to enter the feedback passage <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Subsequently, the supply gas from the supply port <b>285</b> passes through the inlet <b>318</b>, the first valve seat <b>320</b>, through the feedback passage <b>314</b> to the transverse port <b>316</b>, the signal passage <b>282</b> and the signal chamber <b>288</b> to act upon the signal diaphragm <b>290</b>. The pressure of the supply gas increases a force supplied by the signal diaphragm <b>290</b> and a diaphragm cage assembly <b>259</b>, thereby increasing a seat load upon a valve seat <b>230</b> from the valve plug <b>240</b> to decrease a leakage flow therebetween. This pressure also acts upon the inner surface <b>317</b> of the o-ring <b>326</b> to apply a negative feedback force on the linkage to provide a proportional output from the control device <b>200</b>. That is, a force equal to the product of the pressure within the signal passage <b>282</b> and the effective sealing area of the o-ring <b>326</b> (i.e. the cross-sectional area of the o-ring defined by the inner surface <b>317</b>) is applied in opposition to the linkage force.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As the linkage applies the input signal to the input post <b>327</b> seating forces between the first plug end <b>332</b> and the first valve seat <b>320</b> are diminished or reduced, increasing supply gas pressure to the signal chamber <b>288</b>. The amplifier stage relay <b>200</b> of the amplifier stage D has port switches (not shown) set for proportional/direct operation. Thus, supply gas is applied to an input port <b>211</b> and a chamber <b>215</b>. A chamber <b>216</b> and an output port <b>217</b> are coupled to a final control device. The supply gas is contained within the chamber <b>215</b> as long as a leakage flow across a valve seat <b>242</b> is substantially reduced by the valve plug <b>238</b> to prohibit a pressure increase in the chamber <b>216</b> and the output port <b>217</b>. As pressure increases in the signal chamber <b>288</b>, the force generated by the signal diaphragm <b>290</b> and the diaphragm cage assembly <b>259</b> increases the seat load across the valve seat <b>230</b>. As the seat load increases across the valve seat <b>230</b> and the valve plug <b>240</b> of a plug assembly <b>237</b>, the seat load across the valve seat <b>242</b> and the plug <b>238</b> decreases. The decrease in seat load across the valve seat <b>242</b> and the plug <b>238</b> increases a leakage flow from the chamber <b>215</b> and subsequently into the chamber <b>216</b>. The increase in flow and pressure communicate through the pressure outlet <b>217</b> and into the final control device.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Continuing in operation, as the seat load of the first plug end <b>332</b> and the first valve seat <b>320</b> decreases, the supply gas in the feedback passage <b>314</b> acts upon the exhaust seat <b>325</b> to offset the input signal applied to the input post <b>327</b> by the linkage and provide a proportional amount of supply gas pressure to the signal chamber <b>288</b>. At equilibrium, the valve seat <b>230</b> of the amplifier stage relay <b>210</b> is in contact with the valve plug <b>240</b> and the valve seat <b>242</b> is in contact with the valve plug <b>238</b> with the seat loads in balance so that the output pressure at the pressure outlet <b>217</b> and the final control device is proportional to the input signal at the input post <b>327</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If the input signal at the input post <b>327</b> decreases, the force provided by the diaphragm cage assembly <b>259</b> decreases so that the seat load between the valve plug <b>238</b> and the valve seat <b>242</b> increases and the seat load between the valve seat <b>230</b> and the valve plug <b>240</b> decreases. In this state, the leakage flow between the valve seat <b>230</b> and the valve plug <b>240</b> enable the supply gas in the chamber <b>216</b> to pass through a T-shaped opening <b>232</b> to the chamber <b>218</b> and vent through an input port <b>213</b>, which is exposed to the atmosphere. Changes in the input signal at the input post <b>327</b> results in a new equilibrium state for the amplifier stage relay <b>210</b> with the output pressure at the pressure outlet <b>217</b> being directly proportional to the input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">During operation, when the input force at the input post <b>327</b> decreases, the seat load at the second valve seat <b>322</b> decreases and the supply plug <b>330</b> is slightly loaded. That is, the seat load at the first plug end <b>332</b> of the supply plug <b>330</b> and the first valve seat <b>320</b> increases to decrease the leakage flow of supply gas through the first valve seat <b>320</b>. The seat load at the second valve seat <b>322</b> of the exhaust seat <b>325</b> and the second plug end <b>334</b> of the supply plug <b>330</b> decreases. The decrease in seat load permits the supply gas in the signal chamber <b>288</b>, the signal passage <b>282</b>, the transverse port <b>316</b>, and feedback passage <b>314</b> to vent through the second valve seat <b>322</b> to atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The signal stage relay <b>300</b> enables the example dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>200</b> to have a high gain, a low transition bleed, and four modes of operation that achieve numerous advantages. For example, the spring <b>340</b> is utilized to overcome a frictional force created by the seal or O-ring <b>326</b> and to keep or maintain the input post <b>327</b> in contact with the input linkage, thereby ensuring that a dead band of operation does not occur during the operation of the linkage. In other words, the input post <b>327</b> is in contact with the input linkage such that a bias force of the spring <b>340</b> substantially maintains contact between the input linkage and the input post <b>327</b> to substantially eliminate a dead band between the input linkage motion and exhaust seat <b>325</b> motion. The high gain, four-modes of operation provided by the example dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>200</b> eliminate the need to use either two-serially aligned amplifier stage relays <b>210</b> to provide a high gain or a diaphragm between the exhaust seat <b>325</b> and the valve body <b>312</b> to provide a feedback force. The use of the seal or O-ring <b>326</b> (i.e., as opposed to the use of a diaphragm) to provide a supply gas pressure feedback force to the exhaust seat <b>325</b> enables the signal stage relay <b>300</b> to have a small diameter and, thus, a small and compact size. This also results in the example dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>200</b> being usable with a smaller displacer and lighter fluids in a fluid vessel, thereby minimizing the cost of the fluid vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The example dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>200</b> utilizes the springs <b>244</b> and <b>248</b> of the amplifier stage relay <b>210</b> and the springs <b>344</b> and <b>340</b> of the signal stage relay <b>300</b> to assist in the control of the flow of the supply gas through or across the respective valve seats <b>242</b>, <b>230</b> and <b>320</b> and <b>322</b>. As a result, the example dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>200</b> may function at any orientation, including horizontal, vertical, and angled without compensating for the affects of gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">One skilled in the art should also appreciate that the feedback area, presented by the effective area of the o-ring <b>326</b> can also be adjusted by changing the internal diameter of the feedback passage <b>314</b> of the signal stage relay <b>300</b> and the external diameter of the seal or o-ring <b>326</b>. That is, the signal stage relay housing <b>312</b> and the seal or o-ring <b>326</b> can be quickly changed or replaced as a replaceable single stage module that provides a predetermined feedback area to accommodate different types of services such as water, condensate or interface, which may provide or exert different linkage forces. For example, a relatively large feedback area (e.g. 0.1080 in<sup>2</sup>) would be preferable for applications providing a large buoyant force (i.e. corresponding to fluid having an approximate specific gravity of 1.0), such as water. A slightly smaller feedback area (e.g. 0.0625 in<sup>2</sup>) would accommodate applications providing a moderate buoyant force (i.e. corresponding to a fluid having an approximate specific gravity of 0.8) such as oil and a very small feedback area (e.g. 0.036 in<sup>2</sup>) would preferably accommodate an oil-to-water interface application with a small buoyant force (i.e. corresponding to fluids having an approximate differential specific gravity of 0.1). Specifically, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that this feature provides the user with an improved setup and calibration scenario for level control applications since the lever and the displacer need not be modified or replaced for these different applications.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The example dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>200</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may provide very high gain (i.e. increased responsiveness) and very low gas consumption during normal operation. However, in certain applications such high gain or responsiveness may create susceptibility to mechanical vibrations that may lead to instability in control. The source of this instability is generally the rapid application of a feedback force on a controller linkage by the signal stage of the pneumatic controller device. The example pneumatic control device <b>401</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may substantially reduce such susceptibility by: 1) independently controlling the pressure to the signal stage relay; and 2) reducing the feedback area of signal stage relay.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a cut-away illustration of an example dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>401</b> having a signal stage E and an amplifier stage F including stabilizing pressure regulators <b>500</b> and <b>510</b>. The stabilizing pressure regulators <b>500</b> and <b>510</b> independently provide supply air to a signal stage relay <b>410</b> and an amplifier stage relay <b>420</b> through a signal supply pressure inlet <b>485</b> and an amplifier supply pressure inlet <b>411</b>. It should be appreciated that such stabilizing pressure regulators <b>500</b> and <b>510</b> could be integrated within the signal stage E and the amplifier stage F, or such regulators could be external to the signal and amplifier stages E and F. Alternatively, it should be appreciated that stabilizing regulator <b>500</b> may be positioned downstream of stabilizing pressure regulator <b>510</b>. The signal stage relay <b>410</b> and the amplifier stage relay <b>420</b> of example device generally function as the previously described example dual-stage pneumatic control device <b>200</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> except the stabilizing pressure regulators <b>500</b> and <b>510</b> provide independent pressure supply to each stage, signal stage E and amplifier stage F to enhance device stability and to improve overall pneumatic control device performance. For example, the signal stage pressure regulator <b>500</b> may be set to 8 psig, whereas the amplifier stage pressure regulator <b>510</b> may be set to 35 psig. Generally, the signal stage E is set to a lower pressure than the amplifier stage F. That is, the signal stage pressure may be set at a minimal operating point to operate the amplifier stage F. The lower signal stage pressure improves pneumatic control device stability and performance in the following manner: 1) lower signal stage supply pressure directly reduces the feedback force that can be generated by the signal stage relay <b>410</b> (i.e. Force=Pressure&#xd7;Area); and 2) lower pressure directly reduces the gas consumed by the signal stage relay <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a signal stage <b>610</b> to further improve pneumatic control device performance. That is, in combination with the low signal stage pressure of the example pneumatic control device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the present example signal stage <b>610</b> has a reduced feedback area to further reduce feedback forces on a sensor. The example signal stage relay <b>610</b> includes a relay body <b>612</b> having smaller internal diameter relative to the feedback passage <b>614</b> and/or the previously described relay body <b>312</b> of the example pneumatic control device <b>200</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The corresponding feedback passage <b>614</b> is also reduced in diameter to provide a sealing engagement with a seal or an o-ring <b>626</b>. As previously described, the fluid pressure in the feedback passage <b>614</b> acts upon the inner surface <b>617</b> and the seal or o-ring <b>626</b> to apply a negative feedback force on the linkage to provide a proportional output from a control device. As a result, the reduced feedback area provides a reduced feedback force to a sensor coupled to a pneumatic control device.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The combination of low pressure signal stage and the reduced feedback-area signal stage may improve device stability for feedback sensors with high gain. By controlling the feedback area in a predetermined manner and configuring signal stage pressure independent of amplifier stage pressure, a pneumatic control device can be adapted to stabilize a broad variety of displacement-style level controllers.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In summary it should be appreciated that the example device disclosed herein substantially eliminates the transition bleed of the control device fashioning a dual-stage pneumatic relay that positively closes an exhaust port of the relay before a supply port opens. Additionally, a seal or an o-ring of a signal stage relay provides significant negative feedback area to counteract or offset the lever force on the signal stage relay in a throttling or proportioning manner while providing increased gain to improve overall system performance.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although certain example apparatus have been described herein, the scope of coverage of this patent is not limited thereto. On the contrary, this patent covers all methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture fairly falling within the scope of the appended claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>
