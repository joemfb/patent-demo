<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a heating device for heating a member to be heated, by electromagnetic induction, and an image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, there has been known a heating device for heating a member to be heated (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;to-be-heated member&#x201d;) by electromagnetic induction. For example, in an image forming apparatus, such as a copying machine or a printer, such a heating device heats a metal roller or a metal belt, which is a to-be-heated member, by electromagnetic induction, and fixes a toner image formed on a sheet using the heat of the heated to-be-heated member.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There has also been known an image forming apparatus of this type, which detects a change in the state of a metal belt as the to-be-heated member, such as a damage, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-328159.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> schematically shows a fixing device as a heating device for the image forming apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-328159. The fixing device has an inlet upper roller <b>6</b> and an exit upper roller <b>7</b> arranged on upstream and downstream sides, respectively, in a manner spaced from each other. A fixing belt <b>2</b>, which is an endless metal belt, is wound and stretched between the inlet and exit upper rollers <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. A nip pad <b>8</b> for applying pressure to a sheet, and a temperature-detecting thermistor <b>4</b> are arranged inside the fixing belt <b>2</b>. An inlet lower roller <b>10</b> and an exit lower roller <b>11</b> are arranged on the upstream and downstream sides, respectively, in a manner spaced from each other, and an endless pressing belt <b>9</b> is wound and stretched between the inlet and exit lower rollers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. A nip pad <b>12</b> is disposed inside the pressing belt <b>9</b>. An antenna <b>3</b> for detecting magnetic flux is disposed inside the fixing belt <b>2</b> at a location opposite to an induction heating coil <b>1</b> with the fixing belt <b>2</b> positioned therebetween. The antenna <b>3</b> is connected to an energization inhibition circuit, not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The magnetic flux entering the antenna <b>3</b> varies depending on the state of the fixing belt <b>2</b>, and therefore, the image forming apparatus is configured to detect the state of the fixing belt <b>2</b> according to the magnetic flux entering the antenna <b>3</b> and make the energization inhibition circuit operable to stop the operation of the induction heating coil <b>1</b> if there is abnormality in the state of the fixing belt <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the image forming apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-328159, the nip pad <b>8</b> and the temperature-detecting thermistor <b>4</b> are arranged inside the fixing belt <b>2</b>, and hence there are limitations to the shape and material of the antenna <b>3</b>. Further, the inside of the fixing belt <b>2</b> is under a high-temperature environment, and hence it is necessary to use heat-resistant members which are high in cost, for the antenna <b>3</b>, which reduces the degree of freedom in design.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, normally, to prevent members other than the fixing belt <b>2</b> which is the to-be-heated member, particularly members that are not desired to be heated, from generating heat by induction heating, the image forming apparatus is provided with magnetic shields. However, the magnetic shields sometimes adversely affect the antenna <b>3</b>, causing reduced voltage output from the antenna <b>3</b>, which sometimes makes it difficult to detect a small magnetic flux.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a heating device and an image forming apparatus which make it possible to improve the degree of freedom in design to enhance the accuracy of detecting the state of a to-be-heated member, and easily reduce cost.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a heating device comprising a coil that generates magnetic flux by flow of electric current therethrough, a core formed of a magnetic material, for forming a magnetic path, a to-be-heated member configured to generate heat by action of the magnetic flux generated by the coil, a magnetic flux-detecting unit disposed in an area opposite to the to-be-heated member with the core positioned therebetween, for detecting magnetic flux passing through the area, and a control unit configured to determine whether or not a state of the to-be-heated member has changed, based on a result of detection by the magnetic flux-detecting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image forming apparatus comprising a transfer unit configured to transfer a toner image onto a recording medium, a coil that generates magnetic flux by flow of electric current therethrough, a core formed of a magnetic material, for forming a magnetic path, a fixing belt configured to generate heat by action of the magnetic flux generated by the coil, and thereby heat the toner image transferred onto the recording medium, a magnetic flux-detecting unit disposed in an area opposite to the fixing belt with the core positioned therebetween, for detecting magnetic flux passing through the area, and a control unit configured to determine whether or not a state of the fixing belt has changed, based on a result of detection by the magnetic flux-detecting unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention will now be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings showing embodiments thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of a whole image forming apparatus to which is applied a heating device according to an embodiment of the present invention. The image forming apparatus, denoted by reference numeral <b>900</b>, is configured as an electrophotographic full-color printer including a fixing unit <b>911</b> as a heating device, by way of example.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The image forming apparatus <b>900</b> includes image forming units of four colors, arranged in a tandem manner from left to right, as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The image forming units are each an electrophotographic processing mechanism based on a laser exposure method, and have the same configuration. Component elements associated with yellow, magenta, cyan, and black are denoted by symbols &#x201c;y&#x201d;, &#x201c;m&#x201d;, &#x201c;c&#x201d;, and &#x201c;bk&#x201d;, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Now, a description will be given of a yellow image forming unit. In the image forming apparatus <b>900</b>, a charging roller <b>902</b><i>y </i>charges a photosensitive drum <b>901</b><i>y </i>to a predetermined potential, to thereby smooth the potential of the photosensitive drum <b>901</b><i>y</i>. The photosensitive drum <b>901</b><i>y </i>rotates counterclockwise, as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and a laser unit <b>903</b><i>y </i>scans the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>901</b><i>y </i>by laser beam, and forms an electrostatic latent image on the surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, an intermediate transfer belt <b>906</b> is wound and stretched between a driving roller <b>921</b>, a driven roller <b>922</b>, and a secondary transfer roller <b>907</b>, and is driven for clockwise rotation, as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A primary transfer charging roller <b>905</b><i>y </i>is disposed on the reverse side of the intermediate transfer belt <b>906</b>. According to the electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>901</b><i>y</i>, toner is attached to the photosensitive drum <b>901</b><i>y </i>by a development blade <b>904</b><i>y</i>. At this time, the toner image attached to the photosensitive drum <b>901</b><i>y </i>matches an image drawn as the electrostatic latent image. After the photosensitive drum <b>901</b><i>y </i>further rotates, the toner image is transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>906</b>. The other image forming units each have the same arrangement as the yellow image forming unit, and hence descriptions thereof are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The four-color toner image attached to the intermediate transfer belt <b>906</b> is transferred onto a sheet P, which is a recording medium conveyed from a sheet cassette <b>910</b> via a sheet conveying path <b>912</b><i>a</i>, by the secondary transfer roller <b>907</b> and a secondary-transfer opposed roller <b>908</b>. Toner remaining on the intermediate transfer belt <b>906</b> without being transferred onto the sheet P is removed by a cleaning unit <b>909</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The sheet P having the toner image attached thereto is conveyed to the fixing unit <b>911</b> via a sheet conveying path <b>912</b><i>b</i>, and the toner image, which is unfixed, is fixed on the sheet P by heat and pressure. The sheet P having the toner image fixed thereon is discharged via a sheet conveying path <b>912</b><i>c </i>as a product.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next, a description will be given of the arrangement of the fixing unit <b>911</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically shows the fixing unit <b>911</b>.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the fixing unit <b>911</b>, an upper fixing belt <b>120</b>, which is an endless to-be-heated member, is wound and stretched between two core metals <b>123</b> such that the fixing belt <b>120</b> is rotated by rotations of the core metals <b>123</b>. The fixing belt <b>120</b> is made of metal, and is heated by a so-called electromagnetic induction heating method, in which heat is generated by an eddy current caused to flow by the action of an alternating magnetic flux generated by an induction heating coil <b>101</b>. More specifically, the fixing belt <b>120</b> has a rubber layer formed on the front side of a conductive layer made of metal, and heat is generated by the eddy current flowing through the conductive layer. A material which has a high relative permeability and hence is highly permeable to magnetic flux is selected for the conductive layer of the fixing belt <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, a lower fixing belt <b>121</b>, which is an endless pressing belt, is wound and stretched between two core metals <b>124</b> such that the fixing belt <b>121</b> is rotated by rotations of the core metals <b>124</b>. The sheet P having the unfixed toner image attached thereto passes between the two fixing belts <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>, whereby the unfixed toner image is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Nip pads <b>130</b> and <b>131</b>, which are metal plates for applying pressure to the sheet P, are arranged inside the upper and lower fixing belts <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>, respectively, whereby spaces inside the upper and lower fixing belts <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> are narrowed. Further, a thermistor <b>133</b> is disposed inside the upper fixing belt <b>120</b>, and the wiring of the thermistor <b>133</b> is shielded by a magnetic shield <b>132</b> in a simplified fashion. The temperature of the fixing belt <b>120</b> is measured by the thermistor <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A heating coil unit <b>110</b> is disposed close to an upper portion of the fixing belt <b>120</b>. The heating coil unit <b>110</b> comprises the induction heating coil <b>101</b>, ferrite cores <b>102</b>, which are magnetic bodies, and a casing <b>111</b> for supporting the whole heating coil unit <b>110</b>. The induction heating coil <b>101</b> is designed such that magnetic flux generated by the same passes through magnetic paths mainly formed by the ferrite cores <b>102</b> and the fixing belt <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A loop antenna <b>140</b> as a magnetic flux-detecting unit (hereinafter simply referred to as the &#x201c;antenna <b>140</b>&#x201d;) is disposed close to an upper portion (outer portion) of the heating coil unit <b>110</b>. More specifically, the antenna <b>140</b> is disposed in an area at a location opposite to the fixing belt <b>120</b> with the ferrite cores <b>102</b> positioned therebetween, and detects magnetic flux passing through the area. The position of the antenna <b>140</b> is also an area at a location opposite to the fixing belt <b>120</b> with the induction heating coil <b>101</b> positioned therebetween. The antenna <b>140</b> is configured to generate voltage or current by magnetic flux, and in the present embodiment, detects magnetic flux using an output voltage. The basic arrangement of the antenna <b>140</b> is the same as the antenna disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-328159. The antenna <b>140</b> extends in the direction of width of the fixing belt <b>120</b> (direction of depth as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and is disposed such that an electric wire reciprocates in the extending direction of the antenna <b>140</b> to form a generally annular shape (form a loop) longer in the extending direction.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of a control mechanism of the fixing unit <b>911</b>. An output voltage from the antenna <b>140</b> is delivered to a control circuit (control unit) <b>170</b> via an AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b>. The control circuit <b>170</b> controls the operation of an IH (induction heating) power supply <b>180</b> such that it can start and stop the IH power supply <b>180</b>. The IH power supply <b>180</b> is controlled as above to thereby drivingly control the induction heating coil <b>101</b>. The control circuit <b>170</b> comprises a CPU, not shown, an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), not shown, and so forth, and controls the overall operation of the fixing unit <b>911</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit diagram of the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b>. An output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> is proportional to the output voltage from the antenna <b>140</b>, and hence based on the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b>, it is possible to know the level of voltage generated by the antenna <b>140</b>. The waveform of the voltage generated by the antenna <b>140</b> is similar to a waveform of the differentiation of magnetic flux entering the antenna <b>140</b>, and the magnetic flux entering the antenna <b>140</b> is generated by electric current flowing through the induction heating coil <b>101</b>. Therefore, the basic frequency of the waveform of the voltage generated by the antenna <b>140</b> is the same as the basic frequency of an AC current flowing through the induction heating coil <b>101</b>, and is approximately 20 KHz to 80 KHz.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> show the waveform of an output from the antenna <b>140</b>, a waveform of the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b>, and a DC waveform, respectively. Hereinafter, the operation and waveform of the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> converts a high-frequency AC voltage <b>200</b> generated by the antenna <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) to a DC voltage <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>), for outputting the same. To this end, in the present embodiment, there is employed a voltage doubler rectifier circuit <b>161</b> which includes diodes <b>163</b> and <b>164</b>, and capacitors <b>165</b> and <b>166</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At an observation point PA of the voltage doubler rectifier circuit <b>161</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a waveform <b>201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) is observed, and the output signal has a DC voltage <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>). Further, the voltage doubler rectifier circuit <b>161</b> can be provided with a resistance <b>162</b> for adjusting discharge current, so as to change the drop rate of the DC voltage <b>202</b>, as desired. As described above, it is possible to know the level of voltage output from the antenna <b>140</b> based on an output signal from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> show magnetic paths formed when the fixing belt <b>120</b> is normal and when the same is abnormal, respectively. Now, the phrase &#x201c;when the fixing belt <b>120</b> is abnormal&#x201d; is intended to mean &#x201c;when the state of the fixing belt <b>120</b> has changed from a normal state thereof&#x201d;. The phrase is intended to mean, for example, &#x201c;when the fixing belt <b>120</b> suffers from damage (belt abnormality), such as breakage and peeling. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, component parts inside the fixing belt <b>121</b> and the fixing belt <b>120</b> are omitted from illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, when the fixing belt <b>120</b> is normal, much of magnetic flux generated by the induction heating coil <b>101</b> flows to pass through magnetic paths formed by the ferrite cores <b>102</b> and the fixing belt <b>120</b>. Magnetic flux flowing through the ferrite cores <b>102</b> is referred to as &#x201c;the magnetic flux <b>50</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the fixing belt <b>120</b>, when an eddy current flows, Joule heat is generated to thereby generate heat, and at the same time magnetic flux is generated by the eddy current in a direction of canceling magnetic flux generated by the induction heating coil <b>101</b>, whereby a magnetomotive force is generated in a direction opposite to a direction of a magnetomotive force generated by the induction heating coil <b>101</b>. At this time, magnetic flux <b>150</b> which does not pass through the ferrite cores <b>102</b> exists around the heating coil unit <b>110</b>, and a ratio of the amount (density) of the magnetic flux <b>150</b> which does not pass through the ferrite cores <b>102</b> to the amount of the magnetic flux <b>50</b> passing through the ferrite cores <b>102</b> is held constant.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Therefore, if the amount of the magnetic flux <b>150</b> which does not through the ferrite cores <b>102</b> is detected by the antenna <b>140</b> disposed at a location around the heating coil unit <b>110</b>, it is possible to estimate the amount of the magnetic flux <b>50</b> passing through the ferrite cores <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a case where the fixing belt <b>120</b> is broken for some reason (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>), the magnetic flux which was generated by the eddy current flowing through the fixing belt <b>120</b> and flowed in the direction opposite to the direction of the magnetic flux generated by the induction heating coil <b>101</b> is no longer generated. Therefore, the magnetomotive force which was generated in the direction opposite to the direction of the magnetomotive force generated by the induction heating coil <b>101</b> is no longer generated either.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At this time, the fixing belt <b>120</b> having a higher magnetic permeability than that in the air does is substantially lost at a damaged portion thereof, and hence the magnetic resistance of the whole magnetic circuit increases. However, the effects of disappearance of the magnetomotive force generated by the eddy current are dominant, which increases the total amount of the magnetic flux. For this reason, when the fixing belt <b>120</b> is damaged, the amount of the magnetic flux <b>50</b> passing through the ferrite cores <b>102</b> increases to thereby also increase the amount of the magnetic flux <b>150</b> passing through the antenna <b>140</b>, whereby the level of the output voltage from the antenna <b>140</b> becomes higher (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). Therefore, when the fixing belt <b>120</b> is damaged, the value of the output signal from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> becomes larger than when the fixing belt <b>120</b> is normal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, a description will be given of a method in which the control circuit <b>170</b> determines whether or not the state of the fixing belt <b>120</b> has changed, based on the results of detection by the antenna <b>140</b> (process for determining abnormality of the fixing belt).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show waveforms of the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> when the fixing belt <b>120</b> is normal and when the same is abnormal, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.7A</figref>, when induction heating is started at a certain time point (IH start), the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> (detected voltage) rises and then is held almost constant. The value of the output does not exceed a reference threshold value TH until the induction heating is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, when some abnormality occurs in the fixing belt <b>120</b> during operation of the induction heating, causing breakage of part of the fixing belt <b>120</b>, the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> suddenly rises after a time point when the part of the fixing belt <b>120</b> has been broken, to exceed the reference threshold value TH. This state continues until the induction heating is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Therefore, the control circuit <b>170</b> can determine whether or not the state of the fixing belt <b>120</b> has changed, by monitoring the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> and comparing the output with the reference threshold value TH. In this case, it is possible to determine that the fixing belt <b>120</b> suffers from belt abnormality when the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> has exceeded the reference threshold value TH.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart of a process for determining abnormality of the fixing belt <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the image forming apparatus <b>900</b> starts a print job, the control circuit <b>170</b> causes the fixing unit <b>911</b> to start a fixing operation (step S<b>101</b>). Next, the control circuit <b>170</b> starts driving the IH power supply <b>180</b> to thereby cause an AC current to flow through the induction heating coil <b>101</b> (step S<b>102</b>). More specifically, to raise the temperature of the fixing belt <b>120</b> to a temperature required for printing (e.g. 200&#xb0; C. ), the control circuit <b>170</b> performs induction heating during the print job.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Then, the control circuit <b>170</b> determines whether or not the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> has exceeded the reference threshold value TH during driving of the IH power supply <b>180</b> (step S<b>103</b>). More specifically, the control circuit <b>170</b> continues to monitor the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> while the IH power supply <b>180</b> is in operation for the fixing operation of the fixing unit <b>911</b>. Then, the control circuit <b>170</b> determines whether or not the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> has exceeded the reference threshold value TH, before the induction heating for the fixing operation becomes unnecessary and the driving of the IH power supply <b>180</b> is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As a result of the determination, if the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> has exceeded the reference threshold value TH during the driving of the IH power supply <b>180</b>, the control circuit <b>170</b> determines that the belt abnormality has occurred (step S<b>104</b>). In this case, the control circuit <b>170</b> performs emergency stop of driving of the IH power supply <b>180</b> to thereby stop supply of electric power to the induction heating coil <b>101</b> (step S<b>105</b>). The emergency stop of the IH power supply <b>180</b> makes it possible to prevent the fixing operation from being continued in an abnormal state. As a result, it is possible to improve safety by preventing occurrence of a further failure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">On the other hand, in the step S<b>103</b>, if the driving of the IH power supply <b>180</b> has been terminated without the output from the AC to DC conversion circuit <b>160</b> exceeding the reference threshold value TH, the control circuit <b>170</b> terminates the fixing operation (step S<b>106</b>). In this case, occurrence of the belt abnormality is not detected.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the present embodiment, the antenna <b>140</b> is disposed in the area at a location opposite to the fixing belt <b>120</b> with the ferrite cores <b>102</b> positioned therebetween. This area where the antenna <b>140</b> is disposed is not in a narrow space inside the fixing belt <b>120</b> but in a wide space outside the fixing belt <b>120</b>, so that in configuring the antenna <b>140</b> such that a sufficient detection signal can be obtained, limitations to the shape and material of the antenna <b>140</b> are reduced. Further, the above-described area for disposing the antenna <b>140</b> is not under a high-temperature environment, differently from the inside of the fixing belt <b>120</b>, and hence it is not necessary to use an expensive, highly heat-resistant member for the antenna <b>140</b>. Moreover, the antenna <b>140</b> disposed outside the fixing belt <b>120</b> is not adversely affected by the magnetic shield <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and hence it is easy to secure high output from the antenna <b>140</b> and easy to detect a small magnetic flux. This makes it possible to improve the degree of freedom in design, enhance the accuracy of detecting the state of the fixing belt <b>120</b>, and easily reduce cost.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, when the belt abnormality occurs, the driving of the IH power supply <b>180</b> is forcibly stopped. This makes it possible to avoid wasteful processing and improve safety.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The area for disposing the antenna <b>140</b> is by no means limited to the above-described example. That is, it is only required to dispose the antenna <b>140</b> in such an area as makes it possible to detect magnetic flux leaking from magnetic paths formed to extend through the ferrite cores <b>102</b> and the fixing belt <b>120</b>. Therefore, it is possible to dispose the antenna <b>140</b> at a desired location around the heating coil unit <b>110</b>, opposite to the fixing belt <b>120</b> with the ferrite cores <b>102</b> and the heating coil unit <b>110</b> positioned therebetween. This also leads to the enhanced degree of freedom in design of the heating device.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, the construction of the &#x201c;magnetic flux-detecting unit&#x201d; for detecting magnetic flux is not limited to the antenna <b>140</b>, but the magnetic flux-detecting unit may be constructed using a hall element or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, the &#x201c;to-be-heated member&#x201d; as a target of which a change in state is to be determined is not limited to the fixing belt of a belt fixing type fixing device. For example, the to-be-heated member may be a fixing roller of a roller fixing type fixing device or a supporting member for supporting solid ink, in an ink jet printer. In this case, it is envisaged that a change in the state of the fixing roller or the supporting member corresponds to deformation, such as damage or distortion, of the fixing roller or the supporting member.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Although in the above-described embodiment, the present invention is applied to the fixing device for the image forming apparatus, this is not limitative, but the present invention can be applied to any device insofar as it is a heating device in which a to-be-heated member generates heat by electromagnetic induction. For example, the present invention can be applied to a heating device for a laminating process for forming a layered member by affixing thin layers of materials to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all modifications, equivalent structures and functions.</p>
