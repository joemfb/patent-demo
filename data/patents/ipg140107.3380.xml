<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF BENEFIT TO PRIOR APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit of an earlier-filed United Kingdom Patent Application 1017971.1, filed Oct. 25, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to renewable energy monitoring systems, in particular to renewable energy monitoring systems comprising wireless repeaters designed for short range wireless data transmission.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless repeaters can be used to increase the range between devices communicating wirelessly. They may be of benefit in situations where a source and receiver are positioned out of wireless range of one another; the wireless repeater acting as an intermediate &#x2018;hop&#x2019; in the transmission path from source to receiver thereby allowing devices to be separated by a greater distance than normally possible.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some scenarios a single wireless repeater can be insufficient to maintain communication between a wireless source and monitoring station because the distance, even with a wireless repeater, may be too great. In other situations the characteristics of the operating environment may greatly attenuate the wireless data signal and so communication may be further impaired. Metal lined partitions and metallic foil lined insulation in buildings can severely impact wireless transmission for example.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A particular problem exists for communications with renewable energy monitoring systems using solar photovoltaic (PV) power inverters because they are typically located on the roof of a property. The PV power inverter may need to communicate with a gateway, which may be a wireless base station connected to a residential gateway (ADSL or cable modem for example) located, typically, on the ground floor of a building. In such situations wireless transmission is required through a roof and potentially several floors of the property.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One solution is to use multiple repeaters (multi-hop transmission), but this increases the cost and can also be unsightly and inconvenient to the consumer having to install multiple repeaters in the property.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is therefore a need for an improved wireless repeater avoiding the cost and inconvenience of installing multiple repeaters in a property.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Background prior art can be found in EP2169847 A2, US2005/0201397 A1, US2002/0080027 A1, WO2005/119609 A2, EP1748576 A2, US2009/0160395 A1, CN101674032 A.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a renewable energy, in particular solar photovoltaic, monitoring system for monitoring a renewable energy generation device mounted on or adjacent to a building, comprising: a device monitor coupled to a renewable energy generation device to monitor said renewable energy generation device and generate monitoring data defining a status of said renewable energy generation device, said device monitor wirelessly communicating said monitoring data to an gateway using a wireless communications link, said gateway receiving said monitoring data from said device monitor and communicating said monitoring data to a monitoring station; and a wireless repeater providing said communications link between said device monitor and said gateway, wherein said wireless repeater comprises: a wireless transceiver module; a plurality of spaced apart antennas coupled to said wireless transceiver module; at least one antenna interface having one or more of said plurality of spaced apart antennas electrically coupled thereto; wherein said wireless transceiver module is coupled to said at least one antenna interface, said wireless transceiver module comprising data receiving and transmission means to receive said monitoring data from at least one of said plurality of spaced apart antennas and to transmit said monitoring data using one or more other of said plurality of spaced apart antennas, and a processing element coupled to said data receiving and transmission means to process said monitoring data received and transmitted from said one or more of said plurality of antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Antennas are spaced apart, at least one located within communication range of each device transmit or receive data (or both transmit and receive), such as the device monitor and gateway. Data transmitted by either device is received by an antenna then retransmitted using one or more other antennas (which may also include the same antenna received the data that is then retransmitted. The same renewable energy monitoring system can be used for both residential properties and commercial establishments without needing to change this hardware by repositioning each antenna accordingly. The renewable energy generation device may be located on the roof of the building for example, in particular if the device is a solar PV system incorporating a solar PV cell and solar PV inverter. The device monitor may be coupled to, or integrated within, the solar PV inverter (or other renewable energy generation device). Where only monitoring is required, communication may only need to be unidirectional from the device monitor to a monitoring station (although it will be appreciated that communication may also be bidirectional and provide control data, or requests for monitoring data to the renewable energy generation device). The monitoring station may be local, within the building for example, or alternatively may also be remote. A remote monitoring station may be located at the utility provider (the provider of the renewable energy generation device) who may monitor multiple systems in parallel for each residential/commercial building (to monitor the status and functionality of the energy generation devices). Alternatively or additionally, the monitoring may further be record energy generation data to credit a user's account with electricity fed into an electrical grid.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In embodiments said gateway receives control data from said monitoring station and communicates said control data to said device monitor using said wireless communications link; said wireless transceiver module receives said control data from at least one of said plurality of spaced apart antennas and transmits said control data using one or more other of said plurality of spaced apart antennas; and said device monitor receives said control data from said gateway and controls said renewable energy generation device dependent on said control data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Control information may be sent from the monitoring station to the energy generation device, including for example activation and deactivation information, positioning data, and update control firmware for example.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In embodiments a said wireless transceiver module is coupled to one of the antenna interfaces; the antenna interface being electrically coupled to two or more of said plurality of antennas, said coupling comprising a transmission line splitter, wherein: said transmission line splitter transmits monitoring data received from at least one of said two or more of said plurality of antennas to said antenna interface, and said transmission line splitter transmits monitoring data received from said antenna interface to each of said two or more of said plurality of antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In further embodiments said transmission line splitter transmits control data received from at least one of said two or more of said plurality of antennas to said first antenna interface, and said transmission line splitter transmits control data received from said first antenna interface to each of said two or more of said plurality of antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Multiple antennas are coupled to a single antenna interface on the wireless repeater using a transmission line splitter. This advantageously changes the transmission and reception regions, each region being such each of the devices can be communicated with by an antenna. Transmission power of the wireless repeater does not necessarily need to be increased as a result of power dividing the signal between the multiple antennas using the transmission line splitter because each antenna can be positioned within range of each device being communication with.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In embodiments the transmission line splitter is impedance matched to transmission lines electrically coupling said two or more of said plurality of antennas to said transmission line splitter. In embodiments said transmission lines comprise coaxial cable. Impedance matching provides for maximum power transfer, helps to minimise losses in the transmission lines and minimises signal reflections.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The regions of transmission and reception associated with each of said plurality of spaced apart antennas may be non-overlapping. In embodiments said renewable energy monitoring system is located on or within a building, said building comprising at least two separate regions separated by a partition, wherein: a first of said plurality of spaced apart antennas is located in a first of said at least two separate regions of said building and a second of said plurality of spaced apart antennas is located in a second of said at least two separate regions of said building; and said regions of transmission and reception associated with each of said first and second of said plurality of spaced apart antennas are non-overlapping, said partition limiting said transmission and reception.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In embodiments of the renewable energy monitoring system a first of said plurality of spaced apart antennas is located proximally to said device monitor and a second of said plurality of spaced apart antennas is located proximally to said gateway.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Advantageously this minimises power requirements for the wireless transceivers as only a short transmission range is required, perhaps in the order of several to tens of metres.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In embodiments said renewable energy generation device comprises a photovoltaic inverter. The gateway provides a link to a remote monitoring station (at a solar PV energy company or manufacturer for example) which may monitors and controls the operation of the solar PV inverter. The gateway may be a wireless base station connected to a communications gateway such as an ADSL modem, cable router or network interface installed within the property. Alternatively the gateway may communicate or be integrated into a local monitoring station within the property, providing direct monitoring and control of the solar PV inverter.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In embodiments of the renewable energy monitoring system said device monitor and said gateway and said wireless transceiver module comprise comprises a Zigbee&#x2122; transceiver module providing low rate data transmission and long battery life (compared to higher performance higher power wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of monitoring a renewable energy generation, in particular solar photovoltaic, device mounted on or adjacent to a building, the method comprising: generating monitoring data at a renewable energy generation device, said monitoring data defining a status of said renewable energy generation device; wirelessly communicating said monitoring data to an gateway using a wireless communications link, said gateway communicating said monitoring data to a monitoring station; using a wireless repeater to provide said wireless communications link, the wireless repeater comprising: a plurality of spaced apart antennas each having an associated region of transmission and reception, and at least one antenna interface having one or more of said plurality of spaced apart antennas electrically coupled thereto; the method further comprising using a wireless transceiver module to receive monitoring data from at least one of said plurality of spaced apart antennas using data receiving means, processing said received monitoring data, and transmitting said processed and received monitoring data using said data transmission means to one or more other of said plurality of spaced apart antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Antennas are spaced apart, each located within communication range of one of the devices to communicate with. Data transmitted by each device is received by each antenna then retransmitted using one or more other antennas. The same renewable energy monitoring system can be used for both residential properties and commercial establishments without needing to change this hardware by repositioning each antenna accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In embodiments the method further comprises: said gateway receiving control data from said monitoring station; communicating said control data to said renewable energy generation device using said wireless communications link; said wireless transceiver modules receiving control data from at least one of said plurality of spaced apart antennas using said data receiving means, processing said received control data, and transmitting said processed and received control data using said data transmission means to one or more other of said plurality of spaced apart antennas; and the method further comprising: receiving said control data at said renewable energy generation device and controlling said renewable energy generation device dependent on said control data;</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the method multiple antennas may be coupled to a single antenna interface on the wireless repeater using a transmission line splitter thereby advantageously changing the transmission and reception regions, each region being such that at least one of the devices can be communicated with. Transmission power of the wireless repeater does not necessarily need to be increased as a result of power dividing the signal between the multiple antennas using the transmission line splitter because each antenna can be positioned within range of each device being communication with.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In embodiments the method further comprises impedance matching said transmission line splitter to transmission lines electrically coupling said two or more of said plurality of antennas to said transmission line splitter. In embodiments said transmission lines comprise coaxial cable. Impedance matching provides for maximum power transfer, helps to minimise losses in the transmission lines and minimises signal reflections.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Advantageously this minimises power requirements for the wireless transceivers as only a short transmission range is required, perhaps in the order of several to tens of metres. The wireless transceiver module used in the method may comprise a Zigbee&#x2122; transceiver module for example.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a wireless repeater comprising: a wireless transceiver module; a plurality of spaced apart antennas coupled to said wireless transceiver module; at least one antenna interface having one or more of said plurality of spaced apart antennas electrically coupled thereto; wherein said wireless transceiver module is coupled to said at least one antenna interface, said wireless transceiver module comprising data receiving and transmission means to receive data from at least one of said plurality of spaced apart antennas and to transmit said data using one or more other of said plurality of spaced apart antennas, and a processing element coupled to said data receiving and transmission means to process said data received and transmitted from said one or more of said plurality of antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Antennas are spaced apart, each located within communication range of one of the devices needing to transmit or receive data (or both transmit and receive). Data transmitted by a device is received by an antenna then retransmitted using one or more other antennas.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a residential property <b>1</b> fitted with a solar PV panel <b>30</b> located on roof <b>20</b> fitted with a first embodiment of the invention. A PV power inverter <b>32</b> is mounted on the roof <b>20</b> located under the solar PV panel <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The PV inverter <b>32</b> receives a DC voltage generated by the solar PV panel <b>30</b> and converts it into AC electricity. The generated AC electricity (typically 230V AC or 110V AC depending on country or mains electricity supply for the building) is then fed into the consumer unit <b>22</b> by electricity cable <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A wireless transceiver in a device monitor located on the PV inverter transmits status (monitoring) information and receives control data. This eliminates the need for repeated access to the roof of the property to configure and control the operation of the PV inverter and solar cells. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the PV inverter uses a Zigbee&#x2122; wireless transceiver designed for short range communication, typically over communication distances needed within residential properties. It will however be appreciated that other forms of wireless communication may be used such as Wi-Fi&#x2122; and Bluetooth&#x2122; for example. Zigbee is particularly beneficial to use due to its low power capabilities compared to technology such as Wi-Fi and ability to support products requiring a long battery life.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A gateway <b>24</b> (wireless base station) communicates with the PV inverter providing an interface to the residential network or broadband internet modem/router <b>26</b>. This allows remote access and monitoring of PV inverter and solar cells by the PV inverter provider or electricity supplier at monitoring site <b>34</b>. As this needs to be connected to, typically, a consumer's broadband internet modem/router <b>26</b> the positioning of the gateway <b>24</b> may be restricted to certain locations in the property.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The distance between the wireless base station and PV inverter may be too great to permit direct communication, thereby requiring the use of a wireless repeater to extend the range. This may still be insufficient to communicate through the roof <b>20</b> of the property <b>1</b> due to the construction materials used in the roof such as high performance insulation materials (in particular those using a conductive foil lining), resulting in significant attenuation of the wireless signal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To eliminate the need for multiple wireless repeaters between the PV inverter and wireless base station the repeater <b>10</b> (shown in further detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), is located in the roof space of property <b>1</b>. The antenna output is connected to a transmission line splitter <b>16</b> which in turn is connected to a pair of antennas <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> using coaxial cable. One of these antennas, antenna <b>14</b>, is mounted on the roof of the property in close proximity to the PV inverter and the second antenna <b>12</b> in the roof space of the property. It will be appreciated that second antenna <b>12</b> may alternatively be mounted closer to the wireless base station if needed to stay within communication range. The electricity feed from the PV inverter <b>32</b> to the consumer unit <b>22</b> typically requires a connection through the roof of the property for the electricity cable through and so provides an existing route for the coaxial cable connecting the splitter <b>16</b> to the roof mounted antenna <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The embodiment of the wireless repeater used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in further detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The transceiver module <b>10</b> comprises a radio module <b>47</b> providing transmit and receive radio (transmission and receiver means) and a processing element <b>43</b>. The radio module <b>47</b> receives data from either antenna <b>14</b>, located proximally to the PV inverter in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, extracts and then transmits the digital data to processing element <b>43</b>. The processing element <b>43</b> processes data received and decoded by the radio module <b>47</b>, performing data control, routing and interfacing operations for example. It will be appreciated however that processing may simply require forwarding data back to the radio module <b>47</b>. The processed data is then transmitted by the transmitting portion of radio module <b>47</b> to antennas <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> via transmission line splitter <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Splitter <b>16</b> divides the transmit power being each antenna. Consequently, if the transceiver module has a fixed power output the transmission range of each antenna is reduced compared to use of a single transmit antenna. The antennas are now however located closer to the communicating devices <b>32</b>, <b>24</b> and so communication can be maintained even though the transmit range, per antenna, has been reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If multiple PV inverters are distributed across the roof out of range of the installed antenna <b>14</b> additional antennas may be installed and connected to the splitter <b>16</b>. Again, it will be appreciated that the transmit power per antenna will be further reduced reducing the transmit range of each antenna. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows how the separation of source and receiver devices can be extended according to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The PV inverter <b>32</b> and gateway <b>24</b> are separated by a distance R, where R exceeds the communication range of the wireless transceivers in PV inverter <b>32</b> and reception capabilities of gateway <b>24</b>. Antennas <b>14</b> and <b>12</b> are located proximally to the PV inverter <b>32</b> and gateway <b>24</b> respectively within a communication range r. The regions of transmission and reception associated with each of antennas <b>14</b> and <b>12</b> are be non-overlapping. Communication between the wireless transceivers, with the use a single wireless repeater <b>10</b> is then achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a second embodiment of the invention implemented in a commercial property <b>2</b> fitted with a solar PV panel <b>30</b>. A PV power inverter <b>32</b>, identical to PV power inverter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is mounted on the roof <b>21</b> located under the solar PV panel <b>32</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the roof <b>21</b> is manufactured from corrugated metal sheets, (aluminium for example), resulting in a higher signal attenuation compared to residential property <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The size of the building further increases the distance between the PV inverter <b>32</b> and the gateway <b>24</b> (wireless base station for example).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the wireless repeater <b>11</b> is implemented from a pair of transceiver modules <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, although it will be appreciated that only one may be necessary and the embodiment as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may also be used. One of these antennas, antenna <b>14</b>, is mounted on the roof of the property in close proximity to the PV inverter and the second antenna <b>12</b> in the roof space of the commercial property. The increased size of the property compared to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> requires higher transmit power to reach the gateway <b>24</b> and so dividing the power between multiple antenna may be insufficient. To address this, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the wireless repeater <b>11</b> comprises a pair of transceiver systems <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> interconnected by a wired communication link. Each transceiver system is connected to an antenna <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> by coaxial cable with the connection to the roof antenna <b>14</b> routed similarly to that done in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The second antenna, antenna <b>12</b> is routed through the ceiling <b>17</b> of building <b>2</b> to minimise the obstructions to gateway <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The transceiver modules <b>13</b>,<b>15</b> each comprise a radio module <b>47</b>. Radio module <b>47</b> receives data from antenna <b>14</b>, extracts and then transmits the digital data to processing element <b>43</b>. The processing element <b>43</b> processes data received and decoded by the radio module <b>47</b>, performing data control, routing and interfacing operations for example. It will be appreciated however that processing may simply require forwarding the received data through to the wire link <b>40</b> to the processing element <b>43</b> in transceiver module <b>15</b>. The communicated data is then transmitted by the transmitting portion of transceiver <b>48</b> radio module <b>47</b> to antenna <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The wired communication link <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is implemented using a serial link and serial wire protocol&#x2014;an interface and standard commonly found on wireless transceiver modules such as those implementing the Zigbee standard. It will be appreciated however that many difference wired interfaces and standards are available and any such standard may be adopted. Preferably, however the interface standard adopted will be low power so that the receiver can run off a battery.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Each antenna output in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be further split as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to change the transmission and reception regions, at a cost of reduced range per antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">No doubt many other effective alternatives will occur to the skilled person. It will be understood that the invention is not limited to the described embodiments and encompasses modifications apparent to those skilled in the art lying within the scope of the claims appended hereto.</p>
