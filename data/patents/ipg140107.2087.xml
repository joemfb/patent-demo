<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to an apparatus for inducing flow in a molten material. In particular, but not exclusively, the invention relates to apparatus comprising an arrangement for mounting an electromagnetic induction stirring unit to a vessel for containing molten materials. The invention also relates to a mounting plate for mounting an electromagnetic induction stirring unit to a vessel for containing molten materials.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is known to provide furnaces for the melting and refining of metal materials, including aluminium, or other materials. Furnaces have also been used to recycle scrap metal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is accepted that the melting and refining process can be improved by stirring the molten metal in the furnace. Stirring the molten metal distributes heat more evenly throughout the melt and so improves the efficiency of the process. Where additional solid-state materials, such as scrap metal for recycling and/or additives, are introduced into the melt in the furnace, stirring can assist in mixing the solid state material with the melt more quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known to provide a stirring apparatus in the form of an electromagnetic induction unit (a type of linear induction motor) positioned underneath the furnace in a horizontal plane adjacent a bottom wall of the furnace. The magnetic field created by the induction unit acts through a relatively thick steel plate and internal refractory lining on the bottom of the furnace to stir the molten material slowly in a horizontal plane, in an attempt to disperse the heat evenly throughout the melt. However, it is believed that such a treatment of molten metal may have disadvantages at least in certain applications. For example, when additional scrap metal material or alloy additives such as silicon are introduced into the furnace on top of the melt, the stirring action provided by the electromagnetic induction unit does not contribute greatly to mixing the new scrap metal material/additives evenly throughout the melt. Often the scrap metal material/additive will be quite light (particularly a silicon additive) and will simply float on the surface of the melt as it is stirred around in a horizontal plane rather than, for example, being dragged downwardly into the molten metal where it can be melted and mixed much more quickly and effectively. Once again, scrap metal with a high surface area to mass ratio (for example shredded aluminium drink cans) will simply float on the top of the melt and become oxidised rather than being submerged within the bath to be melted down and recycled in an efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, in order to stir the metal, it is necessary that the induction unit provide a deep magnetic field that propagates through the furnace construction to penetrate into the molten material in the furnace. This requires the induction device to be operated at very low frequencies, typically 1 Hz. Consequently the speed of stirring is relatively low.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The applicant has proposed in WO 03/106668 to mount an electromagnetic induction unit on an angled wall of a furnace port to induce a flow or stirring in the molten metal having both a vertical and a horizontal component. This arrangement can be used to help draw scrap materials or additives down into the molten material to aid in mixing. As described, the electromagnetic induction unit sets up a circulating flow of material in the furnace by creating a downward flow of material at one end. Because the electromagnetic field does not have to penetrate as far into the molten material as with the previously known arrangements, it is possible to use an electromagnetic induction unit capable of operating at frequencies up to 60 Hz but which produces a shallower magnetic field. This is advantageous as it enables relatively fast flow rates to be achieved, leading to improved flexibility in mixing. The direction of the magnetic field can also be reversed and the system used to extract molten material from the furnace by pulling the molten meal up the angled wall and into an extraction chute.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the applicant's proposed system, the electromagnetic induction unit operates at a relatively high frequency when compared with the previously known system and the depth of the magnetic field is comparatively shallow. As a result, it is not possible to mount the induction unit to the vessel using a thick steel plate and refractory construction as used in the previously known arrangement, as this would prevent the magnetic field from penetrating into the molten material to a sufficient depth. Instead, the induction unit is mounted to the vessel by means of a thin metal carbide plate construction made up of a number of separate tiles. Whilst this method of mounting the induction unit has proved to be effective in use, it is complex and time consuming to construct. A further drawback is that the furnace cannot be used with the induction unit removed unless the induction unit is replaced by a substitute plate to ensure the integrity of the furnace. Accordingly, if there is a need to repair or replace the induction unit, it is often necessary to shut the furnace down.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is then a need for an improved apparatus for inducing flow in a molten material in which some or all of the shortfalls of the prior known arrangements are overcome, or at least mitigated. In particular, there is a need for improved apparatus for inducing flow in a molten material having an improved arrangement for mounting an electromagnetic stirring unit to a vessel for containing a molten material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is also a need for am improved mounting plate for mounting and an electromagnetic stirring unit to a vessel for containing a molten material which overcomes, or at least mitigates, some or all of the shortfalls of the prior known mounting plate arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided apparatus for inducing flow in a molten material, the apparatus comprising a refractory lined vessel for containing a molten material, an aperture or region of reduced thickness in the refractory lining, a mounting plate of non-magnetic material removably mounted to the vessel over the aperture or region of reduced thickness, an electromagnetic induction unit mounted adjacent an exterior face of the mounting plate and a cooling system for cooling the mounting plate in use.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The cooling system may comprise an arrangement for inducing a flow of cooling fluid between the electromagnetic induction unit and the mounting plate. The cooling system may comprise a plurality of cooling channels through which the cooling fluid flows in use. The mounting plate, at least where it extends over the aperture or region of reduced thickness in the refractory lining, may have a continuous inner surface region and an outer surface region with a plurality of spaced vanes defining the cooling channels. Some of the vanes may follow a non-linear path, at least in an area of the mounting plate through which the magnetic field generated by the induction unit passes in use. The non-linear path may be a curved or zigzag path across said area. The inner surface region and the vanes may be integrally formed from a single piece of material.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The mounting plate may be made of austenitic steel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The mounting plate may have a thickness in the range of 10 to 30 mm, and preferably in the range of 15 to 25 mm and more preferably in the range of 18 to 22 mm. The vanes may have a height in the range of 5 to 25 mm, and preferably in the range of 10 to 20 mm, and more preferably in the range of 13 to 17 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The mounting plate may be part of a mounting plate assembly for mounting the induction unit to the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The mounting plate may have a recess in the outer surface region fluidly connected with an inlet end of the fluid-cooling channels and the mounting plate assembly may comprise a cowling attached to the mounting plate for directing a flow of fluid into the recess from a fluid-flow source. The cowling may comprise means for mounting at least one cooling fan, the cowling being configured to direct air from the at least one fan into the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The mounting plate assembly may include a cover member mounted to an outer face of the mounting plate, the cover member defining an aperture through which at least an area of the mounting plate over which the cooling channels and the vanes extend is exposed, the electromagnetic induction unit being received in the aperture so that a face of the unit abuts the vanes. Where the mounting plate assembly has a cowling, the cowling may be an integral part of the cover member.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The mounting plate assembly may include a further plate extending at an angle from one end of the mounting plate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The apparatus may comprise a frame mounted to the vessel about the aperture, the mounting plate being removably mounted to the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The apparatus may include at least one refractory tile positioned inboard of the mounting plate, the at least one tile engaging with the refractory lining and extending across the aperture in the refractory lining. The, or each, refractory tile may be thinner than the refractory lining surrounding the aperture. Insulation material may also be provided between the at least one refractory tile and the mounting plate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The apparatus may include a framework for mounting the induction unit to the vessel for pivotal movement between an operative position, in which a face of the induction unit is located adjacent the mounting plate, and an inoperative position, in which the induction unit is spaced from the mounting plate.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Where the mounting plate has plurality of spaced vanes, a face of the electromagnetic induction unit may abut the vanes when the electromagnetic induction unit is mounted in an operative position.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the vessel is a furnace. In an alternative embodiment, the vessel is a furnace port, the port comprising an inclined wall to which the induction unit is mounted. The port may be removably mountable to a wall of a furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a mounting plate for mounting an electromagnetic induction unit to the wall of a vessel for containing molten material, the mounting plate being made of non-magnetic material and comprising an inner surface region and an outer surface region having a plurality of spaced vanes to define cooling channels extending over at least an area of the mounting plate, in which at least some of vanes follow a non-linear path across all or part of said area. At least some of the vanes may follow a curved or zigzag path across said area.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The inner surface region and the vanes may be integrally formed from a single piece of material.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The mounting plate may be made of austenitic steel.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The mounting plate may form part of a mounting plate assembly comprising a cover mounted to an outer surface of the plate, the cover defining a central aperture through which at least a part of some of the vanes is exposed and a plenum assembly for directing a flow of fluid through the cooling channels.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The general configuration and operation of the stirring/flow inducement apparatus <b>12</b> is similar to that described in the applicant's International patent application published as WO 03/106668, to which the reader should refer for a detailed description of its construction and operation. The content of WO 03/106668 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, including in particular but not exclusively, details of the construction and operation of the stirring apparatus and the flow of molten material which can be induced using the apparatus <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In cross-section, the port <b>18</b> is shaped generally as a right-angled triangle, with the inclined wall <b>16</b> being angled at approximately 55&#xb0; to the vertical end wall <b>20</b> of the furnace. However, the port need not be constructed as a right angled triangle and the angle of the inclined wall can be varied to suit the particular application and could, for example, be anywhere in the range of 30&#xb0; to 66&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The port <b>18</b> is mounted about an aperture <b>22</b> in the vertical end wall <b>20</b> of the furnace. The upper end of the port <b>18</b> in the embodiment shown is extended to define a channel portion <b>24</b> in which is formed a channel <b>25</b>. In use, the channel <b>25</b> is in fluid connection with the interior of the furnace by means of a flow passage through the port and the aperture <b>22</b>. The channel <b>25</b> can be extended outwardly by connecting additional channel members to form an extraction chute. In some embodiments, not shown, the port <b>18</b> does not have a channel portion <b>24</b>, in which case it may be similar to the arrangement described in relation to FIGS. 1 to 3 in WO 03/106668.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the arrangements described in WO 03/106668, the port <b>18</b> is permanently attached to the vertical end wall <b>20</b> of the furnace using refractory techniques. However, in the present embodiment the port <b>18</b> is removably attached to the furnace. This is advantageous as it enables the port <b>18</b>, including the mounting arrangement for the induction unit <b>14</b>, to be assembled at a remote location from the furnace and the complete port assembly then attached to a furnace in-situ. The provision of a removable port also makes it possible to have one or more spare ports <b>18</b> ready assembled to enable a damaged port to be replaced very quickly should the need arise. This significantly reduces the downtime for the furnace when compared with the prior known arrangements in which a damaged port would have to be dismantled, repaired and reassembled in-situ.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The port <b>18</b> has a frame <b>26</b> comprising opposing side members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>each of which is generally triangular in shape. Extensions <b>26</b><i>c </i>project outwardly from the upper, outer (in use) corner of the side members to define the channel portion <b>24</b>. Side wall panels <b>28</b> (only one of which is shown) are attached to the inner surfaces of the side members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>to form the side walls of the port and a rectangular back plate <b>30</b> is mounted to the rear end faces of the side members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>for location on the vertical end wall <b>20</b> of the furnace about the aperture <b>22</b>. The back plate <b>30</b> has an aperture that aligns with the aperture <b>22</b> in the vertical wall <b>20</b> of the furnace. The back plate <b>30</b> and the frame side members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>can be mounted to the end wall <b>20</b> of the furnace by any suitable method. For example, they may be mounted by means of studs (not shown) on the furnace wall <b>20</b> or other fasteners which are received in corresponding holes <b>31</b> in back plate <b>30</b> and the inner vertical lengths <b>26</b><i>d </i>of the side members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>. A suitable seal may be provided between the back plate <b>30</b> and the wall <b>20</b> of the furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The side members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>, the side wall panels <b>28</b> and the back plate <b>30</b> can be made of any suitable material such as steel, which may be austenitic steel. The interior of the port <b>18</b> is lined with refractory materials <b>34</b> to define the channel <b>25</b> and the passageway fluidly connecting the channel <b>25</b> with the interior of the furnace. The refractory materials also define an opening or aperture <b>35</b> adjacent the angled wall <b>16</b> of the port. The refractory lining <b>34</b> includes a base section <b>34</b><i>a </i>which locates at the lower end of the port and a channel section <b>34</b><i>b </i>which locates at the upper end of the port and which lines the channel portion <b>24</b>. The refractory lining <b>34</b> also includes two sidewall sections <b>34</b><i>c </i>that locate on the base section <b>34</b><i>a </i>and line the sidewalls of the port. A pair of plates <b>45</b> are secured to the upper surfaces of the side frame members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>to hold the sidewall sections <b>34</b><i>c </i>and the channel section <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the refectory material in position.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As can be seen best from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an arrangement for mounting the electromagnetic induction unit <b>14</b> to the port <b>18</b> includes a frame member <b>36</b> which is mounted to the inclined outer faces of the side members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>and to the lower faces of the extensions <b>26</b><i>c </i>so as to surround the opening <b>35</b> in the refractory materials lining the port. The frame member <b>36</b> can be made of any suitable material such as steel and may be secured to the side members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the port frame by any suitable means, such as by welding or by means of suitable fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The frame member <b>36</b> is generally rectangular in shape but with an upper section <b>36</b><i>a </i>which is angled relative to a main section <b>36</b><i>b </i>of the frame to fit under the channel portion <b>24</b>. In embodiments where the port <b>18</b> has no channel portion <b>24</b>, the frame member <b>36</b> may be a simple rectangular frame.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The frame member <b>36</b> defines an opening or window <b>37</b> surrounding the aperture <b>35</b> in the refractory lining <b>34</b> of the port <b>18</b> through which various components of the induction unit mounting arrangement can be inserted. These include one or more refractory tiles <b>42</b>, an insulation layer <b>44</b> and a molten material leakage sensor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The refractory tiles <b>42</b> locate in a recess <b>43</b> defined in the refractory lining <b>34</b> of the port surrounding the opening <b>35</b> so as to extend across and close the aperture <b>35</b>. The three tiles are positioned with a lower tile locating in recess portion <b>43</b><i>a </i>in the base section <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the refractory material, an upper tile engaging with a lower edge <b>48</b> of the upper channel section <b>34</b><i>b </i>and the third tile located between the other two. Whilst three tiles <b>42</b> are used in the present embodiment this is not essential and one, two, or more than three tiles can be used as desired in order to cover the aperture in the refractory lining of the port.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The refractory tiles <b>42</b> are thinner than the refractory lining <b>34</b> surrounding the aperture and may be formed of an abrasion resistant composite ceramic material, though other durable refractory materials can be used. The base section <b>34</b><i>a </i>and the channel section <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the refractory lining may also be made of an abrasion resistant composite ceramic material, though again any suitable refractory materials can be used. The base of the channel section <b>34</b><i>b </i>may be of the same thickness as the tiles. The refractory tiles <b>42</b> can be considered to define a region of reduced thickness in the refractory lining. The base of the channel section <b>34</b><i>b </i>can also be considered to be part of the region of reduced thickness in the refractory lining.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Typically, the refractory tiles <b>42</b> will be inserted into the recess <b>43</b> surrounding the aperture <b>35</b> in the refractory lining through the window <b>37</b> after the frame <b>36</b> has been secured to the port. However, the tiles <b>42</b> could be positioned within the aperture before the frame <b>36</b> is mounted in position if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A layer of insulation <b>44</b> is inserted into the opening <b>37</b> in the frame <b>36</b> to abut the outer surfaces of the tiles <b>42</b> and the horizontal lower surface of the channel section <b>34</b><i>b </i>of refectory material. The layer of insulation includes a main insulation plate member <b>44</b><i>a </i>which is positioned adjacent the tiles <b>42</b>. The main insulation plate member can be made of any suitable material but in the present embodiment comprises a ceramic carrier <b>44</b><i>b </i>in which various insulation materials <b>44</b><i>c </i>are held. The insulation materials extend over a width which is at least the same as the opening <b>35</b> in the refectory lining <b>34</b> of the port. Any suitable insulation materials can be used and are selected based on their thermal and mechanical properties measured against the calculated requirements in any particular application. In the present embodiment, the insulation material contains 80% or more of alumina.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The use of a ceramic carrier <b>44</b><i>b </i>for the insulation materials provides stability and accurate insulation compressions. However, the use of a ceramic carrier is not essential and the insulation layer could be provided by means of any suitable insulation materials such as a combination of ceramic board and insulation blanket.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A further insulation plate <b>44</b><i>d </i>is positioned within the angled portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>of the frame <b>36</b> adjacent the horizontal lower surface of the channel section <b>34</b><i>b </i>of refectory material. The further insulation plate <b>44</b><i>d </i>can be made of any suitable material including any of those discussed above in relation to the main insulation plate <b>44</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The molten material leakage sensor <b>46</b> is positioned inside the frame <b>36</b> adjacent the outer surface of the insulation plate member <b>44</b><i>a</i>. The sensor can be of any suitable form and in the present embodiment comprises a sensor net having a mesh of wires embedded in a substrate. The sensor is used as part of a sensor circuit to detect a leakage of molten materials, in particular molten metal such as aluminium, in a known manner. Other forms of sensor can be used or the sensor could be omitted in certain applications.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The window or aperture <b>37</b> in the frame member <b>36</b> is closed by a mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> which is secured to the outer surface of the frame member <b>36</b>. The mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> can be secured in position using any suitable means, such as releasable fasteners including studs or bolts. The mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> is fastened tightly to the frame member <b>36</b> so as to compresses the refractory tiles <b>42</b>, the insulating layer <b>44</b> and the sensor <b>46</b> between itself and the refractory materials <b>34</b> lining the interior of the port. The frame member <b>36</b> acts as a spacer to determine the amount of compression the tiles <b>42</b>, the insulating layer <b>44</b> and sensor <b>46</b> are placed under and the thickness of the frame is accordingly selected to provide the desired amount of compression dependent on the materials and dimensions of the tiles <b>42</b>, insulation layer <b>44</b> and sensor <b>46</b> (where provided).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the electromagnetic induction unit <b>14</b> is mounted to the port <b>18</b> by means of a framework indicated generally at <b>50</b>. The framework <b>50</b> is arranged to mount the induction unit <b>14</b> to the port so that it can be pivoted between an operative position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and an inoperative position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the operative position, an inner face <b>52</b> of the induction unit <b>14</b> is held in abutment with the mounting plate assembly <b>40</b>. In the inoperative position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the induction unit <b>14</b> is spaced from the mounting plate assembly <b>40</b>. This arrangement is advantageous as the induction unit <b>14</b> is heavy and the pivotable framework enables the induction unit <b>14</b> to be safely mounted to the port <b>18</b> and moved to the operative position in a controlled manner. In addition, the induction unit <b>14</b> can be moved to the inoperative position for inspection or to enable work to be carried out on it without having to completely remove the unit <b>14</b> from the port.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The framework <b>50</b> includes lower supporting brackets <b>54</b> on either side of port <b>18</b>, each mounted to a respective one of the side frame members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>. A generally U shaped frame <b>56</b> is pivotably mounted to the lower brackets <b>54</b> at one end and is configured to surround the induction unit <b>14</b> on three sides. Mounting lugs (not shown) on the induction unit have holes that align with holes in a flange <b>58</b> on the frame <b>56</b> to receive fasteners <b>60</b> for securing the induction unit <b>14</b> to the frame. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the induction unit can be inserted into the frame <b>56</b> in direction of arrow B and secured in position.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Upper support brackets <b>62</b> are also mounted to the frame members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>on either side of the port <b>18</b>. The upper support brackets are positioned so as to align with corresponding brackets <b>64</b> on the upper end of the frame <b>56</b> when the induction unit <b>14</b> is pivoted to the operative position as indicated by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The upper support brackets <b>62</b> and the corresponding brackets <b>64</b> are secured together using suitable fasteners to hold the induction unit <b>14</b> in the operative position.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Co-operating abutments (not shown) are provided on the lower support brackets and the frame <b>56</b> to hold the frame generally horizontally when it is in the inoperative position, in order that the induction unit <b>14</b> can be easily and safely mounted in or removed from the frame <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The upper and lower support brackets <b>54</b>, <b>62</b> are attached directly to the framework <b>26</b> of the port structure. This transfers the stress caused by mounting the inductor unit through the framework to the furnace and so isolates the ceramic components in the mounting arrangement, such as the tiles <b>42</b>, the insulating plate member <b>44</b><i>a </i>and the sensor <b>46</b>, from the inductor unit <b>14</b> mounting stresses.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> physically closes-off the port window <b>37</b> and the aperture <b>35</b> in the refractory lining and provides structural rigidity whilst offering a minimum of opposition to the magnetic field generated by the induction unit <b>14</b>. The mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> has an upper section <b>40</b><i>a </i>that is angled relative to a main section <b>40</b><i>b </i>for location under the channel portion <b>24</b> of the port. The main section <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the mounting plate assembly locates on the main section <b>36</b><i>b </i>of the frame member and forms, in effect, the outer surface of the inclined wall <b>16</b> of the port and provides an exterior closure for the aperture <b>35</b> in the refractory lining <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The construction of the mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> can be seen more clearly from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> in the present embodiment has three main component parts, a main mounting plate <b>66</b>, a cover member <b>68</b> and a further plate <b>70</b>. The mounting plate <b>66</b> and the cover member <b>68</b> together form the main section <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the mounting plate assembly <b>40</b>, whilst the further plate <b>70</b> forms the upper section <b>40</b><i>a</i>. All the component parts of the mounting plate assembly are made from non-magnetic materials. In the present embodiment, the parts are all made from austenitic steel and are welded together.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The main mounting plate <b>66</b> is produced from a single, rectangular plate of austenitic steel, or other non-magnetic material. An outer surface region of the plate <b>66</b> is machined to produce vanes <b>72</b> which define air-cooling channels <b>74</b>. An inlet recess <b>76</b> is also machined into the outer surface region of the mounting plate at one end of the channels <b>74</b>. The recess fluidly interconnects all of the channels <b>74</b> so that cooling air directed into the recess can flow along each of the cooling channels.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the present embodiment, the inlet recess <b>76</b> is formed at an end of the channels that is uppermost in use so that the air flows downwardly through the channels. However, the direction of airflow through the channels <b>74</b> could be reversed so that it flows from the bottom to the top. Indeed, the channels <b>74</b> need not extend in a generally vertical direction but could be aligned generally horizontally so that the air flows from side to side across the inductor unit <b>14</b> or in any other direction.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The mounting plate <b>66</b> can be of any suitable thickness depending on the application and the depth of the magnetic field generated by the inductor <b>14</b>. In the present embodiment, the mounting plate has an overall thickness of 20 mm with the cooling channels <b>74</b> and the inlet recess <b>76</b> having a maximum depth of about 15 mm. Thus the mounting plate <b>66</b> has an inner surface region with a minimum thickness of 5 mm at the base of the channels so that the plate forms a closure when mounted to the frame <b>36</b>. However, the thickness of the mounting plate <b>66</b> can be varied as required and could be anywhere from 10 to 30 mm and the maximum depth of the cooling channels <b>74</b> (or height of the vanes <b>72</b>) can be anywhere from 5 to 25 mm dependent on the thickness of the plate. The thickness of the plate <b>66</b> and the depth of the cooling channels <b>74</b> is selected to ensure that the mounting plate <b>66</b> has an unbroken or continuous inner surface region which completely covers the aperture or window <b>37</b> in the frame member <b>36</b> providing a physical barrier between the induction unit <b>14</b> and the refractory materials.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The cover member <b>68</b> is in the form of a rectangular frame that locates on a border region of the mounting plate <b>66</b>. An array of mounting holes <b>78</b> are provided along two sides and a bottom edge of the mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> through both the mounting plate <b>66</b> and the cover member <b>68</b> by means of which the mounting plate assembly can be secured to the frame. The mounting holes <b>78</b> are located in a border region of the assembly <b>40</b> and lie outside the aperture <b>37</b> in the frame <b>36</b> so that the inner surface region of the mounting plate <b>66</b> where it extends across the aperture <b>37</b> remains unbroken to act as a barrier to prevent any molten fluid which may leak past the tiles <b>42</b>, the insulation materials <b>44</b> and the sensor <b>46</b> from contacting the inductor unit.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A plenum <b>80</b> is formed integrally as part of an upper, horizontal member of the cover and is arranged to overlie the inlet recess <b>76</b> in the mounting plate <b>66</b>. The plenum is in the form of a triangular housing having an upper surface <b>82</b> in which two openings <b>84</b> are formed. Means are provided to mount two cooling fans <b>86</b> to the upper surface so that air from the fans is directed into the plenum which guides the air into the inlet recess <b>76</b> and through the cooling channels <b>74</b>. In the present embodiment, two cooling fans <b>86</b> are provided which are sized so that each fan is capable of generating a sufficient flow of cooling air for the system to operate safely should one fan fail. In this regard, it should be noted that air from either fan <b>86</b> is able to flow into all the cooling channels. It will be appreciated that number of cooling fans <b>86</b> can be varied in accordance with system requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is not essential that the cooling fans <b>86</b> are located on the mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> itself. In some applications it may be desirable to provide a remote source of airflow and to direct the airflow into the cooling channels by means of ducting. This may connect with the plenum <b>80</b> whose design can be suitably modified. Indeed, in some applications where forced convection is not required, the cooling fans can be omitted altogether so that natural convection is relied upon to set up a flow of air through the cooling channels. The apparatus can also be modified to use fluids other than air for cooling. This could include other gases or liquids.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the present embodiment, the rectangular frame portion of the cover assembly <b>68</b> has a thickness of about 5 mm so that the main section <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> has an overall thickness of about 25 mm where the cover overlies the mounting plate <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A lower horizontal member <b>88</b> of the cover <b>68</b> overlies a lower end of the mounting plate <b>66</b> and end regions <b>74</b><i>a </i>of the cooling channels <b>74</b> opposite from the inlet recess <b>76</b>. Openings <b>90</b> in the lower member <b>88</b> align with the end regions <b>74</b><i>a </i>of the channels <b>74</b> to form an outlet for the airflow. A strengthening flange <b>92</b> projects outwardly along the lower section <b>88</b> of the cover member just above the outlet openings <b>90</b>. The flange <b>92</b> may also serve to deflect the air flowing through the openings <b>90</b> away from the induction unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The further plate <b>70</b> is a planar plate which is welded to an upper end of the mounting plate <b>66</b> at an angle so as to project under the channel portion <b>24</b> of the port <b>18</b> in use. The further plate <b>70</b> is mounted to the angled portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>of the frame to close the lower surface of the channel portion <b>24</b>, supporting the channel section <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the refractory material and the further insulation plate <b>44</b><i>d</i>. The further plate <b>70</b> also extends over the fans <b>86</b> and protects them. The further plate <b>70</b> can be omitted where the port <b>18</b> is not provided with a channel portion <b>24</b> or where the base of the channel portion <b>24</b> is closed off by some other means, such as a separate plate.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The rectangular frame of the cover member <b>68</b>, defines a central rectangular aperture <b>94</b> though which part of the cooling channels <b>74</b> and the vanes <b>72</b> in the mounting plate <b>66</b> are exposed. When the induction unit <b>14</b> is brought into the operative position, an inner end of the induction unit <b>14</b> locates within the aperture <b>94</b> so that the inner face <b>52</b> of the induction unit is brought into contact with the outer end faces of the vanes <b>72</b>. In this position, the cooling channels <b>74</b> provide an air gap between the face <b>52</b> of the induction unit and the solid (i.e. continuous) inner surface region of the mounting plate <b>66</b> through which cooling air flows when the fans <b>86</b> are operative. This provides forced cooling to reduce the surface temperature of the inductor and the temperature of the mounting plate <b>66</b>. A flange about the periphery of the induction unit <b>14</b> forms a seal with the cover member to prevent the air escaping.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">An important aspect of the development of the mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> is the need for it to offer minimal opposition to the magnetic field generated by the induction unit <b>14</b>. In the operative position, the induction unit <b>14</b> is in contact with the vanes <b>72</b> so that the magnetic field only passes through the mounting plate <b>66</b> and not the cover member <b>68</b>. By machining the mounting plate <b>66</b> from a single piece of austenitic steel, complete electromagnetic continuity between the vanes <b>72</b> and the inner surface region is ensured. As a result, the mounting plate <b>66</b> is relatively unaffected by the magnetic field generated by the induction device <b>14</b>. This arrangement is highly efficient as no, or only a very limited, magnetic field is induced in the mounting plate <b>66</b> so that there is very little energy loss in the magnetic field generated by the induction device <b>14</b> as it passes through the mounting plate. It is also advantageous that very little heat is generated in the mounting plate <b>66</b> by the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Those vanes <b>72</b><i>b</i>, which occupy a region of the mounting plate <b>66</b> through which the magnetic field generated by the induction device passes, follow a non-linear path. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there are nine vanes <b>72</b> which define ten channels <b>74</b>. The two outermost vanes <b>72</b><i>a </i>are linear. These provide a suitable surface for mounting the inductor face <b>52</b> and are positioned outside of the magnetic field generated by the device <b>14</b>. The two outermost vanes <b>72</b><i>a </i>lie half under the cover <b>68</b> and half exposed inside the aperture <b>94</b>. With this arrangement, the outer side edges of the induction unit are supported on the exposed half of the vanes <b>72</b><i>a </i>and the cover <b>68</b> is supported on the other half.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The inner seven vanes <b>72</b><i>b </i>follow a zigzag path over the majority of their length and the apparatus is arranged so that the magnetic field passes though the mounting plate <b>66</b> only in the region where the inner vanes are non-linear. Lower end regions <b>72</b><i>c </i>of the inner vanes <b>72</b><i>b</i>, which are positioned outside of the magnetic field, are linear. Rather than following a zigzag path, the central vanes <b>72</b><i>b </i>could follow alternative non-linear paths which may be a curved. The vanes <b>72</b><i>b </i>could follow a sinusoidal or other wave like path, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The non-linear form of the vanes <b>72</b><i>b </i>increases the torsional resistance of the mounting plate <b>66</b> and is believed to improve transparency to the electromagnetic field when compared with a plate having straight or linear vanes.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the present embodiment, the mounting plate <b>66</b> through which the magnetic field is propagated is produced as a singe integral component to ensure complete electrical continuity. Machining the mounting plate <b>66</b> from a single piece of material is also a particularly convenient method of manufacture. However, the mounting plate <b>66</b> could be produced by welding separate vanes to a planar plate, provided the welding is of a sufficiently good quality to provide adequate electrically continuity. In an alternative arrangement, a further component or components can be positioned between a planar plate and the induction unit <b>14</b> to form the cooling channels. In this arrangement, the plate may be constructed of a non-magnetic metal material, such as austenitic steel, whilst the further component or components may be made of a non-conducting material such as a ceramic, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The present mounting arrangement for the induction unit <b>14</b> offers a number of advantages over the prior known mounting arrangements. With the mounting plate assembly <b>40</b> in position, the arrangement provides a strong physical barrier between the face <b>52</b> of the inductor unit <b>14</b> and interior of the port <b>18</b> and enables the furnace to be run with or without the inductor <b>14</b> in place. This in turn means that the inductor unit <b>14</b> can be removed and/or replaced without having to shut the furnace down, thus minimising the inductor change out time. If the furnace is to be run with the inductor unit removed, a cover plate (not shown) can be positioned over the mounting plate <b>66</b> to close the outer faces of the cooling channels <b>74</b> to enable the cooling system to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The ability to pivot the inductor <b>14</b> between an operative and inoperative position using the swing frame <b>56</b> provides for safe handling of the inductor unit <b>14</b> and enables maintenance work to be carried out on the inductor in-situ. Alternatively the inductor unit <b>14</b> can be replaced to enable maintenance/repairs to be carried out at a remote location with minimum downtime of the furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the event the port <b>18</b> itself requires attention, the entire port can be removed from the furnace and placed in a jig in which it can be rotated from its in use position to assist in assembly/disassembly of the various components. As discussed previously, spare ports <b>18</b> ready assembled can be provided so that a port <b>18</b> can be quickly replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The mounting arrangement described is particularly suitable for use in mounting an induction unit <b>14</b> to a vessel for containing molten aluminium (including aluminium alloys) as it is resistant to penetration by molten aluminium. The cooling system, in conjunction with the ceramic tiles and insulation materials, is arranged to position the aluminium freeze plane inboard of the inductor face <b>52</b>. This prevents molten aluminium coming into contact with the induction unit <b>14</b> in the event of a leak through the aperture in the refractory materials.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">It will be appreciated, however, that the mounting arrangement can be adapted for use with vessels containing molten materials other than aluminium by appropriate selection of materials and dimension for the various components. Indeed, it will be appreciated that the various components located inboard of the mounting plate <b>66</b> can be changed as required by the particular application. For example, the leakage sensor <b>46</b> could be omitted and the nature of the insulation materials varied to meet application requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Furthermore, whilst the mounting arrangement is particularly suitable for mounting an induction unit to a port <b>18</b> on a furnace, the arrangements disclosed can be adapted to mount an induction unit to any vessel which is used to contain molten materials and could, for example, be used to mount the induction unit directly to a wall or the base of a furnace or indeed any other vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Whereas the invention has been described in relation to what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed arrangements but rather is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent constructions included within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Where the terms &#x201c;comprise&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprised&#x201d; or &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; are used in this specification, they are to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components referred to, but not to preclude the presence or addition of one or more other feature, integer, step, component or group thereof.</p>
