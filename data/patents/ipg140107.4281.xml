<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119, of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0133498, filed Dec. 23, 2010, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Example embodiments relate to nonvolatile semiconductor memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Semiconductor memories are usually considered to be the most vital microelectronic component of digital logic system design, such as computers and microprocessor-based applications ranging from satellites to consumer electronics. Therefore, advances in the fabrication of semiconductor memories including process enhancements and technology developments through the scaling for higher densities and faster speeds help establish performance standards for other digital logic families.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Semiconductor memory devices may be characterized as volatile random access memories (RAMs), or nonvolatile memory devices. In RAMs, the logic information is stored either by setting up the logic state of a bistable flip-flop such as in a static random access memory (SRAM), or through the charging of a capacitor as in a dynamic random access memory (DRAM). In either case, the data is stored and can be read out as long as the power is applied, and are lost when the power is turned off; hence, they are called volatile memories.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Nonvolatile memories, such as Mask Read-Only Memory (MROM), Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM), Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM), and Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), are capable of storing the data, even with the power turned off. The nonvolatile memory data storage mode may be permanent or reprogrammable, depending upon the fabrication technology used. Nonvolatile memories are used for program and microcode storage in a wide variety of applications in the computer, avionics, telecommunications, and consumer electronics industries. A combination of single-chip volatile as well as nonvolatile memory storage modes is also available in devices such as nonvolatile SRAM (nvSRAM) for use in systems that require fast, programmable nonvolatile memory. In addition, dozens of special memory architectures have evolved which contain some additional logic circuitry to optimize their performance for application-specific tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In nonvolatile memories, however, MROM, PROM, and EPROM are not free to be erased and written to by a system itself, so that it is not easy for general users to update stored contents. On the other hand, EEPROM is capable of being electrically erased or written. Application of an EEPROM is widened to an auxiliary memory or to system programming where continuous updates are needed (flash EEPROM).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to example embodiments of the inventive concepts a nonvolatile memory devices includes a memory cell array having a plurality of memory blocks and a plurality of bit lines arranged at the memory cell array. Each of the plurality of memory blocks has a plurality of strings arranged in rows and columns and formed to be vertical to a substrate. Strings of each row of each memory block are connected with the bit lines, respectively, and strings of each column of each memory block are connected in common with a corresponding one of the bit lines. One memory block of the plurality of memory blocks includes a first region for storing ROM data and a second region for storing replica ROM data for repairing the ROM data.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to at least one example embodiment, the first region is formed of strings of one of rows in the one memory block and the second region is formed of strings of one of the remaining rows in the one memory block.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should be noted that these figures are intended to illustrate the general characteristics of methods, structure and/or materials utilized in certain example embodiments and to supplement the written description provided below. These drawings are not, however, to scale and may not precisely reflect the precise structural or performance characteristics of any given embodiment, and should not be interpreted as defining or limiting the range of values or properties encompassed by example embodiments. For example, the relative thicknesses and positioning of molecules, layers, regions and/or structural elements may be reduced or exaggerated for clarity. The use of similar or identical reference numbers in the various drawings is intended to indicate the presence of a similar or identical element or feature.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Example embodiments will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which example embodiments are shown. Example embodiments may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the concept of example embodiments to those of ordinary skill in the art. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements, and thus their description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d;, &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present. Like numbers indicate like elements throughout. As used herein the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements or layers should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; &#x201c;on&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly on&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; or &#x201c;under&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary terms &#x201c;below&#x201d; and &#x201c;under&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including&#x201d; if used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Example embodiments are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of example embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle may have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this inventive concept belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly-used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and/or the present specification and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating nonvolatile memory devices according to example embodiments of the inventive concepts. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a nonvolatile memory device <b>1000</b> according to example embodiments may include a memory cell array <b>110</b> which may store data. The memory cell array <b>110</b> may be at least one of a planar structure and a vertical structure. The memory cell array <b>110</b> may include a region <b>111</b> for storing ROM data. The region <b>111</b> may be called a trim data region, an OTP region, an E-fuse region, an information region, and/or the like. Hereinafter, the region <b>111</b> may be referred to as a ROM data region. The ROM data region <b>111</b> may be a one-time programmable region, and ROM data stored in the ROM data region <b>111</b> may be read when needed. The term &#x2018;ROM data&#x2019; may be read-only data. ROM data (or, reliability data) stored in the ROM data region <b>111</b> may include, for example, operating option information, voltage trimming information, repair information and/or the like. However, ROM data stored in the ROM data region <b>111</b> is not limited according to example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The nonvolatile memory device <b>1000</b> according to at least one example embodiment may include a row selector circuit <b>120</b>, a voltage generator circuit <b>130</b>, a page buffer circuit <b>140</b>, an input/output circuit <b>150</b>, and control logic <b>160</b>. The row selector circuit <b>120</b> may select and drive rows of the memory cell array <b>110</b> in response to the control of the control logic <b>160</b>. The voltage generator circuit <b>130</b> may generate voltages (e.g., a word line voltage, a bulk voltage, and/or the like) necessary for operations (e.g., erasing, reading, programming, and/or the like) in response to the control of the control logic <b>160</b>. A voltage that may be generated by the voltage generator circuit <b>130</b> may be supplied to the memory cell array <b>110</b> via the row selector circuit <b>120</b> or directly.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The page buffer circuit <b>140</b> may operate in response to the control of the control logic <b>160</b>, and may be configured to read data from the memory cell array <b>110</b> at a read operation and to program data in the memory cell array <b>110</b> at a program operation. The input/output circuit <b>150</b> may provide an interface with the interior of the nonvolatile memory device <b>1000</b> and/or with an external device (e.g., a memory controller). Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the input/output circuit <b>150</b> may include a column selector circuit, an input buffer circuit, an output buffer circuit, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The control logic <b>160</b> may control an overall operation of the nonvolatile memory device <b>1000</b>. The control logic <b>160</b> may include a register <b>161</b> which may be configured to a part or all of ROM data read from the ROM data region <b>111</b> via the page buffer circuit <b>140</b>. Loading of ROM data onto the register <b>161</b> may be made at power-up. The control logic <b>160</b> may control an overall operation of the nonvolatile memory device <b>1000</b> according to an operating option that may be defined by the ROM data that may be stored in the register <b>161</b>. In the event that repair information may be stored in the register <b>161</b>, the control logic <b>160</b> may control the input/output circuit <b>150</b> such that replaced data may be transferred instead of defective data. If voltage trimming information is stored in the register <b>161</b>, the control logic <b>160</b> may control the voltage generator circuit <b>130</b> based upon the voltage trimming information.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a block diagram and a circuit schematic illustrating memory cell arrays according to example embodiments of the inventive concepts. A memory cell array according to at last one example embodiment may be a planar structure. With the planar structure, strings may be formed in parallel with a substrate. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the memory cell array <b>110</b> may include a ROM data region <b>111</b>. The ROM data region <b>111</b> may include one or more ROM blocks <b>111</b><i>a </i>for storing ROM data and one or more replica blocks <b>111</b><i>b </i>for storing the same data as the ROM data stored in the ROM block <b>111</b><i>a</i>. It may be understood that two or more ROM blocks may be used according to the amount of ROM data. The number of replica blocks may be determined according to the number of ROM blocks. More replica blocks may be used to prepare for frequent read fail. The replica block <b>111</b><i>b </i>may be used to repair read fail when read fail on ROM data that may be stored in the ROM block <b>111</b><i>a </i>arises. For this reason, the same data as ROM data that may be stored in the ROM block <b>111</b><i>a </i>may be stored in the replica block <b>111</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ROM block <b>111</b><i>a</i>, for example, may include strings STR corresponding to a plurality of bit lines BL<b>1</b>-BLm, respectively. Each string STR may include a string selection transistor SST, a ground selection transistor GST, and memory cells MC<b>1</b>-MCn that may be connected in series between the selection transistors SST and GST. The string selection transistor SST, the ground selection transistor GST, and the memory cells MC<b>1</b> to MCn may be connected with a string selection line SSL, a ground selection line GSL, and word lines WL<b>1</b>-WLn, respectively. The ground selection transistor may be connected to a common source line CSL. Although not shown in figures, the replica block <b>111</b><i>b </i>may be configured the same as the ROM block <b>111</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Two word lines (e.g., WLi-<b>1</b> and WLi) of the word lines WL<b>1</b>-WLn of the ROM block <b>111</b><i>a </i>may be used to store ROM data. Memory cells connected with the word lines WLi-<b>1</b> and WLi may be programmed according to ROM data. Memory cells that may be connected with the remaining word lines may keep an erase state. Memory cells (e.g., MCi-<b>1</b> and MCi) in each column and that may be connected with the word lines WLi-<b>1</b> and WLi may be programmed to have the same data bit (e.g., data &#x2018;1&#x2019; or data &#x2018;0&#x2019;). This may prepare for data fail due to charge loss.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating a bias condition for reading ROM data stored in a ROM block of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. ROM data that may be stored in a ROM block <b>111</b><i>a</i>, for example, may be read by a page buffer circuit <b>140</b> under the control of control logic <b>160</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ROM data may be read by applying, for example, a voltage of OV to word lines WLi-<b>1</b> and WLi and a read voltage Vread to the remaining word lines WL<b>1</b> to WLi-<b>2</b> and WLi+<b>2</b> to WLn. V<sub>GSL </sub>may be applied to a ground selection transistor GST and V<sub>SSL </sub>may be applied to a string selection transistor SST. Although one of memory cells MCi+<b>1</b> and MCi in any column (e.g., BL<b>1</b>) and that may be connected with the word lines WLi-<b>1</b> and WLi may cause data fail due to charge loss, ROM data that may be stored in the other memory cell may be read normally. The read ROM data may be stored in a register <b>161</b> of the control logic <b>160</b> via an input/output circuit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective diagram illustrating memory cell arrays according to other example embodiments of the inventive concepts. A memory cell array according to at least one example embodiment may be a vertical structure. The vertical structure may be a structure in which a string of memory cells is arranged vertically with respect to a substrate. For example, memory cells of a memory string may be stacked vertically. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a memory cell array <b>110</b> may include a plurality of memory blocks BLK<b>1</b>-BLKz, each of which may be a three-dimensional structure (a vertical structure). For example, each of the memory blocks BLK<b>1</b>-BLKz may include structures extending along the first to third directions. For example, each of the memory blocks BLK<b>1</b>-BLKz may include a plurality of strings (e.g., NAND strings) extending along the second direction. As another example, a plurality of NAND strings may be provided along the first or third direction. According to at least one example embodiment, the memory blocks BLK<b>1</b>-BLKz may be selected by a row selector circuit <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to at least one example embodiment, at least one (hereinafter, referred to as a ROM and replica block) of memory blocks BLK<b>1</b>-BLKz may be used to store ROM data. The ROM and replica block may include a region for storing ROM data, one or more regions for repairing read fail of the ROM data, and the like. Herein, read and program operations on the regions of the ROM and replica block may be controlled independently from one another. Unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the regions of the ROM and replica block may be defined physically within one block. One ROM and replica block may be used to store ROM data and data (hereinafter, referred to as replica ROM data) for repairing read fail of the ROM data. Herein, one memory block may include memory cells which may be simultaneously erased at an erase operation. It may be possible to store ROM data and replica ROM data using one ROM and replica block. Repairing of ROM data at frequent read fail may be made within one ROM block without a need for an additional memory block (e.g., a replica block).</p>

The substrate <b>111</b> may be a pocket p-well which may be provided within an n-well. Below, it may be assumed for purposes of explanation that the substrate <b>111</b> may be a p-well (or, a pocket p-well). However, the substrate <b>111</b> may not be limited to p-type.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A plurality of doping regions <b>311</b>-<b>314</b> extending along the first direction may be provided in the substrate <b>111</b>.
