<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a motor housing <b>200</b> is slidably disposed on the first pole <b>110</b><i>a</i>. A brush motor <b>205</b> is disposed in the motor housing <b>200</b>. The motor housing <b>200</b> helps protect the brush motor <b>205</b> (or other components) from moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The device <b>100</b> of the present invention further comprises a roller brush <b>210</b>. The roller brush <b>210</b> may be generally cylindrical or irregular in shape. The brush <b>210</b> may be constructed from a variety of materials and may be tailor made for a user (e.g., soft, abrasive, etc.). The brush <b>210</b> has an axle <b>216</b> with a first end and a second end. The first end of the axle <b>216</b> of the brush <b>210</b> engages the brush motor <b>205</b> in the motor housing <b>200</b> (the motor housing <b>200</b> is slidably disposed on the first pole <b>110</b><i>a</i>). Generally, the brush <b>210</b> is positioned perpendicularly to the first pole <b>110</b><i>a</i>, although the brush <b>210</b> is not limited to this position. In some embodiments, the second end of the axle <b>216</b> of the brush <b>210</b> does not engage anything (e.g., the second pole <b>110</b><i>b</i>). In some embodiments, the second end of the axle <b>216</b> engages a sliding component slidably disposed on the second pole <b>110</b><i>b</i>. The roller brush <b>210</b> can be adjusted according to the user's height. For example, the user can manipulate the range of the roller brush's position via switches of the control panel (on the drive lever <b>240</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The brush <b>210</b> can rotate either counterclockwise or clockwise, wherein the user can choose the direction in which the brush <b>210</b> rotates. The brush <b>210</b> is operatively connected to the brush motor <b>205</b>, wherein the brush motor <b>205</b> functions to rotate the brush <b>210</b> in either the counterclockwise or clockwise direction. In some embodiments, the brush motor <b>205</b> functions to move the brush <b>210</b> in alternative directions, for example in a side-to-side direction or an irregular direction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The brush <b>210</b> can be used to massage and brush the user's back, neck, legs, shoulders, and/or the like. In some embodiments, the brush <b>210</b> helps improve blood flow. The brush <b>210</b> may provide a relaxing massage.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The brush motor <b>205</b> is operatively connected to a control panel <b>250</b>. The control panel <b>250</b> functions to control the brush motor <b>205</b>, for example the speed at which the brush motor <b>205</b> rotates the brush <b>210</b> and/or the direction (e.g., clockwise, counterclockwise) in which the brush motor <b>205</b> rotates the brush <b>210</b>. Control panels and components thereof are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, in some embodiments, the control panel <b>250</b> allows a user to select a low speed, a medium speed, and a high speed and/or allows a user to turn the brush motor <b>250</b> on and off. In some embodiments, the control panel <b>250</b> is disposed on a drive lever <b>240</b> that extends outwardly from the motor housing <b>200</b>. The drive lever <b>240</b> allows a user to manipulate the brush <b>210</b> (e.g., speed, direction) while showering with his/her back to the brush <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, a track motor is disposed in the motor housing <b>200</b>, wherein the track motor functions to move the motor housing <b>200</b> and brush <b>210</b> upwardly and downwardly with respect to the poles <b>110</b>. Motors that function to move an object up and down a cylindrical pole are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The motor housing <b>200</b> can be slid upwardly and downwardly on the first pole <b>110</b><i>a </i>(via the track motor) so that a user can find a position that suits him/her best. When the user finds an ideal position for the motor housing <b>200</b>, he/she can deactivate the track motor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The track motor is operatively connected to the control panel <b>250</b>, which functions to control the movement of the motor housing <b>200</b> and brush <b>210</b> via the track motor.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, a first sleeve bearing <b>220</b><i>a </i>(e.g., plastic sleeve bearing) is slidably disposed on the first pole <b>110</b><i>a</i>, for example above the motor housing <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, a second sleeve bearing <b>220</b><i>b </i>is slidably disposed on the second pole <b>110</b><i>b</i>.

The pump component may be operatively connected to the control panel <b>250</b>, wherein the control panel <b>250</b> can manipulate the pumping of the soap. The soap reservoir <b>410</b> may be disposed on a frame <b>460</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In some embodiments, the soap dispenser functions via capillary action or via the pump component. For example, the brush <b>210</b> may comprise a plurality of pores, which are fluidly connected to the soap reservoir <b>410</b> via the soap hose. When a portion of liquid soap of bath gel is released from the soap reservoir <b>410</b> (e.g., via a the control panel <b>250</b>), the soap/gel goes through the soap hose to the pores <b>465</b> in the brush <b>210</b> and onto the user's skin. In some embodiments, there is no water hose <b>530</b>. In some embodiments, the device comprises a water hose <b>530</b>. In some embodiments, the water hose <b>530</b> runs from the showerhead <b>500</b> through the reservoir <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the soap dispenser comprises multiple reservoirs <b>410</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For example, the soap dispenser may comprise a first reservoir <b>410</b><i>a</i>, a second reservoir <b>410</b><i>b</i>, and a third reservoir <b>410</b><i>c </i>(or more than three reservoirs). In some embodiments, the soap dispenser is operatively connected to a self-soaping device <b>418</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, a shield <b>310</b> (e.g., like a car fender with splash guard) surrounds a portion of the brush <b>210</b>, for example the shield <b>310</b> is positioned above the brush <b>210</b>. The shield <b>310</b> can help prevent the soap from splashing the walls of the shower.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The brush <b>210</b> may be constructed in a variety of styles and from a variety of materials. In some embodiments, the brush <b>210</b> is constructed from a material comprising bristles, mesh, cloth, artificial sponge or natural sponge, the like, or a combination (according to the user's preference). In some embodiments, each brush <b>210</b> is covered with a material (e.g., bristles, mesh, cloth, etc.) and further with another product (e.g., cleansing product). In some embodiments, the brush <b>210</b> is installed on a sturdy roller frame (e.g., 5-wire ring cage) welded to hold the core and stop it from slipping.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The device <b>100</b> of the present invention can be easily assembled and installed. The device <b>100</b> may be constructed in a size (or sizes) to accommodate standard showers or non-standard showers.</p>

A user can also choose the kind of brush <b>210</b> (e.g., cleansing surface) as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The height of the back scrubber can be adjusted. For example, two pinions are installed at each pole (left and right) that will travel up and down on both rack gears located behind the poles (similar to a track). The movement of these pinions is powered by the main electric motor and controlled by the control panel. The height range of the roller brush can be adjusted as well. Each pinion can be released from the rack gear through a release clutch located at the drive lever, similar to a clutch lever of a bike. Once the range of height is adjusted on the roller brush, the user can apply manually continuous upward/downward repetitive movements on different parts of his/her body. All movements will be smooth due to the function of the sleeve bearings and springs installed at both poles.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The brush may be constructed in a variety of styles and from a variety of materials (bristles, mesh, cloth, artificial sponge, or natural sponge) according to the user's preference. In some embodiments, the roller brush is a cylinder. Its surface may have a material known as double contact. Cleansing surfaces of the cylinder that the user chooses (bristles, mesh, cloth, artificial sponge, or natural sponge) may have in its posterior part the double contact material to stick to the cylinder. To put the surface of the user's preference to be more abrasive or less abrasive, the user just has to attach the chosen surface on the surface of the cylinder. The brush may be installed on a sturdy roller frame (e.g., 5-wire ring cage) welded to hold the core and stop it from slipping. The roller brush may be used for cleaning multiple different body parts, not just the user's back. For example, the user may clean his/her abdomen, chest, shoulders, etc. In some embodiments, a duplicate control panel to drive the back scrubber with the other adopted positions may be installed. In some embodiments, another handle may be installed to facilitate upwards/downwards movement. In some embodiments, the roller brush may be linked to restriction springs, which push the roller brush forward and facilitate its travel.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, mechanical extensions are used in the device of the present invention, such as those used for blocking aisles (e.g., extendable aisle gates). Such extension devices are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The extensions may have lock and releasing features to fix or release it from the frame of the back scrubber.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the device of the present invention further comprises grabbing handles <b>920</b>. The grabbing handles may be disposed on each side of the frame, making them easily accessible. The grabbing handles may be particularly useful for elderly individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the device further comprises resting steps <b>940</b> to facilitate the cleaning of thighs, knees, femoral biceps, feet, and other parts of the body. The steps may be positioned on both sides of the lower crossbar <b>120</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The device of the present invention may be adjusted vertically. The lower rubber tops of the poles have firm contact with the floor and the upper ones have contact with the ceiling <b>600</b>. To establish an exact measurement for the adjusting poles, behind the poles there may be a set of bars with holes (like a flute) or dents. In some embodiments, the adjusting of the poles may be done with pins or a duty bar clamp. Final adjusting may be through threads <b>930</b> at the bottom of both poles until lower and upper rubber tops have solid contact with the floor and ceiling, respectively. The device may also be adjusted horizontally according to the size of the tub already existing in the home.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The drive lever may have a rotator knob to move the roller brush upwardly and downwardly continuously without uncomfortable gestures. For example, to push the roller brush down the user may just push down the drive lever very lightly.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the device of the present invention has a reservoir for liquid soap and/or bath gel. The reservoir may function to hold multiple types of soaps and/or gels, for example the reservoir may have multiple compartments. The reservoir set may be installed above the anti-splash shield. The releasing of the soap or gel may be controlled with the control panel of the drive lever. A user can select a choice and a solenoid mechanism may move a bar with a hole below the bottom of each reservoir (e.g., a fixed amount of soap or gel). The present invention is not limited to a solenoid mechanism. The soap or gel may be dispensed to the surface of the roller brush.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The water hose may be optional. Instead, a user may wish to be seated and take a bath using the portable showerheads. In some embodiments, this type of portable showerhead may be included with the device of the present invention. A support may be disposed near the gel reservoir to grab the portable showerhead.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The device of the present invention allows movement of the roller brush in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction, as the user wishes.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the motor is operatively connected to a rechargeable battery (e.g., rechargeable heavy duty battery pack). The power may be used for purposes including but not limited to the motors rotation of the roller brush, the motor's movement of the roller brush upwardly and downwardly (with its splash guard, bath gel reservoir, pump, hose, solenoid mechanism, etc.), pumping bath gel from reservoir to surface of roller brush, and/or control panel functions.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an alternative embodiment, the device may comprise many of the aforementioned components. However, in some embodiments, a spring <b>910</b> is located in a horizontal position installed in between both poles. The torque of this spring <b>910</b> allows the smooth movement outwardly and downward of the roller brush, even the repetitive action of the user to clean his/her body. The spring <b>910</b> may also help make the brush stay up initially. With a rectangular handle <b>920</b> installed, a user can apply either a forward or backward movement to the set conformed by the roller brush, motor, and splashing shield. The handle <b>920</b> may have a releasing lever to release a latch governed by a spring. Releasing that latch may allow a free forward/backward movement of the set (roller brush, motor, and splashing shield) or adjusting it in any desired position. To make it possible to adjust the set in any desired position, the latch may bite dents of the racks that will be inside of the horizontal sliding tracks. Also, the adjusting may be via a system called locks by segments. As the travel of this roller brush may not be uniform, the roller brush may be linked to restricting springs. These springs may push the roller brush forward and facilitate it to register the sinuosity and may conform to the body with less contact.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the alternative embodiment, the vertical springs and the sleeve bearings are eliminated. Both embodiments discussed may have grabbing handles, resting steps, and thread devices to apply final adjusting. Both embodiments discussed may have restriction springs installed in the mechanism of the roller brush to facilitate uniform cleaning. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, no water hose is present. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a control handle <b>950</b>.</p>
