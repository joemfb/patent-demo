<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation application of PCT Application No. PCT/JP2011/003768 filed Jun. 30, 2011, designating the United States of America, the disclosure of which, including the specification, drawings and claims, is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure pertains to a display panel in which a sealing resin layer is interposed between an element substrate and an opposing substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional technology allows for a sealing resin layer provided in order to prevent deterioration of a light-emitting element, such as an organic electroluminescence element, caused by the infiltration of water or oxygen from the outside atmosphere. That is, the sealing resin layer is formed between an element substrate, on which the light-emitting element is formed, and an opposing substrate (e.g., a CF substrate) opposite the element substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following describes a forming method for the sealing resin layer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating resin flow during sealing resin layer formation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a magnified view of portion A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a cross-section taken along line B<b>1</b>-B<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the spread of the resin material.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The sealing resin layer is formed, for example, by dropping resin material <b>903</b>, used for sealing, onto the opposing substrate <b>901</b>. The dropping of the resin material <b>903</b> is performed by dripping a drop of the resin material <b>903</b> at a plurality of positions on the opposing substrate <b>901</b>, in volumes sufficient for a single drop to cover multiple (e.g., on the order of 100) light-emitting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Next, curing is initiated for the resin material <b>903</b> so dropped onto the opposing substrate <b>901</b>. The curing of the resin material <b>903</b> is initiated, for example, by UV irradiation. The curing duration is controllable by the adjustment of curing delay agents, polymerization initiators, and reactants.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Subsequently, before the dropped resin material <b>903</b> hardens, the element substrate is arranged opposite the opposing substrate, and the two substrates are joined. Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref>, the dropped resin material <b>24</b> spreads in concentric circles, expanding from the center of each drip position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, resin material <b>903</b><i>a</i>, spread in concentric circles from the center of a given drip position, mutually overlaps resin material <b>903</b><i>b </i>and <b>903</b><i>c</i>, similarly spread in concentric circles from the respective centers of neighbouring drip positions. Thus, the sealing resin layer forms over a wide area between the opposing substrate <b>901</b> and the element substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">However, the above-described technology is problematic in that voids <b>905</b> remain in the sealing resin layer, wherever unfilled by the resin material. When such a void <b>905</b> occurs on or above one of the light-emitting elements, the light-emitting element remains uncovered by the sealing resin layer. This is problematic in that the light-emitting element is not protected against the deterioration caused by infiltration of water or oxygen from the outside atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">One non-limiting and exemplary Embodiment provides a display panel in which void formation is constrained, and in which the effect of void formation on the light-emitting elements is minimized, as well as a manufacturing method for such a display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">In one general aspect, the techniques disclosed here feature a display panel, comprising: an element substrate having a plurality of pixels, each pixel having at least one light-emitting element; an opposing substrate arranged so as to oppose the element substrate; and a sealing resin layer interposed between and adjoining the element substrate and the opposing substrate, respective surfaces of the element substrate and the opposing substrate facing each other, and the sealing layer sealing the light-emitting elements, wherein an element surface is defined as a top surface of the element substrate on one of the light-emitting elements, an element opposed surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the element surface, an inter-pixel surface is defined as a top surface of the element substrate between neighbouring pixels, an inter-pixel opposing surface is defined as a top surface of the opposing substrate opposite the inter-pixel surface, an inter-element surface is defined as a surface of the element substrate between neighbouring light-emitting elements within one of the pixels, an inter-element opposing surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the inter-element surface, for at least one given pixel, a distance between the element surface and the element opposing surface corresponding to each of the light-emitting elements of the given pixel is smaller than: a distance between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface in an inter-pixel area between the given pixel and at least one neighbouring pixel; and a distance between the inter-element surface and the inter-element opposing surface corresponding to the light-emitting elements of the given pixel, and on the element substrate, the distance between the given pixel and the neighbouring pixel is greater than a distance between one of the light-emitting elements of the given pixel and a neighbouring light-emitting element of the given pixel, and a distance between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface in an expansion is greater than a maximum distance between the inter-element surface and the inter-element opposing surface, the expansion being located between the given pixel and the neighbouring pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">In another general aspect, the techniques here disclosed feature a display panel manufacturing method, comprising: an element substrate formation step of forming an element substrate having a plurality of pixels, each pixel having at least one light-emitting element; an opposing substrate formation step of forming an opposing substrate arranged so as to oppose the element substrate; and a sealing resin layer formation step of forming a sealing resin layer, respective surfaces of the element substrate formed in the element substrate formation step and the opposing substrate formed in the opposing substrate formation step facing each other, the sealing resin layer being interposed between and adjoining the element substrate and the opposing substrate, and the resin layer sealing the light-emitting elements, wherein for the element substrate formation step and the opposing substrate formation step, an element surface is defined as a region of the surface of the element substrate on one of the light-emitting elements, an element opposing surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the element surface, an inter-pixel surface is defined as a surface of the element substrate between neighbouring pixels, an inter-pixel opposing surface is defined as a region of the surface of the opposing substrate opposite the inter-pixel surface, an inter-element surface is defined as a surface of the element substrate between neighbouring light-emitting elements within one of the pixels, an inter-element opposing surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the inter-element surface, and the element substrate and the opposing substrate are formed such that: on the element substrate, for at least one given pixel, a distance between the element surface and the element opposing surface corresponding to each of the light-emitting elements of the given pixel is smaller than: a distance between the inter-element surface and the inter-element opposing surface in an inter-pixel area between the given pixel and at least one neighbouring pixel; and a distance between the inter-element surface and the inter-element opposing surface corresponding to the light-emitting elements of the given pixel, and on the element substrate, the distance between the given pixel and the neighbouring pixel is greater than a distance between one of the light-emitting elements of the given pixel and a neighbouring light-emitting element of the given pixel, and a distance in an expansion between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface is greater than a maximum distance between the inter-element surface and the inter-element opposing surface, the expansion being located between the given pixel and the neighbouring pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">According to the above structure, the distance between the element substrate and the opposing substrate is wider at portions where none of the light-emitting elements are formed than at portions where the light-emitting elements are formed. Thus, the distance between the element substrate and the opposing substrate is narrower at portions where the light-emitting elements are formed, such that the fluidity of the resin material is increased at such portions and thereby constraining void formation in the portions where the light-emitting elements are formed.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Overview of Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">In one non-limiting aspect, a display panel of the present disclosure comprises: an element substrate having a plurality of pixels, each pixel having at least one light-emitting element; an opposing substrate arranged so as to oppose the element substrate; and a sealing resin layer interposed between and adjoining the element substrate and the opposing substrate, respective surfaces of the element substrate and the opposing substrate facing each other, and sealing the light-emitting elements, wherein an element surface is defined as a top surface of the element substrate on one of the light-emitting elements, an element opposing surface is defined a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the element surface, an inter-pixel surface is defined as a top surface of the element substrate between neighbouring pixels, an inter-pixel opposing surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the inter-pixel surface, an inter-element surface is defined as a top surface of the element substrate between neighbouring light-emitting elements within one of the pixels, an inter-element opposing surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the inter-element surface, for at least one given pixel, a distance between the element surface and the element opposing surface corresponding to each of the light-emitting elements of the given pixel is smaller than: a distance between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface in an inter-pixel area between the given pixel and at least one neighbouring pixel; and a distance between the inter-element surface and the inter-element opposing surface corresponding to the light-emitting elements of the given pixel, and on the element substrate, the distance between the given pixel and the neighbouring pixel is greater than a distance between one of the light-emitting elements of the given pixel and a neighbouring light-emitting element of the given pixel, and a distance between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface in an expansion is greater than a maximum distance between the inter-element surface and the inter-element opposing surface, the expansion being located between the given pixel and the neighbouring pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">In another non-limiting aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, an element substrate reference surface is defined as a surface of the element substrate located on the inter-pixel area and nearest the opposing substrate, the element substrate has primary recesses (or primary concavities) each located on one of the light-emitting elements and recessed with respect to the element substrate reference surface, a bottom of each primary concavity being the element surface and the element substrate reference surface being the inter-pixel surface, an opposing substrate reference surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the element substrate reference surface, and the opposing substrate has primary protrusions each located opposite one of the primary concavities and protruding from the opposing substrate reference surface, a top face of each primary protrusion being the element opposing surface and the opposing substrate reference surface being the inter-pixel opposing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">Accordingly, a distance between the element surface and the element opposing surface, where the light-emitting elements are formed, is narrower than a distance between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface in an inter-pixel area between the given pixel and at least one neighbouring pixel, in inter-pixel areas where no light-emitting elements are formed. Thus, the fluidity of the resin material is increased where the light-emitting elements are formed, thereby constraining void formation in the vicinity of the light-emitting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">Conversely, the distance between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface in an inter-pixel area where no light-emitting elements are formed between the given pixel and at least one neighbouring pixel is greater than the distance between the element surface and the element opposing surface where the light-emitting elements are formed. Thus, the resin material flows less easily through the inter-pixel areas, which easily induce the voids therein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">However, void formation in the inter-pixel areas has little effect on the light-emitting elements, as no light-emitting elements are located in the inter-pixel areas.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">Furthermore, void formation is constrained in the areas where the light-emitting elements are formed, such that upon light emission, the voids are less likely to cause a decrease in luminance. Additionally, this enables the suppression of flicker due to external light reflection when no light is being emitted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">In a further aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, on the element substrate, the expansion making the distance, in the expansion, between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-element opposing surface greater than the distance, in areas other than the expansion, between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface is located between the given pixel and the neighbouring pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">Accordingly, the expansion easily induces the voids therein. Thus, in the event of void formation, it is more likely that the void formation occurs in the inter-pixel area where no light-emitting elements are located. Thus, a high-quality display panel is made available.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">In yet a further aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, the light-emitting elements are formed between partition walls. Accordingly, irregularities are more easily formed in the surface of the element substrate that faces the opposing substrate. By satisfying the above-discussed distance relationships, void formation over the light-emitting elements can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">In another aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, the partition walls are of uniform height. Accordingly, the irregularities in the surface of the element substrate that faces the opposing substrate can more easily be reduced. This simplifies control of the distance between the element substrate and the opposing substrate, so as to produce a high-quality display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">In an alternate aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, an auxiliary electrode is provided between the pixels. Accordingly, in the event of void formation, the voids are collected in regions near the auxiliary electrodes, which do not affect light emission. As such, void formation between the element surface of the element substrate and the element opposing surface of the opposing substrate can be suppressed. As a result, the infiltration of water and oxygen from the outside atmosphere to the light-emitting elements and the like is preventable.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">In another alternate aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, the light-emitting elements of the pixels each emit a different color of light. Further, the colours of light emitted by the light-emitting elements of the pixels are at least three in number. Accordingly a color display panel is made available.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">In yet another alternate aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, each one of the light-emitting elements is an electroluminescence light-emitting element. Accordingly, a thin, high-efficiency display panel is made available.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">In yet a further alternate aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, the opposing substrate includes a plurality of color filters arrayed in correspondence with the different colours of light emitted by the light-emitting elements, and the primary protrusions of the opposing substrate are the color filters. Accordingly, although irregularities are more easily formed in the surface of the opposing substrate that faces the element substrate, void formation over the light-emitting elements can be suppressed by satisfying the above-discussed distance relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">In still a further aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, the opposing substrate includes a black matrix partitioning the color filters in correspondence with the colours of light, and the opposing substrate reference surface is a surface of the black matrix facing the element substrate. Accordingly, the reference surface is more likely made more uniform (i.e., the reference surface is less subject to fluctuations). This simplifies control of the distance between the element substrate and the opposing substrate, so as to produce a high-quality display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">In still another aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, the expansion is located at an approximate midpoint of the inter-pixel area. Accordingly, there is an increase in probability that void formation will occur at the position farthest from the light-emitting elements, i.e., in the inter-pixel area between neighbouring pixels where no light-emitting elements are formed. As such, a high-quality display panel is made available.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">In still another alternate aspect of the display panel of the present disclosure, the primary protrusions equivalent to the color filters each protrude with respect the opposing substrate reference surface to a different degree, such that the distance between the element surface and the element opposing surface is minimized at a middle light-emitting element for each of the pixels. Further, for at least one given pixel, the distance between the element surface and the element opposing surface corresponding to each of the light-emitting elements of the given pixel is greater than a distance between neighbouring light-emitting elements of the given pixel. Accordingly, the inter-pixel area easily induces the voids therein, such that a high-quality display panel is made available.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">A display panel manufacturing method of the present disclosure comprises: an element substrate formation step of forming an element substrate having a plurality of pixels, each pixel having at least one light-emitting element; an opposing substrate formation step of forming an opposing substrate arranged so as to oppose the element substrate; and a sealing resin layer formation step of forming a sealing resin layer, respective surfaces of the element substrate formed in the element substrate formation step and the opposing substrate formed in the opposing substrate formation step facing each other, the sealing resin layer being interposed between and adjoining the element substrate and the opposing substrate, and sealing the light-emitting elements, wherein for the element substrate formation step and the opposing substrate formation step an element surface is defined as a top surface of the element substrate on one of the light-emitting elements, an element opposing surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the element surface, an inter-pixel surface is defined as a top surface of the element substrate between neighbouring pixels, an inter-pixel opposing surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the inter-pixel surface, an inter-element surface is defined as a top surface of the element substrate between neighbouring light-emitting elements within one of the pixels, an inter-element opposing surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the inter-element surface, and the element substrate and the opposing substrate are formed such that: on the element substrate, for at least one given pixel, a distance between the element surface and the element opposing surface corresponding to each of the light-emitting elements of the given pixel is smaller than: a distance between the inter-element surface and the inter-element opposing surface in an inter-pixel area between the given pixel and at least one neighbouring pixel; and a distance between the inter-element surface and the inter-element opposing surface corresponding to the light-emitting elements of the given pixel, and on the element substrate, the distance between the given pixel and the neighbouring pixel is greater than a distance between one of the light-emitting elements of the given pixel and a neighbouring light-emitting element of the given pixel, and a distance in an expansion between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface is greater than a maximum distance between the inter-element surface and the inter-element opposing surface, the expansion being located between the given pixel and the neighbouring pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">Further, an element substrate reference surface is defined as a surface of the element substrate located on the inter-pixel area and nearest the opposing substrate, the element substrate has primary recesses each located on one of the light-emitting elements and recessed with respect to the element substrate reference surface, a bottom of each primary concavity being the element surface and the element substrate reference surface being the inter-pixel surface, an opposing substrate reference surface is defined as a surface of the opposing substrate opposite the element substrate reference surface, and the opposing substrate has primary protrusions each located opposite one of the primary concavities and protruding from the opposing substrate reference surface, a top face of each primary protrusion being the element opposing surface and the opposing substrate reference surface being the inter-pixel opposing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">Accordingly, a distance between the element surface and the element opposing surface, where the light-emitting elements are formed, is narrower than a distance between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface in an inter-pixel area between the given pixel and at least one neighbouring pixel, in inter-pixel areas where no light-emitting elements are formed. Thus, the fluidity of the resin material is increased where the light-emitting elements are formed, thereby enabling the suppression of void formation in the vicinity of the light-emitting elements. Conversely, the distance between the inter-pixel surface and the inter-pixel opposing surface in an inter-pixel area between the given pixel and at least one neighbouring pixel is greater than the distance between the element surface and the element opposing surface in the inter-pixel areas, where no light-emitting elements are formed. Thus, the resin material flows less easily through the inter-pixel areas, which easily induce the voids therein. However, void formation in the inter-pixel areas has no effect on the light-emitting elements, as no light-emitting elements are located in the inter-pixel areas.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">In an alternative aspect of the display panel manufacturing method of the present disclosure, an auxiliary electrode is provided between the pixels.

In contrast to conventional technology, voids do not form over the sub-pixels, as any voids formed do so in the inter-pixel areas over the inter-pixel BM <b>123</b><i>b </i>and have little effect on the sub-pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0125">Furthermore, the position at which the distance between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b> is greatest (i.e., the position of distance D<b>3</b>) is the approximate midpoint between pixels (while designed to be at the midpoint, manufacturing variations may lead to deviations).

<p id="p-0143" num="0144">The process of joining the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b> includes a step of dripping resin material for the sealing resin layer onto the joining face (top face) of the EL substrate <b>11</b> at a plurality of locations, a step of causing the joining face (top face) of the CF substrate <b>12</b> to adhere to the EL substrate <b>11</b> having the resin material dripped thereon, and step of curing the resin during adhesion.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0145">While the following describes dripping the resin material onto the EL substrate <b>11</b>, the resin material may optionally be dripped onto the CF substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A through 14C</figref> illustrate an example of the joining process.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0147">First, a seal material (i.e., DAM) paste is applied to prevent leakage of the resin material for the sealing resin layer <b>13</b> that seals the prepared (i.e., manufactured) EL substrate <b>11</b> and the prepared (i.e., manufactured) CF substrate <b>12</b>. Furthermore, resin material (FILL) <b>165</b> for the sealing resin layer <b>13</b> is dripped at predetermined space intervals onto interior portions of the CF substrate <b>12</b> (i.e., onto portions where the organic light-emitting layer <b>115</b> is formed) excluding the circumferential area of the CF substrate <b>12</b> (Dripping step, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0148">Once the dripping of the resin material <b>165</b> is complete, the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b> are joined under a vacuum (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>). At this point, the resin material <b>165</b> so dripped spreads throughout the space between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b> such that gaps between drops of the resin material <b>165</b> are eliminated (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0149">The resin material <b>165</b> is then irradiated with UV rays, for example. Such irradiation may occur while dripping the resin material <b>165</b>, or may occur once all of the resin material <b>165</b> has been dripped. Upon irradiation by the UV rays, resin curing is delayed. While some curing may begin during UV irradiation, most curing progresses after the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b> have been joined.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0150">Then, the resin material <b>165</b> is cured once the dripped resin material <b>165</b> has sufficiently spread (curing step). Upon curing, the resin material <b>165</b> forms the sealing resin layer <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0177">As described above, the resin material for the sealing resin layer <b>13</b> has a viscosity of 500 mmPa&#xb7;s. The resin material is dripped using a syringe, for example.

The number of drops so dripped is dependent on the size of the display panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0178">The resin material is dripped in a zigzag pattern. That is, when dripping is performed in a matrix, for example, the drip positions on two neighbouring rows are offset by a half-pitch in the row direction.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0179">UV rays irradiate the dripped or dripping resin material, for example. Here, a resin material is used in which curing is delayed upon UV irradiation. Therefore, resin material solidification progresses little before and after the joining of the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b>, such that the resin material flows into the gaps between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0180">Once the resin material has filled the gaps between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b> (alternatively, once an expected time for the resin material to fill the gap has elapsed), heat is applied to encourage solidification of the resin material. The display panel <b>10</b> is complete once the resin material has hardened.</p>
<heading id="h-0038" level="1">5. Resin Material Fluidity</heading>
<p id="h-0039" num="0000">(1) Overview</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0181">As described under the Technical Field and Summary headings, the problem of void formation within the sealing resin layer was observed. Upon investigation of void formation positions and the like, it was discovered that void formation occurs in specific places.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0182">First, in conformity with the resin material dripping pattern, void formation was found to occur regularly at positions most distant from the dripping points. Second, the voids were found to be concentrated in portions of specific colours.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0183">Upon detailed investigation into several membrane thickness variations for each color, R, G, and B, of the color filters, it was found that the shape of the irregularities in the CF substrate had a major influence. That is, the ease of spreading (i.e., the fluidity) of the resin material when the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b> are joined is influenced by the degree to which the color filters protrude (i.e., by the size of the gaps between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0184">This influence is greater than that of wettability in the surfaces of the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b>, and is not constrained by the presence of pigments or dyes in the color filters.</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">(2) Experiment</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0185">The following uses the results of an experiment in which the irregularities in the CF substrate <b>12</b> are varied to describe the separation of the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b>, and the fluidity of the resin material used for the sealing resin layer <b>13</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0186" num="0187">As shown, the experiment was performed in three configurations. The irregularities in the EL substrate <b>11</b> were held constant, while three levels on the CF substrate <b>12</b> were investigated.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0188">The EL substrate <b>11</b> used in the experiment was made concave to correspond with the color filters <b>122</b> on the CF substrate <b>12</b>, i.e., to assume the primary concavities <b>118</b> between the banks <b>114</b>. The concavity depth was of 1 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0189">Conversely, on the CF substrate <b>12</b> used in the experiment, the BM <b>123</b> had the height given as BM, the blue color filter <b>122</b> (B) had the height given as B, the green color filter <b>122</b> (G) had the height given as G, and the red color filter <b>122</b> (R) had the height given as R, all heights being measured with respect to the substrate body <b>121</b> and indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>.

<p id="p-0190" num="0191">The membrane thickness of the color filters <b>122</b> was determined according to the (type of) sub-pixel.

The membrane thickness often varies by color.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0192">For example, given a membrane thickness of 1.3 &#x3bc;m for the BM <b>123</b>, then with respect to the top surface of the BM <b>123</b>, color filter <b>122</b> (B) protruded by 0.32 &#x3bc;m whereas color filters <b>122</b> (G) and <b>122</b> (R) were recessed by 0.3 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0193">As given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, distances D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b> were found using the above-given levels 1 through 3 of the CF substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0194">Specifically, for level 1, distances D<b>1</b> (R) and D<b>1</b> (G) were 11.60 &#x3bc;m, distance D<b>1</b> (B) was 10.98 &#x3bc;m, and distance D<b>2</b> was 11.30 &#x3bc;m.

<p id="p-0199" num="0200">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the void quantity decreased across levels, such that a ranking in decreasing order of void quantity gives the order level 1, level 2, level 3.

<p id="p-0200" num="0201">Comparing level 1 to level 2 revealed that, as stated above, fewer voids were present at level 2 than at level 1. That is, void formation is less likely to occur at level 2 than at level 1.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0202">Comparing the configurations of level 1 and level 2 revealed that, at level 1, only distance D<b>1</b> (B) is smaller than distance D<b>2</b>, while at level 2, distances D<b>1</b> (R), D<b>1</b> (G), and D<b>1</b> (B) are all smaller than distance D<b>2</b>. Also, distance D<b>1</b> is smaller at level 2 than at level 1.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0203">Accordingly, it can be concluded that void formation is less likely when all distances D<b>1</b> are as small as possible, specifically when all distances D<b>1</b> are smaller than distance D<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0204">Comparing level 2 to level 3 revealed that, as stated above, fewer voids were present at level 3 than at level 2. That is, void formation is less likely to occur at level 3 than at level 2.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0205">Comparing the configurations of level 2 and level 3 revealed that on both levels, distances D<b>1</b> (R), D<b>1</b> (G), and D<b>1</b> (B) were all smaller than distance D<b>2</b>, and that all distances D<b>1</b> were smaller at level 3 than at level 2.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0206">Accordingly, as described in the above comparison of level 1 and level 2, it can be concluded that void formation is less likely when all distances D<b>1</b> are smaller than distance D<b>2</b>, and all distances D<b>1</b> are small.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0207">To summarise the above findings, void formation becomes less likely as distances D<b>1</b> are made smaller than distance D<b>2</b>, and as the gap (distance) between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b> is made smaller.</p>

<p id="p-0209" num="0210">As conversely confirmed, at level 1, although the resin material <b>165</b> (black side) flowed in a similar pattern over individual pixels (areas), at the pixel (area) level, the resin material <b>165</b> flowed (spread) between the blue color filter <b>122</b> (B) and the EL substrate <b>11</b> as well as between the BM <b>123</b><i>b </i>and the EL substrate <b>11</b>, flow was more difficult between the red color filter <b>122</b> (R) and the EL substrate <b>11</b> as well as between the green color filter <b>122</b> (G) and the EL substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0211">At level 1, the difference between the fluidity of the resin material <b>165</b> at the blue color filter <b>122</b> (B) and the BM <b>123</b><i>b </i>and the fluidity of the resin material <b>165</b> at the red color filter <b>122</b> (R) and the green color filter <b>122</b> (G) lay in the distance between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b>.

Thus, the resin material fluidity worsened in the corresponding inter-pixel area, leading to void formation.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0216">That is, void formation is constrained by optimizing the distance between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0236" num="0237">The exemplary Embodiment focuses on the distance between the EL substrate and the CF substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0238">Here, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the distance between the surface of the CF substrate <b>12</b> (which is the top surface of the inter-subpixel BM <b>123</b><i>a</i>) and the surface of the EL substrate <b>11</b> at a position above one of the banks <b>114</b> is equal to distance D<b>2</b> between the inter-pixel surface of the EL substrate <b>11</b> (the surface above the banks <b>114</b><i>a</i>) and the inter-pixel opposing surface of the CF substrate <b>12</b>. Simply considering the distance between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b>, void formation is likely to occur in the portion corresponding to the top of the inter-subpixel BM <b>123</b><i>a </i>between the pixel areas.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0239">However, the distance between the color filters <b>122</b> in the pixel areas is, for example, distance B<b>2</b> between color filter <b>122</b> (B) and color filter <b>122</b> (G) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), which is on the order of 3 &#x3bc;m to 8 &#x3bc;m. As such, when distance B<b>2</b> is, for example, 5 &#x3bc;m, and thus small in comparison to distance D<b>1</b> between the EL substrate <b>11</b> and the color filters <b>122</b> on the CF substrate <b>12</b>, then, considering the fact that the fluidity of the resin material increases with narrowing distance, there is no need to account for the distance between the CF substrate <b>12</b> and the EL substrate <b>11</b> between the color filters <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0240">For reference, when the ratio of the distance between the color filters <b>122</b> to distance D<b>1</b> between the CF substrate <b>12</b> and the EL substrate <b>11</b> is 1.0 or lower, the distance between the CF substrate <b>12</b> and the EL substrate <b>11</b> between the color filters <b>122</b> is plausibly ignorable, even if greater than distance D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0241">On the other hand, when the distance between pixels (distance B<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is small in comparison to distance D<b>1</b> and thus similar to the distance between neighbouring color filters <b>122</b> in the pixel areas, void formation becomes difficult to suppress in the pixel area despite distance D<b>2</b> being greater than distance D<b>1</b>. Accordingly, void formation in the pixel areas is constrainable by setting distance D<b>1</b> between the CF substrate <b>12</b> and the EL substrate <b>11</b> to be, for example, on the order of 5 &#x3bc;m or greater, which further improves the likelihood that any voids formed are located in the inter-pixel areas.</p>
<heading id="h-0046" level="1">Reasoning Leading to Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0241" num="0242">The present inventors examined the causes of void formation in the sealing resin layer between the EL substrate and the CF substrate, and thus came to the following understanding.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0243">Specifically, when the resin material used for sealing spreads in concentric circles, void formation does not occur in areas near the center of the concentric circles, but does occur in peripheral regions farther away from the center. Regions exist where the resin material spreading in concentric circles from the center of a given drip position (termed a first drip position) and the resin material spreading in concentric circles from the center of another drip position (termed a second drip position) neighbouring the first drip position do not overlap, as regional overlap is not perfect. Void formation then occurs in these non-overlapping regions.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0244">Furthermore, during the analysis of void formation locations, the existence of environments more or less conducive to the spread of the resin material in concentric circles progressing with increasing distance from the center of the concentric circles (i.e., void formation does not occur in progress-conducive environments, but does occur in non-conducive environments) was determined.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0245">When viewed in cross-section, the EL substrate has banks facing the CF substrate, and the sub-pixels are formed between the banks. Accordingly, the surface of the EL substrate has irregularities.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0246">When viewed in cross-section, the CF substrate has BM on the surface thereof serving as the banks between the filters of each color, and these color filters are correspondingly formed between the BM. Accordingly, the surface of the CF substrate has irregularities.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0247">Given that the sub-pixels are formed on the EL substrate between the banks, the sub-pixels are located in the concavities between the banks. Conversely, the color filters on the CF substrate are located opposite the sub-pixels on the EL substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0248">Upon critically examining and analyzing the relationship between the depth of the concavities where the sub-pixels are located between the banks on the EL substrate and the height of the color filters opposite the sub-pixels of the EL substrate on the CF substrate (including depressions and concavities with respect to the BM surface), the present inventors arrived at the following.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0249">When the color filters on the CF substrate protrude toward the EL substrate relative to the BM surface, there is a tendency toward greater progress by the resin material between the concavities formed between the banks on the EL substrate and the color filters protruding from the substrate body.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0250">In other words, when pressurized between the EL substrate and the CF substrate, the resin material used for sealing spreads into the gaps between the substrates, thereby determining the void locations. While spreading, the resin material is more easily drawn into narrow gaps between the substrates than into wide gaps between the substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0251">In addition, the progress of the resin material into the concavities between the banks on the EL substrate and the color filters protruding from the CF substrate is notably enhanced when the size of the protruding color filters (i.e., the degree of protrusion) is increased while the space between the concavities between the banks on the EL substrate and the color filters protruding from the CF substrate is narrowed and correspondingly made narrower than the space between the sides of the concavities between the banks (the EL substrate banks) and the space between the sides of the protruding color filters (the inter-subpixel BM on the CF substrate). In other words, void formation in the resin layer used for sealing is more easily made to occur in the inter-pixel areas between the EL substrate and the CF substrate, where no pixels are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0252">The reasons are not yet fully clear, but the mechanism is theorized to be similar to capillary action. The present disclosure has thus been reached in light the above-described new findings.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0253">Assuming a mechanism similar to capillary action, the surface of the EL substrate or the surface of the CF substrate is activatable by irradiation under, for example, oxygen plasma or UV rays, prior to the joining of the substrates, in order to promote greater capillary action.</p>

<p id="h-0048" num="0000">1. EL Substrate</p>
<p id="h-0049" num="0000">(1) Surface Irregularities</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0254">Although the exemplary Embodiment describes the surface irregularities of the EL substrate <b>11</b> as being caused by the banks <b>114</b>, the surface of the sealing layer (or encapsulation layer) (<b>117</b>) may optionally be made planar. The planarization of the sealing layer (<b>117</b>) is performable by a planarization process, or by thickening the resin layer (<b>117</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0255">Further, although the portions corresponding to the banks protrude with respect to the bottom of the surrounding concavities, this may be reversed. Optionally, the portions having the banks may, for example, be worked into concavities (such that the surrounding area forms a protrusion with respect to the bank portion).</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0256">However, this approach requires that, when the EL substrate opposes the CF substrate, the portion wider than the distance between the space between the banks of the EL substrate and the color filters on the CF substrate is arranged in an area other than the area sandwiched between the banks of the EL substrate and the color filters on the CF substrate.</p>
<p id="h-0050" num="0000">(2) Banks</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0257">In the exemplary Embodiment, each pixel is delimited by two banks. That is, two of the banks <b>114</b> are arranged between two neighbouring pixels, one of the banks <b>114</b> being located at the side of the organic light-emitting layer (<b>115</b> (B)) of a given pixel that faces the other pixel, and the other one of the banks <b>114</b> being located at the side of the organic light-emitting layer (<b>115</b> (R)) of the other pixel that faces the given pixel (i.e., the two banks <b>114</b> on either side of the auxiliary electrode <b>113</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0258">However, a single bank may optionally be arranged between the pixels, as in the example described in Variation (1). In this example, the reference signs of the exemplary Embodiment are used for elements identical to those described therein.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0259"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a cross-sectional diagram schematically illustrating the key components of a display panel <b>200</b> pertaining to Variation (1).</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0260">The display panel <b>200</b> has a sealing resin layer <b>203</b> joining an EL substrate <b>201</b> and a CF substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0261">The EL substrate <b>201</b> includes a main substrate (TFT substrate) <b>111</b>, an inter-layer insulating membrane <b>112</b>, anodes <b>113</b><i>a</i>, auxiliary electrodes <b>113</b><i>b</i>, banks <b>205</b>, an organic light-emitting layer <b>115</b>, a cathode <b>207</b>, and a sealing layer <b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0262">The banks <b>205</b> include two varieties, namely inter-subpixel banks <b>205</b><i>a </i>arranged between the sub-pixels, and inter-pixel banks <b>205</b><i>b </i>arranged between the pixels. The inter-subpixel banks <b>205</b><i>a </i>are configured identically to the inter-subpixel banks <b>114</b><i>a </i>disposed between the sub-pixels in the exemplary Embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0263">In Variation (1), a single bank (<b>205</b><i>b</i>) is arranged between the pixels <b>30</b>. Thus, the Variation differs from the exemplary Embodiment in that the surface of the portion corresponding to the area between pixels on the CF substrate <b>12</b> is flat.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0264">Let the distance between the inter-pixel opposing surface of the CF substrate <b>12</b> and the inter-pixel surface of the EL substrate <b>201</b> be D<b>2</b>, and let the distance between the sub-pixel surface of the EL substrate <b>201</b> and the sub-pixel opposing surface of the CF substrate <b>12</b> be D<b>1</b>. The distance between the EL substrate <b>201</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b> then satisfies the relation:

<p id="p-0264" num="0265">Accordingly, void formation in the pixel areas having the organic light-emitting layers <b>115</b> (i.e., the sub-pixels) is constrainable.</p>
<p id="h-0051" num="0000">(3) Pixels</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0266">In the exemplary Embodiment, the pixels are each made up of three sub-pixels each emitting a different color of light. However, the pixels may optionally be made up of a single sub-pixel.</p>
<p id="h-0052" num="0000">2. CF Substrate</p>
<p id="h-0053" num="0000">(1) Color Filter Type</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0267">In the exemplary Embodiment, three types of color filters are discussed, namely red (R), green (G), and blue (B). However, no particular limitation is intended. For example, yellow (Y) may be optionally added for a total of four types, or the color filters may be optionally omitted for a monochrome result.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0268">When the wavelengths of the light emitted by the organic light-emitting layer do not require color selection by color filter, then no color filter is required on the CF substrate opposite thereto. In such circumstances, the opposing substrate is configured to be transparent, and this transparent substrate is shaped to have a surface corresponding to the shape of the irregularities in the substrate having the sub-pixels. Thus, the transparent substrate is equivalent to the CF substrate of the exemplary Embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0054" num="0000">(2) Color Filter Locations</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0269">In the exemplary Embodiment, a uniform location pattern is used for the color filters in the pixel areas. However, the location pattern may optionally vary with each pixel area.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0270">Furthermore, in the exemplary Embodiment, one of each of three types of color filter <b>122</b> are used for each individual pixel. However, a plurality of (e.g., two) predetermined color filters may optionally be used in a given color, for a total of four color filters making up the pixel (in such circumstances, the quantity of sub-pixels is four).</p>
<p id="h-0055" num="0000">(3) Color Filter Thickness</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0271">In the exemplary Embodiment, the membrane thickness of the color filters <b>122</b> is uniform, irrespective of the color emitted thereby. However, the thickness of the color filters <b>122</b> may optionally vary. Nevertheless, distances D<b>1</b> (R), D<b>1</b> (G), and D<b>1</b> (B) between the respective top faces of the color filters <b>122</b> (i.e., the sub-pixel opposing surfaces) and the top surface of the sub-pixels on the EL substrate <b>11</b> or <b>201</b> are beneficially smaller than distance D<b>2</b> between the inter-pixel areas on the EL substrate <b>11</b> or <b>201</b> and the CF substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0272">Portions of the EL substrate <b>11</b> or <b>201</b> opposite the color filters <b>122</b> (i.e., the sub-pixel surface) may, with respect to the inter-pixel surface of the EL substrate <b>11</b> or <b>201</b>, optionally be recessed, protrude, or be recessed and protrude to a degree varying according to the corresponding color filter, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0273">When distance D<b>1</b> between the CF substrate and the EL substrate varies at the color filters, D<b>1</b> at the central portion of the pixel areas is beneficially narrower than D<b>1</b> at edge portions of the pixel areas. This is because narrowing distance D<b>1</b> at the central portion of the pixel area increases the fluidity of the resin material therethrough and minimizes the occurrence of void formation therein. In other words, distance D<b>1</b> is made narrower at the center portion than at the edge portions to encourage void formation offset toward the edge portions.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0274">That is, given similarly-sized voids forming in the pixel area, an occurrence of void formation so as to extend outside the pixel area and only partially into the pixel area is preferable to an occurrence of void formation occurring entirely within the pixel area in that the former is better able to minimize the effect on the organic light-emitting layer.</p>

<p id="p-0275" num="0276">In the exemplary Embodiment, distance D<b>3</b> between the EL substrate and the CF substrate is greatest at the approximate midpoint of the inter-pixel area, regardless of the position of the pixels.

<p id="p-0276" num="0277">However, during investigation, the present inventors determined that the regions most prone to void formation are the regions more distant from the position where the resin material is dripped. Thus, the secondary concavity <b>119</b> may optionally be formed so as to increase distance D<b>3</b> only in the regions particularly prone to void formation.
