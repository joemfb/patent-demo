<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-20999, filed on Feb. 2, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a solid state imaging device and a method for manufacturing the solid state imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When forming a transparent insulation film on a top face of a light sensing part in a back side illumination CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor, it is demanded to form the transparent insulation film at low temperatures in the range of approximately 200 to 300&#xb0; C. because of constraints imposed on the temperature by a bonding agent used for sticking together and Cu interconnections and it is difficult to form a good quality transparent insulation film on the top face of the light sensing part.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, the transparent insulation film formed at low temperatures has defects in an interface to the light sensing part and a high interface level. Even in a state in which there is no incidence light, electrons caused by them are detected as a current (called dark current) and appear as noise in image pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a conventional solid state imaging device proposed as a method for preventing the dark current, a negative fixed charge layer is formed on the top of the light sensing part and holes are attracted to the light sensing side of the light sensing part to form a P<sup>+ </sup>layer on the top of the light sensing part.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the solid state imaging device, electrons generated by a cause such as the interface level are canceled by holes because there is the P<sup>+ </sup>layer on the light sensing side, and the dark current can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">HfO<sub>2 </sub>or the like used as the negative fixed charge layer is premised on that it is formed as a film at low temperatures, however, it is difficult to reduce the defects or interface level.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, HfO<sub>2 </sub>or the like has a high refractive index as compared with SiO<sub>2 </sub>or SiN used in the transparent film. As a result, the reflectance increases. In a structure having a negative fixed charge layer, therefore, there is a possibility that it will not be able to cope with the conventional transmission film design and limits will be imposed on the final design as well.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, a solid state imaging device in which holes are attracted by using a ferroelectric substance instead of the negative fixed charge layer is proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The solid state imaging device includes a plurality of pixels having photoelectric converters, a ferroelectric film which is formed over a photoelectric converter of each pixel via an insulation film and which is formed of an inorganic compound subjected to polarization processing, and a transparent electrode formed on the ferroelectric film.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to this configuration, effects similar to those of the negative fixed charge layer can be obtained by retaining the polarization of dipoles of the ferroelectric substance even in a state in which voltage is not applied and adjusting the polarization direction to direct the negative charge side toward the light sensing plane.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As for an inorganic ferroelectric substance, however, heat treatment of at least 300&#xb0; C. is typically needed for film forming and crystallization and its Curie point is high. It is difficult to demonstrate the performance while satisfying the temperature constraints.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, it is difficult to use a ferroelectric substance such as barium titanate as a negative charge layer because it has a high refractive index and high temperature processing is needed to conduct sufficient polarization.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A solid state imaging device according to an embodiment includes a light sensing part which conducts photoelectric conversion on incident light. The solid state imaging device includes a ferroelectric layer including an organic compound on a surface of the light sensing part on which light is incident. The solid state imaging device includes a transparent electrode formed on the ferroelectric layer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hereafter, embodiments of a solid state imaging device and its manufacturing method according to the present invention will be described more specifically with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a plane layout of an image pickup pixel part and a peripheral circuit part in a solid state imaging device according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The solid state imaging device <b>1</b> is the so-called back side illumination solid state imaging device which receives light incident from the back (a plane opposite form the plane on which the interconnection layer is provided) at its light sensing part. In the present embodiment, the solid state imaging device <b>1</b> will be described by taking a CMOS image sensor as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The solid state imaging device <b>1</b> is formed by providing an image pickup pixel part <b>3</b> and a peripheral circuit part <b>4</b> on a semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the image pickup pixel part <b>3</b>, a large number of pixels are arranged in a two-dimensional form. Each pixel includes a light sensing part functioning as a photoelectric converter, such as a photodiode, and a pixel circuit (not illustrated) formed of a plurality of transistors to read a signal obtained by photoelectric conversion in the light sensing part. Furthermore, three pixels respectively having R, G and B color filter layers described later correspond to one picture element which is a minimum unit forming an image.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The peripheral circuit part <b>4</b> includes a timing generator <b>40</b> which outputs a pulse signal, a vertical selection circuit <b>41</b> which selects a signal of pixels in a vertical direction sequentially with a row taken as the unit, a correlated double sampling circuit <b>42</b> which reads a signal of a pixel by controlling a transistor of each pixel in synchronism with a pulse signal supplied from the timing generator <b>40</b>, a horizontal selection circuit <b>43</b> which outputs an output signal of the correlated double sampling circuit <b>42</b> to a gain control circuit <b>44</b>, the gain control circuit <b>44</b> which exercises gain control on a signal supplied from the horizontal selection circuit <b>43</b>, an A/D conversion circuit <b>45</b> which conducts analog-digital conversion on an output signal of the gain control circuit <b>44</b>, and a digital amplifier <b>46</b> which amplifies a digital signal supplied from the A/D conversion circuit <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a principal part sectional view showing a schematic configuration of a solid state imaging device according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The solid state imaging device <b>1</b> includes a semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>, which in turn includes light sensing parts <b>20</b> (three pixels respectively for R, G and B are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), a pixel circuit, pixel isolation regions <b>21</b> which isolate the light sensing parts <b>20</b>, and the peripheral circuit part <b>4</b>, a ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> having ferroelectricity formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>, a transparent electrode <b>7</b> formed on the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b>, an insulation film <b>8</b> formed on the transparent electrode <b>7</b>, a shading film <b>9</b> formed on parts of the insulation film <b>8</b> corresponding to the peripheral circuit part <b>4</b>, an insulation film <b>10</b> formed on the insulation film <b>8</b> to cover the shading film <b>9</b>, color filter layers <b>11</b>R, <b>11</b>G and <b>11</b>B (hereafter referred to collectively as &#x201c;color filter layer <b>11</b>&#x201d; as well) formed on the insulation film <b>10</b>, condenser lenses <b>12</b> formed on the color filter layer <b>11</b>, an interconnection layer <b>13</b> formed under the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>, and a support substrate <b>15</b> formed of a silicon substrate bonded to the bottom of the interconnection layer <b>13</b> by an adhesive agent <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> is below 210&#xb0; C. in the melting point, and more favorably below 160&#xb0; C. The ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> can be formed at a temperature slightly lower than the melting point, i.e., at a temperature below 200&#xb0; C., or more favorably at a temperature below 150&#xb0; C. The ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> is formed of an organic compound having light transmittance and ferroelectricity.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As an organic compound having ferroelectricity, for example, a vinylidene fluoride compound can be used. Vinylidene fluoride compounds include at least one of vinylidene fluoride (VDF), a homopolymer of vinylidene fluoride (VDF), i.e., polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a copolymer of VDF and a monomer which can be copolymerized with VDF, such as, for example, a copolymer (VDF/TrFE) of vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and ethylene trifluoride (TrFE) and a copolymer (VDF/TeFE) of vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and ethylene tetrafluoride (TeFE).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">VDF and PVDF have ferroelectricity. VDF and PVDF have a refractive index n=1.42 in the range of n=1.3 to 1.5, and it is nearly equivalent to that of SiO<sub>2</sub>. VDF and PVDF can be formed at low temperatures (approximately 150&#xb0; C. or below).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The VDF/TrFE copolymer and the VDF/TeFE copolymer have a suitable mole composition range which is suitable with respect to the polarization quantity. For example, as for the VDF/TrFE copolymer, it is desirable to copolymerize VDF and TrFE with a mole ratio in the range of 65:30 to 85:15, and it is further desirable to copolymerize VDF and TrFE with a mole ratio of 75:25. The VDF/TrFE copolymer is stronger than PVDF single substance in polarization, and its refractive index is n=1.42, which is nearly equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub>. The VDF/TrFE copolymer can attract holes to the top face of the light sensing part <b>20</b> intensely than the PVDF, and can be formed at low temperatures (150&#xb0; C. or below).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For revealing ferroelectricity of the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b>, a voltage must be applied between the electrode (transparent electrode <b>7</b>) and the substrate (semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>) at least once. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct processing (poling) to apply the voltage at arbitrary timing after the electrode is formed and align polarizations.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As for the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b>, a layer having a film thickness in the range of 0.1 to 200 nm can be used. Since the applied voltage at the time of poling can be made small, a range of 0.1 to 50 nm is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As the transparent electrode <b>7</b>, for example, indium tin oxide (ITO), zinc oxide, tin oxide or the like can be used. The transparent electrode <b>7</b> having a film thickness in the range of 1 to 1,000 nm can be used. If the transparent electrode <b>7</b> is too thin, the electric resistance becomes high although the light transmittance is great. Therefore, it is desirable that the transparent electrode <b>7</b> has a film thickness in the range of 5 to 100 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As for the insulation film <b>8</b> and the insulation film <b>10</b>, a material obtained by selecting one out of SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiON and SiN having transmittance with respect to incident light or combining at least two of them can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As for the shading film <b>9</b>, for example, aluminum, tungsten or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The color filter layers <b>11</b>R, <b>11</b>G and <b>11</b>B are formed of, for example, resists including dyes which selectively transmit light having red, green and blue wavelengths, respectively. The color filter layers <b>11</b>R, <b>11</b>G and <b>11</b>B are formed over the light sensing part <b>20</b> in a predetermined order.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The interconnection layer <b>13</b> includes a plurality of interconnections <b>130</b> formed of Cu or the like, and an inter-layer insulation film <b>131</b> formed of SiO<sub>2 </sub>or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As for the adhesive agent <b>14</b>, for example, SOG (spin on glass) cured by heat treatment in the range of 300 to 400&#xb0; C. can be used.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Manufacturing Method for Solid State Imaging Device)</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An example of a manufacturing method for a solid state imaging device will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>, N-type regions which form photodiodes of the light sensing parts <b>20</b>, a pixel circuit including a plurality of transistors, the pixel isolation regions <b>21</b>, and the peripheral circuit part <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Then, the interconnection layer <b>13</b> is formed on a face of the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> having the N-type regions of the light sensing parts <b>20</b> formed thereon. The adhesive agent <b>14</b> is formed on the interconnection layer <b>13</b>. The support substrate <b>15</b> is bonded to the interconnection layer <b>13</b> via the adhesive agent <b>14</b>. And heat treatment in the range of 300 to 400&#xb0; C. is conducted to cure the adhesive agent <b>14</b> and fix the support substrate <b>15</b> to the interconnection layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Then, the back side of the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> is polished until the N-type regions are exposed, resulting in a thinner semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>. And P-type regions which form photodiodes are formed on the back side of the pixel isolation region <b>21</b> and N-type regions in the image pickup pixel part <b>3</b> by ion injection.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> formed of, for example, VDF/TrFE copolymer is formed on the P-type region as an organic compound having ferroelectricity. As for the film forming method of ferroelectric macromolecules, a spin coat method by applying a solution, the LB (Langmuir-Blodgett) method, and the vacuum evaporation method are considered to be suitable. In the present embodiment, the spin coat method is used. In the case of the LB method, the heat treatment can be made unnecessary, because dipoles are oriented on the substrate by transferring the substrate to the organic compound developed on the liquid surface.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Then, the transparent electrode <b>7</b> is formed on the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> by using the vacuum evaporation method, the sputtering method, the cluster beam evaporation method.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram for explaining the poling of the ferroelectric layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) is a diagram showing an example of a heating temperature waveform. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) is a diagram showing an example of applied voltage waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">After the transparent electrode <b>7</b> is formed as a film, heat treatment is conducted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>). In the case where the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> is the vinylidene fluoride (VDF) compound, conducting heat treatment at a temperature (in the range of approximately 130 to 145&#xb0; C.) which is slightly lower the melting point (approximately 150&#xb0; C.) can improve the polarization orientation and cause stronger polarization. Since the vinylidene fluoride (VDF) compound becomes hard to reveal the ferroelectricity if it is melted and recrystallized, it becomes necessary to select a process conducted at 150&#xb0; C. or less, in the ensuing process.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Before the temperature falls to the Curie temperature (120 to 125&#xb0; C.), a voltage is applied to become negative on the transparent electrode <b>7</b> and become positive on the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> side as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4(</figref><i>b</i>). The magnitude of the voltage is changed according to the film thickness of the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> to apply an electric field corresponding to 100 MV/m. Owing to this voltage applying, dipoles <b>60</b> of the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> are aligned in the vertical direction (poling) and ferroelectricity is revealed. Since the dipoles <b>60</b> are directed in a direction opposite to the applied voltage, the dipoles <b>60</b> have positive charges on the transparent electrode <b>7</b> side and negative charges on the semiconductor <b>2</b> side. As a result, the dipoles <b>60</b> attract holes <b>22</b> in the photodiodes and form a P<sup>+ </sup>layer (hole storage layer) <b>23</b> in an upper part of the light sensing part <b>20</b> in the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If the temperature falls to the room temperature (20&#xb0; C.), voltage applying is stopped. It is desirable to leave the interconnections connected to the transparent electrode <b>7</b> even after the poling. Even if depolarization is caused by use of the solid-state imaging device and the performance is degraded, the polarization state of the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> can be restored to the original state by applying the voltage between the electrode and the substrate again if the interconnections are left.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Incidentally, the timing of the poling is not restricted to the way of the temperature falling in the heat treatment, but the poling may be conducted at arbitrary timing before completion of the solid state imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Then, the insulation film <b>8</b> is formed on the transparent electrode <b>7</b>. As for the film forming method, the PVD method and the spin coat method capable of forming the film at low temperatures are considered to be suitable. However, there is no problem even if the CVD method is used as long as the conditions are satisfied. In the case of an organic ferroelectric substance, the temperature used in the process needs to be the upper limit temperature (150&#xb0; C.) of the heat processing or below, because the ferroelectricity is lost if it melts.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Then, the shading film <b>9</b>, the insulation film <b>10</b>, the color filter layer <b>11</b>, and the condenser lenses <b>12</b> are formed through typical processes, and the desired solid state imaging device <b>1</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the first embodiment, the P<sup>+ </sup>layer <b>23</b> is formed in the upper part of the light sensing part <b>20</b> by poling the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> formed on the light sensing part <b>20</b>, and electrons generated at the interface level can be recombined in the P<sup>+ </sup>layer <b>23</b> in the light sensing part <b>20</b> and extinguished. As a result, the dark current caused by the interface level can be reduced. Furthermore, since the vinylidene fluoride compound which forms the ferroelectric layer <b>6</b> can be formed at a comparatively low temperature and it has a refractive index which is as low as that of the insulation films <b>8</b> and <b>10</b>, lowering in the photoelectric conversion efficiency caused by reflection can be suppressed. In addition, even if depolarization is caused by use of the solid state imaging device, the original polarization state can be restored by applying the voltage between the electrode and the substrate.</p>
