<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The instant disclosure relates generally to the MapReduce software framework and, more specifically, to feedback-based systems and method for processing incoming data using a plurality of mapper modules and reducer module(s).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Data analytics is the science of examining raw data in order to draw conclusions about that information. Data analytics is used in many sectors to improve decision-making. As the use of data analytics continues to grow, the volume of data to be analyzed grows as well. Furthermore, data is being stored longer and longer as the value of that data becomes increasingly appreciated.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Given the ever-increasing volume of data, and the heightened reliance on techniques, such as, for example, data analytics for sifting through it, tools have been developed to sort, analyze, and manipulate the data in an effort to make it more manageable. One such tool is MapReduce. MapReduce is a software framework introduced by Google Inc. in 2004 to support distributed computing on large data sets on clusters of computers. The framework is inspired by map and reduce functions commonly used in functional programming. MapReduce uses two primitive functions, &#x201c;Map&#x201d; and &#x201c;Reduce,&#x201d; to process incoming data.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring now to prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an existing system <b>100</b> for processing incoming data <b>102</b> in accordance with the MapReduce framework is illustrated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, incoming data <b>102</b> is broken-up into chunks, with each chunk being provided to one of a plurality of identical mapper modules <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>n</i>. The mapper modules <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>n </i>then perform processing on the incoming data <b>102</b>, such as, but not limited to, filtering, transformation, or aggregation. The mapper modules <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>n </i>then transmit the mapped data <b>108</b> to the reducer module(s), such as reducer module <b>106</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> only depicts two mapper modules <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>n </i>and a single reducer module <b>106</b>, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any number of mapper modules and reducer modules may be employed. For example, in one embodiment, there are fewer reducer modules than mapper modules. The one or more reducer modules (e.g., reducer module <b>106</b>) then process (e.g., aggregate) the mapped data <b>108</b> to provide reduced data <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, conventional systems (e.g., system <b>100</b>) for processing incoming data in accordance with the MapReduce framework are unidirectional. That is, in conventional systems the mapper modules transmit data to the reducer module(s), but the reducer module(s) do not transmit any data back to the mapper modules. The unidirectional nature with which existing systems process data in accordance with the MapReduce framework may result in less than optimal performance in many scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide techniques for processing incoming data using a plurality of mapper modules and reducer module(s), such that the reducer modules can transmit data back to the mapper modules.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The instant disclosure describes techniques and apparatuses for processing incoming data using a plurality of mapper modules and at least one reducer module. To this end, in one example, a system for processing incoming data is provided. The system includes a plurality of mapper modules and at least one reducer module in communication with at least one of the plurality of mapper modules. In this example, each mapper module is configured to process the incoming data to provide mapped data. Each at least one reducer module is configured to process the mapped data to provide reduced data. Further, the at least one reducer module is configured to generate a feedback message. The feedback message includes data describing a suggestive configuration value for at least one of the plurality of mapper modules to apply when processing the incoming data.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one example, at least one of the plurality of mapper modules is further configured to receive the feedback message and process the incoming data by applying the suggestive configuration value from the feedback message to the incoming data in order to provide feedback-influenced data. In another example, at least one of the plurality of mapper modules is configured to receive the feedback message and process the incoming data without applying the suggestive configuration value from the feedback message to the incoming data in order to provide non-feedback-influenced data. In still another example, at least one of the plurality of mapper modules is configured to receive the feedback message and (1) process the incoming data without applying the suggestive configuration value for a time-period and then (2) process the incoming data by applying the suggestive configuration value at the expiration of the time-period. As used herein, a time-period can include a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 2 ms), a relative amount of time (e.g., 2 ms after an event), or an amount of time tied to an operation (e.g., after two clock-cycles), or upon receipt of new incoming data.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one example, the at least one reducer module is further configured to receive the feedback-influenced mapped data and generate a new feedback message based on the feedback-influenced mapped data. In this example, the new feedback message includes data describing a new suggestive configuration value for at least one of the plurality of mapper modules to apply when processing the incoming data. In another example, the at least one reducer module is further configured to process the feedback-influenced mapped data to provide feedback-influenced reduced data.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, there are a variety of ways in which the feedback message and/or the new feedback message can be transmitted to at least one of the plurality of mapper modules. In one example, the at least one reducer module is configured to transmit the feedback message directly to at least one of the plurality of mapper modules. For example, this can be accomplished through the use of a name node module in communication with the at least one reducer module and the plurality of mapper modules. In this example, the at least one reducer module is configured to receive mapper module identification data from the name node module, wherein mapper module identification data includes data describing at least one mapper module of the plurality of mapper modules. Accordingly, the at least one reducer module is configured to transmit the feedback message directly to at least one of the plurality of mapper modules based on the mapper module identification data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another example where the name node module is in communication with the at least one reducer module and the plurality of mapper modules, the at least one reducer module may be further configured to transmit the feedback message to the name node module. The name node module is then configured to transmit the feedback message to at least one of the plurality of mapper modules.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one example, a messaging system module is in communication with the at least one reducer module and the plurality of mapper modules. In this example, the at least one reducer module is further configured to publish the feedback message to the messaging system module to provide a published feedback message. At least one of a plurality of mapper modules may be further configured to subscribe to the published feedback message to provide at least one subscribing mapper module. The messaging system module is configured to notify the at least one subscribing mapper module of the published feedback message and the at least one subscribing mapper module is configured to receive the published feedback message.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another example, at least one of the plurality of mapper modules includes a listener thread in communication with a worker thread. In this example, the listener thread is configured to receive the feedback message. The worker thread is configured to (1) process, during reception of the feedback message by the listener thread, the incoming data and (2) receive the suggestive configuration value of the feedback message from the listener thread of the same at least one mapper module.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Related methods and apparatuses for carrying out the aforementioned techniques are also disclosed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one example of a system <b>200</b> for processing incoming data <b>102</b> using a plurality of mapper modules and at least one reducer module is illustrated. In the illustrated example, system <b>200</b> includes mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>and reducer module <b>206</b>. While only two mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>204</b><i>n </i>and a single reducer module <b>206</b> are illustrated, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any number of mapper modules and reducer modules may be employed, provided that there are fewer reducer modules than mapper modules. In an embodiment, the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>and reducer module <b>206</b> may be implemented using Apache&#x2122; Hadoop&#x2122; running on one or more suitable processing devices as described below relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each mapper module (e.g., mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>204</b><i>n</i>) may be configured as a subscribing mapper module <b>504</b>, as discussed in additional detail below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Furthermore, each mapper module (e.g., mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>204</b><i>n</i>) may include a worker thread <b>328</b> and a listener thread <b>326</b>, as discussed below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In addition, each reducer module (e.g., reducer module <b>206</b>) may include a feedback message sender <b>324</b>, as discussed below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Although not illustrated is <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, those having skill in the art will also appreciate that the components used in the different architectures for delivering a feedback message <b>212</b> (or a new feedback message <b>216</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> may also be included in the system <b>200</b>. For example, the name node module <b>320</b> and/or the messaging system module <b>532</b> may be included within the system <b>200</b> in accordance with the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">System <b>200</b> operates as follows. Incoming data <b>102</b> is received by each mapper module (e.g., mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>204</b><i>n</i>). Specifically, the incoming data is broken-up into chunks, with a different chunk being received by each mapper module. As used herein, the incoming data <b>102</b> may include any type of digital or analog data. Furthermore, the incoming data <b>102</b> may be supplied from any suitable source, such as, but not limited to, one or more databases, data repositories, etc. In one example, the incoming data may include graph data describing a graph consisting of vertices and edges that connect the vertices, as known in the art. The mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>process (e.g., filter, transform, aggregate) the incoming data <b>102</b> to provide mapped data <b>108</b>. The reducer module <b>206</b> that is in communication with the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>processes (e.g., filters, transforms, aggregates) the mapped data <b>108</b> to provide reduced data <b>110</b>. Prior to, contemporaneous with, or following the production of the reduced data <b>110</b>, the reducer module <b>206</b> generates a feedback message <b>212</b>. The feedback message <b>212</b> includes data describing a suggestive configuration value (represented as element <b>327</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>) for the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>to apply when processing the incoming data <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Upon reception of the feedback message <b>212</b>, the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>process the incoming data <b>102</b> in one of several ways. In one embodiment, the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>process the incoming data <b>102</b> by applying the suggestive configuration value <b>327</b> from the feedback message <b>212</b> to the incoming data <b>102</b> to provide feedback-influenced mapped data <b>214</b>. For example, upon receiving the feedback message <b>212</b>, the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>may immediately update their configurations to apply the suggestive configuration value <b>327</b> in processing all subsequently received incoming data <b>102</b>. Techniques for modifying mapper modules are well known in the art. In another embodiment, upon receiving the feedback message <b>212</b>, the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>may retain their initial configuration and not apply the suggestive configuration value <b>327</b> in processing any subsequently received incoming data <b>102</b>. In still another embodiment, upon receiving the feedback message <b>212</b>, the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>may retain their initial configuration for a time-period. The mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>may then update their configurations to process the incoming data <b>102</b> at the expiration of the time-period. As used herein, a time-period can include a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 2 ms), a relative amount of time (e.g., 2 ms after an event), or an amount of time tied to an operation, such as a computing operation (e.g., after two clock-cycles), or upon receipt of new incoming data <b>102</b>. Furthermore, while the term &#x201c;configuration&#x201d; is used herein, it is recognized that the configurations (e.g., suggestive configuration value <b>327</b> and/or new suggestive configuration value <b>329</b>) could include any desirable parameter. For example, the configuration values could represent scaling factors, matching strings, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">By utilizing a suggestive configuration value, rather than a compulsory one, processing efficiencies may be gained. For example, if a compulsory configuration value were to be employed, one or more of the mapper modules (e.g., mapper module <b>204</b><i>a </i>and/or mapper module <b>204</b><i>n</i>) may need to restart the processing of the incoming data <b>102</b> by applying the compulsory configuration value to data that had been previously processed but not yet output. This may be an undesirable consequence in some circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, it is not necessary that all mapper modules update their configurations simultaneously upon reception of a feedback message <b>212</b> including the suggestive configuration value <b>327</b> (although the present disclosure recognizes that simultaneous configuration updates across all mapper modules may be desirable in some instances). For example, permitting each mapper module to update its configuration independently of the other mapper modules may improve the scalability of the system <b>200</b>. That is, if all mapper modules were required to update their configurations at the same time, a synchronization barrier would be added to the system <b>200</b>, which could inhibit the scalability of the system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">After the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>have reconfigured themselves based on the suggestive configuration value <b>327</b> of the feedback message <b>212</b>, they continue to process the incoming data <b>102</b> to provide feedback-influenced mapped data <b>214</b>. This feedback-influenced mapped data <b>214</b> may be received by the reducer module <b>206</b>. Following the reception of the feedback-influenced mapped data <b>214</b>, the reducer module <b>206</b> may generate a new feedback message <b>216</b> based on the feedback-influenced mapped data <b>214</b>. The new feedback message <b>216</b> includes data describing a new suggestive configuration value (represented as element <b>329</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>) for the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>to apply when processing the incoming data <b>102</b>. Furthermore, the reducer module <b>206</b> may process the feedback-influenced mapped data <b>214</b> to provide feedback-influenced reduced data <b>218</b>. Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this cycle of feedback messages and mapper module re-configurations could be repeated as often as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To understand the functionality of the system <b>200</b>, consider an example where the incoming data <b>102</b> comprises graph data describing a graph consisting of vertices and edges that connect the vertices. In this example, the graph data may be broken down into vertex data and edge data. Continuing, in this example, the goal of the data processing may be to list out the top 500 vertices having the greatest number of edges (each vertex may have one or more edges).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">First, the incoming graph data would be broken down into chunks, with each chunk being assigned to a different mapper module. For simplicity, assume that each mapper module is in an initialization state where it applies an initial configuration value in processing the graph data. The mapper modules will process the graph data based on their initial configuration value, and will filter out vertices having a number of edges less than the initial configuration value. The graph data representing the vertices having more edges than the initial configuration value (i.e., the mapped data) will be transmitted to the reducer module. The reducer module may then sort the mapped data to arrive at the 500 vertices having the most edges. The reducer module may then transmit a feedback message to the mapper modules establishing a suggestive configuration value for the mapper modules to apply when processing any subsequent incoming graph data. For example, the reduce function might set the suggestive configuration value to correspond to the number of edges associated with the vertex at 500th place. In this manner, the mapper modules that apply the suggestive configuration value will filter out all vertices containing fewer edges than the vertex at 500th place. This process may be repeated through as many iterations as desired in order to achieve the goal in mind. By progressively increasing the configuration value in this manner, the processing of the mapper modules and the reducer modules is made more efficient by reducing the number of vertices output by the mapper modules.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In order to achieve the functionality described above with respect to system <b>200</b>, the instant disclosure provides an extending programming model from the traditional MapReduce programming model. Table 1 below illustrates a generic example of an extended programming model for the mapper module and Table 2 below illustrates a generic example of an extended programming model for the reducer module:</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As illustrated by the above programming models, a reducer module sends a feedback message to a mapper module by calling a built-in function (FBMR.send) as needed. Note that, in this implementation, it is a programmer's responsibility to design an algorithm within the reducer module that computes a feedback message. This is because the feedback message will be application-specific.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The system <b>200</b> may then deliver the feedback message to the mapper module. Once the mapper module receives the feedback message, it updates it to the configuration variable. Once again, it is the programmer's responsibility to appropriately use the message (configuration.FBMR_message) in processing the input key/value pair (i.e., the incoming data <b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an architecture for delivering a feedback message from a reducer module to a mapper module in accordance with the instant disclosure is illustrated. For simplicity, a single mapper module is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). However, it is understood that the mechanisms illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> can be applied to any number of mapper modules. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the mapper module <b>304</b> includes a worker thread <b>328</b> and a listener thread <b>326</b>. The reducer module <b>306</b> includes a feedback message sender <b>324</b>. Techniques for implementing such threads <b>328</b>, <b>326</b> and the sender <b>324</b> are well known in the art. The feedback message sender <b>324</b> is configured to send a feedback message <b>212</b> (or a new feedback message <b>216</b>) directly to the mapper module <b>304</b> in this example. Specifically, the feedback message sender <b>324</b> of the reducer module <b>306</b> may transmit a feedback message <b>212</b> to the listener thread <b>326</b> of the mapper module. Because the mapper module <b>304</b> is divided into two separate threads (i.e., the worker thread <b>328</b> and the listener thread <b>326</b>) in this example, the listener thread <b>326</b> may receive the feedback message <b>212</b> (and hold it in queue) while the worker thread contemporaneously processes the incoming data <b>102</b>. Then, when desired, the listener thread <b>326</b> may pass the suggestive configuration value <b>327</b> (or the new suggestive configuration value <b>329</b>) of the feedback message <b>212</b> (or the new feedback message <b>216</b>) to the worker thread <b>328</b> via a shared variable.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an optional name node module <b>320</b> in communication with the reducer module <b>306</b>. In this example, the name node module <b>320</b> includes mapper module identification data <b>322</b> (e.g., a list of all of the mapper modules in the system). In this manner, the reducer module <b>306</b> is configured to receive the mapper module identification data <b>322</b> from the name node module <b>320</b>. The reducer module <b>306</b> may then transmit the feedback message <b>212</b> (or the new feedback message <b>216</b>) directly to the mapper module <b>304</b> based on the map identification data <b>322</b>. As the framework disclosed in the instant application can add or decommission mapper modules during processing of the incoming data <b>102</b>, this architecture permits the reducer modules to communicate with the name node module in order to check the up-to-date mapper module list.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another architecture for delivering a feedback message from a reducer module to a mapper module in accordance with the instant disclosure is illustrated. The architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> operates similarly to the architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; however, in this architecture the name node module <b>320</b> includes a feedback message relay module <b>430</b> configured to relay feedback messages <b>212</b>, <b>216</b> from the reducer module <b>306</b> to the mapper module <b>304</b>. This may be a desirable architecture given that the name node module <b>320</b> already includes the mapper module identification data <b>322</b> needed to identify which mapper module(s) should receive particular feedback messages <b>212</b>, <b>216</b>. The feedback message relay module <b>430</b> may receive the mapper module identification data <b>322</b> and use it to transmit the feedback messages <b>212</b>, <b>216</b> to the appropriate mapper module(s), such as mapper module <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, yet another architecture for delivering a feedback message from a reducer module to a mapper module in accordance with the instant disclosure is illustrated. The architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> operates similarly to the architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>; however, in this architecture the name node module <b>320</b> is replaced with a messaging system module <b>532</b>. In this architecture, the reducer module <b>306</b> is configured to publish the feedback messages <b>212</b>, <b>216</b> to the messaging system module <b>532</b> to provide one or more published feedback messages <b>534</b>. Additionally, in this architecture, the mapper module is depicted as a subscribing mapper module <b>504</b>. A subscribing mapper module, such as subscribing mapper module <b>504</b>, is configured to subscribe to one or more published feedback messages <b>534</b> by, for example, issuing a subscription request <b>536</b> to the messaging system module <b>532</b>. Accordingly, the messaging system module <b>532</b> is configured to notify the subscribing mapper module <b>504</b> of one or more published feedback messages <b>534</b> to which it subscribes, by transmitting a published feedback message notification <b>538</b> to the subscribing mapper module <b>504</b>. As such, the subscribing mapper module <b>504</b> is configured to receive (i.e., retrieve from the messaging system module <b>532</b> or receive via a transmission from the messaging system module <b>532</b>) the one or more published feedback messages <b>534</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment, the system <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is implemented using one or more suitably programmed processing devices, such as the processing device <b>600</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The processing device <b>600</b> may be used to implement, for example, one or more components of the system <b>200</b>, as described in greater detail above. Regardless, the processing device <b>600</b> includes one or more processors <b>602</b> coupled to a storage component <b>604</b>. The storage component <b>604</b>, in turn, includes stored executable instructions <b>616</b> and data <b>618</b>. In an embodiment, the processor <b>602</b> may include one or more devices such as microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, or combinations thereof capable of executing the stored instructions <b>616</b> and operating upon the stored data <b>618</b>. Likewise, the storage component <b>604</b> may include one or more devices such as volatile or nonvolatile memory including, but not limited to, random access memory (RAM) or read only memory (ROM). Further still, the storage component <b>604</b> may be embodied in a variety of forms, such as a hard drive, optical disc drive, floppy disc drive, etc. Processor and storage arrangements of the types illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are well known to those having ordinary skill in the art, for example, in the form of laptop, desktop, tablet, or server computers. In one embodiment, the processing techniques described herein are implemented as a combination of executable instructions and data within the storage component <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown, the processing device <b>600</b> may include one or more user input devices <b>606</b>, a display <b>608</b>, a peripheral interface <b>610</b>, other output devices <b>612</b>, and a network interface <b>614</b> in communication with the processor(s) <b>602</b>. The user input device <b>606</b> may include any mechanism for providing user input to the processor(s) <b>602</b>. For example, the user input device <b>606</b> may include a keyboard, a mouse, a touch screen, a microphone, a suitable voice recognition application, or any other means, whereby a user of the processing device <b>600</b> may provide input data to the processor <b>602</b>. The display <b>608</b> may include any conventional display mechanism such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), flat panel display, or any other display mechanism known to those having ordinary skill in the art. In an embodiment, the display <b>608</b>, in conjunction with suitable stored instructions <b>616</b>, may be used to implement a graphical user interface. Implementation of a graphical user interface in this manner is well known to those having ordinary skill in the art. The peripheral interface <b>610</b> may include the hardware, firmware and/or software necessary for communication with various peripheral devices, such as media drives (e.g., magnetic disk or optical disk drives), other processing devices, or any other input source used in connection with the instant techniques. Likewise, the other output device(s) <b>612</b> may optionally include similar media drive mechanisms, other processing devices, or other output destinations capable of providing information to a user of the processing device <b>600</b>, such as speakers, LEDs, tactile outputs, etc. Finally, the network interface <b>614</b> may include hardware, firmware, and/or software that allows the processor(s) <b>602</b> to communicate with other devices via wired or wireless networks, whether local or wide area, private or public, as known in the art. For example, such networks may include the World Wide Web or Internet, or private enterprise networks, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a flow chart illustrating a method for processing incoming data using a plurality of mapper modules and at least one reducer module is provided. While the processing device <b>600</b> is a form for implementing the processing described herein (including that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other, functionally equivalent techniques may be employed. For example, rather than using a single processing device <b>600</b>, the functionality described herein may be separated over multiple processing devices. Furthermore, as known in the art, some or all of the functionalities implemented via executable instructions may also be implemented using firmware and/or hardware devices such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), programmable logic arrays, state machines, etc. Further still, other implementations of the processing device <b>600</b> may include a greater or lesser number of components than those illustrated. Once again, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the wide number of variations that may be used is this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Beginning at block <b>700</b>, incoming data is processed to provide mapped data. This processing may be accomplished by, for example, the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. At block <b>702</b>, the mapped data is processed to provide reduced data. This processing may be accomplished by, for example, the reducer module <b>206</b>. At block <b>704</b>, a feedback message is generated. This may be accomplished by, for example, the reducer module <b>206</b>. The feedback message includes data describing a suggestive configuration value to be applied when processing the incoming data. At optional step <b>706</b>, the incoming data is processed by applying the suggestive configuration value from the feedback message to provide feedback-influenced mapped data. This processing may be accomplished by, for example, the mapper modules <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>n</i>. At optional block <b>708</b>, a new feedback message is generated based on the feedback-influenced mapped data. This may be accomplished by, for example, the reducer module <b>206</b>. The new feedback message includes data describing a new suggestive configuration value to be applied when processing the incoming data.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While particular embodiments have been shown and described, those skilled in the art will appreciate that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the instant teachings.
