<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further to the brief description provided above and associated textual detail of each of the figures, the following description provides additional details of example embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Embodiments are directed to interactive gaming and broadcast sports. More particularly, example embodiments of the present invention are directed interactive online gaming during broadcast sporting events. For example, an interactive online game may include any game including sports fantasy games. Example embodiments include methods and interfaces for interactive online gaming which provide an enriched user experience geared towards providing fulfilling gaming experiences including group gaming, fantasy role and sports gaming, and other similar experiences based upon a live broadcast event.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, an interactive game may be based upon a live sporting event or entertainment event. Prior to broadcast of the event, a series of questions and/or other prompts may be established based upon the event. These questions and prompts may be organized, stored, and served to a user or group of users before, during, and after the event, thereby providing an immersive viewing experience which enriches a user's perception of the event and may provide more satisfaction as compared to gaming and viewing as separate experiences.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning now to the several figures, example embodiments are described in more detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example interactive gaming system, according to an example embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>10</b> includes an interactive gaming server <b>11</b>. The server <b>11</b> may be any server or computing apparatus configured to process program instructions disposed to serve a plurality of users with an interactive game based on the methods described herein. For example, an appropriate server may be a web server or server system configured to provide webpage information to user terminals (e.g., terminals <b>14</b>-<b>16</b>) communicating over network <b>13</b>. The network <b>13</b> may be a communication network such as the Internet or other suitable network. The network <b>133</b> may facilitate transmission of information between the terminals <b>14</b>-<b>16</b> and the server <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The system <b>10</b> further includes broadcast event server <b>12</b> in communication with the network <b>13</b> and the server <b>11</b>. The broadcast event server <b>12</b> may be any suitable server or server system configured to provide broadcast event information. For example, the server <b>12</b> may provide online streaming of a live or broadcast event to terminals <b>14</b>-<b>16</b> and/or provide broadcast event information to server <b>11</b>. However, it should be noted that the broadcast event server <b>12</b> may also be embodied as a television service provider system rather than a typical web server. Thus, the broadcast event server <b>12</b> may also broadcast an event over conventional channels to televisions or other similar devices, in addition to terminals <b>14</b>-<b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to example embodiments, broadcast events provided by the server <b>12</b> may be interpreted to establish an interactive game for a plurality of users at terminals <b>14</b>-<b>16</b>. The interactive game may be tailored to a typical or target audience. For example, a sports-based game may be established based on a particular sporting event. Further, a movie-trivia game may be established based on a particular movie being broadcast or an awards ceremony being broadcast. As broadcast event information is readily available at server <b>11</b>, new questions or portions of the interactive game may be established on-the-fly, during broadcast of the event, thereby providing a more immersive experience. The actual game may be accessed by a plurality of users as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example interactive gaming method, according to an example embodiment of the present invention. The method <b>200</b> includes receiving a set of user credentials at block <b>21</b>. The set of user credentials may include credentials identifying a user, a user account, type of user, location of a user, or any suitable combination of the same. For example, the set of credentials may include a username and password used to verify a user account. The set of credentials may further include information associated with the username and password. Thus, block <b>21</b> includes receiving user information associated with a user including any user information stored or associated with a user's account.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The method <b>20</b> further includes identifying broadcast events based on the user credentials at block <b>22</b>. For example, identifying the broadcast events may include querying a database of past, present, and future events to determine if any events are applicable to the user based on the credentials. An applicable event may include a local event, an event matching a user's preferences, an event a particular user has registered to view, or any other suitable events.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Upon identifying the applicable events, the method <b>20</b> includes providing event information to the user at block <b>23</b>. Providing the event information may include rendering, at a user terminal, a webpage or other interface graphically or textually identifying events with available interactive games. Upon providing, the method <b>20</b> includes receiving user selections for the events at block <b>24</b>. For example, a user may select one or more available events at the rendered webpage or interface. Subsequently, the method <b>20</b> includes initiating interactive online content based on the selections at block <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, example embodiments of the present invention include identifying a user through a set of user credentials, identifying applicable and available broadcast events based on the credentials, providing the events' information to a user, and initiating interactive online content based on a user's selections of the provided events. Initiating interactive online content may include initiating and/or serving an interactive online game to a user. The interactive online game may be based upon the actual event and may be determined before and during the actual event, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example interactive gaming method, according to an example embodiment of the present invention. The method <b>30</b> includes identifying a broadcast event at block <b>31</b>. The broadcast event may be identified as an event which may draw a desire for interactive online gaming. Alternatively, the event may be identified by a user as a selection in method <b>20</b>. In response to the identifying, the method <b>30</b> includes generating interactive online questions and/or content based upon the event at block <b>32</b>. For example, sports-related or player-related questions may be chosen/generated based on a type of sporting event and/or teams associated with the event. The content may be organized based on the event at block <b>33</b>, and may be stored for presentation to a user during the broadcast event at block <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The content may be organized based upon the type of event, based on a duration of the event, or based on other suitable attributes. For example, content may be organized into segments relating to known portions of an event, such as innings in a baseball game or categories in an awards ceremony. Therefore, during broadcast of those portions of the event or immediately prior to broadcasting of those portions, the content may be provided to users engaging in the online game. The questions and content may vary for each broadcast event and may have a different value (e.g., the more difficult the question, the higher point value). Further, new content may be continuously generated and/or chosen based upon the situations occurring in the broadcast event. The new content may also be presented to users based upon the event, in synch with the event, or in response to different portions of the event being currently broadcast. Therefore, example embodiments provide on-the-fly content to users which may be updated periodically or continuously during a broadcast event, thereby improving a user's experience. The content may be provided as a series of questions or prompts related to the event, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example interactive gaming method, according to an example embodiment of the present invention. The method <b>40</b> includes transmitting an online question related to a broadcast event to a user at block <b>41</b>. The online question may be provided through a webpage or web interface served by an interactive online server as described above. The online question may be provided before or during a portion or segment of an associated broadcast event. For example, a question or series of questions related to a current baseball player may be provided immediately before or during the current baseball player's position at bat. The question may be related to a history of the player, or related to an expected outcome of the player's performance (e.g., if the player strikes a homerun).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The method <b>40</b> further includes receiving initial user answers to the question(s) provided at block <b>42</b>. Correct answers may be tallied at block <b>43</b> and a user's rank may be established based on a pool of users at block <b>44</b>. The pool of users may include a portion of users engaging in the interactive online game. The pool of users may be related to the user as friends or users with similar interests. Thereafter, the ranking results may be displayed for the user at block <b>45</b>. Thus, a user interacting with the online questions during an associated broadcast event may view gaming results compared to other users on-the-fly based on questions answered by the user. The user may continue to interact for the duration of the broadcast event.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be appreciated that as users may interact during a broadcast event, and that as questions or prompts may be provided based upon actual circumstances in the event (e.g., overtime, player statistics, etc.), additional interaction from users may be promoted through provision of questions within the actual broadcast event. Thus, in combination with questions being provided through a website or interface, a spokesperson or game representative may actually be broadcast live (or pre-recorded) in the actual event feed prompting users for answers. A user may input answers through the interactive online gaming website for tallying score and rankings as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition to a simple sequence of interactive questions, bonus or special questions may also be provided, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example interactive gaming method, according to an example embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, the method <b>50</b> includes generating a bonus question at block <b>51</b>. The generated bonus question(s) may be provided through the broadcast event and/or through the interactive online gaming system. The method <b>50</b> further includes receiving user answers at block <b>52</b> to determine and award winners at blocks <b>53</b>-<b>54</b>. It should be understood that prizes may also be awarded during normal game-play as described above in addition to bonus question rounds or segments described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Furthermore, a live announcer or on-air talent may announce the winner's name (e.g., during a sign-off period for the event, further enhancing a user's experience.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As described above, example embodiments of the present invention provide interactive online gaming based on broadcast events which promote a rich user experience as compared to gaming and event viewing alone. The interactive online gaming is facilitated through user interfaces provided from an interactive online gaming server of an interactive online gaming system.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example interactive gaming interface, according to an example embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, the interface <b>60</b> includes a plurality of interface portions representing a broadcast event and users engaging with the interactive online gaming system. Broadcast event statistics including gaming statistics, occurrences in the broadcast event, user information, and or other information may be displayed through at least one broadcast event statistics graphical portion <b>61</b>. Further, interactive communications including inter-user communications, messaging, blog or questions posts, and other suitable information may be displayed through at least one messaging graphical portion <b>62</b>. Moreover, participant ranking and gaming results may be displayed through at least one results graphical portion <b>64</b>. Even further, additional or current questions may be provided through at least one interaction graphical portion <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Additionally, advertising and/or promotions may be provided through at least one advertising graphical portion <b>63</b>. Therefore, example embodiments provide a variety of manners in which to incorporate sponsorships, and traditional &#x26; interactive banner advertisements.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be understood that although illustrated in a particular format and orientation, the graphical portions described above should not be so limited. For example, more or less graphical portions may be arranged according to any applicable interactive game.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Hereinafter, a more detailed arrangement of the graphical portions described above is provided with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-17</figref>, in which a plurality of renderings of a gaming interface <b>100</b>, are illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the interface <b>100</b> includes header <b>101</b> displaying information related to the interactive online content. The header <b>101</b> may include a plurality of navigation portions and tabs configured to allow user access to different graphical portions of the interface <b>100</b>. The interface <b>100</b> may allow an online offering that coincides with available events broadcast nationally and regionally. This may include regular programming, special events, sports games, and associated playoff games. Using the interface <b>100</b>, users may participate in as many games as they choose. As described above, live scoring may be used throughout the game so the participant can track progress online during the broadcast event.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The interface <b>100</b> further includes informational section <b>102</b> displaying information related to a current interactive online game or available games through portions <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, and <b>124</b>. For example, the next four unfinished and non-postponed broadcast events on the sporting schedule are shown in portions <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, and <b>124</b>. Games may be listed from left to right, top to bottom according to scheduled start date then scheduled start time.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each available event displayed in portions <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, and <b>124</b> includes event and game information. Furthermore, game and/or event status may be displayed (e.g., delayed, date/time, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A &#x201c;Play&#x201d; button may always present in portions <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, and <b>124</b> such that a user can make picks for the associated game, review picks during the game, or review picks after the game.
