<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0060806, filed on Jun. 22, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Embodiments relate to a heterocyclic compound, and an organic light-emitting diode and a flat display device including the heterocyclic compound, and more particularly, to a heterocyclic compound that is suitable for use as a light-emitting material or electron transporting material included in an organic light-emitting diode, an organic light-emitting diode including the heterocyclic compound, and a flat display device including the organic light-emitting diode. The organic light-emitting diode including an organic layer including the heterocyclic compound may have a low driving voltage, high luminescence efficiency, and long lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Organic light emitting diodes are self-emission devices that have a wide viewing angle, a high contrast ratio, a short response time, and excellent brightness, driving voltage, and response speed characteristics, thus enabling the generation of multi-color images.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">In an organic light-emitting diode, an anode may be formed on a substrate, and a hole transport layer, an emission layer, an electron transport layer, and a cathode may be sequentially formed in this stated order on the anode. In this regard, the hole transport layer, the emission layer, and the electron transport layer may be organic films including organic compounds. When a voltage is applied between the anode and the cathode, holes injected from the anode pass the hole transport layer to the emission layer, and electrons injected from the cathode pass the electron transport layer to the emission layer. The holes and electrons, which are carriers, are recombined in the emission layer to generate excitons, which then change from an excited state to a ground state, thereby generating light.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">An emission layer material of an organic light-emitting diode may include anthracene derivatives. An electron transport material may include Alq<sub>3</sub>, TBPi, PBD, PF-6P, PyPySPyPy, etc. An organic light-emitting diode may use a 2 or 3 equivalent amount of a compound of phenyl anthracene. However, a device using the 2 or 3 equivalent amount of the compound of phenyl anthracene may have two or three anthracenes covalently linked. Thus, an energy gap may be narrow and color purity of blue light emission may be low. Also, the 2 or 3 equivalent amount of the compound of phenyl anthracene may be oxidized and thus, purification thereof may be difficult. Accordingly, organic light-emitting diodes using either an anthracene compound in which naphthalene is substituted at sites 1 and 9 of an anthracene group or a diphenylanthracene compound in which an aryl group is substituted at an m-site of a phenyl group may be used. However, such organic light-emitting diodes may have low luminescence efficiency. Also, an organic light-emitting device may use a monoanthracene derivative substituted with a naphthalene. However, such an organic light-emitting diode may not be practical due to its low luminescence efficiency of about 1 cd/A. Also, an organic light-emitting diode may include a compound having the structure of phenyl anthracene. However, the compound may be substituted with an aryl group at an m-site thereof. Thus, the compound may have a luminescence efficiency as low as about 2 cd/A, although its heat resistance is high.</p>

<p id="p-0245" num="0243">Referring to Table 1 above, it may be seen that when the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 was used as an emission layer material (host, dopant) or an electron transport layer material of an organic light-emitting diode, the driving voltage of the corresponding organic light-emitting diodes decreased by 1 V or more compared to when ADN, DPVBi, and Alq<sub>3</sub>, which are known materials, were used. In addition, efficiency of the organic light-emitting diodes manufactured according to Examples 1 to 21 substantially increased.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0244">For example, it may be seen that, in comparison with Comparative Example 1, the driving voltages of the organic light-emitting diodes manufactured according to Examples 1 to 5 in which the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 was used as a host decreased by 1 V, and efficiency and lifetime thereof also improved; efficiencies of the organic light-emitting diodes manufactured according to Examples 6 to 11 in which the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 was used as a dopant increased by 150% or more, and lifetimes thereof also increased; the driving voltages of the organic light-emitting diodes manufactured according to Examples 12 to 16 in which the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 was used as the electron transporting material decreased by 2 V or more. Also, the driving voltages of the organic light-emitting diodes manufactured according to Examples 17 to 21 in which the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 was used as a host or dopant of an emission layer, or as a host or dopant of the emission layer and an electron transporting material decreased by 2 V compared to Comparative Example 1, and efficiency thereof increased by about 200% and lifetime thereof increased by 100% or more.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0245">From the results described above, it may be seen that a light-emitting diode including the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 device has a low driving voltage, high luminescence efficiency, and long lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0246">The heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may have excellent emission characteristics and charge transport characteristics. An organic light-emitting diode including the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may have a low driving voltage, high luminescence efficiency, and long lifetime, and thus a flat display device including the organic light-emitting diode has an excellent performance.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0247">While the present invention has been particularly shown, and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form, and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit, and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.</p>
