<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a vibrating device and an electronic apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Heretofore, vibrating devices in which a sensor chip and an IC (Integrated Circuit) are disposed within a casing have been known (for example, refer to JP-A-2006-261560 (Patent Document 1)).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A vibrating device (semiconductor package) of Patent Document 1 has a case body having a bottom plate and a frame-like side wall disposed at a peripheral edge portion of an upper surface of the bottom plate. A sensor chip such as an acceleration sensor, a signal processing chip, and a memory chip are mounted on the upper surface of the bottom plate so as to be located in a chip accommodating space formed in the interior of the case body.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, in the vibrating device of Patent Document 1, the signal processing chip and the memory chip are arranged to be overlapped with each other in the thickness direction, and the sensor chip is arranged in parallel next to them. The bottom plate is designed such that the thickness of a sensor chip mounting area in which the sensor chip is mounted is smaller than that of a signal processing chip mounting area in which the signal processing chip and the memory chip are arranged to be overlapped with each other. In other words, the bottom plate has a shape in which one portion (portion corresponding to the sensor chip mounting area) of the upper surface is recessed lower than the other portion (portion corresponding to the signal processing chip mounting area). In the recessed portion, the sensor chip is mounted. In the vibrating device of Patent Document 1, by mounting the sensor chip having a thickness greater than that of the signal processing chip or the memory chip in the recessed portion, miniaturization (reduction in profile) of the vibrating device is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the vibrating device of Patent Document 1, however, the thickness of the sensor chip mounting area of the bottom plate is reduced, and the sensor chip is mounted in the thickness-reduced portion. The thickness-reduced portion is easy to deform (easy to strain) due to an external force or heat, compared to the other portion (signal processing chip mounting area). Then, due to deformation occurring in the portion, an unexpected external force (stress) is applied to the sensor chip, thereby reducing detection accuracy of the sensor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this manner, the vibrating device of Patent Document 1 has a problem that it is impossible to achieve miniaturization while preventing a reduction in characteristics.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An advantage of some aspects of the invention is to provide a vibrating device which can achieve miniaturization while preventing a reduction in characteristics of a vibrating element due to strain, and an electronic apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Application Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This application example of the invention is directed to a vibrating device including: a package having an accommodating space in the interior thereof; and a vibrating element and an IC chip accommodated in the accommodating space, wherein the package has a bottom portion having an IC chip mounting area and a vibrating element mounting area, the IC chip mounting area including an IC chip mounting surface on which the IC chip is mounted, the vibrating element mounting area being disposed in parallel with the IC chip mounting area and including a vibrating element mounting surface on which the vibrating element is mounted, the thickness of the bottom portion is smaller in the IC chip mounting area than in the vibrating element mounting area, and the IC chip mounting surface is located closer to a rear surface side of the bottom portion than the vibrating element mounting surface, the rear surface side being with respect to the mounting surfaces of the IC chip and the vibrating element.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With this configuration, it is possible to provide a vibrating device which can achieve miniaturization (reduction in profile) while preventing a reduction in characteristics of a vibrating element due to strain.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Application Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the vibrating device according to the above application example of the invention, it is preferable that the thickness of the vibrating element is smaller than that of the IC chip.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With this configuration, the vibrating device can be further miniaturized (reduced in profile).</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Application Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the vibrating device according to the above application example of the invention, it is preferable that the vibrating element is supported at both sides thereof on the vibrating element mounting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With this configuration, the held state and vibration characteristics of the vibrating element are stabilized.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Application Example 4</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the vibrating device according to the above application example of the invention, it is preferable that the bottom portion has a recess which is opened in the vibrating element mounting surface and prevents contact with the vibrating element.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With this configuration, it is possible to effectively prevent or suppress breakage and damage of the vibrating element caused by contact between the vibrating element mounting surface and the vibrating element due to an impact such as dropping.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Application Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the vibrating device according to the above application example of the invention, it is preferable that the vibrating element has a vibrating portion which vibrates, and that the vibrating element mounting surface includes, in the planar view of the bottom portion, a recess which includes in the interior thereof at least one portion of the vibrating portion.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With this configuration, the recess can be efficiently formed, and a reduction in rigidity of the vibrating element mounting area can be prevented or suppressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Application Example 6</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the vibrating device according to the above application example of the invention, it is preferable that the bottom portion has a regulating portion which regulates displacement of the vibrating element toward the thickness direction.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With this configuration, excessive deformation of the vibrating element can be prevented, so that breakage and damage of the vibrating element can be prevented or suppressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Application Example 7</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the vibrating device according to the above application example of the invention, it is preferable that at least one portion of the regulating portion faces a base portion of the vibrating element.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With this configuration, excessive deformation of the vibrating element can be prevented, and also influence on vibration characteristics can be reduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Application Example 8</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the vibrating device according to the above application example of the invention, it is preferable that the vibrating device further includes a buffer layer disposed between the vibrating element mounting surface and the vibrating element.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With this configuration, when the vibrating element is greatly displaced due to excessive deformation in the thickness direction, the vibrating element is brought into contact with the buffer layer and the impact is absorbed and relieved. Therefore, breakage and damage of the vibrating element can be prevented or suppressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Application Example 9</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the vibrating device according to the above application example of the invention, it is preferable that a through-hole which communicates between the interior and exterior of the accommodating space is disposed in the bottom portion, and that the through-hole is disposed, in the planar view of the bottom portion, on the side opposite to the vibrating element via the IC chip.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With this configuration, it is possible to more reliably prevent or suppress a change in characteristics of the vibrating element due to strain.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Application Example 10</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the vibrating device according to the above application example of the invention, it is preferable that the through-hole is disposed in a thicker area of the bottom portion than the IC chip mounting area.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although a gyro element is used as a vibrating element in the vibrating device <b>1</b> of the embodiment, a vibrating element to be used is not limited to a gyro element. For example, an acceleration sensor, an AT vibrator (oscillator), or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Hereinafter, these will be sequentially described in detail.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Gyro Element <b>2</b></p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Hereinafter, the gyro element <b>2</b> will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a plan view of an upper surface seen from above (a lid <b>7</b> side), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a plan view (perspective view) of a lower surface seen from above. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, electrodes and terminals are hatched for convenience of description. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, illustrations of supporting portions, beams, electrodes, and the like are omitted for convenience of description.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The gyro element <b>2</b> is a so-called &#x201c;in-plane detection-type&#x201d; sensor which detects an angular velocity about the z-axis. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the gyro element <b>2</b> is composed of a vibrating reed <b>21</b>, and a plurality of electrodes, wirings, and terminals formed on the surfaces of the vibrating reed <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The vibrating reed <b>21</b> is of a so-called double-T-type. The vibrating reed <b>21</b> can be composed of a piezoelectric material such as quartz crystal, lithium tantalate, or lithium niobate. However, quartz crystal is preferable among them. With this configuration, the vibrating reed <b>21</b> which can provide excellent vibration characteristics (frequency characteristics) is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The vibrating reed <b>21</b> extends in the xy plane and has its thickness in the z-axis direction. The vibrating reed <b>21</b> has a base portion <b>22</b> located at the center, a pair of detecting vibration arms <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> each extending outwardly from the base portion <b>22</b> in the y-axis direction, a pair of coupling arms <b>241</b> and <b>242</b> each extending outwardly from the base portion <b>22</b> in the x-axis direction, a pair of driving vibration arms <b>251</b> and <b>252</b> each extending outwardly from a tip portion of the coupling arm <b>241</b> in the y-axis direction, and a pair of driving vibration arms <b>253</b> and <b>254</b> each extending outwardly from a tip portion of the coupling arm <b>242</b> in the y-axis direction. Moreover, the vibrating reed <b>21</b> has a pair of supporting portions <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> arranged to face each other via the base portion <b>22</b> in the y-axis direction and four beams <b>271</b>, <b>272</b>, <b>273</b>, and <b>274</b> coupling the supporting portions <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> with the base portion <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At a tip portion of each of the detecting vibration arms <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> and the driving vibration arms <b>251</b> to <b>254</b>, a weight portion which is substantially quadrilateral and has a width greater than that thereof on its base-end side is formed. By disposing the weight portion, detection sensitivity of the gyro element <b>2</b> for angular velocity is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The supporting portions <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> each extend in the x-axis direction. The other portions constituting the vibrating reed <b>21</b> are located between these supporting portions <b>261</b> and <b>262</b>. The supporting portion <b>261</b> is coupled with the base portion <b>22</b> via the beams <b>271</b> and <b>272</b>. The supporting portion <b>262</b> is coupled with the base portion <b>22</b> via the beams <b>273</b> and <b>274</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The beam <b>271</b> passes through between the detecting vibration arm <b>231</b> and the driving vibration arm <b>251</b> to couple the supporting portion <b>261</b> with the base portion <b>22</b>. The beam <b>272</b> passes through between the detecting vibration arm <b>231</b> and the driving vibration arm <b>253</b> to couple the supporting portion <b>261</b> with the base portion <b>22</b>. The beam <b>273</b> passes through between the detecting vibration arm <b>232</b> and the driving vibration arm <b>252</b> to couple the supporting portion <b>262</b> with the base portion <b>22</b>. The beam <b>274</b> passes through between the detecting vibration arm <b>232</b> and the driving vibration arm <b>254</b> to couple the supporting portion <b>262</b> with the base portion <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The beams <b>271</b>, <b>272</b>, <b>273</b>, and <b>274</b> each have a serpentine portion (S-shaped portion) which extends in the y-axis direction while reciprocating in the x-axis direction, thereby having elasticity in the x-axis direction and the y-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Moreover, since the beams <b>271</b>, <b>272</b>, <b>273</b>, and <b>274</b> each have an elongated shape with the serpentine portion, the beams <b>271</b>, <b>272</b>, <b>273</b>, and <b>274</b> have elasticity in all directions.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Therefore, even when an external impact is applied, an effect of absorbing the impact is provided by the beams <b>271</b>, <b>272</b>, <b>273</b>, and <b>274</b>. Therefore, it is possible to reduce or suppress detection noise due to the impact.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The configuration of the vibrating reed <b>21</b> has been described so far. On the surfaces of the vibrating reed <b>21</b>, the plurality of electrodes, wirings, and terminals are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Specifically, a detecting signal electrode <b>281</b> is formed on upper and lower surfaces of the detecting vibration arm <b>231</b>. Similarly, a detecting signal electrode <b>281</b> is formed on upper and lower surfaces of the detecting vibration arm <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The pair of detecting signal electrodes <b>281</b> formed on the detecting vibration arm <b>231</b> are electrically connected, via wirings (not shown) formed on the surfaces of the vibrating reed <b>21</b>, to detecting signal terminals <b>291</b><i>a </i>formed on the supporting portion <b>261</b>. The pair of detecting signal electrodes <b>281</b> formed on the detecting vibration arm <b>232</b> are electrically connected, via wirings (not shown) formed on the surfaces of the vibrating reed <b>21</b>, to detecting signal terminals <b>291</b><i>b </i>formed on the supporting portion <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Moreover, a detecting ground electrode <b>282</b> is formed on side surfaces of the detecting vibration arm <b>231</b> and upper and lower surfaces of the weight portion of the detecting vibration arm <b>231</b>. Similarly, a detecting ground electrode <b>282</b> is formed also on side surfaces of the detecting vibration arm <b>232</b> and upper and lower surfaces of the weight portion of the detecting vibration arm <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The pair of detecting ground electrodes <b>282</b> formed on the detecting vibration arm <b>231</b> are electrically connected, via wirings (now shown) formed on the surfaces of the vibrating reed <b>21</b>, to detecting ground terminals <b>292</b><i>a </i>formed on the supporting portion <b>261</b>. The pair of detecting ground electrodes <b>282</b> formed on the detecting vibration arm <b>232</b> are electrically connected, via wirings (not shown) formed on the surfaces of the vibrating reed <b>21</b>, to detecting ground terminals <b>292</b><i>b </i>formed on the supporting portion <b>262</b>. The detecting ground electrode <b>282</b> has a potential serving as a ground with respect to the detecting signal electrode <b>281</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">By forming the detecting signal electrodes <b>281</b> and the detecting ground electrodes <b>282</b> with the arrangement described above, detecting vibration generated in the detecting vibration arm <b>231</b> appears as electric charge between the detecting signal electrode <b>281</b> and the detecting ground electrode <b>282</b> formed on the detecting vibration arm <b>231</b>, and can be extracted as a signal from the detecting signal terminal <b>291</b><i>a </i>and the detecting ground terminal <b>292</b><i>a </i>formed on the supporting portion <b>261</b>. Moreover, detecting vibration generated in the detecting vibration arm <b>232</b> appears as electric charge between the detecting signal electrode <b>281</b> and the detecting ground electrode <b>282</b> formed on the detecting vibration arm <b>232</b>, and can be extracted as a signal from the detecting signal terminal <b>291</b><i>b </i>and the detecting ground terminal <b>292</b><i>b </i>formed on the supporting portion <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Moreover, a driving signal electrode <b>283</b> is formed on upper and lower surfaces of the driving vibration arm <b>251</b>. Similarly, a driving signal electrode <b>283</b> is formed also on upper and lower surfaces of the driving vibration arm <b>252</b>. Moreover, a driving signal electrode <b>283</b> is formed also on side surfaces of the driving vibration arm <b>253</b> and upper and lower surfaces of the weight portion of the driving vibration arm <b>253</b>. Similarly, a driving signal electrode <b>283</b> is formed also on side surfaces of the driving vibration arm <b>254</b> and upper and lower surfaces of the weight portion of the driving vibration arm <b>254</b>. These plurality of driving signal electrodes <b>283</b> are electrically connected, via wirings (not shown) formed on the surfaces of the vibrating reed <b>21</b>, to driving signal terminals <b>293</b><i>a </i>formed on the supporting portion <b>261</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Moreover, a driving ground electrode <b>284</b> is formed on side surfaces of the driving vibration arm <b>251</b> and upper and lower surfaces of the weight portion of the driving vibration arm <b>251</b>. Similarly, a driving ground electrode <b>284</b> is formed also on side surfaces of the driving vibration arm <b>252</b> and upper and lower surfaces of the weight portion of the driving vibration arm <b>252</b>. Moreover, a driving ground electrode <b>284</b> is formed also on upper and lower surfaces of the driving vibration arm <b>253</b>. Similarly, a driving ground electrode <b>284</b> is formed also on upper and lower surfaces of the driving vibration arm <b>254</b>. These plurality of driving ground electrodes <b>284</b> are electrically connected, via wirings (not shown) formed on the surfaces of the vibrating reed <b>21</b>, to driving ground terminals <b>293</b><i>b </i>formed on the supporting portion <b>262</b>. The driving ground electrode <b>284</b> has a potential serving as a ground with respect to the driving signal electrode <b>283</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the driving signal electrodes <b>283</b> and the driving ground electrodes <b>284</b> are formed with the arrangement described above, an electric field is generated between the driving signal electrode <b>283</b> and the driving ground electrode <b>284</b> formed on each of the driving vibration arms <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b>, and <b>254</b> by applying a driving signal between the driving signal terminal <b>293</b><i>a </i>and the driving ground terminal <b>293</b><i>b</i>, thereby making it possible to drive and vibrate each of the driving vibration arms <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b>, and <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For these electrodes, terminals, and wirings, for example, one obtained by applying gold plating to an under layer formed on the surfaces of the vibrating reed <b>21</b> and composed of chromium can be used. With this configuration, adhesion between the electrodes or the like and the vibrating reed <b>21</b> is improved, so that the reliability of the gyro element <b>2</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The gyro element <b>2</b> having the configuration described above detects an angular velocity &#x3c9; about the z-axis as follows. In the gyro element <b>2</b>, when an electric field is generated between the driving signal electrode <b>283</b> and the driving ground electrode <b>284</b> in a state where the angular velocity &#x3c9; is not applied, the driving vibration arms <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b>, and <b>254</b> perform bending vibration in directions shown by double-headed arrows A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. In this case, since the driving vibration arms <b>251</b> and <b>252</b> and the driving vibration arms <b>253</b> and <b>254</b> vibrate plane-symmetrically with respect to the yz plane passing through a central point G (center of gravity G), the base portion <b>22</b>, the coupling arms <b>241</b> and <b>242</b>, and the detecting vibration arms <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> hardly vibrate.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the angular velocity Ct) about the z-axis is applied to the gyro element <b>2</b> in a state of performing this driving vibration, the gyro element <b>2</b> vibrates as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. That is, the Coriolis force in directions of double-headed arrows B acts on the driving vibration arms <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b>, and <b>254</b> and the coupling arms <b>241</b> and <b>242</b>, and in response to vibration in the directions of the double-headed arrows B, detecting vibration in directions of double-headed arrows C is excited. Then, the strain of the detecting vibration arms <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> caused by this vibration is detected by the detecting signal electrode <b>281</b> and the detecting ground electrode <b>282</b> to obtain the angular velocity &#x3c9;.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">IC Chip</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The IC chip <b>3</b> is an electron device formed by integrating a driving circuit (oscillator circuit) which drives (oscillates) the gyro element <b>2</b>, a detector circuit including a charge amplifier, and the like. That is, the IC chip <b>3</b> is an electron device which outputs an electric signal to the driving signal electrode <b>283</b> of the gyro element <b>2</b> and receives and processes an electric signal from the detecting signal electrode <b>281</b> to obtain the angular velocity &#x3c9; about the z-axis.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Package</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The package <b>4</b> accommodates the gyro element <b>2</b> and the IC chip. The package <b>4</b> has, in the planar view thereof (the xy-plane view), substantially a rectangular shape extending in the x-axis direction, and accommodates the gyro element <b>2</b> and the IC chip <b>3</b> in a state where they are arranged side by side in the x-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the package <b>4</b> has a base <b>10</b> having a recess opened in its upper surface and the lid <b>7</b> bonded to the base so as to cover the opening of the recess. The base <b>10</b> has a plate-like bottom plate (bottom portion) <b>5</b> and a frame-like side wall <b>6</b> disposed at a peripheral edge portion of an upper surface of the bottom plate <b>5</b>. The package <b>4</b> has an accommodating space <b>4</b><i>a </i>in the interior thereof. Within the accommodating space <b>4</b><i>a</i>, the gyro element <b>2</b> and the IC chip <b>3</b> are airtightly accommodated and mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bottom plate <b>5</b> has a flat lower surface <b>51</b> and an upper surface <b>52</b> having a step. The upper surface <b>52</b> has a gyro element mounting surface (vibrating element mounting surface) <b>521</b> which is located at an upper stage portion of the step and on which the gyro element <b>2</b> is mounted, and an IC chip mounting surface <b>522</b> which is located at a lower stage portion of the step and on which the IC chip <b>3</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The IC chip <b>3</b> is mounted on and fixed to the IC chip mounting surface <b>522</b> via conductive adhesive <b>91</b> such as silver paste. With this configuration, a lower surface of the IC chip <b>3</b> can be grounded, which stabilizes a reference potential.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a plurality of IC pads <b>31</b> are formed on an upper surface of the IC chip <b>3</b>. On the other hand, a connection pad <b>81</b> corresponding to each of the IC pads <b>31</b> is formed at the upper stage portion (the periphery of the IC chip <b>3</b>) of the upper surface <b>52</b> of the bottom plate <b>5</b>. The connection pad <b>81</b> and the IC pad <b>31</b> are electrically connected via a wire (bonding wire). Moreover, each of the connection pads <b>81</b> is electrically connected, via a conductive post (not shown) or the like formed in the bottom plate <b>5</b>, to an external mount terminal (not shown) formed on the lower surface <b>51</b> of the bottom plate <b>5</b>. With this configuration, electrical connection from the outside of the package <b>4</b> to the IC ship <b>3</b> can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For each of the connection pads <b>81</b>, for example, one obtained by applying gold plating to an under layer formed on the upper surface <b>52</b> of the bottom plate <b>5</b> and composed of chromium can be used. With this configuration, adhesion between the connection pad <b>81</b> and the bottom plate <b>5</b> is improved, so that the reliability of the vibrating device <b>1</b> is improved. The configuration described above is similarly applied to a connection pad <b>82</b> described later.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is preferable that the upper surface of the IC chip <b>3</b> is located lower than an upper surface of the gyro element <b>2</b>. With this configuration, a space for arranging bonding wires between the IC chip <b>3</b> and the lid <b>7</b> can be sufficiently assured while achieving a reduction in profile of the vibrating device <b>1</b>. Therefore, for example, contact between the lid <b>7</b> and bonding wires is easily prevented, and an electrical connection state between the IC pad <b>31</b> and the connection pad <b>81</b> can be maintained more reliably, so that the reliability of the vibrating device <b>1</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The location of the upper surface of the IC chip is not limited to that. For example, the upper surface of the IC chip may coincide with the upper surface of the gyro element <b>2</b>, or may be located higher than the upper surface of the gyro element <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the gyro element <b>2</b>, each of the supporting portions <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> is mounted on and fixed to the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b> via conductive fixing members (conductive adhesive) <b>92</b> such as solder. The supporting portions <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> are located at both ends of the gyro element <b>2</b> in the y-axis direction. Therefore, by fixing the supporting portions to the bottom plate <b>5</b>, the gyro element <b>2</b> is supported at the both sides thereof on the bottom plate <b>5</b>. Therefore, the gyro element <b>2</b> can be stably mounted on the bottom plate <b>5</b>, and unwanted vibrations (vibrations other than vibration desired to be detected) of the gyro element <b>2</b> are suppressed, so that the detection accuracy of the gyro element <b>2</b> for angular velocity is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Six conductive fixing members <b>92</b> are disposed corresponding to (in contact with) the detecting signal terminals <b>291</b><i>a </i>and <b>291</b><i>b</i>, the detecting ground terminals <b>292</b><i>a </i>and <b>292</b><i>b</i>, the driving signal terminal <b>293</b><i>a</i>, and the driving ground terminal <b>293</b><i>b </i>which are formed on the supporting portions <b>261</b> and <b>262</b>, and separated from each other. On the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b>, six connection pads <b>82</b> corresponding to the detecting signal terminals <b>291</b><i>a </i>and <b>291</b><i>b</i>, the detecting ground terminals <b>292</b><i>a </i>and <b>292</b><i>b</i>, the driving signal terminal <b>293</b><i>a</i>, and the driving ground terminal <b>293</b><i>b </i>are formed. Each of the connection pads <b>82</b> and any of the terminals corresponding thereto are electrically connected via the conductive fixing member <b>92</b>. Moreover, the connection pads <b>82</b> are electrically connected to the IC ship <b>3</b> via wirings (not shown) formed on the upper surface of the bottom plate <b>5</b> or in the interior thereof for example.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">With this configuration described above, since the conductive fixing member <b>92</b> can be used as a fixing member for fixing the gyro element <b>2</b> to the bottom plate <b>5</b> and as a connecting member for performing electrical connection with the gyro element <b>2</b>, the configuration of the vibrating device <b>1</b> can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Moreover, the conductive fixing members <b>92</b> form a gap between the gyro element <b>2</b> and the bottom plate <b>5</b>, and are each used as a gap member which prevents contact between the gyro element <b>2</b> and the bottom plate <b>5</b>. With this configuration, breakage and damage of the gyro element <b>2</b> due to contact with the bottom plate <b>5</b> can be prevented, so that the vibrating device <b>1</b> which can detect an angular velocity accurately and provide excellent reliability is provided. The gap is preferably short unless it hinders the driving of the gyro element <b>2</b>. With this configuration, excessive deformation of the gyro element <b>2</b> (the vibrating reed <b>21</b>) due to contact of the gyro element <b>2</b> with the bottom plate <b>5</b> is prevented when an impact in the z-axis direction is applied to the vibrating device <b>1</b>, so that breakage and damage of the gyro element <b>2</b> can be effectively suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As described above, the upper surface <b>52</b> of the bottom plate <b>5</b> has the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b> on which the gyro element <b>2</b> is mounted and the IC chip mounting surface <b>522</b> which is located lower (bottom side) than the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b> and on which the IC chip <b>3</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the vibrating device <b>1</b>, the thickness (length in the z-axis direction) of the IC chip <b>3</b> is greater than that of the gyro element <b>2</b> with recent miniaturization of the gyro element <b>2</b>. For example, whereas the thickness of the gyro element <b>2</b> is about 100 &#x3bc;m, the thickness of the IC chip <b>3</b> is about 200 &#x3bc;m. Therefore, the IC chip mounting surface <b>522</b> is located lower than the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b>, and the IC chip <b>3</b> is mounted on the IC chip mounting surface <b>522</b>, whereby a reduction in profile of the vibrating device <b>1</b> can be achieved, and the vibrating device <b>1</b> can be miniaturized.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bottom plate <b>5</b> has a gyro element mounting area (vibrating element mounting area) S<b>1</b> including the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b> and an IC chip mounting area S<b>2</b> including the IC chip mounting surface <b>522</b>. The gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> is configured such that the thickness thereof is greater than that of the IC chip mounting area S<b>2</b>. By mounting the gyro element <b>2</b> in the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> which is a portion having the thickness described above, a reduction in detection accuracy of the gyro element <b>2</b> can be prevented or suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Specifically, the application of strain to the vibrating reed <b>21</b> affects vibration characteristics, which may reduce detection accuracy for angular velocity. Typical causes of the application of strain to the vibrating reed <b>21</b> includes, for example, deformation of the package <b>4</b> due to the application of an external force and deformation of the package <b>4</b> due to thermal expansion or thermal shrinkage (thermal stress).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the package <b>4</b> is deformed due to an external force or thermal stress, the relative positional relation (separate distance) among the six conductive fixing members <b>92</b> which fix the gyro element <b>2</b> to the bottom plate <b>5</b> changes. Stress in response to the change is applied to the vibrating reed <b>21</b>, so that the vibrating reed <b>21</b> is strained. In the case where thermal stress causes the deformation, if the coefficients of linear expansion of the bottom plate <b>5</b> and the vibrating reed <b>21</b> are equal to each other, strain is not substantially applied to the vibrating reed <b>21</b> because even when the package <b>4</b> deforms (expands or shrinks), the vibrating reed <b>21</b> also deforms to the same degree as the deformation of the package <b>4</b>. However, since the coefficients of linear expansion of the bottom plate <b>5</b> and the vibrating reed <b>21</b> are different from each other, strain is applied to the vibrating reed <b>21</b>, similarly to the case of an external force, also in the case where thermal stress causes the deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Particularly in the vibrating device <b>1</b> of the embodiment, the gyro element <b>2</b> is supported at the both sides thereof on the bottom plate <b>5</b>. Therefore, the stress (particularly stress in the y-axis direction) applied to the vibrating reed <b>21</b> cannot be released, so that strain is easily applied to the vibrating reed <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Therefore, in the vibrating device <b>1</b> as described above, the gyro element <b>2</b> is mounted in the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> (on the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b>), whereby the application of strain to the vibrating reed <b>21</b> is prevented or suppressed to prevent or suppress a reduction in detection accuracy of the gyro element <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Since the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> has a thickness greater than that of the other portion (the IC chip mounting area S<b>2</b>) of the bottom plate <b>5</b>, the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> has correspondingly higher rigidity. Therefore, compared to the other portion of the bottom plate <b>5</b>, deformation due to an external force or thermal stress is unlikely to occur. Moreover, even if the deformation occurs, the degree of the deformation is small. By mounting the gyro element <b>2</b> in the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> which is unlikely to deform as described above, the application of strain to the gyro element <b>2</b> can be prevented or suppressed. As a result, a reduction in detection accuracy of the gyro element <b>2</b> can be prevented or suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The thickness of the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> is preferably from about 0.3 mm to 0.8 mm even though it varies depending on a constituent material. With this configuration, the deformation of the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> can be more effectively prevented or suppressed while achieving a reduction in profile of the vibrating device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the bottom plate <b>5</b>, a through-hole <b>53</b> as a sealing hole is formed. The through-hole <b>53</b> is a hole for causing the interior of the accommodating space <b>4</b><i>a </i>to be a reduced-pressure environment (preferably a vacuum). By causing the interior of the accommodating space <b>4</b><i>a </i>to be a reduced-pressure environment, an increase in CI value of the vibrating reed <b>21</b> due to the viscosity of air can be prevented or suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">A method of reducing the pressure in the interior of the accommodating space <b>4</b><i>a </i>is not particularly limited, and includes, for example, a method of first removing air in the interior of the accommodating space <b>4</b><i>a </i>via the through-hole <b>53</b>, placing a metal ball in the through-hole <b>53</b>, irradiating the metal ball with a laser beam to melt the metal ball, and then covering to seal the through-hole <b>53</b>. A step portion <b>531</b> which blocks the passing of the metal ball is formed in the through-hole <b>53</b>, thereby making it easy to melt the metal ball within the through-hole. Specifically, the step portion <b>531</b> is formed at the boundary between a portion formed on the lower surface <b>51</b> side and having an inside diameter greater than the outside diameter of the metal ball and a portion formed on the upper surface <b>52</b> side and having an inside diameter smaller than the outside diameter of the metal ball.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the through-hole <b>53</b> is formed, in the xy-plane view, on the side opposite to the gyro element <b>2</b> via the IC chip <b>3</b>. That is, the through-hole <b>53</b> is formed at a location as far as possible from the gyro element <b>2</b>. Moreover, the through-hole <b>53</b> is formed at a thick portion of the bottom plate <b>5</b>, in other words, at a portion other than the IC chip mounting area S<b>2</b> and having a thickness greater than that of the IC chip mounting area S<b>2</b>. In the embodiment, the through-hole <b>53</b> is formed at a portion having the same thickness as that of the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b>. By forming the through-hole <b>53</b> at the location described above, the following effects can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As described above, the through-hole <b>53</b> is covered by melting the metal ball by laser irradiation. Therefore, as described above, the through-hole <b>53</b> is formed at a location as far as possible from the gyro element <b>2</b>, whereby deformation, degradation, or the like of the gyro element <b>2</b> due to heat in laser irradiation can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Moreover, the temperature at the periphery of the through-hole <b>53</b> is raised due to heat in laser irradiation, causing thermal expansion of the periphery of the through-hole <b>53</b>. Due to the occurrence of the thermal expansion, stress may remain at the periphery of the through-hole <b>53</b> in the bottom plate <b>5</b> after sealing. Therefore, the through-hole <b>53</b> is formed at a location as far as possible from the gyro element <b>2</b>, whereby it is possible to prevent or suppress a change in vibration characteristics of the vibrating reed <b>21</b> due to the stress (strain) remaining at the periphery of the through-hole <b>53</b>, so that a change in detection characteristics of the gyro element <b>2</b> can be prevented or suppressed. Moreover, it is possible to prevent or suppress a change in vibration characteristics of the vibrating reed <b>21</b> also due to a temporal change in residual stress.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the embodiment as described above, since the through-hole <b>53</b> is formed at a thick portion with high rigidity, deformation itself due to the residual stress at the peripheral portion of the through-hole <b>53</b> can be effectively prevented or suppressed. Therefore, it is possible to more reliably prevent or suppress the occurrence of the problems described above. Moreover, a crack is likely to occur from the through-hole <b>53</b> due to heat generated by excess current occurring when the lid <b>7</b> is seam-welded to the base <b>10</b> as will be described later. However, by forming the through-hole <b>53</b> at a thick portion with high rigidity, the occurrence of the crack can be effectively prevented or suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The arrangement of the through-hole <b>53</b> is not limited to that. For example, the through-hole <b>53</b> may be formed, in the xy-plane view, on the side opposite to the gyro element <b>2</b> via the IC chip <b>3</b>, in the bottom plate <b>5</b> having the same thickness as that of the IC chip mounting surface <b>522</b>. Even with the mode described above, it is possible to prevent or suppress a change in vibration characteristics of the vibrating reed <b>21</b> due to the stress (strain) remaining at the periphery of the through-hole <b>53</b>, so that a change in detection characteristics of the gyro element <b>2</b> can be prevented or suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The constituent material of the base <b>10</b> is not particularly limited, and various kinds of ceramics such as aluminum oxide can be used. When the base <b>10</b> having the mode described above is manufactured from the constituent material described above, a laminated body is formed by laminating, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at least one flat plate-like substrate <b>10</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the shape of the bottom plate <b>5</b> in the planar view, at least one frame-like substrate <b>10</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the shape of the upper stage portion of the bottom plate <b>5</b> in the planar view, and at least one flat plate-like substrate <b>10</b><i>c </i>corresponding to the shape of the side wall <b>6</b> in the planar view, and the laminated body is baked. With this configuration, the base <b>10</b> can be manufactured simply.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The constituent material of the lid <b>7</b> is not particularly limited. However, it is desirable that the constituent material is a member having a coefficient of linear expansion close to that of the constituent material of the base <b>10</b>. For example, when ceramics is used as the constituent material of the base <b>10</b> as described above, an alloy such as Kovar is preferably used. The bonding between the base <b>10</b> and the lid <b>7</b> is not particularly limited. For example, they may be bonded together via adhesive, or may be bonded by seam welding or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The vibrating device <b>1</b> of the embodiment has been described so far. According to the vibrating device, miniaturization (reduction in profile) of the device can be achieved while preventing or suppressing a reduction in detection characteristics for angular velocity by reducing the influence of strain as described above. Particularly, since it is possible to prevent or suppress a change in vibration characteristics of the vibrating reed <b>21</b> due to strain, it is possible, for example, to eliminate or reduce the difference between vibration characteristics in shipping inspection and vibration characteristics in mounting on a circuit board or the like. Therefore, excellent detection accuracy can be provided also in mounting. Moreover, electrical characteristics are stabilized, so that detection with higher accuracy can be performed.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Second Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, a second embodiment of a vibrating device according to the invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the vibrating device according to the second embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Hereinafter, the vibrating device of the second embodiment will be described mainly on the differences from the above-described embodiment. Descriptions of matters similar to those of the above-described embodiment are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The vibrating device according to the second embodiment of the invention is similar to that of the above-described first embodiment, excepting that the location and shape of the through-hole are different. Configurations similar to those of the above-described first embodiment are denoted by the same reference and numeral signs.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the vibrating device <b>1</b> of the embodiment, the through-hole <b>53</b> has an inside diameter substantially constant in the axial direction (z-axis direction). Moreover, a portion of the through-hole <b>53</b> overlaps with the side wall <b>6</b> in the xy-plane view. In other words, a portion of an upper opening of the through-hole <b>53</b> is covered by the side wall <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">By configuring the through-hole <b>53</b> as described above, the shape of the through-hole <b>53</b> can be simplified compared to the first embodiment. Moreover, since the passing of the metal ball can be blocked by covering a portion of the opening with the side wall <b>6</b>, the metal ball can be reliably melted within the through-hole <b>53</b>. Moreover, for example, the through-hole <b>53</b> can be formed at a location more separate from the gyro element <b>2</b> compared to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Also in the second embodiment, effects similar to those of the above-described first embodiment can be provided.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Third Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Next, a third embodiment of a vibrating device according to the invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the vibrating device according to the third embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a plan view of the vibrating device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a plan view showing a modified example of a recess of the vibrating device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Hereinafter, the vibrating device of the third embodiment will be described mainly on the difference from the above-described embodiment. Descriptions of matters similar to those of the above-described embodiment are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The vibrating device according to the third embodiment of the invention is similar to that of the above-described first embodiment, excepting that the configuration of the bottom plate is different. Configurations similar to those of the above-described first embodiment are denoted by the same reference and numeral signs.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the bottom plate <b>5</b> has a frame-like recess <b>54</b> opened in the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b> and a projecting portion <b>55</b> surrounded by the recess <b>54</b>. The recess <b>54</b> is formed, in the xy-plane view, so as to include in the interior thereof the detecting vibration arms <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> and the driving vibration arms <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b>, and <b>254</b> of the gyro element <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">By forming the recess <b>54</b>, a relatively large gap can be formed between the bottom plate <b>5</b>, and the detecting vibration arms <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> and the driving vibration arms <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b>, and <b>254</b>. Therefore, an increase in CI value of the gyro element <b>2</b> (the vibrating reed <b>21</b>) due to air resistance (viscosity of air) in the atmosphere is suppressed, so that vibration characteristics can be stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Moreover, for example, it is possible to further reduce the amount of difference between the leakage amount of signal of the gyro element <b>2</b> in tuning performed before sealing and the leakage amount of signal after sealing. Therefore, the vibrating device <b>1</b> which can provide desired characteristics (characteristics after tuning) also after sealing is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The depth (length in the z-axis direction) of the recess <b>54</b> is not particularly limited, and preferably, for example, from about 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m. With this configuration, the functions described above can be sufficiently provided, and a reduction in rigidity of the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The projecting portion (regulating portion) <b>55</b> surrounded by the recess <b>54</b> is disposed to face the base portion <b>22</b> of the gyro element <b>2</b>. An upper surface of the projecting portion <b>55</b> is located on the same plane with the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b>. With the projecting portion <b>55</b>, when an impact in the z-axis direction is applied to the vibrating device <b>1</b>, the base portion <b>22</b> of the gyro element <b>2</b> is brought into contact with the projecting portion <b>55</b>, so that excessive deformation of the gyro element <b>2</b> (the vibrating reed <b>21</b>) is prevented. Therefore, breakage and damage of the gyro element <b>2</b> can be effectively prevented. Since the base portion <b>22</b> hardly vibrates even in driving, the problem of the degradation of vibration characteristics due to air resistance described above hardly occurs even when the projecting portion <b>55</b> is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The shape of the recess <b>54</b> in the planar view is not particularly limited as long as the effects described above can be provided. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, six recesses <b>54</b> may be formed such that each of the recesses corresponds to each arm (each vibrating portion) of the detecting vibration arms <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> and the driving vibration arms <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b>, and <b>254</b>. With this configuration, the occupancy of the recesses <b>54</b> in the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> can be reduced, so that a reduction in rigidity of the gyro element mounting area S<b>1</b> can be more effectively prevented or suppressed. In this case, portions located between the six recesses <b>54</b> constitute the projecting portion <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the embodiment, the upper surface of the projecting portion <b>55</b> is located on the same plane as the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b>. However, the upper surface of the projecting portion <b>55</b> may be located higher or lower than the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Also in the third embodiment, effects similar to those of the above-described first embodiment can be provided.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Fourth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Next, a fourth embodiment of a vibrating device according to the invention will be described.</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The vibrating device according to the fourth embodiment of the invention is similar to that of the above-described first embodiment, excepting that a buffer layer is disposed between the bottom plate (gyro element mounting surface) and the gyro element. Configurations similar to those of the above-described first embodiment are denoted by the same reference and numeral signs.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the vibrating device <b>1</b> of the embodiment has the buffer layer <b>11</b> disposed on the gyro element mounting surface <b>521</b>. Then, the gyro element <b>2</b> is bonded to an upper surface of the buffer layer <b>11</b> via the conductive fixing members <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Moreover, the buffer layer <b>11</b> is disposed, in the xy-plane view, so as to include in the interior thereof the whole of the gyro element <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The buffer layer <b>11</b> absorbs and relieves stress transmitted from the bottom plate <b>5</b> to the gyro element <b>2</b>, or vibration leakage from the gyro element <b>2</b>, whereby the buffer layer <b>11</b> has a function of effectively preventing or suppressing the application of strain to the gyro element <b>2</b> (the vibrating reed <b>21</b>) and a change in characteristics due to vibration leakage. With this configuration, the vibrating device <b>1</b> in which influence due to strain and a change in characteristics due to vibration leakage are further reduced is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">It is preferable that the buffer layer <b>11</b> is composed of a material whose linear expansivity is close to that of the constituent material (quartz crystal) of the vibrating reed <b>21</b>.

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Moreover, it is preferable that the constituent material of the buffer layer <b>11</b> is a material whose modulus of elasticity is from about several GPa to several tens MPa. By using the material described above, when an impact in the z-axis direction is applied to the vibrating device <b>1</b> for example, the gyro element <b>2</b> is brought into contact with the buffer layer <b>11</b> and therefore the impact is absorbed and relieved, so that breakage and damage of the gyro element <b>2</b> can be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In the buffer layer <b>11</b>, conductive posts (not shown) are formed. Via the conductive post, the conductive fixing member <b>92</b> and the connection pad <b>82</b> corresponding to the conductive fixing member <b>92</b> are electrically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Also in the fourth embodiment, effects similar to those of the above-described first embodiment can be provided.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the vibrating device <b>1</b> of the embodiment, the buffer layer <b>11</b> is composed of an anisotropically conductive film (or anisotropically conductive adhesive). The buffer layer <b>11</b> has a conductive property in the thickness direction thereof but has an insulating property in the plane direction. With this configuration, the conductive fixing member <b>92</b> located on the upper surface side of the buffer layer <b>11</b> can be electrically connected with the connection pad <b>82</b> corresponding to the conductive fixing member <b>92</b> and located on the lower surface side of the buffer layer <b>11</b> via the buffer layer <b>11</b> while preventing a short circuit between the plurality of connection pads <b>82</b>. By using an anisotropically conductive film as the buffer layer <b>11</b> in this manner, it is unnecessary to form conductive posts in the buffer layer <b>11</b> unlike the above-described fourth embodiment, so that the configuration or manufacturing of the vibrating device <b>1</b> is simplified.</p>
