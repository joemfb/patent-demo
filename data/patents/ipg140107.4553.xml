<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus and a signal transmission method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most mobile terminals typified by mobile phones and the like use a movable member for a connecting portion between an operation portion to be used by a user and a display portion on which information is displayed. An opening and closing structure of a folding mobile phone is typical of such a movable member. Furthermore, in addition to a call function and an email function, recent mobile phones are provided with a viewing and listening function for a video, an imaging function and the like, thus requiring the above-described connecting portion to be able to be moved in complicated ways according to purposes of the user. For example, in a case of using the viewing and listening function for a video, the user would want to turn the display portion toward himself and stow away the operation portion which is unnecessary for viewing and listening. Thus a structure is desired which would enable the orientation or position of the display portion to be easily changed according to the purpose, such as when the mobile phone is used as an ordinary phone, when it is used as a digital camera, or when it is used as a television receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a large number of signal lines and power lines pass through the connecting portion between the operation portion and the display portion. For example, several tens of wires are connected in parallel in the display portion. Therefore, when a movable member capable of complicated movement as described above is used for the connecting portion, the reliability and the like of the wiring will decrease significantly. For this reason, technology has been shifting from a parallel transmission scheme to a serial transmission scheme to reduce the number of signal lines in the connecting portion. Of course, technological shifts for similar reasons are not limited to the field of mobile phones, and are occurring in the fields of various electronic devices for which complicated wiring is required. Moreover, an additional reason for serialization may be to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the serial transmission scheme described above, transmission data is transmitted after being encoded by a specific scheme. As the encoding scheme, for example, the non-return-to-zero (NRZ) encoding scheme, the Manchester encoding scheme, the alternate mark inversion (AMI) encoding scheme, or the like, may be used. For example, JP-A-1991-109843 discloses a technology for transmitting data by using an AMI code, which is a representative example of a bipolar code. The patent document also discloses a technology with which a data clock is transmitted after being expressed by an intermediate value of a signal level, and the receiving side regenerates the data clock based on the signal level.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Among the encoding schemes described above, a DC component is contained in a signal of the NRZ encoding scheme. Thus it is difficult to transmit the signal of the NRZ encoding scheme together with a DC component such as power supply. On the other hand, signals of the Manchester encoding scheme and the AMI encoding scheme do not contain a DC component. Thus the signals can be transmitted together with a DC component such as power supply. However, with the Manchester encoding scheme and the AMI encoding scheme, the receiving side has to have a phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit in order to regenerate the data clock of the signal. Thus, with a PLL circuit provided in the receiving side, the amount of current consumption will increase accordingly. Furthermore, with the Manchester encoding scheme, data is transmitted at a double data rate by using rise and fall of the clock amplitude. As a result, the amount of current consumption will increase due to the high clock operation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In light of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide a novel and improved information processing apparatus and signal transmission method requiring no PLL circuit on the receiving side at the time of regenerating a clock, and capable of multiplexing a plurality of transmission signals with DC power and transmitting the same.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an information processing apparatus including a signal multiplexing unit for multiplexing a plurality of transmission signals, each in a different frequency band and not containing a DC component, and a power signal supplied from a DC power supply and generating a multiplexed signal, a single signal cable through which the multiplexed signal generated by the signal multiplexing unit is transmitted, and a signal separating unit for separating the multiplexed signal transmitted through the signal cable into signals, each in a frequency band of one of the plurality of transmission signals, and a signal in a frequency band of the power signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">1. Summary of Issues</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">First, before describing in detail the technology according to an embodiment of the present invention, issues to be solved by the present embodiment will be briefly summarized.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">(Parallel Transmission Scheme)</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As already described, with electronic devices such as a general mobile phone, a large number of signal lines and power lines pass through the connecting portion between the operation portion on which an arithmetic operation device is mounted and the display portion on which a display screen is mounted. For example, several tens of wires are connected in parallel in the display portion (parallel transmission scheme). Therefore, when a movable member capable of complicated movement is used for the connecting portion, the reliability of the wiring will decrease significantly. Also, if the reliability of the wiring is to be kept at a predetermined level or more, movement range of the connecting portion will be severely restricted. Thus a serial transmission scheme as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has come to be adopted by the electronic devices such as a mobile phone. Furthermore, serialization of transmission lines is promoted with a view to reducing power consumption by reducing the number of signal lines driven at low impedance and with a view also to reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">(Serial Transmission Scheme)</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A configuration example of a mobile terminal <b>100</b> adopting the serial transmission scheme will be briefly described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing the configuration example of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> adopting the serial transmission scheme. Moreover, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, although a mobile phone is schematically illustrated as an example of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, the application scope of the technology described below is not limited to a mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> mainly includes a display unit <b>102</b>, a connecting unit <b>106</b>, and an operation unit <b>108</b>. Furthermore, the display unit <b>102</b> includes a liquid crystal unit <b>104</b> (liquid crystal display; LCD), a deserializer <b>138</b>, and a first antenna <b>154</b>. Also, the operation unit <b>108</b> includes a baseband processor <b>110</b> (BBP), a serializer <b>134</b>, an RF unit <b>150</b>, and a second antenna <b>156</b>. Also, a serial signal line <b>136</b>, a radio signal line <b>152</b> and a power line <b>158</b> (VCC) pass through the connecting unit <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, the liquid crystal unit <b>104</b> is provided on the display unit <b>102</b>. An image signal transmitted through the serial signal line <b>136</b> is displayed on the liquid crystal unit <b>104</b>. Moreover, a thin coaxial line is used for the serial signal line <b>136</b>, for example. In this manner, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> transmits an image signal or the like (serial signal) through the serial signal line <b>136</b> passing through the connecting unit <b>106</b>, based on the serial transmission scheme. The serializer <b>134</b> for serializing a parallel signal output from the baseband processor <b>110</b> is therefore provided in the operation unit <b>108</b>. On the other hand, the deserializer <b>138</b> for parallelizing a serial signal transmitted through the serial signal line <b>136</b> is provided in the display unit <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The serializer <b>134</b> converts the parallel signal input from the baseband processor <b>110</b> to a serial signal. The serial signal output from the serializer <b>134</b> is input to the deserializer <b>138</b> through the serial signal line <b>136</b>. The deserializer <b>138</b> restores the original parallel signal from the input serial signal, and inputs the restored signal to the liquid crystal unit <b>104</b>. In the serial signal line <b>136</b>, a data signal encoded by the NRZ encoding scheme is individually transmitted, or the data signal and a clock signal are transmitted together, for example. Moreover, a differential signal such as a low voltage differential signal (LVDS) is used, in many cases, for the serial signal that flows through the serial signal line <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, the number k of lines in the serial signal line <b>136</b> can be reduced to only a few lines. Therefore, the movement range of the connecting unit <b>106</b> through which the serial signal line <b>136</b> passes is remarkably large. Furthermore, by serializing the transmission path, the reliability of the serial signal line <b>136</b> can be significantly improved. Thus, for example, a movable member allowing the display unit <b>102</b> to rotate 180 degrees in the direction of an arrow A in the drawing can be used for the connecting unit <b>106</b> connecting the display unit <b>102</b> and the operation unit <b>108</b>. Furthermore, a movable member allowing the display unit <b>102</b> to tilt toward the operation unit <b>108</b> can be used for the connecting unit <b>106</b>. By using such a movable member, a structure allowing the mobile terminal <b>100</b> to be folded with the display unit <b>102</b> turned toward a user can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As described above, serializing the transmission path of the image signal or the like to be transmitted from the baseband processor <b>110</b> to the liquid crystal unit <b>104</b> significantly reduces the number of signal lines passing through the connecting unit <b>106</b>. However, in addition to the serial signal line <b>136</b>, the radio signal line <b>152</b>, the power line <b>158</b> and the like, for example, are wired in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The power line <b>158</b> is for supplying power to the display unit <b>102</b> from the operation unit <b>108</b>. Normally, the battery of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is mounted on the operation unit <b>108</b>. Therefore, power is supplied from the operation unit <b>108</b> to the display unit <b>102</b>. Furthermore, to reduce voltage drop, a wire rod having a certain degree of thickness or a plurality of thin wire rods bundled together is used for the power line <b>158</b>. Thus, providing the power line <b>158</b> in addition to the serial signal line <b>136</b> will severely restrict the movement range of the connecting unit <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">On the other hand, the radio signal line <b>152</b> is for transmitting a radio transmission signal (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;radio signal&#x201d; or &#x201c;radio frequency signal&#x201d;) output from the RF unit <b>150</b> to the first antenna <b>154</b> provided in the display unit <b>102</b>. Moreover, the RF unit <b>150</b> is a section for modulating an audio signal in communication, a data signal in data communication, or the like, to a radio transmission signal, and for outputting the signal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two antennas (first antenna <b>154</b>, second antenna <b>156</b>) are provided in the mobile terminal <b>100</b> for diversity reception. The first antenna <b>154</b> is provided in the display unit <b>102</b>, and is connected to the RF unit <b>150</b> via the radio signal line <b>152</b>. On the other hand, the second antenna <b>156</b> is provided in the operation unit <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Normally, the operation unit <b>108</b> is a portion to be handheld by a user. Therefore, the sensitivity of the second antenna <b>156</b> provided in the operation unit <b>108</b> tends to decrease. Accordingly, the first antenna <b>154</b> is provided, as a main antenna, in the display unit <b>102</b> which is less likely to be handheld by the user. On the other hand, the second antenna <b>156</b> provided in the operation unit <b>108</b> is used as a sub antenna. However, since the first antenna <b>154</b> is provided in the display unit <b>102</b>, the radio signal line <b>152</b> for connecting the first antenna <b>154</b> and the RF unit <b>150</b> passes through the connecting unit <b>106</b>. As a result, providing the radio signal line <b>152</b> in addition to the serial signal line <b>136</b> and the power line <b>158</b> will severely restrict the movement range of the connecting unit <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As described above, even if the image signal or the like output from the baseband processor <b>110</b> is serialized, since the power line <b>158</b>, the radio signal line <b>152</b> and the like are, in reality, provided, the movement range of the connecting unit <b>106</b> will be restricted. Furthermore, an audio input unit, an imaging unit and the like (not shown) may be mounted on the display unit <b>102</b>, and a signal line for transmitting a signal from these structural elements to the baseband processor <b>110</b> may also be provided. Thus a technology for reducing the number of signal lines, such as the serial signal line <b>136</b>, the power line <b>158</b> and the radio signal line <b>152</b>, to a small number is desired for the mobile terminal <b>100</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">(Functional Configuration)</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Here, the functional configuration of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> adopting the serial transmission scheme will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, detailed description of structural elements other than the serializer <b>134</b> and the deserializer <b>138</b> will be omitted, and description is made focusing on the functional configurations of the serializer <b>134</b> and the deserializer <b>138</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows, for the mobile terminal <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the functional configurations of the serializer <b>134</b> and the deserializer <b>138</b> in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">(Serializer <b>134</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the serializer <b>134</b> is configured from a P/S conversion unit <b>162</b>, an encoder <b>164</b>, and a driver <b>166</b>. A parallel signal (parallel display data) is input to the serializer <b>134</b> from the baseband processor <b>110</b>. The parallel signal input to the serializer <b>134</b> is converted to a serial signal by the P/S conversion unit <b>162</b>. The serial signal output from the P/S conversion unit <b>162</b> is input to the encoder <b>164</b>. The encoder <b>164</b> adds a header and the like to the serial signal and inputs the same to the driver <b>166</b>. The driver <b>166</b> transmits the input serial signal to the deserializer <b>138</b> according to LVDS.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">(Deserializer <b>138</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The deserializer <b>138</b> is configured from a receiver <b>172</b>, a decoder <b>174</b>, an S/P conversion unit <b>176</b>, a clock regeneration unit <b>178</b>, and a PLL unit <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A serial signal is transmitted as a LVDS from the serializer <b>134</b> to the deserializer <b>138</b>. The serial signal is received by the receiver <b>172</b>. The serial signal received by the receiver <b>172</b> is input to the decoder <b>174</b> and the clock regeneration unit <b>178</b>. The clock regeneration unit <b>178</b> refers to a reference clock (Ref. CLK) input from the outside, and regenerates a parallel signal clock from a serial signal clock by using a built-in PLL unit <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The parallel signal clock regenerated by the clock regeneration unit <b>178</b> is input to the decoder <b>174</b>. The decoder <b>174</b> refers to the header of the serial signal that is input, detects the beginning portion of the data, and inputs the signal to the S/P conversion unit <b>176</b>. At this time, the decoder <b>174</b> uses the parallel signal clock regenerated by the clock regeneration unit <b>178</b>. The S/P conversion unit <b>176</b> converts the serial signal that is input to the parallel signal (parallel display data). The parallel signal that has been converted by the S/P conversion unit <b>176</b> is input to the liquid crystal unit <b>104</b> (LCD).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described above, the parallel signal (parallel display data) input to the serializer <b>134</b> from the baseband processor <b>110</b> is converted to a serial signal and is transmitted to the deserializer <b>138</b>. Then, the serial signal that is input is restored to the original parallel signal by the deserializer <b>138</b> and is input to the liquid crystal unit <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As with the mobile terminal <b>100</b> described above, the transmission path is serialized by converting the parallel signal to the serial signal and transmitting the serial signal. As a result, the movement range of the portion through which the serial signal line passes is enlarged, and the degree of freedom of the positioning of the display unit <b>102</b> is increased. Accordingly, for example, in a case where the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is used to view television broadcast or the like, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> can be transformed so that the display unit <b>102</b> is positioned in a landscape orientation from the user's point of view. The increase in the degree of freedom brings about a wider range of uses of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and in addition to various functions of a communication terminal, a variety of uses becomes possible, such as viewing videos and listening to music.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">However, since the power line <b>158</b>, the radio signal line <b>152</b> and the like have to be provided separately from the serial signal line <b>136</b>, the degree of freedom of the positioning of the display unit <b>102</b> is still restricted. For example, in a case a plurality of signal lines pass through the connecting unit <b>106</b>, the display unit <b>102</b> cannot rotate 360 degrees in the direction of the arrow A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Furthermore, since a PLL (PLL unit <b>180</b>) is used when the deserializer <b>138</b> regenerates a clock, power consumption is increased. In view of the above, in the embodiment described below, a signal transmission method is proposed which can reduce the number of signal lines to pass through the connecting unit <b>106</b> to one, and also, which requires no PLL in the deserializer <b>138</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">An embodiment of the present invention will be described. The present embodiment proposes the signal transmission method of transmitting a plurality of transmission signals to be transmitted from the operation unit <b>108</b> to the display unit <b>102</b> through a single signal line. The signal transmission method relates to a technology for superimposing the plurality of transmission signals on a DC power and transmitting the same, and furthermore, relates to a technology allowing the receiving side to regenerate a clock without using a PLL.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">2. Configuration of Mobile Terminal <b>200</b></heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">First, a device configuration example of a mobile terminal <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing the device configuration example of the mobile terminal <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment. However, structural elements that have substantially the same function as those of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> described above are denoted with the same reference numerals, and repeated explanation of these structural elements is omitted. Moreover, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, although a mobile phone is schematically illustrated as an example of the mobile terminal <b>200</b>, the application scope of the technology described below is not limited to a mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as with the mobile terminal <b>100</b> described above, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> includes the display unit <b>102</b>, the connecting unit <b>106</b>, and the operation unit <b>108</b>. Furthermore, the display unit <b>102</b> includes the liquid crystal unit <b>104</b> (LCD), the deserializer <b>138</b>, the first antenna <b>154</b>, and a demultiplexer <b>206</b> (DMUX). Furthermore, the operation unit <b>108</b> includes the baseband processor <b>110</b> (BBP), the serializer <b>134</b>, the RF unit <b>150</b>, the second antenna <b>156</b>, and a multiplexer <b>202</b> (MUX). One coaxial cable <b>204</b> passes through the connecting unit <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The main difference between the mobile terminal <b>100</b> described above and the mobile terminal <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> lies in the presence or absence of the multiplexer <b>202</b>, the coaxial cable <b>204</b> and the demultiplexer <b>206</b>. Thus these structural elements will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">(Multiplexer <b>202</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a serial signal such as an image signal is input from the serializer <b>134</b> to the multiplexer <b>202</b>, and a radio transmission signal such as a data signal or an audio signal is input from the RF unit <b>150</b> to the multiplexer <b>202</b>. Furthermore, a power signal (VCC<b>1</b>) from a DC power supply is input to the multiplexer <b>202</b>. As already described, the serial signal described above is a signal obtained by serializing the parallel signal that is output from the baseband processor <b>110</b> by the serializer <b>134</b>. When these signals are input, the multiplexer <b>202</b> multiplexes, with the power signal, the serial signal and the radio transmission signal that are input and generates a multiplexed signal, and transmits the multiplexed signal to the demultiplexer <b>206</b> of the display unit <b>102</b> through the coaxial cable <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">(Demultiplexer <b>206</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the multiplexed signal is transmitted through the coaxial cable <b>204</b>, the demultiplexer <b>206</b> separates the power signal (VCC<b>2</b>), the serial signal and the radio transmission signal in the received multiplexed signal. At this time, the demultiplexer <b>206</b> separates each of the signals by selectively extracting, from the multiplexed signal, a signal in a frequency band of each of the power signal, serial signal and radio transmission signal. For example, the power signal is contained in the multiplexed signal as a DC component. Thus the demultiplexer <b>206</b> can extract the power signal by cutting out the frequency band near a frequency <b>0</b> from the multiplexed signal.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, the radio transmission signal is extracted by cutting out a radio frequency (RF) band from the multiplexed signal. Furthermore, the serial signal is extracted by cutting out the frequency band lower than that of the radio transmission signal. That is, signal components are separated in the frequency domain. Among the signals separated by the demultiplexer <b>206</b>, the power signal is supplied to each of the structural elements of the display unit <b>102</b> as a driving power. Furthermore, the radio transmission signal is transmitted to the first antenna <b>154</b> and is wirelessly sent out. Furthermore, the serial signal is input to the deserializer <b>138</b>. The deserializer <b>138</b> restores the input serial signal to the original parallel signal and inputs the parallel signal to the liquid crystal unit <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Heretofore, the device configuration of the mobile terminal <b>200</b> has been described.

Thus the movement range of the connecting unit <b>106</b> can be considerably increased, and at the same time, the reliability of the signal line can be significantly improved.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">(Functional Configuration of Operation Unit <b>108</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the serializer <b>134</b> is configured from the P/S conversion unit <b>162</b>, an encoder <b>208</b>, and the driver <b>166</b>. A parallel signal (parallel display data) is input from the baseband processor <b>110</b> to the serializer <b>134</b>. The parallel signal input to the serializer <b>134</b> is converted to a serial signal by the P/S conversion unit <b>162</b>. The serial signal output from the P/S conversion unit <b>162</b> is input to the encoder <b>208</b>. The encoder <b>208</b> generates an encoded signal by adding a header and the like to the serial signal and encoding the serial signal according to a predetermined encoding scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Here, an encoding method of the encoder <b>208</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing an example of the encoding method according to the present embodiment. Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a method of generating a code for which an AMI code with a duty of 100% serves as a base. However, the technology according to the present embodiment is not limited to such, and is applied to any code having the same properties as the AMI code in the same manner. For example, it can be applied to a bipolar code, a code according to a partial response scheme, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">(Signal Configuration)</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">First, the configuration of a signal generated by an encoding process of the encoder <b>208</b> will be described. A signal (A) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is input data that has been encoded based on the AMI encoding scheme. On the other hand, a signal (C) is the signal (A) that has been encoded based on the encoding method according to the present embodiment. In the signal (C), data values 1 are expressed by a plurality of potentials A<b>1</b> (&#x2212;1, &#x2212;3, 1, 3), and data values 0 are expressed by a plurality of potentials A<b>2</b> (&#x2212;2, 2) that are different from the potentials A<b>1</b>. Furthermore, the polarities are inverted with each cycle for the signal (C), and the same potential does not occur consecutively. Thus clock components can be regenerated based on the rising edges and the falling edges of the signal (C).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, referring to the signal (A), there is a period in bit intervals T<b>6</b> to T<b>9</b> during which the data values 0 occur consecutively. That is, the signal (A) contains a period during which potentials 0 occur consecutively. When there is a period during which the same potentials occur consecutively as described above, the cycle of the rising and falling becomes hard to detect, making it difficult to regenerate a clock from the signal. However, the signal (C) does not contain a period during which the same potentials occur consecutively. For example, in the signal (C), even in the bit intervals T<b>6</b> to T<b>9</b> where the same data values occur consecutively, the data values will be expressed by mutually different potentials (&#x2212;2, 2). In this manner, the signal (C) is configured such that the polarities are inverted with each cycle even if the same data values occur consecutively.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">(Encoding Method)</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, a method of the encoder <b>208</b> for generating the signal (C) will be described. First, the encoder <b>208</b> encodes an input serial signal to the AMI code signal (A). Then, the encoder <b>208</b> generates a clock signal (B) having a frequency (Fb/2) half that of the AMI code having a transmission rate Fb. That is, a cycle of the clock signal is 2/Fb. However, the amplitude of the clock signal is N times (N&#x3e;1; for example, N=2) that of the AMI code. Then, the encoder <b>208</b> inputs the signal (A) and the clock signal (B) to an adder ADD to add the signals, and generates the signal (C). At this time, the AMI code and the clock are synchronized, and are added with the edges aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Heretofore, the encoding method of the encoder <b>208</b> has been described. The frequency spectrum of a signal, such as the signal (C), that does not contain a DC component and whose polarities are inverted with each cycle, has a form as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. A line spectrum appears in the frequency Fb/2 of the clock signal that is added by the adder ADD, and in addition, a broad frequency spectrum of the AMI code is also present. Furthermore, in this frequency spectrum, null points exist at the frequencies Fb, <b>2</b>Fb, . . . .</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Reference will be made again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The signal (C) (hereinafter, &#x201c;serial signal&#x201d;) generated by the encoder <b>208</b> in the manner described above is input to the multiplexer <b>202</b> via the driver <b>166</b>. Furthermore, a radio frequency signal (hereinafter, &#x201c;radio transmission signal&#x201d;) output from the RF unit <b>150</b> and the power signal (VCC<b>1</b>) input from the DC power supply are also input to the multiplexer <b>202</b>. The multiplexer <b>202</b> multiplexes the serial signal and the radio transmission signal with the power signal, and generates a multiplexed signal. The multiplexed signal generated by the multiplexer <b>202</b> is transmitted to the demultiplexer <b>206</b> of the display unit <b>102</b> through the coaxial cable <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">(Functional Configuration of Display Unit <b>102</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the multiplexed signal is transmitted through the coaxial cable <b>204</b>, the demultiplexer <b>206</b> separates the power signal (VCC<b>2</b>), the serial signal and the radio transmission signal that are contained in the multiplexed signal. The power signal (VCC<b>2</b>) separated by the demultiplexer <b>206</b> is supplied to each of the structural elements of the display unit <b>102</b> as a driving power. Also, the radio transmission signal is transmitted to the first antenna <b>154</b>. Furthermore, the serial signal is input to the receiver <b>172</b> of the deserializer <b>138</b>. A detailed circuit configuration of the demultiplexer <b>206</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Here, the functional configuration of the deserializer <b>138</b> will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the deserializer <b>138</b> is configured mainly from the receiver <b>172</b>, the S/P conversion unit <b>176</b>, a decoder <b>210</b>, and a clock detection unit <b>212</b>. Moreover, the main difference between this deserializer <b>138</b> and the deserializer <b>138</b> mounted on the mobile terminal <b>100</b> described above lies in the functional configuration of the clock detection unit <b>212</b> that does not have the PLL.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As described above, the serial signal is input to the deserializer <b>138</b> from the demultiplexer <b>206</b>. The serial signal is received by the receiver <b>172</b>. The serial signal received by the receiver <b>172</b> is input to the decoder <b>210</b> and the clock detection unit <b>212</b>. The decoder <b>210</b> refers to the header of the input serial signal, detects the beginning portion of the data, and restores the original serial signal according to the encoding scheme used by the encoder <b>208</b>. At this time, the decoder <b>210</b> uses the clock regenerated by the clock detection unit <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Here, a decoding method of the decoder <b>210</b> will be briefly described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As described above, the serial signal is a signal that has been encoded by the encoder <b>208</b> to the signal (C). Thus the decoder <b>210</b> restores the original signal by determining whether the amplitude of the signal received by the receiver <b>172</b> is A<b>1</b> or A<b>2</b>. For example, four threshold values (L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, L<b>3</b>, L<b>4</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are used to determine whether the amplitude is the amplitude A<b>1</b> (&#x2212;1, &#x2212;3, 1, 3) corresponding to a data value 1, or the amplitude A<b>2</b> (&#x2212;2, 2) corresponding to a data value 0.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">For example, the decoder <b>210</b> compares the amplitude of the input serial signal and the four threshold values (L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, L<b>3</b>, L<b>4</b>) described above. Moreover, the actual waveform of the serial signal to be input to the decoder <b>210</b> will have a round eye-pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> due to a high frequency cutoff in the transmission process. Now, the decoder <b>210</b> determines whether the amplitude is A<b>1</b> or A<b>2</b> based on the comparison result. Furthermore, the decoder <b>210</b> restores the original serial signal from the determination result. The determination of the amplitudes A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> is enabled by flipping the region of a negative amplitude value of the serial signal over to the region of a positive amplitude value by using an absolute value circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The serial signal restored by the decoder <b>210</b> in this manner is input to the S/P conversion unit <b>176</b>. When the serial signal in input from the decoder <b>210</b>, the S/P conversion unit <b>176</b> converts the input serial signal to the parallel signal (parallel display data). The parallel signal that has been converted by the S/P conversion unit <b>176</b> is input to the liquid crystal unit <b>104</b> (LCD).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">On the other hand, the clock detection unit <b>212</b> detects the clock component from the serial signal received by the receiver <b>172</b>. At this time, the clock detection unit <b>212</b> detects the cycle of polarity inversion by comparing the amplitude value of the serial signal and the threshold value L<b>0</b> (potential <b>0</b>). Furthermore, the clock detection unit <b>212</b> detects the clock component based on the detected cycle of polarity inversion, and regenerates the original clock. In this manner, the clock detection unit <b>212</b> does not use a PLL circuit when detecting the clock component from the serial signal. Thus power consumption can be reduced since a PLL circuit does not have to be provided on the side of the deserializer <b>138</b>. Moreover, the clock regenerated by the clock detection unit <b>212</b> is input to the decoder <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Heretofore, the functional configuration of the mobile terminal <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment has been described. As described above, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> multiplexes the serial signal and the radio transmission signal with the power signal and transmits the signals, and thus these signals can be transmitted by one coaxial cable <b>204</b>. As a result, since the number of cables to pass through the connecting unit <b>106</b> is only one, the movement range of the connecting unit <b>106</b> is enlarged, and the reliability of the signal line is significantly improved. Furthermore, by using a signal with the clock signal superimposed thereon as the transmission signal, it becomes needless to provide a PLL circuit in the display unit <b>102</b>, and thus the power consumption of the mobile terminal <b>200</b> can be reduced.</p>

In the description, a method has been described, as an example, of multiplexing the image display data, the radio frequency signal of the wireless LAN and the DC current, and supplying the same to the display unit <b>308</b> from the operation unit <b>302</b>. However, the technical scope of the present embodiment is not limited thereto.

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">5. Conclusion</heading>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Lastly, the functional configuration of the information processing apparatus (e.g., mobile terminal <b>200</b>, laptop PC <b>300</b>) according to the present embodiment, and the advantages achieved by the functional configuration will be briefly summarized.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">First, the functional configuration of the information processing apparatus according to the present embodiment can be expressed as follows. The information processing apparatus includes a signal multiplexing unit as described below, one signal cable, and a signal separating unit. The signal multiplexing unit multiplexes a plurality of transmission signals, each in a different frequency band and not containing a DC component, and a power signal supplied from a DC power supply, and generates a multiplexed signal.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As described, each of the transmission signals to be multiplexed by the signal multiplexing unit belongs to a different frequency band. Thus, even when a plurality of transmission signals are multiplexed, each of the transmission signals can be separated easily in the frequency domain. Here, only a plurality of transmission signals belonging to different frequency bands may be input to the signal multiplexing unit, or a plurality of signals may be modulated to be in different frequency bands before being input to the signal multiplexing unit. Furthermore, each of the transmission signals does not contain a DC component. Thus, even when each of the transmission signals is multiplexed with a DC power signal, the power signal and each of the transmission signals may be easily separated in the frequency domain.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Furthermore, the signal cable described above is a cable through which the multiplexed signal generated by the signal multiplexing unit is transmitted. As described above, since a plurality of transmission signals and the power signal are multiplexed by the signal multiplexing unit, it becomes possible to transmit all the signals by one signal cable. Since the number of the signal cables is one, even if a movable member is used for a portion where the signal cable is to be wired, the risk of the signal cable breaking or being damaged due to the transformation of the movable portion is significantly low. Furthermore, a transformation of the movable member such as rotation by 360 degrees on the axis of the signal cable is enabled. Thus the structure of the information processing apparatus can be designed to use a movable member with a high degree of freedom of transformation, and the degree of freedom of design is greatly increased. As a result, a structure is made possible which allows the shape of the information processing apparatus to change into a shape that is easy for a user to use depending on the use situation such as viewing television, capturing images, talking, or inputting data.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Furthermore, the signal separating unit described above is for separating the multiplexed signal transmitted through the signal cable into signals, each in a frequency band of one of the transmission signals, and a signal in a frequency band of the power signal. As described above, the plurality of transmission signals belong to mutually different frequency bands. Furthermore, each of the transmission signals does not contain a DC component. Thus, if the DC component is extracted from the multiplexed signal, the power signal is separated; and if a component in the frequency band of each of the transmission signals is extracted from the multiplexed signal, each of the transmission signals is separated. In this manner, the multiplexed signal generated by the signal multiplexing unit described above can be easily separated in the frequency domain by the signal separating unit. As described above, by combining the signal multiplexing unit and the signal separating unit, a multiplexed transmission using one signal cable is realized. As a result, the advantages as described above can be achieved, and the usability for a user can be greatly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The information processing apparatus described above will be described more concretely as follows. The information processing apparatus includes first and second information processing modules connected to each other by the signal cable. The first information processing module includes the DC power supply, the signal multiplexing unit, and a signal processing unit for performing a predetermined processing on the transmission signal. The second information processing module includes a display screen for outputting an image signal, a radio antenna, and the signal separating unit. In this case, the signal multiplexing unit multiplexes, with the power signal, the image signal to be output on the display screen and a radio signal transmitted from the radio antenna as the transmission signals, and generates a multiplexed signal. Furthermore, the signal separating unit separates the image signal, the radio signal and the power signal in the multiplexed signal.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Normally, with an information processing apparatus divided into two information processing modules, a power supply is mounted on one of the information processing modules. Thus power is supplied to one of the information processing modules to the other information processing module. That is, a power signal is inevitably transmitted between the two information processing modules. Also, if a display screen is mounted on one of the information processing modules, an image signal is transmitted between the two information processing modules. A signal line for a power signal and a signal line for an image signal are already required at this stage.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Furthermore, a radio communication/calling section is mounted on a mobile phone as a matter of course. Similarly, a wireless communication section for wireless LAN or the like is mounted on an electronic device such as a laptop PC. As is well known, a radio communication antenna is easily screened by a human body. Thus, in many information processing apparatuses, the radio communication antenna is provided in a position away from the portion to be operated by the user. In such a case, a radio signal has to be transmitted between the two information processing modules. A signal line for a power signal, a signal line for an image signal and a signal line for a radio signal are required at this stage. However, with the information processing apparatus described above, these signals are transmitted, being multiplexed in the frequency domain, so that the signals can be transmitted by one signal cable. Moreover, the power signal is a direct current, the transmission rate of the image signal is approximately 500 Mbps or less, and the frequency band of the radio signal is a frequency band of approximately 800 MHz or more. Therefore, the central portions of the frequency bands of the signals are distant from each other, and the signals are easily separated in the frequency domain and thus they are suitable for the multiplexed transmission scheme described above. Of course, the multiplexed transmission scheme is also applicable to other types of signals having similar characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Furthermore, the signal separating unit described above will be described in more detail as follows. The signal separating unit includes a first filter having a frequency band near a frequency <b>0</b> as a passband, and a plurality of second filters respectively having the frequency band of one of the plurality of transmission signals as a passband. In this case, the power signal is extracted from the multiplexed signal by the first filter. Also, each of the transmission signals is extracted from the multiplexed signal from which the power signal is removed, by each of the second filters. In this manner, the power signal and each of the transmission signals are successively extracted in the frequency domain from the multiplexed signal by using a plurality of filters.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Furthermore, the information processing apparatus may be a laptop personal computer or a mobile phone. In addition, the information processing apparatus may be any of various electronic devices such as a portable game machine or an imaging device. Furthermore, the signal multiplexing unit may be configured to multiplex, with the power signal, at least a transmission/reception signal in a wireless local area network (LAN) or a reception signal of a broadcast wave as the transmission signal.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Furthermore, the signal multiplexing unit may be configured to multiplex the plurality of transmission signals with the power signal, the plurality of transmission signals being encoded by taking input data that includes mutually different first and second bit values and expressing the first bit value in the form of a plurality of first amplitude values and the second bit value in the form of second amplitude values different from the first amplitude values such that a same amplitude value does not occur consecutively and a polarity of the amplitude value is inverted with each cycle. By using a transmission signal encoded by such an encoding scheme, the receiving side is enabled to regenerate a clock without using a PLL. That is, a polarity inversion cycle of the amplitude value is detected on the receiving side and the clock is regenerated based on the polarity inversion cycle. As a result, a PLL does not have to be provided, and thus power consumption can be reduced. Furthermore, since a PLL is not provided, the circuit scale can be made small, and thus the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The multiplexer <b>202</b> described above is an example of the signal multiplexing unit. The coaxial cable <b>204</b> described above is an example of the signal cable.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">For example, in the embodiment described above, a method of generating a transmission signal by superimposing a clock on an AMI code has been described, and a scheme of multiplexing the transmission signal with a power signal and transmitting the same has been described as an example. However, the technology according to the present embodiment can also be applied to a scheme of multiplexing an AMI code or a Manchester code, neither containing a DC component, with a power signal and transmitting the same. However, it is more preferable to use the encoding scheme described in the embodiment described above. Furthermore, in the embodiment described above, although only a case of transmitting the radio transmission signal from the RF unit <b>150</b> has been described, the same can also be said for a case of receiving the radio transmission signal from the RF unit <b>150</b> via an antenna.</p>
