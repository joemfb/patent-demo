<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to a Korean Patent Application entitled &#x201c;Method and Apparatus for Proving DRM Service&#x201d; filed in the Korean Industrial Property Office on Oct. 7, 2010 and assigned Serial No. 10-2010-0098001, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to Digital Rights Management (DRM) service, and more particularly, to a DRM service method and apparatus applicable to adaptive streaming service.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">DRM service is technology for continuously managing and protecting the intellectual property rights for digital content using encryption technology. In other words, this service is technology for securely delivering a variety of content from a Content Provider (CP) to a user, and preventing the user from illegally distributing the provided content. The DRM technology may protect the information throughout the entire process including creation, distribution, use and disposal of digital content, and may protect the user's rights not only in the online environment but also in the offline environment. Currently, various different DRM systems are available in the market. For example, such DRM systems may include an Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) DRM system, a Marlin DRM system, and a Widevine DRM system. These DRM systems are common in encrypting digital content before delivery and granting an access right to the digital content, i.e., in using a license, but different not only in the language expressing the license or the format thereof, but also in the format of messages used to run DRM service. Therefore, if the DRM system used by the CP providing DRM content is different from the DRM system supported by a user terminal, incompatibility-related problems may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The digital content is provided to the user terminal by various different delivery schemes. Among them, streaming service is service that provides digital content data in real time. The DRM technology may be applied to this streaming service, and may also be applied to adaptive streaming service that automatically adjusts a streaming rate or bit rate in order to optimize throughput depending on the access environment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The adaptive streaming service is technology for optimizing a bit rate by analyzing the user's network environment. In this technology, a user terminal selects and plays, depending on its situation, segments of content divided into small segments based on a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol, allowing the user to enjoy the content seamlessly or without delay.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The terms used for the adaptive streaming service may be defined as follows.
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">Content: creations such as movies, music and news, and their storage form</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">Content component: components constituting content (ex: video, audio, and subtitles)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">Representation: representation form of content. For example, even though low-quality and high-quality representations may exist, their contexts are the same.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0012">Media Presentation Description (MPD): it includes information that a client (or user terminal) receiving and processing content should detect in advance, such as time location, Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and size of the content corresponding to the files obtained by segmenting the entire content into segments with a proper size.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0013">The adaptive streaming service provides representations obtained by encoding the same content and content components with different conditions, such as network bandwidth, resolution, and codec. The adaptive streaming service segments the entire length of content into several equal periods, segments again the periods into segments having a sufficiently short time (e.g., 1 to 10 seconds) (segmentation), and provides MPD information (serving as a manifest file) specifying a file name, a sequence number, a start time, a length, etc. of each segment.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">To make it possible to properly decrypt their representations, segments consist of initialization segments having information for decoder configuration and media segments including segmented content components.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">A user terminal first receives MPD information, determines which representation has been provided, determines the performance and capability of the client device, and the network speed, selects a proper representation, downloads their segments in sequence, and plays the downloaded segments.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">If changeable variables such as the network bandwidth vary, i.e., if the network speed increases, the user terminal selects and plays segments of a representation made with a broader network bandwidth. As a result, though the quality varies with the network speed, the playback continues seamlessly.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0017">Generally, when DRM technology is applied to the adaptive streaming service, a maximum of one DRM system may be supported in a fixed manner per streaming service or streaming content. A content server providing streaming service transmits MPD information expressed in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) to a user terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">The MPD information, basic information about content in service, includes information about a type of the service, a valid period of the service, etc. The MPD information may further include information about one or more representations. The representation information indicates whether DRM is applied to the streaming service, and includes identification information for content provided by the streaming service and address information based on which content may be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">Based on the MPD information, the user terminal selects representation information having a proper bit rate taking into account a network bandwidth in each period of streaming data.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of representation information defined in an MPD according to the prior art. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the representation information includes bandwidth information <b>10</b> to which the representation is applied, content protection information <b>20</b> indicating whether DRM is applied, and information about the applied DRM system, and segment information <b>30</b> indicating identification information and acquired address information for each segment constituting the content provided by the streaming service. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it can be seen that information about one DRM system is shown as &#x201c;OMADRM&#x201d; in the content protection information <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">The user terminal determines a segment Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) included in the representation information of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and determines possibility of content protection. In the case of DRM-applied data, the user terminal additionally acquires a license using the representation information, decrypts the encrypted segments, and plays the content.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">However, when one DRM system is represented in a representation as described above, it is impossible to support multiple DRM systems. For example, if protection systems having different security levels are required depending on the bit rate type (for high-resolution image, low-resolution image, etc.), even though multiple DRM systems may be used, it is not possible to support multiple DRM systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">An aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is to provide a DRM service method and apparatus for supporting multiple DRM systems required in a representation in adaptive streaming service.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">Another aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is to provide a DRM service method and apparatus capable of representing a required DRM system without redundant representation of DRM systems when multiple DRM systems required in each representation or content component are redundant in adaptive streaming service.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, specific details such as detailed configuration and components are merely provided to assist the overall understanding of exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Therefore, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. In addition, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">The present invention provides content to which multiple DRM systems are applied in adaptive streaming service. The present invention may also provide information about multiple DRM systems applied to the content, and download information based on which at least one DRM system may be downloaded. Particularly, in providing content by adaptive streaming service, an adaptive streaming service provider determines a DRM system required in each representation of content, groups representations according to predetermined criteria, and provides content protection information including information about multiple DRM systems required for each representation group. The criteria predetermined to group representations may include content attributes (such as video and audio), content performance including a resolution such as High Definition (HD) class and Standard Definition (SD) class, and content play media type (such as media for TV, and media for mobile).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Upon receiving content by adaptive streaming service, a user terminal (or client) first determines multiple DRM systems for each representation group of content by analyzing content protection information of the content. As for the DRM systems supported by the user terminal among the multiple DRM systems, the user terminal decrypts and plays the content using the DRM system. As for the DRM systems not supported by the user terminal, the user terminal downloads the DRM system from an external DRM server, installs the downloaded DRM system, and decrypts and plays the content using the installed DRM system.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">In other words, in order to solve the problem that only one DRM system is supported for each of representations in adaptive streaming service, the present invention supports all of multiple DRM systems required in each of representations, defines representations in groups according to predetermined criteria, and represents required DRM systems without redundant representation of DRM systems for multiple DRM systems required for a specific group, thus enabling adaptive streaming service.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">The present invention will be described in detail below in conjunction with an adaptive streaming service system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a configuration of an adaptive streaming service system according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the adaptive streaming service system includes a content server (or content service server) <b>300</b>, DRM servers (or DRM service servers) <b>200</b> and <b>250</b>, and a user terminal <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">The DRM servers <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> may include a first DRM server <b>200</b> and a second DRM server <b>250</b>, each of which generates and manages a license corresponding to the content in cooperation with the content server <b>300</b>, and provides the license to the user terminal <b>100</b>. The license includes an encryption key used to decrypt encrypted DRM content and data specifying access rights (e.g., the number of and period of accesses, access condition, etc.) to the content. Each of the first and second DRM servers <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> provides the user terminal <b>100</b> with a DRM system module capable of installing a DRM agent corresponding to the DRM system used to generate a license.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">It is assumed that the first and second DRM servers <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> are different only in that they are server devices supporting different types of DRM systems, but the two server devices <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> perform the operation proposed by the present invention in a similar way. For example, while the first DRM server <b>200</b> may be a server device supporting an OMA DRM system, the second DRM server <b>250</b> may be a server device supporting a Marlin DRM system. Although the OMA DRM system and the Marlin DRM system will be considered by way of example in the present invention, other DRM systems may also be supported. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, one server device may be configured to include both the first and second DRM servers <b>200</b> and <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">The content server <b>300</b> is a device for providing a variety of digital content to the user terminal <b>100</b> having subscribed to multimedia service, and for managing information about users having subscribed to the service and information about the related user terminal <b>100</b>, and may support adaptive streaming service. This content server <b>300</b> provides the user terminal <b>100</b> with information about the DRM system applied to adaptive streaming service.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">In particular, the content server <b>300</b> receives DRM information from the DRM servers <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> and provides the user terminal <b>100</b> with information about the DRM system applied to adaptive streaming service. Specifically, in providing content by adaptive streaming service, the content server <b>300</b> determines a DRM system required in each of representations of the content in cooperation with the DRM servers <b>200</b> and <b>250</b>, groups the representations according to predetermined criteria, and provides content protection information including information about multiple DRM systems required for each representation group.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">The content protection information, information generated for DRM of specific content in response to the specific content in an MPD, may include DRM identification information and license acquisition information. The content protection information may also include DRM download information or a license itself.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">The DRM identification information is identification information for the DRM system used for generation of the license. The license acquisition information is information related to the location where the user terminal <b>100</b> may download the license. The DRM download information is information related to the location where the user terminal <b>100</b> may download the DRM system module corresponding to the DRM system used for generation of the license.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">The content server <b>300</b> converts the content protection information into the format the user terminal <b>100</b> may handle, and transmits the converted information to the user terminal <b>100</b>. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the content protection information may be delivered to the user terminal <b>100</b> using MPD information.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">The MPD information, basic information about the content in service, includes information about a type of the service, a valid period of the service, etc. and may include information about at least one representation. The representation information indicates whether DRM is applied to the streaming service, and includes identification information for the content provided by the streaming service and address information by which the content may be acquired. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the MPD information may include representation group information. The representation group information may refer to any one of information about a representation group generated by a combination of at least two representations among multiple representations according to predetermined criteria; information about media composition obtained by defining multiple representation groups as one media composition; and information about media composition obtained by defining multiple representations as one media composition. The predetermined criteria may include content attributes (such as video and audio), content quality corresponding to a resolution such as HD class and SD class, and content play media type (such as media for TV, and media for mobile). Other criteria unmentioned herein may also be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">The user terminal <b>100</b> is a device for consuming content by requesting, receiving and playing content by adaptive streaming service, and may include, for example, a personal computer (PC), a television (TV), a mobile phone, a Personal Multimedia Player (PMP), a music file player, etc. Upon receiving content by adaptive streaming service, the user terminal <b>100</b> determines multiple DRM systems by analyzing content protection information provided by MPD information. As for the DRM system supported by the user terminal <b>100</b> among the multiple DRM systems, the user terminal <b>100</b> decrypts and plays content using the DRM system. As for the DRM systems unsupported by the user terminal <b>100</b>, the user terminal <b>100</b> downloads the DRM system from an external DRM server, installs the downloaded DRM system, and decrypts and plays the content.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">Structures and operations of the content server <b>300</b> and the user terminal <b>100</b> in the adaptive streaming service system will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">As to the structure and operation of the content server <b>300</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a structure of a content server according to an embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an operation of a content server according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the content server <b>300</b> includes an MPD information configurer <b>310</b> and a communication unit <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the MPD information configurer <b>310</b> determines a DRM system required in each of representations corresponding to the content provided by adaptive streaming service in step <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">In step <b>44</b>, the MPD information configurer <b>310</b> groups representations according to predetermined criteria, and generates representation group information corresponding to the representation group. The predetermined criteria may include content attributes (such as video and audio), content quality such as HD class and SD class, and content play media type (such as media for TV, and media for mobile). Other criteria unmentioned herein may also be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">After generating the representation group information, the MPD information configurer <b>310</b> generates content protection information including information about the DRM system required for each representation group in step <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">In step <b>48</b>, the MPD information configurer <b>310</b> configures, in MPD information, representation group information and content protection information corresponding to the representation group, and provides the MPD information to the user terminal <b>100</b> through the communication unit <b>320</b>. The content protection information includes information about the DRM systems corresponding to the representation group.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">As regards the operation of the MPD information configurer <b>310</b>, the representation group and the DRM systems associated with the representation group will be described in more detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> illustrate a representation group and DRM system information corresponding to the representation group according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0064">If multiple DRM systems are supported in each of representations as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the user terminal <b>100</b> may be provided with first content protection information indicating that DRM<b>1</b> and DRM<b>3</b> are supported in a representation <b>1</b>; second content protection information indicating that DRM<b>2</b> and DRM<b>3</b> are in a representation <b>2</b>; and third content protection information indicating that DRM<b>3</b> and DRM<b>4</b> are supported in a representation <b>3</b>. In this case, the same DRM system information may be redundantly provided to the user terminal <b>100</b> several times, because content protection information is provided to the user terminal <b>100</b> on a representation basis.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">In an embodiment of the present invention, one representation group may be made by combining representations <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> according to first criteria predetermined as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, for example, according to the content attributes (such as video and audio) and the content quality, and content protection information may be provided, indicating that DRM<b>1</b>, DRM<b>2</b>, DRM<b>3</b> and DRM<b>4</b> are supported for the representation group.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>, multiple representation groups may be configured into media composition according to predetermined criteria, for example, according to the content attributes such as video and audio, and the content quality criteria, and content protection information supported for each media composition may be provided. Other criteria unmentioned herein may also be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the content protection information may be provided in a representation level in MPD information, may be provided in a media composition level in MPD information, or may be provided in an MPD information level.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the user terminal <b>100</b> includes a content handler <b>11</b>, an MPD parser module <b>120</b>, a bandwidth monitor <b>130</b>, a representation selector <b>140</b>, a DRM selector <b>150</b>, a DRM installer <b>160</b>, a DRM agent <b>170</b>, a decrypter <b>180</b>, a transceiver <b>190</b>, and a media composition module <b>195</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088">The content handler <b>11</b> handles functions of the user terminal <b>100</b> by controlling the following components. The transceiver <b>190</b> transmits and receives messages or data to/from the network or other devices, and delivers the received messages or data to the content handler <b>11</b>. The transceiver <b>190</b> transmits data and messages provided from the content handler <b>11</b> to the related network entities or devices.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">The MPD parser module <b>120</b>, under control of the content handler <b>11</b>, parses MPD nodes in MPD information received from the content server <b>300</b> via the transceiver <b>190</b>, and generates DRM objects for content protection information. The MPD parser module <b>120</b> delivers the parsed MPD information to the content handler <b>11</b>. The content handler <b>11</b> delivers the MPD information to the representation selector <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090">The bandwidth monitor <b>130</b> checks the network bandwidth by monitoring the network state, and delivers the bandwidth information to the representation selector <b>140</b>, thereby providing the criteria for representation selection.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">Based on the information about the DRM system installation in the user terminal <b>100</b>, the performance of the user terminal <b>100</b>, and the DRM selection criteria, the DRM selector <b>150</b> selects DRM systems which are suitable to be used in playing the content to which multiple DRM systems are applied. The DRM selection criteria may be set in various different ways to select at least one of, for example, a DRM system currently installed in the user terminal <b>100</b>, a DRM system preferred by the service provider providing the content, and a DRM system preferred by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">The representation selector <b>140</b> selects representations in a proper level by making reference to and comparing the network bandwidth, the DRM selection criteria and information about at least one representation included in MPD information. The information about the DRM system selected by the DRM selector <b>150</b> and the information about the representation selected by the representation selector <b>140</b> are provided to the content handler <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">The DRM installer <b>160</b>, under control of the content handler <b>11</b>, downloads and installs a relevant DRM system module if a DRM agent corresponding to the DRM system selected by the DRM selector <b>150</b> is not installed in the user terminal <b>100</b>. The DRM installer <b>160</b> may perform an authentication procedure with the DRM servers <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> by generating performance information/security verification information of the user terminal <b>100</b>. The DRM agent <b>170</b>, under control of the content handler <b>11</b>, may perform a protocol of acquiring a license, and enables the content to be played according to the acquired license. In other words, the DRM agent <b>170</b> acquires a license from its license manager <b>171</b> and manages the acquired license. Depending on the access right included in the license, the DRM agent <b>170</b> allows the content to be accessed by the user terminal <b>100</b> and provides an encryption key to the decrypter <b>180</b>. The DRM agent <b>170</b> is identified according to the type of the DRM system, and may be added by the DRM installer <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">The decrypter <b>180</b>, under control of the content handler <b>11</b>, decrypts the encrypted content data based on the encryption key information of the license and the encryption information (e.g., initial vector and encryption algorithm) described in MPD information. Under control of the content handler <b>11</b>, the decrypted content data is played by a multimedia player (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">The media composition module <b>195</b>, under control of the content handler <b>11</b>, determines the applied DRM systems by checking representation group information in the MPD information parsed by the MPD parser module <b>120</b>, and analyzing content protection information corresponding to the representation group information. For example, the media composition module <b>195</b> determines DRM systems applied to each representation group including multiple representations, or determines DRM systems applied to a media composition including multiple representation groups. The media composition module <b>195</b> provides information about the determined DRM systems to the content handler <b>11</b>, allowing the content handler <b>11</b> to select a DRM system suitable to be used in playing the content to which multiple DRM systems are applied.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">A description will now be made of a DRM service method in the user terminal <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an operation of a user terminal according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the user terminal <b>100</b> receives MPD information provided by adaptive streaming service through the transceiver <b>190</b> in step <b>502</b>. The MPD information includes group information of representations corresponding to the content and content protection information corresponding to the representation group information. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, for example, the representation group information may be information indicating a representation group made by a combination of at least one representation among multiple representations according to predetermined criteria, or may be information indicating the media composition obtained by defining multiple representation groups. The predetermined criteria may include content types or attributes (such as video and audio), content quality corresponding to a resolution such as HD class and SD class, and content play media type (such as media for TV, and media for mobile). Other criteria unmentioned herein may also be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">In step <b>504</b>, the user terminal <b>100</b> analyzes representation group information included in MPD information and content protection information corresponding to the representation group information. The user terminal <b>100</b> may analyze content protection information included in a media composition level, or may analyze content protection information included in an MPD level.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0099">After the analysis of the content protection information is completed, the user terminal <b>100</b> determines a DRM system required for each representation group in step <b>506</b>. For example, the user terminal <b>100</b> may determine a DRM system required by a representation group made by a combination of at least one representation among multiple representations according to predetermined criteria. The user terminal <b>100</b> may also determine a DRM system required by a media composition obtained by defining multiple representation groups or multiple representations.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">After determining the required DRM system, the user terminal <b>100</b> determines in step <b>508</b> whether the required DRM system is a DRM system provided (supported) in the user terminal <b>100</b>. If the required DRM system is a provided DRM system, the user terminal <b>100</b> selects an optimal DRM system among the provided DRM systems in step <b>510</b>. However, if the required DRM system is not a provided DRM system, the user terminal <b>100</b> downloads a DRM system from the DRM server based on downloadableDRMInfo in the content protection information, installs the downloaded DRM system, and selects the optimal DRM system, in step <b>512</b>. The user terminal <b>100</b> may select the optimal DRM system taking into account the current terminal performance, the bandwidth, and the user settings.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0101">In step <b>514</b>, the user terminal <b>100</b> decrypts the content using the selected DRM system and plays the decrypted content. The user terminal <b>100</b> performs the content playback after obtaining license-related information in the content protection information using the selected DRM system, and acquiring information for decrypting content based on the license-related information.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0102">As is apparent from the foregoing description, according to the present invention, multiple DRM systems required in each of representations are set to be supported all in adaptive streaming service. Representations are defined as a group according to predetermined criteria and multiple DRM systems required for the group are set to represent the required DRM system without redundant representation of DRM systems, making it possible to provide more the efficient DRM service. In addition, different security requirements may be satisfied according to various criteria such as content type, content quality, and content play media.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0103">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0104">For example, although representations are grouped according to predetermined criteria such as the content type, the content quality and the content play media in an embodiment of the present invention, the representations may be grouped according to other criteria. Although a representation group is defined as a media composition in the present invention, the representation group may be defined in another manner.</p>
