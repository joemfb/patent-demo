<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system for collecting carbon dioxide in flue gas includes a stack that discharges flue gas discharged from an industrial facility to outside, a blower that is installed at the downstream side of the stack and draws the flue gas therein, a carbon-dioxide collecting device that collects carbon dioxide in the flue gas drawn in by the blower, and a gas flow sensor arranged near an exit side within the stack. A drawing amount of the flue gas by the blower to the carbon-dioxide collecting device is increased until an flow rate of the flue gas from the stack becomes zero in the gas flow sensor, and when the discharged amount of flue gas from the stack becomes zero, drawing in any more than that amount is stopped, and the carbon dioxide in the flue gas is collected while the flue gas is drawn in by a substantially constant amount.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a system for collecting carbon dioxide in flue gas, capable of stably processing all the carbon dioxide in the flue gas discharged from an industrial facility such as a gas turbine, a furnace, or a boiler.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, to collect carbon dioxide in flue gas, for example, a system is adopted when an amine-based absorbing solvent is used as a CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbing solvent to remove and collect CO<sub>2 </sub>from flue gas; firstly, a process is performed to bring the CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbing solvent into contact with the flue gas in an absorption column, and thereafter the CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbing solvent that has absorbed CO<sub>2 </sub>is heated in a regeneration column; secondly, CO<sub>2 </sub>is freed and the CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbing solvent is regenerated, and circulated in the absorption column again, and finally, reused (for example, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H3-193116).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an example of a conventional system for collecting CO<sub>2 </sub>in flue gas. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a conventional CO<sub>2 </sub>collecting system <b>1000</b> includes an flue gas cooling device <b>1004</b> that cools flue gas <b>1002</b> containing CO<sub>2 </sub>discharged from an industrial facility <b>1001</b> such as a boiler and a gas turbine by cooling water <b>1003</b>, a CO<sub>2 </sub>absorption column <b>1006</b> that brings the flue gas <b>1002</b> containing cooled CO<sub>2 </sub>into contact with a CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbing solvent <b>1005</b> absorbing CO<sub>2 </sub>to remove the CO<sub>2 </sub>from the flue gas <b>1002</b>, and a regeneration column <b>1008</b> that releases the CO<sub>2 </sub>from a CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbing solvent (rich solvent) <b>1007</b> absorbing the CO<sub>2 </sub>to regenerate the CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbing solvent. In this device, a regenerated CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbing solvent (lean solvent) <b>1009</b> from which the CO<sub>2 </sub>is removed in the regeneration column <b>1008</b> is recycled as the CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbing solvent in the CO<sub>2 </sub>absorption column <b>1006</b>. The CO<sub>2 </sub>absorption column <b>1006</b> and the regeneration column <b>1008</b> configure a CO<sub>2 </sub>collecting device <b>1030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a CO<sub>2 </sub>collection method using the conventional CO<sub>2 </sub>collecting device <b>1030</b>, the flue gas <b>1002</b> containing CO<sub>2</sub>, discharged from the industrial facility such as a boiler and a gas turbine, is firstly sent to the flue gas cooling device <b>1004</b> after pressure is raised by an flue gas fan <b>1010</b>, cooled by cooling water <b>1003</b>, and thereafter sent to the CO<sub>2 </sub>absorption column <b>1006</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the conventional effective utilization of the carbon dioxide in flue gas, some of the carbon dioxide in flue gas is merely collected to produce carbon dioxide for carbonated drinks and dry ice. However, the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide is recently pointed out as one of the causes of global warming. Measures are becoming an urgent necessity internationally to protect the global environment, and also, the source of generating the carbon dioxide affects every field of human activity, which burns fossil fuels, and demands of restricting the discharge tend are becoming even stronger. Along with this tendency, in power generation facilities such as thermal power stations that use a large amount of fossil fuels, there have been a method in which flue gas of industrial facilities such as a boiler and a gas turbine is brought into contact with a CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbing solvent, all of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the flue gas is removed and collected, and a method for storing the collected CO<sub>2 </sub>without releasing it into the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, in the conventional CO<sub>2 </sub>collecting system <b>1000</b>, there has been proposed that, when collecting all of carbon dioxide in flue gas, a containing unit such as a valve or damper that can be opened and closed inside the stack <b>1001</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, is installed to close and stop during the operation of the CO<sub>2 </sub>collecting device and to release when the operation of the CO<sub>2 </sub>collecting device is stopped while the source of the flue gas is kept operating.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, at the time of stopping the operation of the CO<sub>2 </sub>collecting device, unless an operation such as containment of the valve, damper or the like, which closes the interior of the stack or releasing is surely performed, discharge of flue gas is not performed smoothly, and there are occasions that the industrial facilities (such as gas turbines) at the upstream side are adversely affected.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, in a turbine facility that generates electricity of 200,000 kilowatts in which 3000 ton of carbon dioxide are processed in each day, an amount of discharged flue gas becomes enormous and a stack having, for example, a diameter of 7 to 10 meters is required. Under such circumstances, a facility of a containing unit such as a valve and a damper that contains the flue gas needs to be larger.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, a system capable of drawing in substantially all of a large amount of flue gas to a carbon-dioxide collecting device in a simple, stable, and safe manner has been desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is an object of the present invention to at least partially solve the problems in the conventional technology.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an aspect of the present invention, a system for collecting carbon dioxide in flue gas includes: a stack that discharges flue gas discharged from an industrial facility to outside; a blower that is installed at a downstream side of the stack and draws the flue gas therein; a carbon-dioxide collecting device that collects carbon dioxide in the flue gas drawn in by the blower; and a gas flow sensor that is arranged near an exit side within the stack and measures a gas flow rate. A drawing amount of the flue gas to the carbon-dioxide collecting device by the blower is increased until an flow rate of the flue gas from the stack becomes zero in the gas flow sensor, and when the flow rate of the flue gas from the stack becomes zero, drawing in any more than the amount is stopped, and the carbon dioxide in the flue gas is collected while drawing in the flue gas by a substantially constant amount.</p>

A drawing amount of the flue gas by the blower to the carbon-dioxide collecting device is increased until the gas temperature or a concentration of the gas type changes in the sensor, and when the gas temperature or the concentration of the gas type changes, drawing in any more than the amount is stopped, and the carbon dioxide in the flue gas is collected while drawing in the flue gas by a substantially constant amount.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to still another aspect of the present invention, a system for collecting carbon dioxide in flue gas includes: a stack that discharges flue gas discharged from an industrial facility to outside; a blower that is installed at a downstream side of the stack and draws the flue gas therein; a carbon-dioxide collecting device that collects carbon dioxide in the flue gas drawn in by the blower; and a plurality of sensors that are arranged in an stack flue at an upstream side of the stack and at a downstream side of the stack and measure gas temperature or a concentration of gas type. A drawing amount of the flue gas by the blower to the carbon-dioxide collecting device is increased until a difference in the gas temperature or the concentration of the gas type is generated, and when the difference is generated, drawing in any more than the amount is stopped, and the carbon dioxide in the flue gas is collected while drawing in the flue gas by a substantially constant amount.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention is explained below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The present invention is not limited to the embodiments.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A system for collecting carbon dioxide in flue gas according to a first embodiment of the present invention is explained with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of the system for collecting carbon dioxide in flue gas according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system for collecting carbon dioxide in flue gas <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> according to the first embodiment includes a stack <b>13</b> that discharges flue gas <b>12</b> discharged from an industrial facility <b>11</b> to outside, a blower <b>14</b> that is installed at the downstream side of the stack <b>13</b> and draws the flue gas <b>12</b> therein, a carbon-dioxide collecting device <b>15</b> that collects carbon dioxide in the flue gas <b>12</b> drawn in by the blower <b>14</b>, and a gas flow sensor S<b>1</b> arranged near an exit side within the stack <b>13</b>. In the gas flow sensor S<b>1</b>, a drawing amount of the flue gas <b>12</b> by the blower <b>14</b> to the carbon-dioxide collecting device <b>15</b> is increased until an exhaust flow rate of the flue gas from the stack <b>13</b> becomes zero, and when the discharged amount of flue gas from the stack <b>13</b> becomes zero, drawing in any more than that amount is stopped and the carbon dioxide in the flue gas is collected while the flue gas <b>12</b> is drawn in by a substantially constant amount.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The carbon-dioxide collecting device <b>15</b> is not particularly limited and can be any device that collects carbon dioxide, similar to the CO<sub>2 </sub>collecting device shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the first embodiment, the exhaust flow rate to the outside of the flue gas <b>12</b> from the stack <b>13</b> is monitored all the time in the gas flow sensor S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the drawing amount of the flue gas <b>12</b> by the blower <b>14</b> to the carbon-dioxide collecting device <b>15</b> is increased until the exhaust flow rate from the stack <b>13</b> becomes zero, the discharged amount of the flue gas <b>12</b> to the outside from the stack declines slowly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the discharged amount of flue gas from the stack <b>13</b> becomes zero, drawing in any more than that amount by the blower <b>14</b> is stopped, and the carbon dioxide in the flue gas <b>12</b> is collected by the carbon-dioxide collecting device <b>15</b> while drawing in the flue gas <b>12</b> by the blower <b>14</b> while maintaining the drawing amount to become approximately zero (substantially constant amount).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Accordingly, all of the flue gas from the industrial facility <b>11</b> can be stably drawn into the carbon-dioxide collecting device <b>15</b> and all of the carbon dioxide in flue gas can be collected.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, in the carbon-dioxide collecting device <b>15</b>, since air is mixed in the flue gas which is a target to be processed, malfunctions is not generated even when outside atmosphere is drawn into the carbon-dioxide collecting device <b>15</b> from the stack <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the present invention, the industrial facility is not particularly limited, and examples thereof can include a boiler, a combustion furnace, and a gas turbine facility, which generate carbon dioxide.

Immediately before the concentration change of the carbon dioxide starts (a point indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), drawing in any more flue gas <b>12</b> by the blower <b>14</b> is stopped, and the carbon dioxide in the flue gas <b>12</b> is collected by the carbon-dioxide collecting device <b>15</b> while drawing in the flue gas <b>12</b> by the blower <b>14</b> while maintaining the stopped drawing amount (substantially constant amount).</p>
