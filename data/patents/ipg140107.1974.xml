<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method to attach an object to a support structure, the system including a fastener having an anti-rotational member, a mounting plate having a raised portion adapted to receive the fastener, and an elastic membrane. The fastener is sandwiched between the mounting plate and the elastic membrane. The raised portion forms a cavity having an inner surface. The inner surface abuts against the surfaces of the fastener, which in turn restricts movement.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">While the mounting system of the present application is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the description herein of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to the particular embodiment disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the process of the present application as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present disclosure describes methods and systems for mounting or otherwise attaching an object to polymeric membranes. For example, in some instances, the present disclosure describes methods and systems for attaching objects to polymeric membranes utilized for covering all or a portion of a building structure roof. In some instances, the polymeric membranes may include thermoplastic polymeric membranes (&#x201c;thermoplastic membranes&#x201d;), while, in other instances, the polymeric membranes may include thermoset polymeric membranes (&#x201c;thermoset membranes&#x201d;). Example objects that may be attached include photovoltaic cells, an air handling component (e.g., air conditioning or heating components), telecommunications equipment (e.g., antennas, satellite dishes, etc.), or any other desired object. It should be understood that the materials described herein provide sufficient elasticity for the features described below.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Utilizing the described systems and methods for securing one or more photovoltaic cells to the roof of a structure may provide tax benefits. For example, tax benefits may exist for having photovoltaic cells attached to the structure of a roof that are otherwise unavailable for photovoltaic cells that are merely placed on a roof unattached to the roof structure. Thus, in some implementations, the system and methods described herein provide for attaching an object to the roof structure, and, in the case of photovoltaic cells, may enable a user to enjoy the available tax benefits associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In other implementations, the described methods and systems may be utilized for attaching objects to a polymeric membrane forming part of a structure. Further, while some implementations may be described with respect to thermoplastic membranes, thermoset membranes may also be applicable and vice versa. In general, the described methods and systems may be applicable to applications including roofing, waterproofing, earth lining, pond lining, tent construction, tension fabric applications, air forming technologies, flexible plastic forming (such as with flexible plastic films), rigid plastic forms, as well as any other suitable application.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a perspective view of an example implementation of a system for mounting an object to a polymeric membrane. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a polymeric membrane (interchangeably referred to as &#x201c;membrane&#x201d;) <b>10</b> and a mounting plate <b>20</b>.

Example thermoplastic membranes may include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), thermoplastic olefins (TPO), keytone ethylene esters (KEE), nitrile butadiene polymers (NBP), as well as other suitable thermoplastics. In other instances, thermoset membranes may also be used. For example, examples thermoset membranes may include membranes formed from ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) as well as any other suitable thermoset membranes, including thermoplastic membranes that may morph into thermoset membranes over time, such as chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSPE).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The polymeric membrane <b>10</b> may be secured to a structure <b>40</b>, such as a roof structure. The polymeric membrane <b>10</b> may be secured to the structure <b>40</b> in any known or suitable manner. Further, in some instances, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may be formed entirely or in part from a metal, such as steel, galvanized steel, aluminum, titanium, or other desired or suitable metal. Additionally, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may or may not be weatherized. In other instances, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may be formed from other materials, such as glass, plastic, ceramics, composite materials, or any other material. It should be appreciated that some applications may not require polymeric membrane <b>10</b>; as such, mounting plate <b>20</b> may be bonded or attached directly to structure <b>40</b> without the use of polymeric membrane <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown, the mounting plate <b>20</b> has a protrusion <b>30</b> extending therefrom that may be used for securing a structure. The protrusion <b>30</b> may allow attachment and detachment of the structure, such as structure <b>35</b>, without damage or alteration to the polymeric membrane <b>10</b>. For example, in some instances, the protrusion <b>30</b> may provide for a threaded connection with structure <b>35</b>, although any other suitable connection mechanism may be used. In other implementations, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may be integral to a structure. In still other implementations, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may omit the protrusion <b>30</b>. Alternately, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may include a mechanism for attaching or detaching a corresponding structure thereto. For example, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may include an interlocking mechanism for accepting one or more structures. Example structures may include one or more photovoltaic cells, air handling equipment (e.g., air conditioning equipment or heating equipment), one or more antennas, mounting structures therefor, a barrier, or any other desired structure.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In still other implementations, an example mounting plate <b>20</b> may include a threaded portion for mating engaging with a corresponding threaded portion provided on a structure to be attached or otherwise coupled to the mounting plate <b>20</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a mounting plate <b>20</b> that includes a welded nut <b>22</b> for accepting a protrusion having mating threads. Alternately, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may have a threaded portion <b>24</b> formed therein for accepting the protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of another example mounting plate <b>20</b> in which the protrusion <b>30</b> is a separate piece insertable into an opening <b>32</b> formed in the mounting plate <b>20</b>. Further, a head <b>34</b> of the protrusion <b>30</b> may be retained in a pocket <b>36</b> formed in the mounting plate <b>20</b>. In other instances, the head <b>34</b> may not be retained in a pocket formed in the mounting plate <b>20</b>. In some implementations, the protrusion <b>30</b> may be a carriage bolt insertable into the opening <b>32</b>, and the interface between the opening <b>32</b> and the protrusion <b>30</b> prevents the protrusion <b>30</b> from rotating relative to the mounting plate <b>20</b>. Further, a mounting plate <b>20</b> having an opening <b>32</b> of a single size may be operable to accept protrusions <b>30</b> having varying shaft lengths, widths, and/or diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The mounting plate <b>20</b> may be attached to the polymeric membrane <b>10</b> in numerous ways. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> show several cross sectional views of the mounting plate <b>20</b> attached to the polymeric membrane <b>10</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows the mounting plate <b>20</b> attached to the membrane <b>10</b> with a binding agent, such as an adhesive <b>50</b>, disposed therebetween. Alternately, the binding agent for securing the mounting plate <b>20</b> may be a carrier tape <b>60</b> having adhesive <b>70</b>, <b>80</b> provided on opposing sides thereof, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. In some implementations, the carrier tape <b>60</b> may have a removable protective film or backing <b>65</b>. In some instances the adhesive <b>70</b> and adhesive <b>80</b> may be the same adhesive, while, in other instances, the adhesives <b>70</b>, <b>80</b> may be different. For example, adhesives <b>70</b>, <b>80</b> may be selected based on the material being adhered. For example, for a mounting plate <b>20</b> formed from steel, the adhesive <b>70</b> may be selected to adhere steel, while, for a membrane <b>10</b> formed from PVC, the adhesive <b>80</b> may be selected to adhere to PVC. In some instances the carrier tape <b>60</b> may be a foam-based tape. Carrier tape <b>60</b> may be used to secure the mounting plate <b>20</b> to the membrane <b>10</b>. One or more tape strips or sheets may be used to secure the mounting plate <b>20</b>. Further, the carrier tape <b>60</b> may be custom shaped and/or formed to fit to geometry of the mounting plate <b>20</b>. For example, the carrier tape <b>60</b> may be custom fit to correspond to one or more geometric features of the mounting plate <b>20</b>, such as protrusions or other topographical shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Multiple options for adhesives <b>50</b>, <b>70</b>, and <b>80</b> are available and selecting an appropriate adhesive is often dependent upon the desired engineered failure during testing. In some instances, it may be desirable for the adhesion provided by the selected adhesive to give way at a chosen weight threshold preventing damage to other components within the assembly. In other instances, it may be desirable for the adhesive bond to be so strong that components would not separate without damage to one surface or another. In addition, the selected adhesive may be applied to a carrier tape, the carrier tape and selected adhesive also being capable of being engineered with a chosen weight threshold and thickness. Adhesives <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, and <b>70</b> include cross linking as well as non-cross linked butyl adhesives. A non-exclusive list of adhesives <b>50</b>, <b>70</b>, and <b>80</b>, as well as carrier tapes <b>60</b>, that may be used are: 3M VHB 4941 F, 3M VHB 4941, 3M VHB 4932, 3M VHB 4952, 3M VHB 5925, 3M VHB 5952, 3M VHB 5962, 3M weather strip tapes, 3M Polyurethane 560, 3M Hybrid Sealant 760, 3M DP 190, 3M DP 125, and 3M 1099 Scotch Weld Adhesive, all of which are produced by 3M of 3M Center, St. Paul, Minn. 55144. Additionally, Ashland Aroset 1930 produced by Ashland Inc of Covington, Ky. 41012 is another example of a suitable adhesive. Further, SikaLastomer-68 produced by Sika Corporation of Madison Heights, Mich. 48071, is example of a suitable carrier tape. The following companies make similar or competing adhesive to those named above: Carlisle Syntec of Carlisle, Pa., Carlisle Hardcast Incorporated of Wylie, Tex., and Firestone Building Products of Indianapolis, Ind. It should be appreciated that the adhesives and carrier tapes identified above may be identified as adhesives alone, or as carrier tape alone, or any combination of carrier tape and adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows another example implementation in which the binding agent may be a coating of thermoplastic material <b>90</b> applied to one or more surfaces of the mounting plate <b>20</b> placed into contact with the polymeric membrane <b>10</b>. For example, the polymeric membrane <b>10</b> may be a thermoplastic membrane. The mounting plate <b>20</b> may be located at a desired location on the polymeric membrane <b>10</b>, and the coating <b>90</b> may be heated to form a bond between the mounting plate <b>20</b> and the polymeric membrane <b>10</b>. In some instances, the coating <b>90</b> may be heated by heating the mounting plate <b>20</b>, such as with a thermoinduction welder or hot iron. In other instances, energy may be applied more directly to the coating <b>90</b>, such as with sonic welding. For example, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may be affixed using the coating <b>90</b> such as by dielectrical or sonic or vibration welding, solvent bonding, heat bonding (such as using induction heating, infra red heating, hot air heating, or hot iron heating), any combination of the above, or in any other suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It should be appreciated that thermoplastic coating <b>90</b>, as well as the thermoplastic coatings described in the other embodiments herein, may be represented in a variety of forms. Such forms include, but are not limited to: solids, liquids, or any mixtures of material phases suitable for the implementations disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A further example mounting system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a mounting plate <b>20</b> secured to a polymeric membrane <b>10</b> (e.g., a thermoplastic membrane) with a binding agent <b>100</b>. According to various implementations, the binding agent <b>100</b> may be, for example, a coating of thermoplastic material applied to a contact surface of the mounting plate <b>20</b>. With the thermoplastic coating, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may be located at a desired location on the polymeric membrane <b>10</b> and heated to bind the mounting plate <b>20</b> to the polymeric membrane <b>10</b>. Alternatively, any adhesive or carrier tape, such as the adhesives and carrier tapes described above, may be used to secure the mounting plate <b>20</b> to the membrane <b>10</b>. The combination of the mounting plate <b>20</b> and the polymeric membrane <b>10</b> may be considered a mounting assembly <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the mounting assembly <b>110</b> may be attached to a polymeric membrane <b>120</b>. In the present example, the polymeric membrane <b>120</b> may be a thermoplastic membrane. However, in other instances, the polymeric membrane <b>120</b> may be a thermoset membrane. The mounting assembly <b>110</b> may be attached to the polymeric membrane <b>120</b> in numerous ways. For example, the polymeric membrane <b>10</b> of the mounting assembly <b>110</b> may be coupled to the polymeric membrane <b>120</b> using one or more of the methods described above in regards to the bonding of mounting plate <b>20</b> to polymeric membrane <b>10</b>. In other instances, a bonding agent <b>130</b>, such as a carrier tape and/or adhesive (such as the carrier tape and adhesive, described respectively above) may be used. It should be appreciated that bonding agent <b>130</b> may be another bonding medium, including various bonding materials or various bonding members. Similar to above, the carrier tape may be applied in pieces, such as one or more strips or sheets. Further, as also described above, the carrier tape may be formed to correspond to geometry of the mounting assembly <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate an alternate implementation for securing the mounting assembly <b>110</b> to the polymeric membrane <b>120</b>. As shown, a central portion <b>140</b> of the mounting assembly <b>110</b> may be secured to the polymeric membrane <b>120</b> with an adhesive material <b>145</b>, such as one or more pieces of carrier tape or adhesive, such as the carrier tape and adhesive described above. Another attachment method or material may be used around a perimeter portion <b>150</b>. For example, a coating of thermoplastic material <b>155</b> at one or more locations along the perimeter portion <b>150</b> may be used to secure the perimeter portion <b>150</b> to the polymeric membrane <b>120</b>. The coating of thermoplastic material <b>155</b> may be bonded using one or more of the methods described above. Alternately, one or more of an adhesive or carrier tape may be used on the perimeter portion <b>150</b>. For example, the bonding material used on the perimeter portion <b>150</b> may act to further secure the mounting assembly <b>110</b> or as a waterproofing material.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">It is noted that, in some instances, a coating of thermoplastic material may be used to bond one thermoplastic membrane to another same or similar thermoplastic membrane. In other instances, the thermoplastic material may be omitted. For example, some thermoplastic membranes may be joined using one or more of the welding techniques above without the aid of a bonding material. On the other hand, a coating of thermoplastic membrane may not be capable of bonding a thermoplastic membrane or thermoset membrane to another thermoset membrane. In such instances, an adhesive, such as an adhesive or carrier tape may be used to bond such dissimilar materials to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some instances, the polymeric membrane <b>120</b> may be the same or a similar thermoplastic as a thermoplastic forming the thermoplastic membrane <b>10</b>, such as one or more of the thermoplastics described above. However, the thermoplastics forming the respective thermoplastic membrane <b>10</b> and the thermoplastic membrane <b>120</b> may be different while still bondable with or without the use of a thermoplastic material. In some instances, the thermoplastic membrane <b>120</b> may form an outer surface of a roof structure. However, the description is not so limited, and the present description may be applicable to a thermoplastic membrane in any desired application.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The mounting plate <b>20</b> may be of any desired shape. For example, the mounting plate may be circular, rectangular, square, elongated, or be of any other size or shape. Example mounting plates are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6E</figref> show various views of a circular mounting plate <b>20</b> having a plurality of concentric ridges <b>21</b> formed therein as well as a central cavity <b>22</b> that may be used to capture a head of a protrusion, as discussed in a similar manner above. As also described above, the central cavity <b>22</b> may accept a protrusion of different sizes. The protrusion may extend through opening <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-E</figref>, the example mounting plate <b>20</b> also includes cavities <b>22</b> to accept the heads of protrusions. The protrusions may extend through openings <b>23</b> formed in a wall of the cavities <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-D</figref> are various views of another example mounting plate <b>20</b>. The mounting plate <b>20</b> may include various ridges <b>24</b> formed therein along with a cavity <b>22</b> and opening <b>23</b>. Again, the cavity <b>22</b> may be used to capture an end portion of a protrusion extending through the opening <b>23</b>. The mounting plate <b>20</b> may also include openings <b>25</b> formed around a periphery thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, for the example mounting plate <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A-8D</figref> along with others within the scope of the disclosure, the cavities <b>22</b>, openings <b>23</b>, and/or the combination thereof may be operable to prevent rotation of the protrusion relative to the mounting plate <b>20</b> while also accepting protrusions of different sizes. Additionally, the respective sizes of the ridges <b>24</b>, openings <b>23</b>, cavities <b>22</b>, as well as other aspects of the mounting plates <b>20</b> may be altered to any desired size.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Another example mounting system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in which a mounting plate <b>20</b> is disposed between a first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> and a second polymeric membrane <b>510</b>. Fasteners <b>520</b> extend through the mounting plate <b>20</b>, the second polymeric membrane <b>510</b>, and into a substructure <b>530</b>. The first polymeric membrane <b>510</b> overlays a first surface <b>540</b> of the mounting plate <b>20</b> and includes an opening <b>550</b> through which the protrusion <b>30</b> extends. A bonding material <b>560</b> may be used to adhere the first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> to the mounting plate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some instances, the bonding material <b>560</b> may be a coating of a thermoplastic material applied to a portion of the first surface <b>540</b> between the protrusion <b>30</b> and openings <b>570</b> formed in the mounting plate <b>20</b> through with the fasteners <b>520</b> extend. Still further, in some instances, the bonding material <b>560</b> may be applied and the first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> coupled therewith to the mounting plate <b>20</b> during one or more manufacturing processes. That is, bonding the first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> to the mounting plate <b>20</b> with the bonding material <b>560</b> may be performed remote from a job site, such as at a manufacturing facility. In other instances, the first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> may be bonded to the mounting plate <b>20</b> with the bonding material <b>560</b> at a jobsite. The bonding material <b>560</b> may be a coating of thermoplastic material and used to bond the two components in one or more of the methods described above. In addition to adhering the first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> to the mounting plate <b>20</b>, the bonding material <b>560</b> may also form a seal preventing or substantially preventing fluids from penetrating through the opening <b>550</b> formed through the openings <b>570</b> and into the substructure <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A bonding material <b>580</b> may also be applied to the first surface <b>540</b> of the mounting plate <b>20</b>. In some instances, the bonding material <b>580</b> may also be used to secure the first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> to the mounting plate <b>20</b>, such as after the fasteners <b>520</b> have been used to secure the mounting plate <b>20</b> to the substructure <b>530</b>. Utilizing the bonding material <b>580</b> after fasteners <b>520</b> have been applied avoids the need to puncture the first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> for the fastener <b>570</b>. Thus, in some instances, the bonding material <b>560</b> may be used to secure only a portion of the first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> to the mounting plate <b>20</b> while still allowing passage of the fasteners <b>520</b> through the openings <b>570</b> without the need to puncture the first polymeric membrane <b>500</b>. The bonding material <b>580</b> may be utilized thereafter to secure the first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> to the mounting plate <b>20</b> thereby also providing a seal. The first polymeric membrane <b>500</b> may also be secured to the second polymeric membrane <b>510</b> with a bonding material <b>590</b>. Also, a coating or bonding material may be omitted where the polymeric membranes are capable of being joined without such materials. For example, the membranes may be thermoplastic membranes capable of being joined using one or more of the bonding techniques described above. In such instances, the bonding material <b>590</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A bonding material <b>600</b> may also be used to secure the mounting plate <b>20</b> to the second polymeric membrane <b>510</b>. The bonding materials <b>560</b>, <b>580</b>, <b>590</b>, and <b>600</b> cooperate to form a seal around the mounting plate <b>20</b> to aid in preventing or substantially reducing penetration of fluids and/or debris into the substructure <b>530</b>. One or more of the bonding materials <b>560</b>, <b>580</b>, <b>590</b>, and <b>600</b> may be a coating of a thermoplastic material and used to form a bond using one or more of the techniques described above. In some instances, the bonding materials <b>560</b>, <b>580</b>, and <b>590</b> may be the same material, such as a coating of thermoplastic material <b>610</b>, and may be applied to the mounting plate <b>20</b>, as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Alternately, one or more of the bonding materials <b>560</b>, <b>580</b>, <b>590</b>, and <b>600</b> may be a carrier tape or adhesive as also described above. In still other implementations, one or more of the bonding materials <b>560</b>, <b>580</b>, <b>590</b>, and/or <b>600</b> may be omitted. For example, in some implementations, the polymeric membranes <b>500</b>, <b>510</b> may be secured directly to each other using one or more of the joining techniques described above without the use of a bonding material. Still further, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may also be formed from a material that is joinable to one or more of the polymeric membrane <b>500</b> and/or polymeric membrane <b>510</b> without the use of a bonding agent using one or more of the techniques described above. In such instances, one or more of the bonding materials <b>560</b>, <b>580</b>, and/or <b>600</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The mounting plate <b>20</b> is shown with a protrusion <b>30</b> includes, although the protrusion <b>30</b> may be omitted. Alternately, the mounting plate <b>20</b> may be fixedly attached to another object.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> show another example system <b>700</b> in which one or more mounting plates <b>710</b> are secured to a structure <b>720</b>. For example, the structure <b>720</b> may be a roof structure, although structure <b>720</b> is not so limited but may encompass other structures, such as one or more of the structures identified above or other suitable structure. In some instances, the mounting plates <b>710</b> may be coupled to the structure <b>720</b> with fasteners, although the mounting plates <b>710</b> may be attached in other ways. A polymeric membrane <b>725</b> is applied over the mounting plates <b>710</b>, such as by unrolling a roll of the polymeric membrane <b>725</b>. An example mounting plate <b>710</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The mounting plate <b>710</b> may include a protrusion <b>730</b>. Further, in some implementations, the protrusion <b>730</b> may include a piercing portion <b>740</b> adapted to puncture the polymeric membrane <b>725</b>. Also, a portion of the protrusion <b>730</b> may include a fastening portion <b>735</b> that may be used to attach a structure to the mounting plate. For example, in some instances, the fastening portion <b>735</b> may be a threaded portion. However other fastening mechanisms may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">One or more of the mounting plates <b>710</b> may be secured to the structure <b>720</b>, such as in an array or any other configuration. The mounting plates <b>710</b> may be secured with fasteners and/or with one or more of the techniques described herein (e.g., using a coating of thermoplastic material, carrier tape, adhesive, etc.). With the mounting plates <b>710</b> secured to the structure <b>720</b>, the polymeric membrane <b>725</b> may be overlaid. The mounting plate <b>725</b> may be made to extend through the polymeric membrane <b>725</b> such as by puncturing the polymeric membrane <b>725</b> with the piercing portion <b>740</b>. In other implementations, the polymeric membrane <b>725</b> may have preformed openings to allow the protrusions <b>730</b> to extend therethrough. The polymeric membrane <b>725</b> may be secured to the mounting plate <b>710</b> using one or more of the techniques described above. For example, the mounting plate <b>710</b> may be coupled to the polymeric membrane <b>725</b> with a bonding material <b>727</b>. The bonding material <b>727</b> may be one or more of the materials discussed above and the coupling may be formed using one or more of the methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows another example system <b>900</b> including a mounting plate <b>910</b> coupled to a substructure <b>920</b>. Among other uses, the system <b>900</b> may be applicable to roofing applications. The mounting plate <b>910</b> is shown as being attached with fasteners <b>930</b>. However, other techniques may be used to secure the mounting plate <b>910</b> to the substructure <b>920</b>. The mounting plate <b>910</b> may include a protrusion <b>940</b> and a piercing portion <b>950</b>. Further, in some implementations, the protrusion <b>940</b> may include a fastening portion <b>955</b>. Additionally, while the protrusion <b>940</b> is shown as an integral portion of the mounting plate <b>910</b>, the protrusion <b>940</b> may be attached to the mounting plate <b>910</b> using a fastening mechanism. For example, in some implementations, the protrusion <b>940</b> may be attached to the mounting plate <b>910</b> via a threaded connection. An insulating member <b>960</b> may be disposed above the substructure <b>920</b>. An attachment member <b>970</b> may be secured to the protrusion <b>940</b>, such as by engaging the fastening portion <b>950</b>. In some implementations, the fastening portion <b>950</b> and attachment member <b>970</b> may have a threaded engagement, although other attachment interfaces may be used. A polymeric membrane <b>965</b> overlays the insulating member <b>960</b> and may be bonded to the attachment member <b>970</b> with a bonding material <b>980</b>. In some implementations, the bonding material <b>980</b> may be a coating of thermoplastic material applied to attachment member <b>970</b>. In other implementations, a carrier tape and/or an adhesive may be used to couple polymeric membrane <b>965</b> to the attachment member <b>970</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In addition, the described methods and systems can also reduce damage to a polymeric membrane. For example, when objects are unattached but are in contact, debris may become lodged between the object and the polymeric membrane, and, because of the relative movement between the two, the debris may act as an abrasive on the polymeric membrane. Over time, holes, rips, or other damage may occur to the polymeric membrane exposing the underlying structure to the environment, such as moisture, wind, etc. This exposure can cause damage to the structure. However, the present disclosure describes methods and systems that avoid these drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Additionally, some of the methods and systems described herein also provide for securing one or more objects to a polymeric membrane without piercing the polymeric membrane. Consequently, objects remain attached to the polymeric membrane without providing a pathway for moisture or other objects, e.g., insects, debris, etc., to pass through the membrane. Again, this can have particular value in waterproofing covering applications where an unperforated covering is greatly desired.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Another example system <b>1000</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The system <b>1000</b> includes a polymeric membrane <b>1010</b>, a ridge member <b>1020</b>, and a bonding member <b>1030</b>. In some implementations, the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b> may form a portion of a roof structure, such as an exterior membrane. The ridge member <b>1020</b> may be coupled to the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b> by the bonding member <b>1030</b>. In some instances, the bonding member <b>1030</b> may be a double sided carrier tape similar to the carrier tape described above. In some implementations, the adhesive on the sides of the carrier tape may be selected to provide a bond according to the material forming the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b> and/or the ridge member <b>1020</b>. In other implementations, the bonding member <b>1030</b> may be an adhesive selected to adhere polymeric membrane <b>1010</b> to the ridge member <b>1020</b>. In some instances, the adhesive may be an adhesive similar to the adhesive described above.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The bonding member <b>1030</b> may occupy a channel <b>1040</b> formed in a base <b>1050</b> of the ridge member <b>1020</b>. Lips <b>1055</b> may also be formed in the ridge member <b>1020</b> to aid in preventing intrusion of fluids and other materials into the channel <b>1040</b>. A benefit of the bonding member <b>1030</b> is that while coupling the ridge member <b>1020</b> to the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b>, the bonding member <b>1030</b> may have a bonding strength less than the yield strength of the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b> and/or the ridge member <b>1020</b>. Consequently, the bonding member <b>1030</b> will yield, separating the ridge member <b>1020</b> from the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b> when a shearing load on the ridge member <b>1020</b> exceeds the strength of the bonding member <b>1030</b>. Consequently, the bonding member <b>1030</b> will yield without damaging either the ridge member <b>1020</b> or the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b>. For example, in an application in which the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b> and ridge member <b>1020</b> form an exterior portion of a roof structure, a shearing force on the ridge member <b>1020</b>, for example, caused by a sheet of ice formed on the roof structure, would not tear the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b> as the ice sheet moves down a slope of the roof. Rather, the shearing force would merely sever the ridge member <b>1020</b> from the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b>. In other implementations, the bonding member <b>1030</b> may have a yield strength equal to or greater than one or more of the ridge member <b>1020</b> and/or the polymeric membrane <b>1010</b>.</p>
