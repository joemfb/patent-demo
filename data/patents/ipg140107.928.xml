<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire which is suitable as, for example, a passenger car tire and a motorcycle tire, particularly as a runflat tire, and which has various tire performances improved with achieving weight reduction.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As a runflat tire capable of traveling for a relatively long distance in a deflated condition that the tire loses air pressure due to a puncture, there is known, for example, a tire of so-called side-reinforced type wherein a side-reinforcing rubber layer having a crescent-shaped cross section is disposed in each sidewall portion (see for example Patent Literature 1). In the runflat tire of this type, a plurality of carcass plies are used in order to enhance a load-supporting ability. Further, a rayon fiber cord which has a good heat resistance is used as a carcass cord in order to secure a durability in runflat mode, since the tire temperature in runflat mode is very high as compared with that during normal running in the inflated state.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0004">Tires having the above-mentioned structure have a necessary minimum durability, but further improvement in runflat durability and steering stability is strongly desired from the viewpoints of recent demands for high running speed and long running distance in runflat mode.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pneumatic tire which can enhance the steering stability and durability in runflat running, with achieving weight reduction, to achieve a high running speed and a long running distance in runflat running when used as a runflat tire, and which can achieve, in normal running, enhancement of the steering stability, a high running speed and a long running distance with achieving weight reduction when used as a tire for passenger car or motorcycle. The present invention is based on using, as a carcass cord, an aramid fiber cord which has a heat resistance superior to that of a rayon fiber cord and a high elasticity.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means to Solve the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0006">In order to achieve the object mentioned above, the invention as claimed in claim <b>1</b> of the present application is directed to a pneumatic tire including a carcass extending from a tread portion to bead cores in bead portions through sidewall portions, and a tread-reinforcing cord layer disposed radially outward of the carcass and in the tread portion, and is characterized in that in the meridian cross section including the rotational axis of the tire in a normal inner pressure condition that the tire is mounted on a normal rim and inflated to a normal inner pressure,</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0007">the outer surface of the tire has a curved profile composed of a plurality of circular arcs having different radii of curvature,</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">the carcass comprises a carcass ply in which carcass cords are arranged at an angle of 45 to 90&#xb0; with respect to a circumferential direction of the tire and are covered with a topping rubber, and</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">an aramid fiber is used for the carcass cords.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">The invention is characterized in that the carcass cords have a two-bundle twisted structure that two bundles of first-twisted filaments are subjected to final twist.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">The invention is characterized in that the carcass cords have a twist factor T of 0.5 to 0.7 represented by the equation (1):

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">An embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a meridian cross section view of a tire in the normal inner pressure condition wherein a tire <b>1</b> according to the present invention is a runflat tire <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the runflat tire <b>1</b>A in this embodiment includes a carcass <b>6</b> that extends from a tread portion <b>2</b> to bead cores <b>5</b> in bead portions <b>4</b> through sidewall portions <b>3</b>, and a tread-reinforcing cord layer <b>7</b> that is disposed radially outward of the carcass <b>6</b> in the tread portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">The carcass <b>6</b> comprises at least one carcass ply in which carcass cords are disposed at an angle of 45 to 90&#xb0; with respect to the tire circumferential direction and covered with a topping rubber. In this embodiment is shown a carcass composed of a single carcass ply <b>6</b>A of carcass cords arranged at an angle of 80 to 90&#xb0;. The carcass ply <b>6</b>A is composed of a ply body portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>that extends between the bead cores <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>, and ply turnup portions <b>6</b><i>b </i>that are continuous with the ply body portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>and are turned up around the bead cores <b>5</b> from the axially inside to the axially outside of the tire.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">A bead apex rubber <b>8</b> for reinforcing the bead portion, which is for example made of a hard rubber having a rubber hardness of 65 to 98, is disposed between the ply body portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the ply turnup portion <b>6</b><i>b </i>to radially outwardly extend from the bead core <b>5</b> in a tapered manner. The &#x201c;rubber hardness&#x201d; as used herein denotes a hardness measured by a durometer type A at 23&#xb0; C. Radial height &#x201c;ha&#x201d; of the bead apex rubber <b>8</b> from a bead base line BL is not particularly limited. However, if the height of the bead apex rubber <b>8</b> is too small, the runflat durability may be deteriorated, and if the height is too large, the tire weight may excessively increase or the ride comfort may be deteriorated. Therefore, it is preferred that the height &#x201c;ha&#x201d; of the bead apex rubber <b>8</b> is from 10 to 60%, especially 20 to 50%, of the section height SH of the tire.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">In this embodiment, the carcass ply <b>6</b>A has a so-called high turnup structure wherein the ply turnup portion <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the carcass <b>6</b> extends radially outwardly beyond the radially outer end of the bead apex rubber <b>8</b> and terminates so that outer end <b>6</b><i>be </i>of the turnup portion <b>6</b><i>b </i>is sandwiched between the ply body portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the tread-reinforcing cord layer <b>7</b>. This structure can effectively reinforce the sidewall portion <b>3</b> by the use of single carcass ply <b>6</b>A. Also, since the outer end <b>6</b><i>be </i>of the ply turnup portion <b>6</b><i>b </i>is located apart from the sidewall portion <b>3</b> that is greatly bent during runflat running, damages occurring from the outer end <b>6</b><i>be </i>can be suitably suppressed. The axial width EW of the overlapping part of the turnup portion <b>6</b><i>b </i>with the tread-reinforcing cord layer <b>7</b> is preferably at least 5 mm, more preferably at least 10 mm. It is also preferably at most 40 mm, more preferably at most 30 mm, from the viewpoint of weight reduction. In case of forming the carcass <b>6</b> using a plurality of carcass plies, it is preferable that at least one carcass ply has such a high turnup structure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">The tread-reinforcing cord layer <b>7</b> in this embodiment comprises a belt <b>9</b> superposed on the carcass <b>6</b>, and a band <b>10</b> superposed outward of the belt <b>9</b>. The belt <b>9</b> comprises at least two belt plies (in this embodiment, two belt plies <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B) in each of which belt cords are arranged at an angle, for example, of 10 to 45&#xb0; with respect to the tire circumferential direction and covered with a topping rubber. The belt plies are stacked so that the belt cords in one ply crosses the cords in the other belt ply, whereby the rigidity of the belt is enhanced to strongly reinforce the tread portion <b>2</b> over approximately full width thereof by a hoop effect.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">The band <b>10</b> comprises at least one band ply in which a band cord is spirally wound at an angle of 5&#xb0; or less with respect to the tire circumferential direction and covered with a topping rubber. The band serves to bind the belt <b>9</b>, thereby enhancing the steering stability, high speed durability and the like. As the band ply are adoptable a pair of right and left edge band plies which are disposed to cover only axially outer edge portions of the belt <b>9</b>, a full band ply which covers approximately full width of the belt <b>9</b>, and a combination of them. The band <b>10</b> shown in this embodiment comprises a single full band ply. The tread-reinforcing cord layer <b>7</b> may be formed of only belt <b>9</b> or only band <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">In order to secure the runflat performances, side-reinforcing rubber layers <b>11</b> are disposed in the sidewall portions <b>3</b>. The side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> has a cross section of such a crescent-shape that it has the maximum thickness at its center portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>and extends radially from the center portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>toward both a radially inner end <b>11</b><i>i </i>and a radially outer end <b>11</b><i>o </i>with gradually decreasing the thickness, respectively. The inner end <b>11</b><i>i </i>is located radially inward of the radially outer end of the bead apex rubber <b>8</b>, and the outer end <b>11</b><i>o </i>is located axially inward of an outer end <b>7</b><i>e </i>of the tread-reinforcing cord layer <b>7</b>. It is preferable that the radial width Wi of an overlapping part of the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> with the bead apex rubber <b>8</b> is from 5 to 50 mm, and the axial width Wo of an overlapping part of the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> with the tread-reinforcing cord layer <b>7</b> is from 0 to 50 mm, whereby occurrence of a difference in rigidity at the outer and inner ends <b>11</b><i>o </i>and <b>11</b><i>i </i>of the reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> is controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">In this embodiment, the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> is disposed axially inward (on a tire cavity side) of the ply body portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the carcass <b>6</b> and, therefore, when the sidewall portion <b>3</b> is subject to a flexural deformation, mainly a compressive load acts on the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> and a tensile load acts on the carcass ply <b>6</b>A which includes a cord material. Since a rubber material is resistant to the compressive load and a cord material is resistant to the tensile load, the configuration as mentioned above of the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> can efficiently enhance the flexural rigidity of the sidewall portion <b>3</b>, thus effectively decreasing a vertical flex of a tire in runflat mode. It is preferable that the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> has a rubber hardness of at least 60, especially at least 65. If the hardness is less than 60, the compressive strain in runflat mode is large, so sufficient runflat performances are not obtained. If the hardness is too high, the longitudinal spring constant of a tire excessively increases to lower the ride comfort. From such points of view, it is preferable that the hardness of the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> is at most 90, especially at most 80. The maximum thickness &#x201c;t&#x201d; of the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> is suitably selected depending on tire size, kind of the tire and the like. In case of tires for passenger cars, the maximum thickness &#x201c;t&#x201d; is usually from 5 to 20 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">In this embodiment, a rim-protecting rib <b>12</b> is convexly disposed in the bead portion <b>4</b>. The rim-protecting rib <b>12</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a rib projecting from a base profile line &#x201c;j&#x201d; to cover a rim flange JF. It has a trapezoidal cross section which is enclosed by a projecting face <b>12</b><i>c </i>which projects most axially outwardly, a radially inner slope <b>12</b><i>i </i>which smoothly continues from the projecting face <b>12</b><i>c </i>to the axially outer surface of the bead portion, and a radially outer slope <b>12</b><i>o </i>which smoothly continues from the projecting face <b>12</b><i>c </i>to the base profile line &#x201c;j&#x201d; in the vicinity of a tire maximum width point M. The radially inner slope <b>12</b><i>i </i>is a concave arc-like face having a larger radius &#x201c;r&#x201d; of curvature than an arc-like portion of the rim flange JF, and serves to protect the rim flange JF from stones in normal running condition. It is also serves to decrease the amount of deformation of the bead portion in runflat running condition, thus improving the steering stability in runflat running and the runflat durability, since the radially inner slope <b>12</b><i>i </i>will contact the rim flange JF with leaning against the arc-like portion of the rim flange JF.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">In the present invention, an aramid fiber is used in the carcass cords in order to improve the runflat steering stability and the runflat durability.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">The aramid fiber is known as a high elastic fiber, and can enhance the load-supporting ability of runflat tire <b>1</b>A by using it in carcass cords of the runflat tire <b>1</b>A. Therefore, it is possible to reduce deformation of the tire in runflat mode while achieving weight reduction based on, for example, decrease in number of carcass plies, diameter of carcass cords, and/or cord arrangement density (number of cord ends). Furthermore, decrease in elastic modulus of the aramid fiber is small even at a high temperature of 100 to 150&#xb0; C. as compared with other organic fiber cord materials and, therefore, the aramid fiber has an excellent heat resistance. Therefore, even if the tire temperature elevates during runflat running, it is possible to prevent occurrence of damage owing to lowering of strength of the carcass cords, increase in tire deformation amount owing to lowering of elastic modulus, and accompanying further elevation of tire temperature. Thus, the runflat durability can be improved. Further, it is possible to improve the steering stability in runflat mode, since the high elastic modulus can be maintained to enhance the tire rigidity even if the tire temperature elevates. Thus, high running speed and long running distance in runflat mode can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">However, the aramid fiber tends to be inferior in fatigue resistance owing to high elasticity. Therefore, in this embodiment, to the carcass cords <b>20</b> is applied a two bundle twist structure wherein, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, two bundles <b>21</b> (strands <b>21</b>) of first-twisted filaments of aramid fiber are twisted together. Furthermore, the twisting of two bundles (final twist) is carried out at a higher twist factor T than that conventionally employed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">The &#x201c;twist factor T&#x201d; is represented, as well known, by the following equation (1):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>T=N</i>&#xd7;&#x221a;{square root over ({(0.125<i>&#xd7;D/</i>2)/&#x3c1;})}&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
in which N is the number of final twists of cord per 10 cm, D is a total nominal dtex of single cord (fineness), and &#x3c1; is a specific gravity of a cord material.
</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">A twist factor T as high as 0.5 to 0.7 is adopted, whereby the fatigue resistance that is a drawback of the aramid fiber can be improved and, therefore, the runflat durability can be greatly improved as compared with conventional rayon cords. If the twist factor T of the carcass cord <b>20</b> is less than 0.5, the effect of improving the fatigue resistance is small, so the runflat durability cannot be sufficiently improved. If the twist factor T is more than 0.7, the twist processing becomes difficult, so it is industrially disadvantageous. It is preferable that the twist factor T is 0.6 or more, since the fatigue resistance of cords can be further improved to improve the runflat durability.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">A two bundle twist structure is applied to the carcass cords <b>20</b> in order to exhibit an excellent reinforcing effect by utilizing a high elasticity which is an important property of the aramid fiber. In this case, there is preferred a so-called balanced twisting that the number of first twists is the same as the number of the final twists. However, the number of first twists and the number of final twists may be different so long as the ratio of the number of first twists to the number of final twists (number of first twists/number of final twists) falls within the range of 0.2 to 2.0, preferably 0.5 to 1.5.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">The above-mentioned total dtex D (fineness) of a single cord is not particularly limited, but is preferably from 1,500 to 5,000 dtex for runflat tires. Further, it is preferable that a product of the number of cord ends &#x201c;n&#x201d; (cords/5 cm) and the total dtex D is from 70,000 to 150,000. If the product is less than 70,000, the runflat durability and the steering stability come short, though aramid fiber is used, and if it is more than 150,000, the rigidity of carcass becomes too large, so the ride comfort is impaired and the weight and cost unnecessarily increase. From such points of view, the product D&#xd7;n is more preferably at least 100,000 and is at most 120,000.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">Damages of the carcass cords <b>20</b> arising from fatigue resistance are easy to occur at portions which receive a compressive strain when a tire is deformed, that is to say, at a bead side portion <b>6</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> of the ply turnup portion <b>6</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, in this embodiment, the rim-protecting rib <b>12</b> is convexly disposed in the bead portion <b>4</b> and, therefore, bead deformation in runflat running is decreased and the compressive strain is hard to act on the carcass cords <b>20</b>. As a result, fatigue damage of the carcass cords made of aramid fiber can be further suppressed, whereby the runflat durability can be further improved. In other words, in tires using carcass cords made of aramid fiber, it is preferable to use the rim-protecting rib <b>12</b> from the viewpoint of suppressing the fatigue damage of the cords.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">Further, in this embodiment, as a topping rubber of the carcass ply <b>6</b>A is used a rubber having a high elasticity as compared with a conventional carcass topping rubber, i.e., a rubber having a complex modulus E* of 5 to 13 MPa. The complex modulus E* of a conventional topping rubber for carcass is about 3.8 MPa. By using such a high elastic rubber as a topping rubber, a strain generating at the carcass cords <b>20</b> when a tire is deformed can be decreased, thus further improvement of the runflat durability can be achieved. If the complex modulus E* of the carcass topping rubber is less than 5 MPa, the above effect is not expected, and if the complex modulus E* is more than 13 MPa, the rubber becomes too hard, so the ride comfort is remarkably deteriorated. Therefore, it is preferable that the complex modulus E* is 5.5 MPa or more, especially 6 MPa or more, and it is 11 MPa or less, especially 9 MPa or less.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">In the meridian cross section of the tire in the above-mentioned normal inner pressure condition, the profile of outer surface <b>2</b>A of the tire is formed of a plurality of circular arcs having different radii of curvature. In particular, in case of the runflat tire <b>1</b>A, it is preferable that the profile is formed of a plurality of such circular arcs that the radius R of curvature gradually decreases from a tire equator point CP which is a point of intersection of the tire outer surface <b>2</b>A with the tire equator plane C, toward a ground contact edge Te side, whereby the rubber volume of the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> can be minimized to enhance weight reduction and ride comfort. In particular, these effects can be more highly exhibited when a special profile as proposed in Japanese Patent No. 2994989 is adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">To explain in more detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, if &#x201c;P&#x201d; is defined as a point on the tire outer surface <b>2</b>A which is apart from the tire equator plane C by a distance SP of 45% of a maximum section width SW of the tire, the radius RC of curvature of the tire outer surface <b>2</b>A is set to gradually decrease from the tire equator point CP to the point P. The above-mentioned &#x201c;maximum section width SW&#x201d; of the tire denotes the maximum width on a base profile line &#x201c;j&#x201d; of the tire outer surface <b>2</b>A, and the base profile line &#x201c;j&#x201d; denotes a smooth profile line of the outer surface <b>2</b>A of a tire from which local concave and convex parts such as fine ribs and grooves showing letters, figures and marks for decoration or information, a rim-protecting rib <b>12</b> for preventing a rim from coming off and a side-protecting rib for protecting from a cut.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0053">Ranges RYi satisfying the above equations are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> wherein RY<b>60</b>=Y<b>60</b>/SH, RY<b>75</b>=Y<b>75</b>/SH, RY<b>90</b>=Y<b>90</b>/SH and RY<b>100</b>=Y<b>100</b>/SH. It is reported in Japanese Patent No. 2994989 that since a tread having a profile satisfying the above equations is very round as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the footprint of the tire is in a longitudinally long elliptic shape that the ground contact width is small and the ground contact length is large, and the noise performance and aquaplaning performance can be improved. If the values of RY<b>60</b>, RY<b>75</b>, RY<b>90</b> and RY<b>100</b> are less than the above ranges, the tread portion <b>2</b> becomes flat and the profile of the tire outer surface <b>2</b>A approaches a profile of a conventional tire. If they are more than the above ranges, the tread portion <b>2</b> has a markedly convex profile and the ground contact width becomes too small, so necessary running performances in normal running operation cannot be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">Since the aspect ratio of tire, the maximum section width of tire, the maximum height of tire and the like can be approximately determined from tire standards such as JATMA and ETRTO if the tire is size is previously determined, the ranges of RY<b>60</b>, RY<b>75</b>, RY<b>90</b> and RY<b>100</b> can be readily calculated. Therefore, the tire outer surface <b>2</b>A can be suitably determined by depicting it in a smooth curve from the tire equator point CP to the points P mentioned above so as to satisfy the ranges of RY<b>60</b>, RY<b>75</b>, RY<b>90</b> and RY<b>100</b> at respective positions and so as to gradually decrease the radius RC of curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">It is preferable that the above-mentioned tire has a ground contact width CW, which is an axial distance between axially outermost edges of a footprint formed when a tire contacts a ground, within the range of 50 to 65% of the tire maximum section width SW under condition that a load of 80% of a normal load is applied to the tire under a normal inner pressure condition. The reason is that if the ground contact width CW is less than 50% of the maximum section width SW, the wandering performance is deteriorated under normal running condition and uneven wear is easy to occur due to uneven ground contact pressure. If the ground contact width CW is more than 65% of the maximum section width SW, the ground contact width is excessively large and it is difficult to simultaneously achieve both of good passing noise performance and good aquaplaning performance.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">Since such a special profile has the feature that the region of the sidewall portion is short, the volume of a rubber required for the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> can be decreased by adopting it to runflat tires and, therefore, weight reduction and improvement in ride comfort of runflat tires can be achieved. On the other hand, the amount of deformation in tread portion <b>2</b> having a large rubber volume becomes larger as compared with tires having a usual tread profile. Therefore, the carcass cords of aramid fiber having an enhanced heat resistance are also advantageous for tires having this special profile.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">The pneumatic tire <b>1</b> of the present invention can be formed into normal tire <b>1</b>B for passenger cars, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this case, the passenger car tire <b>1</b>B can have approximately the same structure as the above-mentioned runflat tire <b>1</b>A except that the side-reinforcing rubber layer <b>11</b> is not disposed. In the passenger car tire <b>1</b>B, the rigidity of carcass is enhanced by the use of the carcass cords <b>20</b> of aramid fiber, so the steering stability in normal running can be enhanced to achieve high speed running and high performances with achievement of weight reduction. In the case that the above-mentioned high elastic rubber having a complex modulus of 5 to 13 MPa is used as a topping rubber for the carcass ply <b>6</b>A, a strain occurring in the carcass cords <b>20</b> can be reduced as well as further enhancing the steering stability in normal running, so a fatigue damage of the aramid fiber cords can be suppressed to enhance the durability. It is preferable that the total nominal dtex D of the carcass cords <b>20</b> in the passenger car tire <b>1</b>B is from 1,000 to 5,000 dtex, and the product of the total nominal dtex D and the number of cord ends &#x201c;n&#x201d; (per 5 cm) is from 80,000 to 120,000.</p>

In the motorcycle tire <b>1</b>C, too, the rigidity of carcass is enhanced by the use of the carcass cords <b>20</b> of aramid fiber, so the steering stability in normal running can be enhanced to achieve high speed running and high performances with achievement of weight reduction. Further, in the case that the above-mentioned high elastic rubber having a complex modulus of 5 to 13 MPa is used as a topping rubber for the carcass ply <b>6</b>A, a strain occurring in the carcass cords <b>20</b> can be reduced as well as further enhancing the steering stability in normal running, so a fatigue damage of the aramid fiber cords can be suppressed to enhance the durability. It is preferable that the total nominal dtex D of the carcass cords <b>20</b> in the motorcycle tire <b>1</b>C is from 1,000 to 2,500 dtex, and the product of the total nominal dtex D and the number of cord ends &#x201c;n&#x201d; (per 5 cm) is from 80,000 to 120,000.</p>
