<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application hereby claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/285,089, entitled PORTABLE EXPANDABLE SHELTER, filed Dec. 9, 2009, and incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various portable shelters have been developed that are intended to be transported to a desired site and then set up for use at the site. When the portable shelter is no longer needed, it can be reconfigured in a way that may make it more suitable for transportation to another location. Due to their design and construction however, at least some of these portable shelters may require a significant amount of time and labor in order to properly set the shelter up for use, and to reconfigure the portable shelter for transportation when the shelter is no longer needed. At least some of these portable shelters may include various ancillary components that must be assembled and/or installed to enable set up of the portable shelter, and disassembly of such components when the shelter is being prepared for transportation. Yet other portable shelters may be configured so that, whether ready for use or ready for transportation, all the walls of the portable shelter are rigid. Configurations such as these may result in a portable shelter of significant weight that may not be well suited for some applications.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The portable expandable shelters (&#x2018;PES&#x2019;) disclosed herein are suited for a wide variety of uses in a wide variety of environments. Thus, the example aspects disclosed below may be combined in any suitable fashion to provide a desired portable expandable shelter. Moreover, the overall size of PES embodiments disclosed herein may be selected based upon a variety of considerations and, accordingly, the scope of the invention is not limited to any particular size(s) or configuration(s) of PES. Thus, the particular PES embodiments disclosed herein are presented only by way of example.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">At least some of the PES embodiments disclosed herein may be configured and outfitted to suit various commercial, industrial, military, or other, uses. Some specific examples of such uses include, but are not limited to, field offices, field hospitals, decontamination stations, jails/brigs, holding cells, isolation wards, command posts, field morgues, communications centers, camps, laboratories and schools. As well, the PES can be configured and outfitted for use in virtually any physical or climatic environments, including, but not limited to, desert environments, extreme cold environments, and marine environments.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to some example configurations and outfittings, the exterior of the PES can be painted with camouflage or other paint scheme suited to the anticipated environment and/or application in which the expandable portable shelter will be used. Exterior treatments other than paint, or in addition to paint, can likewise be employed. In some embodiments, one or more of the exterior surfaces of the PES may, for example, be substantially smooth. In other embodiments, one or more of the exterior surfaces may, for example, be corrugated. More generally, any exterior surface configuration may be employed, and various types of exterior surface configurations may be combined in a single embodiment so that, for example, a single PES may include both corrugated and smooth exterior surface configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, a PES may include, for example, one or more of communications systems and equipment, plumbing including toilets, hot and cold water, vents and drainage systems, security systems, lighting, locks, climate control systems and equipment such as heaters, ventilators, fans, and air conditioners, and various types of medical equipment and facilities including diagnostic equipment, treatment equipment, and surgical equipment. As well, a PES may include one or more of suitable floor, wall and ceiling coverings, thermal insulation, sound insulation, other insulation, waterproofing treatment, armor, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, and radiation shielding. Additionally, a PES may include, as appropriate, one or more of shelves, lockers, beds, desks, chairs, operating tables, windows and doors. Finally, and more generally, a PES may include any combination of the various outfittings and configuration elements disclosed herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Particular Aspects of Some Example Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">At least some example embodiments conform, in whole or in part, to the shipping container configurations established by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standards. In one particular example then, an enclosure may have dimensions of either 6.1 m. (20 feet) or 12.2 m. (40 feet) in length and 2.44 m. (8 feet) in width and 2.6 m. (8.5 feet) or 2.9 m. (9.5 feet) in height. The width dimension may be as great as 3.05 m. (10 feet). The ISO and related standards may be found in publications such as ISO 1161 Series 1 Freight containers&#x2014;corner fitting&#x2014;specification; ISO 1496-1 Series 1 freight containers&#x2014;Specification and testing&#x2014;Part 1: General cargo containers for general purposes; ISO standards 9000 through 9004&#x2014;quality standards; International Union of Railways (U.I.C.); Transport International des Routiers (T.I.R.); and, Convention for Safe Containers (C.S.C.), all of which are incorporated herein in their respective entireties by this reference.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As suggested above, the aforementioned configurations are simply illustrative examples and a PES may, more generally, be configured with any desired dimensions consistent with the purpose(s) for which that PES may be intended. By way of illustration, the enclosures of some example embodiments of a PES may be greater than about 20 feet long but less than about 40 feet long. The enclosures of yet other example embodiments of a PES may be less than about 20 feet long. In still further examples, the enclosure of a PES may be greater than about 40 feet long.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Consistent with the foregoing, and as suggested below in the discussion of the TRICON, it is also contemplated that a variety of PES enclosures with lengths less than ISO container lengths, such as the 20 feet ISO container length for example, may be employed. By way of example, the TRICON refers to a PES whose enclosure has a length of about one third the length of a 20 foot container, that is, a length of about 6.6 feet. Correspondingly, a BICON refers to a PES whose enclosure has a length of about half the length of a 20 foot container, that is, a length of about 10 feet. Finally, a QUADCON refers to a PES whose enclosure has length that is about one quarter the length of a 20 foot container, that is, a length of about 5 feet. Again, however, these are simply example enclosure lengths, and the scope of the invention is not limited to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning now to the figures, details are provided concerning various example embodiments. In general, the embodiments disclosed in the figures are presented by way of example. Thus, the figures should not be considered as constraining the scope of the invention in any way. In fact, the components disclosed in the figures may be combined as desired to create a PES having a particular configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With particular reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an example embodiment of a PES, denoted as PES <b>100</b>, is disclosed that includes an enclosure <b>102</b>. As noted above, a PES whose enclosure <b>102</b> has a length that is about one third the length of a 20 foot container is referred to herein as a TRICON. In alternative embodiments, the PES <b>100</b> may be implemented as a BICON, QUADCON, or other configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The enclosure <b>102</b> may, consistent with ISO and/or other standards, include structural features <b>104</b> such as slots or other openings that enable the enclosure <b>102</b> to be readily transported by forklift, crane, or helicopter, for example. One or more portions of the enclosure <b>102</b> may be made out of a variety of materials including one or more of metal, composites such as glass composites or carbon composites for example, fabric, plastic, wood, rubber, and fiberglass. Moreover, different portions of the enclosure may be made of different materials and/or different combinations of materials, examples of which include the aforementioned materials. The various materials employed in the construction of the enclosure <b>102</b> may include both rigid materials and non-rigid materials.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The TRICON, BICON and QUADCON PES configurations, for example, may be particularly useful in certain applications inasmuch as the smaller size of those PES configurations, relative to a 40 foot long freight container for example, enables the PES to be readily transported and airlifted. For example, such PES configurations may be well suited for remote and rugged environments that could present a significant challenge to the transportation and use of a relatively larger shelter, such as a shelter whose size is comparable to a full sized freight container.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As the foregoing makes clear, one useful aspect of some embodiments is that multiple PESs, of any of the BICON, TRICON, QUADCON, or other, configurations, can be removably connected to each other in any desired combination. That is, different PES configurations can be connected together to form a desired combination so that, by way of example, one combination might include a BICON connected to a QUADCON. At least some of the PES combinations are dimensioned so that they can then be transported through container channels using standardized carriers such as trucks, ships, and rail cars. The PESs can also be transported as individual units. This approach may be particularly desirable in some instances as the relatively small size of some of the PESs lends a degree of flexibility in terms of the various ways in which such PESs may be transported. At least some embodiments of the PES are sized and configured to be suited for transportation as air cargo by airplanes or helicopters.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference now to the views presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, further details are provided concerning the example PES <b>100</b>. As indicated in those Figures, the enclosure <b>102</b> of the PES <b>100</b> includes rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B and a bottom <b>102</b>C. The example PES <b>100</b> may also include two sides <b>102</b>D and <b>102</b>E (only side <b>102</b>D is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) which may or may not be rotatable, and which may be connected to the bottom <b>102</b>C. Alternative embodiments of the PES may employ only a single rotatable end and/or one or more rotatable sides.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In general, the movable portion(s) of a PES enable the PES to be changed from the shipping configuration indicated, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where the PES is ready to be transported, and the deployed configuration indicated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the sides <b>102</b>D and <b>102</b>E may be opposing sides, and the ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B may be opposing ends. One or both of the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B may be rotatably connected, such as by a hinge or comparable device(s), to the enclosure <b>102</b>. In some embodiments at least, the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and/or <b>102</b>B may be connected to the PES <b>100</b> near the bottom <b>102</b>C of the enclosure <b>102</b>. As a result of this arrangement, the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B can be moved between a substantially vertical position (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), such as may be employed when the PES <b>100</b> is being transported, and a substantially horizontal position such as may be employed when the PES <b>100</b> is in use (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Moreover, and as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> for example, the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B can assume various intermediate positions between substantially horizontal and substantially vertical.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The enclosure <b>102</b> includes suitable securement devices (not shown) for securing the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B in the substantially vertical position, and the enclosure <b>102</b> may also include securement devices configured to releasably secure the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B in the substantially horizontal position, the substantially vertical position, and/or in intermediate positions between substantially horizontal and substantially vertical. Such securement devices may comprise, for example, locks, pins, and bolts. The aforementioned example securement devices are example structural implementations of a means for releasably securing that may be employed with the ends and/or sides of the enclosure <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While some embodiments of a PES may include two rotatable portions, such as rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B, the scope of the invention is not so limited. Rather, other embodiments may have only a single rotatable portion, while still other embodiments may have more than two rotatable portions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In at least some embodiments, the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B and/or other portions of the enclosure <b>102</b> may include sealing elements so that when the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B are secured in the substantially vertical position, the enclosure <b>102</b> is substantially watertight and/or airtight. As well, the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B and/or other portions of the PES <b>100</b> may operate in conjunction with handles, dampers, hoists, motors, pulleys, ropes, cables, springs and/or other structures or devices to facilitate the raising and lowering of the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B. The aforementioned components, either alone or in various combinations, are examples of structural implementations of a means for moving that may be employed with movable portions of the enclosure <b>102</b> such as the ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b><i>b </i>and/or sides <b>102</b>D and <b>102</b>E.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Some embodiments of a PES may include moveable portions, such as rotatable ends and/or rotatable walls, to which are mounted, either permanently or removably, various structures, systems, equipment or devices. By way of example, a rotatable end in one embodiment of a PES may have foundations mounted to it so that when the rotatable end is in the substantially horizontal position, equipment and other items can be connected to the foundations. More generally, the rotatable end may be configured to include any structures, systems, equipment or devices that are desired to be floor mounted. Thus, when the rotatable end is in the substantially horizontal position, such systems, equipment and devices are positioned on or near the floor of the enclosed space defined by the rotatable end and the foldable frame (discussed below).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With continued attention to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the PES <b>100</b> may further include a pair of foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B that are connected, permanently or removably, to the enclosure <b>102</b> of the PES <b>100</b> and are configured and arranged for motion relative to the enclosure <b>102</b> of the PES <b>100</b>. As used herein, &#x2018;connected&#x2019; embraces both arrangements where one element, such as the foldable frame for example, is directly connected to another element, such as the enclosure for example, as well as arrangements where one element, such as the foldable frame for example, is indirectly connected to another element, such as the enclosure for example, by way of one or more intermediate structures or elements.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Note that in one alternative embodiment, the PES has only a single foldable frame, while in other example embodiments, the PES may include more than two foldable frames. In at least some embodiments, one or both of the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B may include one or more locking mechanisms (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) configured and arranged such that the foldable frame can be locked into a desired position, such as the position indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> for example. The use of such a locking mechanism may help ensure that the foldable frame does not collapse or slip out of position.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B are substantially the same size as each other, such that the respective spaces enclosed by each of the foldable frames, when fully unfolded, are substantially the same size. In yet other embodiments, the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B are of different sizes, such that the respective spaces enclosed by each of the foldable frames, when fully unfolded, are different sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">One or both of the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B may include a plurality of frame elements <b>202</b> joined together in such a way that at least one of the elements is movable relative to another of the elements. Two or more of the frame elements <b>202</b> may be permanently connected to each other, or removably connected to each other. Thus, some of the frame elements <b>202</b> may be joined together with one or more of pins, hinges, slide mechanisms and/or any other device(s) that would permit relative motion between or among two or more of the frame elements <b>202</b> of a particular foldable frame while also ensuring that the two or more frame elements <b>202</b> remain connected to each other. The aforementioned pins, hinges, slide mechanisms and other devices may, in some embodiments, be combined with a locking mechanism to form a mechanism that not only enables relative motion between frame elements <b>202</b> but also enables those frame elements <b>202</b> to be locked into a desired position relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Consistent with their role as load bearing members, discussed in further detail below, example embodiments of the frame elements employed in a foldable frame are strong enough to handle relatively large loads without deforming or failing. As noted elsewhere herein, example embodiments of the PES include an enclosure that may take a form similar in configuration to a portion of an ISO container, or may in fact comprise a portion of an actual ISO container. Thus, at least some embodiments of the foldable frame are robust enough to support, from above, some or all of a side or end of such an enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With more particular reference now to their construction, the frame elements <b>202</b> may be comprised of a variety of different materials. For example, one or more of the frame elements <b>202</b> may comprise one or more of metal, plastic, fiberglass, wood, or carbon fiber material. The frame elements <b>202</b> may be implemented in a variety of different forms as well. For example, one or more of the frame elements <b>202</b> may be flat or round, and tubular or substantially solid. As well, the frame elements <b>202</b> may have various cross-sectional shapes including, but not limited to, flat, round, square, rectangular, polygonal, I-beam, and T-beam. Further, the group of frame elements <b>202</b> used in any given foldable frame may be substantially uniform in terms of their size, shape, and material or may vary in terms of their size, shape and material. More generally however, the scope of the invention is not limited to any particular configuration of frame element(s) <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In at least one embodiment, the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B are connected to the enclosure <b>102</b> at points A (one location at each side) and B (one location at each side) with pins and/or other devices that enable at least a portion of each of the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B to rotate relative to a portion of the enclosure <b>102</b>. Other suitable attachments devices may alternatively be used however. One or both of the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B may be permanently or removably connected to the enclosure <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition to being connected to the enclosure <b>102</b>, the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B are also connected to rotatable end <b>102</b>A and rotatable end <b>102</b>B, respectively. One consequence of this arrangement is that one or more frame elements <b>202</b> of the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B move in unison with a respective rotatable end.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Additionally, because the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B of this embodiment are connected to both the enclosure <b>102</b> and the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B, respectively, the foldable frames <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B are able to support the rotatable end <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b><i>b</i>, respectively, in the substantially horizontal position. In some embodiments at least, such a configuration and arrangement eliminates the need for separate support structures and mechanisms to support the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B in the substantially horizontal position. These and/or other embodiments eliminate, particularly, the need for supporting the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B from below when the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B are in the substantially horizontal position. This functionality may be particularly useful where the surface upon which the PES <b>100</b> is resting or intended to rest is unlevel, soft and/or uneven or otherwise configured and/or oriented such that supporting the rotatable ends <b>102</b>A and/or <b>102</b>B from below would be impractical and/or ineffective.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As the foregoing discussion suggests, at least some embodiments of the foldable frame serve not only to at least partially define the boundaries of a space which can be substantially enclosed with a cover, as discussed below, but also to provide structural support for the movable portion with which the foldable frame is associated. That is, at least some embodiments of a foldable frame constitute load bearing structures, inasmuch as such embodiments serve to support, from above, a movable portion of an enclosure in one or more positions, such as a substantially horizontal position for example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the foldable frame is supplemented with other systems and/or devices that likewise serve to support the movable portion of the enclosure from above. Such systems and devices include, for example, one or more of cables, chains, ropes, tensioners, pulleys, sheaves, springs, motors, and components for manual operation of the aforementioned devices and systems. Such systems and devices may be employed, for example, where the movable portion associated with the foldable frame is relatively large and/or where the movable portion is required to support relatively heavy loads when in the substantially horizontal position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With more specific reference now to the example of rotatable end <b>102</b>A and foldable frame <b>200</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, a rotation of rotatable end <b>102</b>A, for example, from the substantially vertical position to the substantially horizontal position causes foldable frame <b>200</b>A to move from a stowed configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) where the foldable frame <b>200</b>A is substantially disposed within the interior of the enclosure <b>102</b> to a deployed configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Thus, when a user moves rotatable end <b>102</b>A to the position indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the foldable frame <b>200</b>A is automatically moved at the same time to the deployed position indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">One useful aspect of this arrangement and relation is that the PES <b>100</b> can be quickly and easily set up and struck down since there is no need to assemble, and then position, a frame to cover and enclose the additional floor space provided by the rotatable end <b>102</b>A. Instead, the foldable frame <b>200</b>A is automatically deployed as a result of the rotation of the rotatable end <b>102</b>A. In similar fashion, the PES <b>100</b> can be quickly collapsed by simply rotating the rotatable end <b>102</b>A from the substantially horizontal position to the substantially vertical position. That is, since some or all elements of the foldable frame <b>200</b>A move in unison with rotatable end <b>102</b>A, movement of the rotatable end <b>102</b>A to the substantially vertical position causes the foldable frame <b>200</b>A to move automatically to the stowed position.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As the foregoing example illustrates, example embodiments of a PES that includes a foldable frame may eliminate the need for special tools or significant labor in setting up and striking down the PES. As well, the configuration of example embodiments of the PES may enable relatively rapid set up and strike down of the PES. As a further example, the configuration of example embodiments of the PES may eliminate the need for ancillary support mechanisms to maintain the PES in a deployed state.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As noted elsewhere herein, and disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, at least some embodiments of the PES include one or more covers <b>300</b>A and <b>300</b>B that may be permanently or removably connected to a corresponding folding frame and/or enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With particular reference to the example of cover <b>300</b>A, the cover <b>300</b>A may be connected to foldable frame <b>200</b>A so as to move in unison with foldable frame <b>200</b>A and, thus, with the rotatable end <b>102</b>A. More particularly, the cover <b>300</b>A may be connected to foldable frame <b>200</b>A such that when foldable frame <b>200</b>A is moved to the deployed position as a result of movement of the rotatable end <b>102</b>A to the substantially horizontal position, the cover <b>300</b>A unfolds to substantially enclose the extended space cooperatively defined by the rotatable end <b>102</b>A and the foldable frame <b>200</b>A. In similar fashion, movement of the foldable frame <b>200</b>A to the stowed position in the interior of the enclosure <b>102</b>, which results from movement of the rotatable end <b>102</b>A to the substantially vertical position, causes the cover <b>300</b>A to be automatically folded into the interior of the enclosure <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As well, the covers <b>300</b>A and <b>300</b>B may be connected to the enclosure <b>102</b> in such a way that leakage of water and/or air/wind to/from the interface between the enclosure <b>102</b> and the covers <b>300</b>A and <b>300</b>B is substantially prevented. In some embodiments, a cover <b>300</b> may be positioned within its corresponding foldable frame while, in other embodiments, the cover <b>300</b> may be arranged to fit over its corresponding foldable frame.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one example embodiment, a PES may be configured to operate under positive pressure such that the pressure inside the enclosed area defined by the rotatable end(s) and the corresponding cover(s) is greater than the pressure outside the PES. The positive pressure could be established and maintained by any suitable device(s), such as fans or blowers for example. Such a configuration and capability to enable and sustain a positive pressure environment may be useful in environments where, for example, a nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) attack may have occurred or may be anticipated.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With continued attention to a cover, such as covers <b>300</b>A and <b>300</b>B for example, a variety of different covers may be employed in various embodiments. One or more of the covers may comprise a flexible material, or materials, that may or may not be waterproof. Examples of suitable flexible materials include, but are not limited to, fabrics such as canvas, rubberized fabrics, nylon, plastic, ripstop materials, waterproof materials, windproof materials, breathable materials, and flexible materials that incorporate one or more of the aforementioned characteristics and/or materials. As well, the covers may or may not include one or more of the various types of insulation disclosed herein. The covers employed in a particular PES may all be the same, or may differ from each other in one or more ways.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Some or all portions of a given cover may be opaque, partly transmissive to light, or substantially transmissive to light. In at least some embodiments, a cover is provided that is substantially opaque but includes one or more windows that comprise a material that is at least partially transmissive to light. As well, some covers may include one or more openings that can be covered and uncovered by a flap or similar element such that the interior of the extended enclosure can communicate with the outside environment. The flaps may be securable by any suitable device, examples of which include zippers, and a hook and loop closure system. At least some embodiments of a cover may also include one or more portions comprising mesh or similar material that is suited to enable airflow into and out of the area by the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the covers <b>300</b>A and <b>300</b>B may be substantially the same as each other in terms of one or more characteristics such as size, shape and materials. In yet other embodiments, the covers <b>300</b>A and <b>300</b>B may differ from each other in terms of one or more characteristics such as size, shape, and materials.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at least some embodiments of the PES further include a cover <b>400</b> having a door frame <b>502</b> that defines an opening <b>504</b> that can be accessed by way of a door <b>506</b>. The door <b>506</b> may be comprised of any suitable material(s) including, but not limited to, fabric, rubber, composites such as glass composites or carbon composites, metal, glass, wood, fiberglass, and plastic. Thus, the door <b>400</b> may be substantially constructed of rigid material(s), or may alternatively be substantially constructed of flexible material(s), examples of which include the cover materials disclosed herein. In at least one embodiment, the door frame <b>502</b> is connected to a corresponding foldable frame and/or to a movable portion of the enclosure, such as a rotatable end, such that upon unfolding of the foldable frame into the deployed position, the door frame <b>502</b> and door <b>506</b> are automatically deployed to the position indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this example, the cover <b>400</b> includes an opening that is positioned around, and attachable to, the door frame.
