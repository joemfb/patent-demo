<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the inventive subject matter generally relate to the field of wireless communications and, more particularly, to detecting transmission in collocated wireless devices.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When wireless devices are in close proximity to each other, communication from one wireless device may interfere with communication from the other wireless device. For example, when Bluetooth&#xae; and wireless local area network (WLAN) devices operate in close proximity to each other, the radio protocol of one device can interfere with the radio protocol of the other device. Packet traffic arbitration (PTA) may be used to exchange dynamic information between the wireless devices to prevent the wireless devices from transmitting at the same time.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various embodiments are disclosed of a mechanism for detecting transmission in collocated wireless devices. In one embodiment, a method comprises monitoring a power supply line associated with a first wireless network device of a communication system. An indication of an increase in power drawn by the first wireless network device is detected. It is determined that the first wireless network device will transmit a packet based on detecting the indication of the increase in power drawn by the first wireless network device. Communications of a second wireless network device of the communication system are suspended in response to said determining that the first wireless network device will transmit the packet.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The description that follows includes exemplary systems, circuits, methods, techniques, instruction sequences, and computer program products that embody techniques of the present inventive subject matter. However, it is understood that the described embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. For instance, although examples refer to detecting transmission to enable coexistence between WLAN and Bluetooth devices, in other embodiments transmission may be detected in other wireless standards and devices, e.g., WiMAX, ZigBee&#xae;, Wireless USB devices, etc. In other instances, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures, and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obfuscate the description.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Interference between two wireless network devices (e.g., a Bluetooth device and a WLAN device) collocated on a common system and communicating within a common frequency spectrum (e.g., a 2.4 GHz spectrum) can result in performance degradation. Typically, the wireless network devices exchange information to schedule transmission/reception of packets. However, in some implementations, one of the wireless network devices may not notify the other wireless network device before initiating a packet transmission. For example, the Bluetooth device may receive an inquiry frame or a page frame while the Bluetooth device and the WLAN device are in a shared receive mode. According to Bluetooth protocols, in some instances, the Bluetooth device may be required to switch to a transmit mode and transmit a response to the inquiry/page frame. Existing coexistence solutions may not provide a mechanism for the Bluetooth device to provide an indication to the WLAN device, or the WLAN device to detect, that the Bluetooth device will perform a transmit operation in response to the inquiry/page frame. In other words, because the WLAN device is unaware of the Bluetooth device switching from the receive mode into the transmit mode and transmitting the response, collisions between a Bluetooth transmit packet and a WLAN receive packet can occur resulting in loss of information. Also, in some instances, the high power of the Bluetooth transmit signal may damage components of the WLAN device, e.g., when the Bluetooth and WLAN devices are in a shared receive mode.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Functionality can be implemented for a collocated first wireless network device to detect transmissions in a collocated second wireless network device. In one embodiment, a power supply line of the second wireless network device can be monitored to detect an increase in power drawn by the second wireless network device, which can serve as an indication of transmission in the second wireless network device. In another embodiment, signal strength at an I/O pin of the second wireless network device can be compared with reference signal strength to determine whether the second wireless network device will transmit while the first wireless network device is in the receive mode. Additional techniques can be implemented for detecting transmission in the second wireless network device, as will be further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>. By detecting transmission in the second wireless network device, ongoing communications of the first wireless network device can be suspended (e.g., disabling a low noise amplifier (LNA), disabling the receive mode, etc.) without exchange of information between the two collocated wireless network devices. Moreover, loss of information and component damage in the first wireless network device can also be mitigated.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating example architecture of a collocated Bluetooth device and a WLAN device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and the WLAN device <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and the WLAN device <b>140</b> may be collocated on a common system (e.g., on the same circuit board, on distinct circuit boards within the same system, etc.). In other embodiments, the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and the WLAN device <b>140</b> can be embedded on the same chip (e.g., a system on a chip (SoC), an integrated circuit, etc.) The Bluetooth device <b>120</b> comprises a Bluetooth coexistence unit <b>124</b>, a Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b>, and a Bluetooth transmit circuit <b>122</b>. The Bluetooth coexistence unit <b>124</b> is coupled to the Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b> and the Bluetooth transmit circuit <b>122</b>. In one example, the Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b> comprises an LNA <b>171</b>, a mixer <b>172</b>, an amplifier <b>173</b>, a low pass filter <b>174</b>, and an analog to digital converter (ADC) <b>175</b>. The Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b> may also comprise additional components (e.g., amplifiers, filters, decoding units, etc.) for processing a Bluetooth receive packet. In one example, the Bluetooth transmit circuit <b>122</b> comprises a power amplifier <b>176</b>, a mixer <b>177</b>, an amplifier <b>178</b>, a low pass filter <b>179</b>, and a digital to analog converter (DAC) <b>180</b>. The Bluetooth transmit circuit <b>122</b> may also comprise additional processing units (e.g., modulators, encoders, etc.) coupled to the DAC <b>180</b> to generate and process a Bluetooth transmit packet before the Bluetooth transmit packet is transmitted. The Bluetooth device <b>120</b> also comprises a Bluetooth synthesizer <b>185</b>, which is provided as input to the mixers <b>172</b> and <b>177</b>. The Bluetooth coexistence unit <b>124</b> may comprise a switch (not shown) to switch between the Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b> and the Bluetooth transmit circuit <b>122</b>. It is noted, however, that in some examples the switch may be separate from the Bluetooth coexistence unit <b>124</b>. The Bluetooth coexistence unit <b>124</b> may provide the Bluetooth receive packet to the low noise amplifier <b>171</b> in the Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b> when the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is in &#x201c;receive mode&#x201d;.

The WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> may comprise a switch (not shown) to switch between the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b> and the WLAN transmit circuit <b>148</b>. It is noted, however, that in some examples the switch may be separate from the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b>.

The switch <b>110</b> is coupled to the Bluetooth coexistence unit <b>124</b>. The switch <b>110</b> has the first connection <b>107</b> with the switch <b>106</b> and a second connection <b>108</b> with the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. In one example, the switches <b>106</b>, <b>110</b> and the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> may be configured to give control of the communication antenna <b>102</b> to one of the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b>, the WLAN transmit circuit <b>148</b>, and the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the communication antenna <b>102</b> can be used for transmissions and receptions, and the switches <b>106</b> and <b>110</b> may be bidirectional switches. When the WLAN device <b>140</b> is in an inactive state and only the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is communicating (e.g., transmitting Bluetooth packets, receiving Bluetooth packets, scanning for other Bluetooth devices, etc.), the communication antenna <b>102</b> is coupled with the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> via the switch <b>106</b>, the connection <b>107</b>, and the switch <b>110</b>. When the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is in an inactive state and only the WLAN device <b>140</b> is communicating (e.g., transmitting WLAN packets, receiving WLAN packets, etc.), the communication antenna <b>102</b> is coupled with the WLAN device <b>140</b> via the switch <b>106</b> and the connection <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some implementations, the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can enable the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and the WLAN device to operate in shared receive mode (e.g., involving simultaneous reception of Bluetooth and WLAN signals). In one example, when the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and the WLAN device <b>140</b> are in the shared receive mode, the received RF signal is provided from the communication antenna <b>102</b> to the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b> via the switch <b>106</b>, the connection <b>109</b>, and the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b>. In the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b>, the received RF signal is amplified by the LNA <b>153</b> and is then provided to the splitter <b>154</b>. In one example, the splitter <b>154</b> can split the received RF signal energy into two parts&#x2014;one portion of the received RF signal energy is provided to the remainder of the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b> for further processing by the mixer <b>155</b>, the amplifier <b>156</b>, the LPF <b>157</b>, the ADC <b>158</b>, etc. The other portion of the received RF signal energy is provided to the Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b> via the LNA output driver <b>152</b>, the connection <b>108</b>, the switch <b>110</b>, and the Bluetooth coexistence unit <b>124</b>. The LNA output driver <b>152</b> may amplify the Bluetooth portion of the received RF signal energy before providing the signal to the switch <b>110</b>. The Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b> may then accordingly process the Bluetooth portion of the received RF signal energy.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As described above, in some instances, the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> may switch from a receive mode to a transmit mode without notifying the WLAN device <b>140</b>, e.g., to transmit a response to the inquiry/page frame. In these instances, if the system is in the shared receive mode, when the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> switches from the receive mode to the transmit mode, the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> transmits a high-power Bluetooth transmit signal to the LNA output driver <b>152</b> along the established signal path between the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and the WLAN device <b>140</b> via the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. Because the LNA output driver <b>152</b> is typically not designed to withstand the high power of the Bluetooth transmit signal, the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and other components of the WLAN device <b>140</b> may be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one implementation, the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> suspends WLAN communications in accordance with directions from the WLAN coexistence unit <b>142</b>. The WLAN coexistence unit <b>142</b> communicates with the Bluetooth coexistence unit <b>124</b> to exchange information (e.g., scheduling information, priority information, etc) about various coexistence events (e.g., Bluetooth packet transmission/reception, WLAN packet transmission/reception, etc.). For example, the Bluetooth coexistence unit <b>124</b> may transmit an indication <b>150</b> to the WLAN coexistence unit <b>142</b> notifying the WLAN coexistence unit <b>142</b> that the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> will transmit a Bluetooth packet. The indication <b>150</b> may be in the form of a signal along a dedicated line, a coexistence message, etc. In response to receiving the indication <b>150</b>, the WLAN coexistence unit <b>142</b> may direct the WLAN communication controller <b>146</b> to suspend ongoing WLAN communications. The WLAN communication controller <b>146</b> may prevent WLAN packet reception to protect the WLAN device <b>140</b> from the high-power Bluetooth transmit signal, e.g., when the system is in a shared receive mode. In some implementations, the WLAN communication controller <b>146</b> may allow WLAN packet reception if the WLAN signal is sufficiently large. It is noted, however, that in some two-chip architectures, where the WLAN device <b>140</b> and the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> are implemented on separate chips (e.g., system on a chip (SoC), integrated circuit, etc.), and may also be from different manufacturers, a dedicated line between the WLAN device <b>140</b> and the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> may not be practical or possible. Therefore, various other techniques can be implemented for detecting transmission in collocated network devices, e.g., as will be further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should be noted that the circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example, and should not be used to limit the embodiments.

The WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> may accordingly suspend WLAN communications in response to receiving the indication <b>150</b>. Although the circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts component connections to illustrate the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and the WLAN device <b>140</b> operating in the 2.4 GHz spectrum, in some implementations, the WLAN device <b>140</b> may also operate in the 5 GHz spectrum. For example, the WLAN device <b>140</b> that implements IEEE 802.11a/b/g protocols, may operate in the 2.4 GHz (for 802.11b/g communications) and the 5 GHz (for 802.11a communications) spectrum. In some implementations, the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may comprise additional components to process signals in the 5 GHz spectrum, e.g., the WLAN device <b>140</b> may comprise additional components, such as a distinct transmit/receive circuit for processing signals in the 5 GHz spectrum, etc. for processing the 5 GHz WLAN signals.</p>

In one example, the resistor <b>204</b> maybe connected in series with a power amplifier supply line (e.g., a power supply that provides voltage to the power amplifier <b>176</b> of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>) after an RF choke.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At stage A, the Bluetooth power monitoring unit <b>206</b> monitors a voltage across the resistor <b>204</b> to determine an increase in power drawn by the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. In one implementation, the Bluetooth power monitoring unit <b>206</b> may comprise a low frequency ADC (LFADC) which can be used to monitor the voltage across the resistor <b>204</b>.

The WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> can direct the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b> to abort ongoing WLAN packet receptions. The WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> may also disable (e.g., turn off) an LNA output driver (e.g., the LNA output driver <b>152</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) so that the WLAN device <b>140</b> is not coupled with the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating example operations for detecting transmission in a Bluetooth device based on monitoring a power supply line of the Bluetooth device. Flow <b>400</b> begins at block <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At block <b>402</b>, the power supply line, of the Bluetooth device, is monitored. For example, the Bluetooth power monitoring unit <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may monitor the power supply <b>202</b> associated with the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. In one implementation, the Bluetooth power monitoring unit <b>206</b> may monitor voltage across a resistor (e.g., the resistor <b>204</b>) connected in series with the power supply line of the Bluetooth device (e.g., a power amplifier supply line).

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At block <b>404</b>, an indication of an increase in power consumed by the Bluetooth device is detected.

In one implementation, the Bluetooth power monitoring unit <b>206</b> detects the increase in power drawn by the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> by monitoring the voltage across the resistor <b>204</b>. The Bluetooth power monitoring unit <b>206</b> may generate the indication of the increase in power consumed by the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> on detecting the increase in the voltage across the resistor <b>204</b>. In another implementation, the Bluetooth power monitoring unit <b>206</b> may generate the indication of the increase in power consumed by the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> on detecting a signal, transmitted by the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>, requesting power for a Bluetooth device power amplifier. The Bluetooth power monitoring unit <b>206</b> may transmit the indication of the increase in power consumed by the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> to a WLAN communications controller <b>146</b>.

The flow continues at block <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At block <b>406</b>, it is determined whether the WLAN device has control of a communication antenna. The communication antenna (e.g., the communication antenna <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be a common antenna used for transmission and reception by both the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and the WLAN device <b>140</b>.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At block <b>408</b>, control of the communication antenna is relinquished to the Bluetooth device.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an example conceptual diagram illustrating detection of transmission in a Bluetooth device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a Bluetooth transmission detector <b>550</b> connected in between the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and the switch <b>110</b> along the connection <b>108</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the Bluetooth transmission detector <b>550</b> is coupled to the WLAN communication controller <b>146</b>. In some implementations, the Bluetooth transmission detector <b>550</b> may detect a Bluetooth packet transmission and accordingly direct the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> to suspend ongoing WLAN communications and disable the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. In some implementations, the Bluetooth transmission detector <b>550</b> may disable the LNA output driver <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one implementation, the Bluetooth transmission detector <b>550</b> may comprise a peak detector. The peak detector may be an internal or an external peak detector connected to the output of the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. The peak detector may have a threshold of &#x2212;10 dBm, &#x2212;4 dBm, or any suitable peak detection threshold. The peak detector threshold may be selected such that the peak detector is triggered during a ramp-up stage of the Bluetooth power amplifier <b>176</b>. For example, the peak detector threshold may be selected to be a level that may be attained mid-way through the ramp-up stage of the power amplifier <b>176</b>. As another example, the peak detector threshold may be selected to be a level that may be attained after the ramp-up stage of the power amplifier <b>176</b> has been completed. Alternately, the peak detector threshold may be selected such that the peak detector is triggered by a signal that is much larger than the signal strength of a typical received RF signal. The peak detector threshold may be selected to be a level much greater than a maximum expected signal strength of the received RF signal. In one implementation, the peak detector threshold may be greater than the maximum expected signal strength of the received RF signal by 40 dBm. For example, if it is determined (e.g., by simulations, analysis of historical data, etc.) that the maximum expected signal strength of the received RF signal is &#x2212;50 dBm, the peak detector threshold may be &#x2212;10 dBm.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The signal at an input/output (I/O) terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> may be compared against the peak detector threshold. In the transmit mode, the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> may be the high-power Bluetooth transmit signal provided from the Bluetooth transmit circuit <b>122</b> to the communication antenna <b>102</b>. In the receive mode, the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> may be a Bluetooth receive signal or a portion of the received RF signal energy (from the LNA output driver <b>152</b>) provided to the Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b>. Thus, if the signal strength of the signal at an input/output (I/O) terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is greater than the peak detector threshold, the high signal strength may be attributed to the Bluetooth transmit signal. The peak detector may communicate a result of the comparison to the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b>. The WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> can accordingly disable the LNA output driver <b>152</b>, thus protecting the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and other components of the WLAN device <b>140</b> from the high-power Bluetooth transmit signal. Disabling communications of the WLAN device <b>140</b> and providing control of the communication antenna <b>102</b> to the Bluetooth transmit circuit <b>122</b> can also help ensure proper reception of the Bluetooth transmit packet at a receiving Bluetooth device.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another implementation of the Bluetooth transmission detector <b>550</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the Bluetooth transmission detector <b>550</b> comprises a directional coupler <b>652</b> and a comparator <b>650</b>. In one implementation, the directional coupler <b>652</b> is connected between the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and the switch <b>110</b> (along connection <b>108</b>). The comparator <b>650</b> receives and compares signal strengths at the two ends of the directional coupler <b>652</b>. Connection <b>654</b> represents a signal to/from the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. The connection <b>654</b> represent a signal transmitted by the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> or a signal received by the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. The connection <b>654</b> can represent the signal at an I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. Connection <b>656</b> represents a signal from the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. As described above, the signal from the LNA output driver <b>152</b> is provided to the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> for processing by the Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The directional coupler <b>652</b> can be used to infer energy from the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. The directional coupler <b>652</b> is constructed so that the directional coupler <b>652</b> provides a greater attenuation for a signal in one direction as compared to in the opposite direction. For instance, the directional coupler <b>652</b> may provide a high attenuation in the path from the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> to the LNA output driver <b>146</b> so that the high-power Bluetooth transmit signal is not transmitted to and does not damage the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. On the other hand, the directional coupler <b>652</b> may provide little or no attenuation in the path from LNA output driver <b>146</b> to the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> so that the Bluetooth receive unit <b>126</b> can receive and process the portion of the received RF signal energy from the LNA output driver <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The comparator <b>650</b> compares the signal strength of the signal on the connections <b>656</b> and <b>654</b>. In some embodiments, a bias may be applied to the comparator <b>650</b> to favor the signal from the LNA output driver and to reduce false detection. If the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is not transmitting a Bluetooth transmit signal, the signal before and after the directional coupler <b>652</b> will be approximately equal because the directional coupler <b>652</b> provides very little attenuation in the path from the LNA output driver <b>152</b> to the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. However, if the signal after the directional coupler <b>652</b> is much greater than the signal before the directional coupler <b>652</b>, it may be assumed that the increase in signal strength is as a result of the high-power Bluetooth transmit signal. The result of comparing the signal strengths may be provided to the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b>. The WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> may analyze the output of the comparator <b>650</b> and accordingly determine whether or not the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> will initiate a Bluetooth packet transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the comparator <b>650</b> may generate a &#x201c;1&#x201d; (e.g., a high amplitude signal) if the signal received from the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> (i.e., the signal strength along the connection <b>654</b>) is greater than the signal received from the LNA output driver <b>152</b> (i.e., the signal strength along the connection <b>656</b>). The WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> can attribute the variation in signal strengths to the high-power Bluetooth transmit signal, disable the LNA output driver <b>152</b>, and stop reception of the received RF signal. This can ensure that the high-power Bluetooth transmit signal does not damage the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and other components of the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">On the other hand, the comparator <b>650</b> may generate a &#x201c;0&#x201d; (e.g., a low amplitude signal) if the signal received along the connection <b>654</b> is less than or equal to than the signal received from the LNA output driver <b>152</b> (i.e., the signal strength along the connection <b>656</b>). The signal strengths of the two signal being approximately equal can indicate the output of the LNA output driver <b>152</b> is being provided to the Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b>. This also indicates that the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is not transmitting the Bluetooth transmit signal. The WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> may not take any action if it is determined that Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is not transmitting the Bluetooth transmit signal.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be noted that in some implementations, the directional coupler <b>652</b> may be replaced by an attenuator. In other words, one input to the comparator <b>650</b> may be the signal to/from the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and the other input to the comparator <b>650</b> may be the signal transmitted by the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> or a signal received by the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. The signal provided to/from the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> may be attenuated so that the comparator <b>650</b> favors the signal from the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. In other implementations, the attenuator may be used in conjunction with the directional coupler to provide added protection against false detection.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an alternate embodiment for detecting transmission in a collocated Bluetooth device. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the Bluetooth transmission detector <b>550</b> comprises a replica LNA output driver <b>706</b>, a peak detector <b>708</b>, a peak detector <b>710</b>, and a comparator <b>712</b>. In one implementation, the output of the splitter <b>154</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is provided to the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and the replica LNA output driver <b>706</b>. The output of the LNA output driver <b>152</b> is provided to the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and to the peak detector <b>708</b>. The output of the replica LNA output driver <b>706</b> is provided to a peak detector <b>710</b>. The outputs of the peak detector <b>708</b> and the peak detector <b>710</b> are provided to a comparator <b>712</b>. The comparator <b>712</b> is coupled to the WLAN communications unit <b>146</b>. Additionally, a gain controller <b>714</b> controls amplification/attenuation factor of the LNA <b>153</b>, the LNA output driver <b>152</b>, and the replica LNA output driver <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the replica LNA output driver <b>706</b> and the LNA output driver <b>152</b> may have similar operating characteristics. For example, the replica LNA output driver <b>706</b> and the LNA output driver <b>152</b> may comprise the same circuit connections, operate at the same operating temperature and operating voltage, may be constructed using the same technology (e.g., on an integrated circuit), etc. The gain controller <b>714</b> adjusts the gains of the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and the replica LNA output driver <b>706</b> such that the replica LNA output driver <b>706</b> has a higher gain as compared to the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. The difference in the gains of the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and the replica LNA output driver <b>706</b> may be determined based on a difference between the maximum signal strength of the Bluetooth transmit signal and a maximum estimated received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of a received RF signal. Therefore, under normal operating conditions (i.e., when the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is not transmitting) the comparator <b>712</b> may favor the output of the replica LNA output driver <b>708</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, the peak detector <b>708</b> determines the signal strength of the signal at an I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. As described above, the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> can be a high-power Bluetooth transmit signal when the Bluetooth device is in &#x201c;transmit&#x201d; mode. Alternatively, the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device can be a portion of the received RF signal from the LNA output driver <b>152</b> when the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is in &#x201c;receive&#x201d; mode. The peak detector <b>710</b> determines the signal strength of the signal input of the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. This is the signal that corresponds to the portion of the received RF signal energy that is provided to the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. The comparator <b>712</b> compares the signal strengths determine by the peak detectors <b>708</b> and <b>710</b> and provides a result of the comparison to the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b>. If the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> determines that the output of the peak detector <b>708</b> is greater than the output of the peak detector <b>710</b>, the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> determines that the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is in transmit mode. Therefore, the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> disables the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and directs the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b> to suspend ongoing WLAN packet reception. By disabling the LNA output driver <b>152</b>, damage to the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and subsequently to other components of the WLAN device <b>140</b> can be prevented. Moreover, this can minimize corruption of the Bluetooth transmit packet.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating example operations for detecting transmission in a Bluetooth device. Flow <b>800</b> begins at block <b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At block <b>802</b>, strength of a signal at a first terminal of a comparator is determined. The signal at the first terminal of the comparator corresponds to a signal at an input/output (I/O) terminal of the Bluetooth device. For instance, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the comparator <b>650</b> may determine the strength of the signal on connection <b>654</b> that connects the Bluetooth device to the comparator <b>650</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a peak detector may determine the strength of the signal at the input/output (I/O) terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the peak detector <b>708</b> may determine the strength of the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. The flow continues at block <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At block <b>804</b>, the strength of a reference signal is determined. In one implementation, the reference signal is be a pre-determined threshold. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the reference signal may be the peak detector threshold. In another implementation, the reference signal may be a signal associated with the LNA output driver <b>152</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the reference signal is a signal at a second terminal of the comparator <b>650</b>. The signal at the second terminal of the comparator <b>650</b> may correspond to a portion of a received RF signal that an LNA output driver <b>152</b> in a WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b> provides to a Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b>. For example, the comparator <b>650</b> may determine the strength of the signal on connection <b>656</b> that connects the output of the LNA output driver <b>152</b> to the comparator <b>650</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the reference signal is a signal provided to the LNA output driver <b>152</b> and to the replica LNA output driver <b>706</b>. The reference signal is a portion of the received RF signal that is provided to the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. The flow continues at block.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At block <b>806</b>, it is determined whether the strength of the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device is greater than the strength of the reference signal. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the peak detector can determine whether the strength of the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device is greater than the peak detector threshold. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the comparator <b>650</b> may compare the strengths of the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device and the reference signal. Communication of a collocated WLAN device <b>140</b> may be controlled depending on whether or not the strength of the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device is greater than the strength of the reference signal. In one implementation, the comparator <b>650</b> may determine whether the strength of the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device is greater than the strength of the reference signal by a pre-defined threshold. For example, the comparator <b>650</b> may indicate that the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is transmitting if the strength of the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device is at least 20% greater than the strength of the reference signal. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the comparator <b>712</b> may compare the signal strength at the input and the output of the LNA output driver. In other words, the comparator <b>712</b> may compare the strength of the portion of the signal to be provided to the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and the strength of the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. If it is determined that the strength of the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device is greater than the strength of the reference signal, the flow continues at block <b>808</b>. Otherwise, the flow loops back to block <b>802</b> where the signal strength at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> is monitored without interrupting ongoing communications of the Bluetooth device and the WLAN device <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At block <b>808</b>, it is determined whether the WLAN device has control of a communication antenna. For example, the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> may determine whether the WLAN device <b>140</b> is in a shared receive mode with the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>, whether the WLAN device is receiving an RF signal, or whether the WLAN device <b>140</b> is transmitting a WLAN packet. If it is determined that the WLAN device <b>140</b> has control of the communication antenna, the flow continues at block <b>810</b>. Otherwise, the flow ends.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">At block <b>810</b>, control of the communication antenna is relinquished to the Bluetooth device. For example, the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> may suspend ongoing WLAN communications and relinquish control of the communication antenna <b>102</b> to the Bluetooth device <b>120</b>. The WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> may attribute high strength of the signal at the I/O terminal of the Bluetooth device to a high-power Bluetooth transmit signal. The flow continues at block <b>812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At block <b>812</b>, the LNA output driver is disabled. For example, the WLAN communications controller <b>146</b> may disable the LNA output driver <b>152</b> in the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b>. This can ensure that the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b> is not coupled with the Bluetooth device <b>120</b> and that the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b> is not damaged by the high-power Bluetooth transmit signal. Disabling the LNA output driver <b>152</b> can also result in disabling operations of the WLAN receive circuit <b>144</b> and the Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b> (since no signal is provided by the LNA output driver <b>152</b> to the Bluetooth receive circuit <b>126</b>). From block <b>812</b>, the flow ends.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should be understood that the depicted diagrams (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>) are examples meant to aid in understanding embodiments and should not be used to limit embodiments or limit scope of the claims. Embodiments may perform additional operations, fewer operations, operations in a different order, operations in parallel, and some operations differently. For example, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts the LNA output driver <b>152</b> being disabled (block <b>410</b>) after the WLAN device <b>140</b> relinquishes control of the communication antenna <b>102</b> (block <b>408</b>), in some implementations, the operations described with reference to blocks <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> may be performed concurrently. Likewise, the operations described with reference to blocks <b>810</b> and <b>812</b> may be performed in a different order or may even be performed concurrently. Furthermore, the operation described with reference to block <b>406</b> can be performed prior to the operation of block <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It should also be noted that the WLAN communication controller <b>146</b> might disable the LNA output driver <b>152</b> as soon as it receives an indication that the Bluetooth transmit circuit <b>122</b> will transmit a packet. In some implementations, a time instant when the WLAN communication controller <b>146</b> detects Bluetooth packet transmissions, and accordingly disables the LNA output driver <b>152</b>, can influence packet collisions, integrity of the Bluetooth transmit packet, etc. For example, packet collisions and damage to the LNA output driver <b>152</b> can be avoided if the WLAN communication controller <b>146</b> detects the Bluetooth transmission prior to the ramp up stage of the Bluetooth power amplifier <b>176</b> or relatively early during the ramp up stage, when the signal strength of the Bluetooth transmit signal is not too high.</p>
