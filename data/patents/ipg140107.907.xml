<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to valve assemblies, and more particularly relates to multi-position valve assemblies in the field of Invitro Diagnostics (IVD) and analytical instruments.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Rotary shear valve assemblies are commonly used in the HPLC analytical instrument market. These valve assemblies are characterized by relatively long life and high precision fluid delivery. Many rotary valve assemblies are driven by stepper motors which are used for positioning a grooved rotor device to multiple locations on a stator device. Rotor device and stator device components are manufactured of chemically resistant plastic materials such as PEEK, PFA, MFA, and UHMWPE. Additionally, chemical inertness may be achieved through use of ceramic materials with the added benefit of long life and low wear.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Shear valve assemblies may be produced at a very low cost by means of injection molding parts traditionally produced by more expensive machining methods. Such parts include sun, planet and ring gears and a housing containing these components. Significant design and cost advantage can be gained by using injection molded parts in combination with low cost high performance stepper motors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Solenoid valve assemblies are used in many industries. However, there are limitations with respect to performance that are not simply overlooked in IVD and analytical instrument markets. Most solenoid valve assemblies, for example, are single on/off switch devices controlling a single point of flow. When multiple points of flow control are desired, more than one solenoid valve assembly is therefore necessary. Another problem commonly associated with theses solenoid valve assemblies is an undesirable pumping phenomenon (pulsating flow variation), believed to be associated with coil, bounce, and pressure differential dynamic effects. Furthermore, solenoid valve assembly seats have been known to be susceptible to sticking and leakage problems caused by dirt or by foreign matter lodged on the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To address these issues, such micro-fluidic shear valve assemblies have been mounted directly to fluid distribution manifold devices. In this manner a single shear valve assembly can replace numerous individual solenoid valve assemblies and nearly eliminate pumping phenomenon characteristic of solenoid valve assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For the most part, however, the direct mounting of shear valve assemblies to the distribution manifold devices have experienced negative effects. For example, in one particular design, epoxy is used to seal the stator device to a surface of the manifold device. Disadvantages in this art can be seen with regard to leakage and cost. The epoxy must be carefully applied between the stator device and manifold device interface, so as not to interfere with the fluid flow thorough the ports of the stator device. Moreover, the stator device and manifold device contact surfaces require costly dimensional tolerances and finishes and leakage has been known to occur at the epoxy interface. Consequently, leakage repair by removal of the stator device cannot be easily accomplished without damage to the manifold device. Often the solution is to replace the entire manifold device, incurring significant costs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a micro-fluidic valve assembly that can be simply and cost effectively mounted directly to a fluid distribution manifold without leakage or operational compromise.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a micro-fluidic POD apparatus that is configured to operably mount a micro-fluidic valve assembly directly to a communication face of a fluid distribution manifold, in a fluid-tight manner. The POD apparatus includes a POD housing having a proximal portion and a distal mounting end. The housing proximal portion is configured to mount to the valve actuator apparatus, while the distal mounting end is configured to mount directly to the communication face of the distribution manifold. An interior wall of the POD housing defines an interior central passage extending from an opening at the housing distal mounting end to the housing proximal portion. The POD apparatus further includes a stator device defining a plurality of stator passages that terminate at respective communication ports at the distal stator face thereof. The stator device is positioned in the interior central passage, in a seated position, such that a distal stator face thereof is oriented substantially adjacent to the POD housing distal mounting end.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with the present invention, a relatively thin, elastomeric gasket member is disposed in the gasket receptacle of the housing in abutting contact between a proximal gasket face thereof and the distal stator face of the stator device. The gasket member further defines a plurality of independent through-holes, each strategically positioned such that when the POD housing is securely mounted to the distribution manifold, the distal gasket face contacts the manifold communication face, in a compressed condition, to form a fluid-tight seal between each respective stator communication port and a corresponding manifold communication port at the manifold communication face.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, a micro-fluidic valve assembly can be directly mounted to a manifold device, providing direct fluid communication between the stator communication ports of the stator device and the corresponding manifold communication ports, aligned therewith. Additionally, this maintenance free design is capable of enduring relatively harsh chemicals for millions of actuations at high pressures up to about 7 bar (102 psi) using this specialized elastomeric gasket member. In one specific example, the elastomeric gasket member is composed of one of EPDM, Viton and FFKM with Shore A hardness ranging from 45 to 85 durometer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one specific embodiment, when the stator device is oriented in the seated position, and the gasket member is the disposed in the gasket receptacle, in an uncompressed condition, the distal gasket face extends distally beyond from the housing mounting end by a distance in the range of about 0.2 mm to about 0.3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another configuration, each gasket member through-hole includes, on at least one of the proximal stator face and the distal stator face, a molded-in O-ring seal surface circumferentially upstanding respectfully therefrom, and surrounding each through-hole thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The diameter of each gasket through-hole is sized slightly larger than that of each corresponding stator communication port, in the uncompressed condition. When the gasket member is compressed between the stator device and the communication face of the manifold, in the compressed condition, the diameter of each gasket through-hole is sized substantially the same as that of the corresponding stator communication port.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still another specific embodiment provides the proximal gasket face of the gasket member that includes at least one mounting pin that extends proximally. This pin is configured for aligned sliding receipt in a corresponding alignment hole defined in the distal stator face.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet another specific embodiment provides a rotor element that is disposed in the housing central passage for rotation about a rotational axis thereof. The rotor element defines a distal rotor face disposed opposite to, and in abutting contact with, the proximal stator face, at a rotor-stator interface. The POD apparatus further includes a shaft adapter having a distal portion formed for engaged contact with the rotor element. A proximal portion thereof is configured to rotatably engage a drive assembly of the valve assembly for selective relative rotation between the distal rotor face and the proximal stator face.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one specific embodiment, a pressure adjustment assembly is included that cooperates between valve drive assembly and the shaft adapter to generate an axial compression pressure between the distal rotor face and the proximal stator face, at a rotor-stator interface, to enable fluid-tight relative rotation therebetween. The pressure adjustment assembly is preferably provided by a compression spring having a distal portion cooperating with the shaft adapter, and a distal portion cooperating with the valve shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A distal face of the shaft adapter includes two or more alignment posts extending distally thereof. These posts are configured for aligned sliding receipt in corresponding alignment recesses defined in the proximal rotor face of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Yet another specific configuration provides a cap retainer configured to engage the interior wall of the POD housing, in an engaged position, releasably retaining the stator device in the seated condition. The shaft adapter is generally cylindrical shaped, having a first diameter, and a distal annular flange portion having a second diameter that is greater than the first diameter. The cap retainer includes an annular ring body that defines a central through-passage having a retainer diameter sized to permit rotatably receipt of the first diameter of the shaft adapter. The retainer diameter, however, is sized to prevent axial passage of the annular distal flange portion of the shaft adapter therethrough, having the second diameter. In accordance with the present invention, the rotor element can be loosely retained against the stator device when the shaft adapter is not in engaging contact with the drive assembly of the micro-fluidic valve assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In still another embodiment, the cap retainer includes a plurality of retaining legs spaced radially about, and depending distally from, the ring body. The retaining legs are configured to radially extend around both the annular distal flange portion of the shaft adapter and the rotor element to permit selective relative rotation thereof about the rotation axis. The distal ends of the retaining legs are sized and dimensioned for abutting contact against the proximal stator face to retain the stator device in the seated condition, when the cap retainer is in the engaged position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another aspect of the present invention, a micro-fluidic valve assembly is provided that is operably mounted between a drive motor and the fluid distribution manifold. The valve assembly includes an assembly housing having a proximal portion and a distal mounting end configured for mounting contact with the communication face of the distribution manifold. The assembly housing further includes an interior wall defining an interior central passage extending from an opening at the housing distal mounting end to the housing proximal portion thereof. A drive assembly is positioned within the central passage proximate to the housing proximal portion, and is rotatably coupled to the drive motor. The valve assembly further includes a rotor element and a stator device engaged with one another at the rotor-stator interface. The rotor element includes a distal rotor face, and is rotatably coupled to the drive assembly for selective rotation about a rotational axis thereof between a plurality of discrete fluid distribution positions. The stator device is disposed in the interior central passage, in a seated position, such that a distal stator face thereof is oriented substantially adjacent to the distal mounting end of the assembly housing. The distal stator face and the housing opening collectively define a gasket receptacle, when the stator device is oriented in the seated position. The stator device further defines a plurality of stator passages terminating at respective communication ports at the distal stator face. A relatively thin, elastomeric gasket member is provided having a proximal gasket face and an opposed distal gasket face. The gasket member is configured for disposition in the gasket receptacle of the housing in abutting contact between the proximal gasket face and the distal stator face. When the assembly housing is securely mounted to the distribution manifold, the distal gasket face of the gasket member, which defines a plurality of independent through-holes, each of which is strategically positioned, contacts the manifold communication face, in a compressed condition. A fluid-tight seal is then formed between each respective stator communication port and a corresponding manifold communication port.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one specific configuration, a pressure adjustment assembly cooperates between a valve shaft of the drive assembly and the shaft adapter to generate an axial compression pressure between the distal rotor face and the proximal stator face, at a rotor-stator interface, to enable fluid-tight relative rotation therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Yet another embodiment provides a pressure adjustment assembly that includes a compression spring having a distal portion cooperating with the shaft adapter, and a proximal portion cooperating with the valve shaft. The valve shaft defines a distal receptacle formed and dimensioned for snug, sliding axial receipt of the proximal portion of the shaft adapter therein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Still yet another arrangement provides the shaft adapter with proximal end that defines a spring receptacle, having a distal interior wall. The pressure adjustment assembly includes a compression spring that is disposed in both the distal receptacle of the valve shaft and the spring receptacle of the shaft adapter when the shaft adapter is slideably received, axially, in the valve shaft distal receptacle. This biases the rotor element toward the proximal stator face for fluid-tight contact therebetween at the rotor-stator interface.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In still another aspect of the present invention, a micro-fluidic valve system is provided including a micro-fluidic valve actuator apparatus, a fluid distribution manifold and a micro-fluidic POD apparatus. The valve actuator apparatus includes an actuator housing and a drive assembly. The fluid distribution manifold includes a communication face and a plurality of fluid distribution channels each having a respective communication port terminating at the manifold communication face. Collectively, the valve actuator apparatus and the POD apparatus make up a micro-fluidic valve assembly which is directly mounted to the communication face of the manifold, via the POD apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In accordance with this aspect of the present invention, the POD apparatus includes a POD housing having a proximal portion, a distal mounting end, and an interior wall defining an interior central passage. This passage extends from an opening at the housing distal mounting end to the housing proximal portion. The POD apparatus further includes a stator device disposed in the interior central passage, in a seated position, such that a distal stator face thereof is oriented substantially adjacent to the POD housing distal mounting end. Collectively, the distal stator face and the POD housing opening define a gasket receptacle, when the stator device is oriented in the seated position. A relatively thin, elastomeric gasket member is provided having a proximal gasket face and an opposed distal gasket face. The gasket member is configured for disposition in the gasket receptacle of the housing in abutting contact between the proximal gasket face and the distal stator face. When the assembly housing is securely mounted to the distribution manifold, the distal gasket face of the gasket member, which defines a plurality of independent through-holes, each of which is strategically positioned, contacts the manifold communication face, in a compressed condition. A fluid-tight seal is then formed between each respective stator communication port and a corresponding manifold communication port.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">While the present invention will be described with reference to a few specific embodiments, the description is illustrative of the invention and is not to be construed as limiting the invention. Various modifications to the present invention can be made to the preferred embodiments by those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. It will be noted here that for a better understanding, like components are designated by like reference numerals throughout the various figures.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>10</b>-<b>13</b>, a micro-fluidic valve system, generally designated <b>20</b>, is provided that is capable directly mounting a micro-fluidic valve assembly <b>24</b> directly to a communication face <b>21</b> of a fluid distribution manifold device <b>22</b>, for liquid-tight coupling to communication ports <b>25</b> of the manifold. The entire valve system <b>20</b>, broadly, includes the micro-fluidic valve assembly <b>24</b> and the manifold device <b>22</b> upon which it is mounted. The micro-fluidic valve assembly <b>24</b>, on the other hand, is essentially comprised of a valve actuator apparatus <b>26</b>, which generally includes an actuator housing <b>41</b> and a drive assembly <b>32</b>, and a micro-fluidic POD apparatus <b>27</b>, which generally includes a rotor element <b>31</b>, a stator device <b>30</b>, as well as structural provisions (which will be described) that enable fluid-tight coupling of the respective communication ports <b>35</b> of the stator device directly to corresponding communication ports <b>25</b> one the face <b>21</b> of the manifold device <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In accordance with the present invention, the POD apparatus <b>27</b> includes a POD housing <b>29</b> having a proximal portion, a distal mounting end <b>36</b>, and an interior wall <b>39</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) defining an interior central passage <b>45</b> extending from an opening into the passage, at the housing distal mounting end <b>36</b>, to the housing proximal end. The stator device <b>30</b> is disposed in the interior central passage <b>45</b>, in a seated position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>), such that a distal stator face <b>37</b> thereof is oriented substantially adjacent to the POD housing distal mounting end <b>36</b>. The stator device provides a plurality of stator passages extending axially therethrough, each of which terminates at respective communication ports <b>35</b> at distal stator face <b>37</b>. Collectively, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the distal stator face <b>37</b> and the POD housing opening into the central passage <b>45</b>, at the distal mounting end <b>36</b>, defining a distal gasket receptacle <b>47</b>, when the stator device is oriented in the seated position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A relatively thin, elastomeric gasket member <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>11</b>) is configured for disposition in the gasket receptacle <b>47</b> of the POD housing <b>41</b> in abutting contact between a proximal gasket face <b>38</b> and the distal stator face <b>37</b>. The gasket member <b>28</b> further defines a plurality of independent through-holes <b>33</b>, each strategically positioned such that when the POD housing <b>29</b> is securely mounted to the communication face <b>21</b> of the distribution manifold device <b>22</b>, a distal gasket face <b>40</b> contacts the manifold communication face <b>21</b>, in a compressed condition (i.e., when mounted to the manifold device <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>13</b>)), to form a fluid-tight seal between each respective stator communication port <b>35</b> and a corresponding manifold communication port <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Accordingly, when the POD apparatus <b>27</b> is mounted directly to the manifold device <b>22</b>, the manifold communication ports <b>25</b> provide direct fluid communication with the corresponding communication ports <b>35</b> of the stator device <b>30</b>, aligned therewith. A relatively low cost valve assembly, thus, is provided, having the ability to seal the micro-fluidic valve assembly directly to a manifold device with less than 1.0 uL/min leakage. Through the application of this specialized elastomeric gasket <b>28</b>, in addition, this system is capable of enduring relatively harsh chemicals for millions of actuations at high pressures up to 7 bar (102 psi). Moreover, by selecting more recent ceramic stator device and rotor device materials for the stator and rotor components, highly desirable maintenance free operation may be achieved, even through millions of actuations.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the manifold device <b>22</b> defines a plurality of fluid channels <b>23</b> that terminate at fluid communication ports <b>25</b> disposed at the manifold device communication face <b>21</b>. The valve assembly <b>24</b>, on the other hand, selectively determines the direction of the liquid flow through communication ports <b>25</b> of the manifold device <b>22</b>, via rotor element <b>31</b>, and is comprised of three primary components, as mentioned: valve actuator apparatus <b>32</b>, the POD apparatus <b>27</b> and the elastomeric gasket <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The POD apparatus <b>27</b>, its POD housing <b>29</b> of which contains a shear or rotary valve (i.e., a stator device <b>30</b> and a rotor device <b>31</b>) therein, together with the valve actuator apparatus <b>26</b> (i.e., collectively the valve assembly <b>24</b>), can then mounted directly to the communication face <b>21</b> of the manifold device <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In accordance with the present invention, as above-indicated, to facilitate and promote a liquid tight seal between the stator device <b>30</b> and the manifold device communication face <b>21</b> under harsh usage conditions, a special elastomeric gasket <b>28</b> is disposed therebetween. This gasket <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), preferably contained within gasket receptacle <b>47</b> of the POD apparatus <b>27</b>, is relatively thin and defines a plurality of through-holes <b>33</b>, each of which is aligned with, and correspond to, respective manifold fluid communication ports <b>25</b> and the stator fluid communication ports <b>35</b>. Upon compression mounting of the POD apparatus <b>27</b> to the manifold device communication face <b>21</b>, the liquid impervious, elastomeric gasket <b>28</b> is compressed between the micro-fluidic valve assembly <b>24</b> and the manifold device <b>22</b>, creating a seal therebetween. Specifically, a liquid-tight seal is created between the distal stator face <b>37</b> of the stator device <b>30</b> and a proximal gasket face <b>38</b> of the gasket <b>28</b>, while another liquid-tight seal is created between the distal gasket face <b>40</b> of the gasket and manifold device communication face <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As mentioned, the valve assembly <b>24</b> is primarily comprised of three components: the valve actuator apparatus <b>26</b>, the POD apparatus <b>27</b>, and the elastomeric gasket <b>28</b>, the POD apparatus of which receives and seats the elastomeric gasket <b>28</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, valve actuator apparatus <b>26</b> includes the actuator housing <b>41</b>, a stepper motor <b>42</b> and the drive assembly <b>32</b> that transmits rotational movement from the motor <b>42</b> to the rotor element <b>31</b>. In one specific embodiment, the drive assembly <b>32</b> intercoupled the motor <b>42</b> to the POD apparatus <b>26</b> by means of a valve shaft <b>43</b> and a planetary gear system <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An alternate drive system (not shown) may be used in which the valve shaft <b>43</b> directly engages the motor <b>42</b> without the use of intermediary gears. In this configuration, the decreased motor torque, resulting from the absence of a gear system, may be compensated for by applying a motor with greater torque. The Rheodyne Titan EZ valve, Model EZ670-000-4, manufactured by IDEX Health &#x26; Science, for example, achieves up to 7 in-lbs of torque combining a 42 mm tin can stepper motor with an injection molded planetary gear system.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The POD housing <b>29</b> is generally cylindrical-shaped, and defines a central passage <b>45</b> axially therethrough which extends from the opening at the distal mounting end <b>36</b> to the proximal end thereof (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</figref>). The stepped interior wall <b>39</b>, forming the central passage <b>45</b>, is sized and dimensioned for seated receipt of the stator device <b>30</b>, when assembled in a seated position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>). To facilitate proper seating of the stator device <b>30</b>, and thus, proper orientation of the distal stator face <b>37</b> relative to the housing distal mounting end <b>36</b>, the housing <b>29</b> includes a step feature <b>46</b>. Disposed at a distal portion of the central passage <b>45</b> and extending radially inwardly, this step feature <b>46</b> is sized and dimensioned to seat against a correspondingly sized and dimensioned outer circumferential recess flange <b>49</b> of the stator device <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Once the stator device <b>30</b>, seats axially against the step feature <b>46</b>, both of which are correspondingly keyed, further axial displacement, distally, is prevented. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> best illustrates that when the stator device <b>30</b> is seated, the distal stator face <b>37</b> is spaced just below flush of the distal mounting end <b>36</b>, forming the gap or gasket receptacle <b>47</b> upon which the elastomeric gasket is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 7</figref>, both the stator device <b>30</b> and POD housing <b>29</b> are keyed for proper rotational alignment therebetween, in addition to the above mentioned stepped features. The distal mounting end <b>36</b> of the POD housing <b>29</b>, for example, defines a pair of stator alignment cutouts <b>48</b>. Corresponding to these cutouts is a pair of alignment features <b>50</b> that align the stator device <b>30</b> in the correct position relative to the remaining valve assembly <b>24</b>, when inserted within the POD housing <b>29</b>. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the stator proximal face <b>69</b> defines an alignment cutout <b>53</b> which is formed and dimensioned for receipt of a POD alignment feature <b>54</b> therein to further facilitate aligned seating. Collectively, these alignment structures not only facilitate alignment, but also prevent rotation of the stator device <b>30</b> in the POD housing <b>29</b> when the rotor element <b>31</b> rotates thereagainst.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">To mechanically couple the rotor device <b>31</b> to the drive assembly <b>32</b>, the POD apparatus <b>27</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B and <b>9</b>) includes a shaft adapter <b>55</b> which rotatably engages the drive valve shaft <b>43</b> to enable rotation of the rotor device. The valve shaft <b>43</b> defines a distal receptacle <b>56</b> which formed and dimensioned for snug, sliding axial receipt of a proximal portion of the shaft adapter <b>55</b> therein. An interior wall that define the distal receptacle <b>56</b> of the valve shaft <b>43</b> and a proximal exterior wall that defines the proximal portion of the shaft adapter <b>55</b> are both correspondingly keyed such that any torque and rotation of the valve shaft about its longitudinal axis is transferred to the shaft adapter. An annular distal flange portion <b>57</b> of the shaft adapter flares radially outward to a diameter similar to that of the rotor device <b>31</b>. Thus, the first diameter of the proximal portion of the shaft adapter is correspondingly less than the second diameter of the distal flange portion <b>57</b>. A distal adapter face <b>60</b> of the shaft adapter <b>55</b>, at the annular distal flange portion <b>57</b>, is formed to seat the rotor device <b>31</b> thereagainst.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Protruding axially outward from the distal adapter face <b>60</b> of the shaft adapter <b>55</b> are one or more alignment posts <b>61</b> that are formed and dimensioned for sliding receipt in corresponding recesses <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>) is in a proximal rotor face <b>63</b> of the ceramic rotor device <b>31</b>. The alignment posts <b>61</b> and corresponding recesses <b>62</b> are sized and placed to align the rotor device relative to the valve shaft <b>43</b>. Furthermore, the posts <b>61</b> function to transfer any torque and rotation of the shaft adapter <b>55</b> about its longitudinal axis to the rotor device.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B and <b>9</b>, a cap retainer <b>65</b> is incorporated to loosely retain the rotor device <b>31</b>, as well as retain the shaft adapter <b>55</b>, to the POD housing <b>29</b>. This advantageous in that the POD apparatus <b>27</b> can be easily mounted to the valve actuator apparatus <b>26</b> as a single unit.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The cap retainer <b>65</b> is preferably also injection molded, having a thin annular ring body <b>66</b> that defines a through-passage <b>64</b> sized to rotatably receive the first diameter of shaft adapter therein. The diameter of the through-passage <b>64</b>, however, is sized and dimensioned to prevent axial passage of the annular distal flange portion <b>57</b> of the shaft adapter therethrough. Accordingly, when the cap retainer <b>65</b> is mounted to the POD housing, in an engaged position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 9</figref>) as will be described below, the diametric tolerance between the first diameter of the shaft adapter and that of the ring body through-passage <b>64</b> permit unimpaired relative rotation thereof. On the other hand, the second diameter of the flange portion <b>57</b> prevents proximal passage through the cap retainer <b>65</b>, loosely retaining the shaft adapter <b>55</b>, and the mounted rotor device <b>31</b>, to the POD housing <b>29</b>. It will be appreciated, of course, that in order to prevent separation of the shaft adapter <b>55</b> and the rotor device <b>31</b>, the length of the alignment posts <b>61</b> should be greater than the permitted axial displacement or play between the distal flange portion <b>57</b> and the annular ring body <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B and <b>10</b>, extending distally from the annular ring body <b>66</b> is a plurality of radially spaced retaining legs <b>67</b>, as well as a plurality of radially spaced snap hooks <b>68</b> alternatively positioned between each retaining leg <b>67</b>. Preferably, the cap retainer <b>65</b> includes three equally spaced retaining legs <b>67</b> radially about a longitudinal axis of the ring body <b>66</b>, and three equally spaced snap hooks <b>68</b> positioned therebetween. Both the retaining legs <b>67</b> and the snap hooks <b>68</b> are diametrically positioned to extend around the shaft adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">During assembly, when the shaft adapter <b>55</b> and rotor device <b>31</b> are disposed atop the stator device <b>30</b> in the POD housing <b>29</b>, the cap retainer <b>65</b> is inserted into the POD housing <b>29</b>. The diametric orientation of both the retaining legs <b>67</b> and the snap hooks <b>68</b>, relative to the ring through-passage <b>64</b>, is configured to extend circumferentially around the shaft adapter <b>55</b> as the proximal portion of the shaft adapter <b>55</b> is positioned, relatively, through the ring body <b>66</b>. Each snap hook <b>68</b> includes a tang portion <b>58</b> which is formed and dimensioned engage and lock into corresponding receiving windows <b>70</b> in the POD housing <b>29</b>, locking the cap retainer in the central passage <b>45</b> of the POD housing <b>29</b>, in an engaged position. Simultaneously, the retaining legs <b>67</b> are distally sized to abut against the proximal stator face <b>69</b> of the stator device <b>30</b>, retaining and seating the circumferential recessed flange <b>49</b> against the POD housing step feature <b>46</b>, in the seated condition. In this configuration, as mentioned, both the shaft adapter <b>55</b> and the rotor device <b>31</b> are permitted a minor amount of axial displacement in the POD housing <b>29</b> when the POD apparatus is not mounted to the drive assembly <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Once assembled, the stator device <b>25</b>, the rotor device <b>31</b>, the cap retainer <b>65</b> and the shaft adapter <b>55</b> are contained within the central passage <b>45</b> of the POD housing, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>8</b>. The POD apparatus <b>27</b> can then be mounted or coupled to the actuator housing <b>41</b> of the valve actuator apparatus <b>26</b>. For instance, the POD housing <b>29</b> may be mounted to the actuator housing <b>41</b> at two locations using standard 4-40 screws <b>74</b>. At these two regions, ribs <b>72</b> are molded into the POD housing to provide structural strength against internal spring forces and external bending forces. As with most shear valve assemblies, the stator device <b>30</b> is stationary relative to the POD apparatus while the rotor device <b>31</b> rotates as it is driven by the valve shaft <b>43</b> in the actuator housing <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The ceramic stator device <b>30</b> and rotor device <b>31</b> form a liquid tight seal at a rotor/stator interface thereof when loaded by a compressive force, and can withstand up to millions of actuations in the presence of liquids ranging from de-ionized water to salt solutions. To create the compressive force between the stator device <b>30</b> and the rotor element <b>31</b>, at the rotor/stator interface, a pressure adjustment assembly <b>71</b> cooperating between drive assembly <b>32</b> and the shaft adapter <b>55</b> to generate an axial compression pressure between a distal rotor face and the proximal stator face <b>69</b>, at a rotor-stator interface, to enable fluid-tight relative rotation therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one specific embodiment, the pressure adjustment assembly <b>71</b> is provided a helical compression spring <b>71</b>, as the primary force mechanism, to fluid-tight seal the rotor element <b>31</b> against the stator device <b>30</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the shaft adapter <b>55</b> defines a spring receptacle <b>73</b> accessible at a proximal end of the adapter. During assembly of the POD apparatus <b>27</b> to the valve actuator apparatus <b>26</b>, and, thus, the valve shaft <b>43</b> of the drive assembly <b>32</b> to the shaft adapter <b>55</b>, the helical compression spring <b>71</b> is disposed therebetween. Upon compression of the spring therebetween, the shaft adapter <b>55</b> is biased axially toward the stator device <b>30</b>, forming the fluid tight seal at the rotor/stator interface. The helical spring, therefore, displaces the annular distal flange portion <b>57</b> of the shaft adapter <b>55</b> axially a sufficient distance from the cap retainer ring body <b>66</b> so as to prevent interfering contact. Moreover, the spring functions to accommodate minor axial size variations between the interacting components.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It will be appreciated that although a pressure adjusting mechanism <b>71</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), is the primary force seating the stator device <b>30</b>, in the seated position against POD housing <b>29</b>, the cap retainer legs <b>67</b> of the cap retainer <b>65</b> also provide an additional holding force thereagainst. Therefore, the combined spring force and the cap retainer <b>65</b> retain the stator device <b>30</b> in place against compression of the elastomeric gasket <b>28</b>, collectively creating more than sufficient force to seal at the stator device/rotor element, stator device/gasket and gasket/manifold device interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Briefly, although ceramics are emphasized with respect to the stator device <b>30</b> and the rotor element <b>31</b>, it will be appreciated that other materials may be used such as PEEK, PFA, MFA, and UHMWPE, although wear life and pressures may change. Moreover, other hard-on-hard application may be implemented such as those described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/833,834 to Tower, filed Jul. 9, 2010, entitled &#x201c;ROTARY SHEAR VALVE ASSEMBLY WITH HARD-ON-HARD SEAL SURFACES&#x201d;, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In accordance with the present invention, as mentioned above, the valve assembly <b>20</b> is liquid-tight sealed to the manifold device <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>13</b>) by means of a molded elastomeric gasket <b>28</b> that is disposed in the gasket receptacle <b>47</b> at the distal mounting end <b>36</b> of the POD apparatus <b>27</b>. The height of the gasket <b>28</b> is such that the distal gasket face <b>40</b> thereof extends slightly above flush of distal mounting end <b>36</b> of the POD housing <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Hence, when the valve assembly <b>20</b> is mounted to the manifold device, the elastomeric gasket <b>28</b> is compressed, forming the liquid-tight seal around and between the manifold and stator communication ports <b>25</b>, <b>35</b>. In one specific embodiment, using the material composition of the elastomeric gasket <b>28</b> set forth below, when gasket member <b>28</b> is the disposed in the gasket receptacle <b>47</b>, in an uncompressed condition, the distal gasket face <b>40</b> extends distally beyond from the housing mounting end <b>36</b> by a distance in the range of about 0.2 mm to about 0.3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>10</b>, the elastomeric gasket <b>28</b> includes a molded-in O-ring-style seal surfaces <b>75</b> circumferentially upstanding from both the proximal and distal gasket face <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, and surrounding each through-hole <b>33</b> thereof. These surrounding sealing surfaces <b>75</b> function to optimize the sealing area such that sufficient sealing is achieved with minimal spring forces. Lower forces are desirable in order to minimize the stator device/rotor device sealing forces which results in longer life and lower wear. Similarly, in the uncompressed condition, these O-ring style sealing surfaces <b>75</b> extends proximally and distally beyond from the respective gasket faces <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> by a distance in the range of about 0.1 mm to about 0.2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, the gasket <b>28</b> is designed with through-holes <b>33</b> that are slightly larger in diameter than that of the communication ports <b>25</b>, <b>35</b> in the respective mating manifold device and stator device (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The purpose is to take into account gasket compression deformation of the gasket during installation which causes the gasket holes to shrink.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Additionally, the bolt circle of the pattern of gasket holes <b>33</b> may be decreased slightly, if necessary, such that when compressed during installation it will increase and match the bolt circle of the pattern of holes in both the stator device and manifold device. Finally, the size of the sealing surface is custom designed to optimize factors such as compression area, force, and deformation taking into account the elastic modulus of the gasket material. Depending on properties of the gasket, dimensions of the sealing area and thickness of the gasket, a range of forces are necessary to compress and seal within the space defined by the pod and stator device. This invention is designed to accommodate a wide variety of gasket materials including EPDM, Viton and FFKM with Shore A hardness ranging from 45 to 85 durometer while using the same components to minimize cost. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a shear face valve assembly capable of holding pressures greater than about 50 psi that have expected valve assembly lifetimes greater than 50K cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Briefly, to co-align the through-holes <b>33</b> of the gasket member <b>28</b> with those of the stator device <b>30</b>, two molded-in mounting posts <b>51</b> are provided which are received in alignment holes <b>52</b> defined in the distal stator face <b>37</b> of the stator device <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, mounting of the valve assembly <b>20</b> to the manifold device <b>22</b> is achieved by either of two techniques. The first technique relates to the application of standard fasteners <b>76</b> extending though the manifold device <b>22</b> from the distal side thereof the manifold device, and into threaded inserts <b>79</b> disposed in mounting bosses <b>77</b> formed in the injection molded POD housing <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The second technique relates to the application of mounting cleats <b>80</b>, with a cam-like head <b>81</b>, mounted to the manifold device <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>). These cam-like heads <b>81</b> are formed and dimensioned to engage an annular shoulder <b>82</b> of a distal flange <b>83</b> of the injection molded POD housing <b>29</b> as the fastener is rotated and/or threaded into the manifold device on the back side of the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">To align the POD apparatus <b>27</b> relative to the manifold device <b>22</b> during assembly, two molded-in alignment posts <b>85</b> are included which are inserted into corresponding alignment holes <b>86</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 12</figref>) formed in the communication face <b>21</b> of the manifold device <b>22</b>. In one configuration, these corresponding keyed structures are disposed at irregular positions (i.e., different than 180 degrees apart) to ensure correct assembly and accurate alignment of holes from the stator device to gasket to manifold device.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Although the present invention has been primarily described as applying to shear face valve assemblies for high pressure applications that require high lifecycle capabilities (e.g., such as all HPLC Instrument platforms/designs), it will be appreciated that this technology may be applied to all shear valve assembly platforms/designs (such as AI (analytical chemistry) and IVD (In-vitro Diagnostics)).</p>
