<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related in general to the field of semiconductor devices and processes, and more specifically to the structure and fabrication method of semiconductor leadframes for low volume, yet high diversity Quad Flat No-Lead (QFN) and Small Outline No-Lead (SON) devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The metallic leadframes used in semiconductor devices such as dual-in-line devices, surface mount devices, and Quad Flat No-Lead (QFN) and Small Outline No-Lead SON) devices, provide a pad for stable support of the semiconductor chip, and a plurality of leads to bring electrical conductors in close proximity of the chip. After attaching the chip onto the pad, the remaining gap between the chip and a lead is usually bridged by a thin wire attached in a bonding process; the wires are typically made of gold or copper. In order to protect the sensitive chip and wires from environmental disturbances such as moisture, scratches and light, the assembled chip and wires and portions of the leadframe are encapsulated in a package, which typically is produced by molding epoxy-based polymeric compounds around the sensitive device parts.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For reasons of easy manufacturing, it is common practice to fabricate the leadframes from a strip of flat metal sheet about 120 to 250 &#x3bc;m thick. Most commonly the sheets are made of a base metal such as copper or a copper alloy; alternatively, base metal sheets of aluminum or an iron-nickel alloy (Alloy 42) are in usage. The preferred fabrication methods are usually a chemical etching technique, supported by masks, or a stamping technique. The stamping technique offers the additional opportunity of pressing portions of the leadframe (for instance the pad) into a plane different from the original plane of the metal sheet, simplifying the tasks of wire bonding and positioning the chip pad for easy thermal heat flow into external heat sinks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As an example, when leadframes for surface mount devices in the 8 to 200 pin range are to be fabricated in mass production, steel tools (stampers) for stamping the leadframes from metal strips are usually selected; they have a 6 to 8 week delivery time and cost between about $ 50 k to 500K dependent on the complexity of the selected pin count. A stamper can be used for about one million cutting stokes, before it has to be re-sharpened. The cycle of cutting and sharpening can be repeated between about 20 to 100 times in the lifespan of a stamper. A semiconductor assembly factory working at high production levels may operate with about 50 to 100 different stampers to produce several hundred million leadframes per month.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As another example, when leadframes for QFN or SON devices in the to pin range are to be fabricated in mass production, photomasks for chemical etching are usually selected; they have a 2 to 3 week delivery time and cost between about $ 1500 and 5000 dependent on the complexity of the selected pin count. A photomask can be used for the whole lifespan of the device-to-be-produced. A semiconductor factory working at high production levels may operate with more than 500 different photomasks to produce between 10 and 30 million leadframes per month.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Etched leadframes are between 5 to 10 times more expensive than stamped leadframes, because the production throughput is slower, the chemical tanks need constant control, and the metal chemically dissolved from the starting strip is lost; in contrast, the metal cut away from the strip by the stamper can be recycled.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A finished packaged semiconductor device includes parts of distinctly different materials. Proper functioning of the packaged device requires that the parts keep adhering to each other reliably so that the package does not delaminate in device operation and tests. For example, the adhesion between the epoxy-based polymeric molding compounds of the encapsulation and the leadframe is stronger, when the copper leadframe has a copper oxide surface rather than a pure copper surface; further, roughened metal surfaces enhance adhesion to polymeric materials compared to smooth surfaces. On the other hand, stitch-bonding gold wires to a silver-spot surface results in mechanically stronger connections than stitch-bonding to copper oxide. As another example, for connecting an external part to a copper lead using solder, the wetting of solder is facilitated by a layer of nickel on the copper, especially when the nickel is topped by a layer of a noble metal such as palladium or gold.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is common practice to optimize leadframe attributes such as adhesion, bondability, and solderability by depositing additional metal layers on certain leadframe portions. After stamping or etching the leadframes from the sheet metal, a plating technique is used to deposit, for example, layers of nickel and a noble metal, or a layer of tin. The steps of stamping (or etching) and subsequent plating, including the step of applying masks, have been established in industry as reel-to-reel operations; the production is controllable and well suited for high volume production.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Applicant recognized that the current semiconductor leadframe manufacturing flow is directed for supporting high-volume products, but is not a good fit for the Analog type businesses, where more than 70% of products do not ramp up to high volumes. Analog products rather have to respond to rapidly changing requirements in QFN/SON designs, pin counts, and package sizes. For Analog products, it takes presently too much cycle time and investment money to tool up the stamping machines, photomasks, and etching baths for producing the leadframes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Applicant solved the leadframe manufacturing problems of flexibility, turn-around time, spacing rules, and cost by changing the leadframe production steps from the conventional sequence: first cutting, then plating, to the new sequence: first plating, then cutting, and by simultaneously replacing the conventional fixed cutting tools (stamper, mask) with programmable methods (laser jet, water jet, electrical discharge machining). These computer-controlled techniques also improve the design rules for spacings and widths, creating denser interconnections for improved electrical functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, applicant recognized that the ongoing miniaturization of the device packages enhances the risk of delamination between leadframe and polymeric package and endangers device reliability. In addition, technical constraints, such as the spacing rules in the leadframe designs, are becoming increasingly restrictive, and the current leadframe fabrication flow cannot support effectively rapid prototyping.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Applicant discovered that the adhesion between leadframe and polymeric encapsulation can be strongly improved when the sidewalls of leadframe pad and segments have a surface configuration (roughness, metal oxides) with strong intermolecular affinity to polymeric compounds, independent of any plated metal layer on other leadframe surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Applicant solved the delamination problem of leadframe and polymeric compound concurrently with the leadframe manufacturing problem by the same change in leadframe production steps, namely first plating, then cutting. In the new leadframe manufacturing flow, a strip of a first metal (e.g., copper) is plated on both surfaces with a layer of a second metal (e.g., nickel). Then, the strip is cut with software-driven equipment (e.g., laser jet), whereby the first metal becomes exposed at the sidewalls of the cuts, and is readily oxidized. In addition, the machining is employed to remove the plated second metal from pre-selected leadframe surface areas (e.g., peripheral pad areas), creating and roughening additional zones (e.g., of copper oxide) for leadframe-to-package adhesion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As further benefits, the leadframe fabrication flow of the invention reduces the cycle time for developing new leadframes and introducing new products and any needed initial investment. In addition, the new fabrication flow supports rapid prototyping and designing of experiments, which require multiple variations. Since the computer-numerical controlled tools offer an opportunity to remove certain additional portions of the plated second metal, special features and shapes can be created such as mold locks, mold flow controls, stress-relieving shapes, space for fitting external components, and precision shapes for electrical control.</p>

A semiconductor chip <b>101</b> is attached by a polymeric material <b>102</b> to the pad <b>111</b> of a metallic leadframe <b>110</b>. Besides pad <b>111</b>, the leadframe <b>110</b> has a plurality of leads <b>112</b>. Pad <b>111</b> has a first surface <b>113</b> and a second surface <b>115</b>, which is parallel to first surface <b>113</b>. Leads <b>112</b> have a first surface <b>114</b> and a second surface <b>116</b>, which is parallel to first surface <b>114</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, first surface <b>113</b> of the pad and first surface <b>114</b> of the leads lie in one plane, and second surface <b>115</b> of the pad and second surface <b>116</b> of the leads lie in another parallel plane. In other semiconductor devices, pad <b>111</b> and leads <b>112</b> may be offset relative to each other so that the pad first surface is in a plane different from but parallel to the plane of the lead first surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Pad <b>111</b> further has sidewalls <b>117</b> oriented about normal to the surfaces <b>113</b> and <b>115</b>; leads <b>112</b> have sidewalls <b>118</b> oriented about normal to the surfaces <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> indicates, chip <b>101</b> is electrically connected to the leads by bonding wires <b>103</b>. Furthermore, wires <b>103</b>, chip <b>101</b>, portions of first pad surface <b>113</b>, and first surfaces <b>114</b> are packaged in a protective polymeric encapsulation compound <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, pad <b>111</b> and each lead <b>112</b> of the leadframe <b>110</b> have a core <b>130</b> of a first metal, preferably copper or a copper alloy; other core metal options include aluminum and an iron-nickel alloy (Alloy 42). Core <b>130</b> is preferably in the thickness range from about 120 to 250 &#x3bc;m, but other QFN/SON devices have thinner core metals <b>130</b>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates, the core metal is exposed at the sidewalls of pad <b>111</b> and leads <b>112</b>; these exposed core metal sections are designated <b>130</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the preferred embodiment, the exposed core metal <b>130</b><i>a </i>includes oxides of the first metal. As an example, when first metal is copper, exposed metal <b>130</b><i>a </i>includes copper oxides.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The core metal <b>130</b> is further exposed at area portions of the pad first surface <b>113</b>; the width of these area portions is designated <b>130</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the preferred embodiment, the exposed core metal of width <b>130</b><i>b </i>includes oxides of the first metal. As an example, when first metal is copper, exposed metal <b>130</b><i>b </i>includes copper oxides. For the fabrication of width <b>130</b><i>b </i>see below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Due to their chemical configuration (dangling bonds) and physical roughness, metal oxides enhance the adhesion between polymeric encapsulation compound <b>120</b> and the metallic leadframe <b>110</b>. The reliability of the adhesion between the encapsulating compound and the encapsulated parts depends on the integrity in time and temperature of the interfaces between the compound and the parts. In first order, the interfaces have to guarantee mechanical interlocking of compound and parts strong enough so that different physical expansions and contractions in x- and y-directions based on different coefficients of thermal expansion can be prevented from disrupting the interlocking. With movements in x- and y-directions suppressed, movements in the z-direction (i.e., delamination) can also be inhibited. Volumetric expansion and contraction does not endanger the reliable coherence of the encapsulation compound and the encapsulated parts, especially the encapsulated portions of the leadframe.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further illustrates, pad <b>111</b> and each lead <b>112</b> have a layer of a second metal on both sides of the first metal core. The layer on the first surface side is designated <b>131</b>, and the layer on the second surface side is designated <b>132</b>. Layers <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> may each actually include a stack of two layers. The second metal comprises at least one metal selected from a group including nickel, tin, copper, palladium, silver, and gold. As an example, for nickel the preferred thickness range of layers <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> is between about 0.5 and 2.0 &#x3bc;m; an additional outermost layer of palladium is preferably about 0.1 &#x3bc;m or less, or an additional gold layer about 0.009 &#x3bc;m or less.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by shading, the area portions of width <b>130</b><i>b</i>, which expose the first metal core in oxidized form, include the first surface of the pad <b>111</b>, which is structured so that a frame of width <b>130</b><i>b </i>around the pad periphery exposes the first metal, while the central pad area <b>213</b> is covered by the layer (<b>131</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the second metal. A portion or all of the central pad area <b>213</b> may be used to attach chip <b>101</b> to the leadframe pad <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Another embodiment of the invention is a method for fabricating a leadframe for semiconductor devices, especially for the QFN and SON device families. The process steps of the method are summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and highlighted by the respective sketches of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The method starts with step <b>301</b> by selecting a strip of a first metal as the leadframe core metal; illustration in step <b>401</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As mentioned, a preferred first metal is copper in strips of less than 120 to 250 &#x3bc;m thickness. The strip is preferably a sheet of metal with two flat sides, which is standardized at the assembly and test factories in terms of strip width, length, and thickness. In some factories, the strip is processed in a reel-to-reel operation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The next step <b>302</b> (illustration <b>402</b>) is the plating of the unshaped strip with a layer of a second metal over both sides of the strip. This step is in contrast to the conventional next step, in which the strip is first machined into the leadframe of the selected design, and then plated after the machining process. Preferably, the plating is performed as a so-called pre-plating step, meaning plating before encapsulation (such as molding, see below); alternatively, the strip may remain un-plated for a later plating process after encapsulation (so-called post-plating). As mentioned above, the plating step may include the plating of a stack of two or more metal layers; the second metal comprises at least one metal selected from a group including nickel, tin, copper, palladium, silver, and gold. The preferred plating technique involves electrochemical deposition with tanks of chemical solutions; other techniques include electroless plating, chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, and evaporation. After the plating step, the strip may be stored (step <b>303</b>, illustrated in <b>403</b>) as an unshaped strip until the strip, or a quantity of it, is needed for machining (cutting) in the selected design.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In step <b>304</b>, illustrated in <b>404</b>, the leadframe is shaped; this step includes two actions: Cutting a leadframe pattern from the strip, and removing selected portions of the deposited second metal layer. The areas <b>404</b><i>b </i>of the selected portions are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 404</figref> by shading. The two actions may be performed in parallel, or concurrently. Step <b>304</b> includes a programmable mechanical machining technique operable to cut lines through the thickness of the strip and also to remove portions of the second metal layer from selected surface areas. Among the programmable machining techniques are: Computer numerical controlled tools (CNC); electrical discharge machining (EDM); programmable laser cutting; and programmable water jet cutting. CNC refers to the computer-guided automation of machine tools, operated by abstractly programmed commands encoded on a storage medium. EDM is a manufacturing process, whereby a wanted shape of a leadframe is obtained by using electrical discharges (sparks).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As a feature common to these software-driven machines, no special tools such as stampers for punching and photomasks for etching are needed. Consequently, the software-driven machines have very quick turn-around time and low fixed costs. The faster turn-around time reduces the technology and product introduction cycle time. The low fixed cost reduces the initial investment needed. As another advantage compared to punching or etching, software-driven machines such as CNC, EDM, and Lasers, improve significantly the design rules for spacing, widths, and pitches of the leadframes. These machines thus provide the tools for continued miniaturization of the semiconductor devices, an ongoing trend in the Analog product families, and for denser interconnections, improving the electronic functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Since the strip has a core of a first metal and plated surface layers of a second metal, the cutting of the leadframe pattern from the pre-plated strip in step <b>304</b> exposes the core first metal at the cut lines (sidewalls of the cuts). Had the plating step be performed after the cutting step, as in the conventional leadframe fabrication flow, the cut lines (sidewalls) would be plated over and could not expose the core first metal. The usage of software-driven machine tools further allows removing selected portions of the deposited second metal layer from the surfaces in order to expose additional first metal areas. In step <b>305</b>, illustrated in drawing <b>405</b>, these exposed sections of the first metal core at the cut lines and on surface areas are oxidized. Some oxidation can be accomplished by exposure to ambient; enhanced oxidation is accomplished by exposing the leadframe to oxygen plasma. In addition to chemically creating metal oxides, the method used for cutting and removing roughens the exposed first metal surfaces. As stated above, both the chemical configuration and the physical roughness enhance the adhesion between the encapsulating polymeric compound and the encapsulated metallic leadframe. For product families such as the progressively miniaturized Analog QFN/SON devices, the gradual substitution of improved adhesion quality for shrinking adhesion areas is a technical advantage of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In step <b>306</b>, illustrated in drawing <b>406</b>, the leadframe is used for assembling a semiconductor device. Step <b>306</b> includes mounting a semiconductor chip of the leadframe pad and electrically connecting the chip to the respective leads, using bonding wires.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The flexibility and short cycle time of the computer control of fabricating leadframes allows the designing of experiments (DOE) for leadframes with large variations of design features for improving adhesion, avoiding delamination, locking-in molding compound, and reducing thermomechanical stress. Software-driven tools for machining pre-plated metal sheets can specifically solve two problem regimes where the failure risk increases with shrinking leadframe feature sizes, namely delamination and thermomechanical stress.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a cross section through a lead made of a core first metal <b>501</b> and pre-plated on the surfaces by layers of a second metal <b>502</b>. A mechanical lock <b>500</b> for encapsulation compound has been machined sidewise into the core first metal <b>501</b> by electrical discharges (sparks); the fabrication tool used is a software-controlled EDM. After drilling a via hole <b>510</b> through the stack of first and second metals and inserting an electrode embedded in a dielectric liquid, the metal removal from the leadframe core first metal occurs by a series of rapidly recurring current discharges between the electrode and the lead, separated by a dielectric liquid and subject to an electric voltage. When the electric field between the electrode and the lead becomes larger than dielectric strength (at reduced distance) and some current flows between electrode and lead, material is removed. New liquid flushes the debris and a new liquid dielectric breakdown can occur. Thereafter, the metal forming the space for lock <b>500</b> has a chance to oxidize. During the encapsulation process, a low viscosity polymeric precursor fills the space of lock <b>500</b> as symbolized by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. After polymerization of the precursor, the hardened encapsulation compound is firmly interlocked with the lead, and delamination of the encapsulation compound from the leadframe metal is prevented. The strong coupling of compound and metal is further enhanced by oxidizing the core metal surfaces inside the lock before filling the lock with polymeric compound.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The avoidance of thermomechanical stress, known to be concentrated at corners and edges, by the method of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The FIG. depicts a cross section through a lead made of a core first metal <b>601</b> and pre-plated on the surfaces by layers of a second metal <b>602</b>. After forming the lead by cutting it from a metal sheet, sharp edges <b>603</b> are typically created along the lead, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> at the intersection of the dotted lines (and extending perpendicular to the paper plane). Using computer-controlled laser jets along the sharp edges, the sharp edges are removed and rounded to the contours <b>610</b>. As a consequence, thermomechanical stress no longer peaks at the edges; it does not have any higher value than at other locations along the lead.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">While this invention has been described in reference to illustrative embodiments, this description is not intended to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications and combinations of the illustrative embodiments, as well as other embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description. As an example, the invention applies not only to leadframes for QFN/SON type devices, but to any type of leadframe used for semiconductor devices. As another example, the invention can be applied to a sequence of process steps, wherein the plating step is performed after the device encapsulation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As another example, the method can be extended to computer-controlled machining auxiliary features of the leadframe without the need for extra masks or stamps. For example, electrical resistance may be fine-tuned by local thinning of the leadframe metal and creating performance-controlling metallic shapes. The encapsulation compound may be locked-in by local grooves. Special channels can be created for preferential flowing of the encapsulation compound.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As another example, the method may be employed to custom-shape the metal of the leadframe to create local depressions suitable for inserting external components. As another example, the method may create stress-relieving leadframe shapes such as gull wings, which may even extend outside the device encapsulation compound.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is therefore intended that the appended claims encompass any such modifications or embodiments.</p>
