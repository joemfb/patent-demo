<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A device for frothing milk with a base element including a container for receiving milk to be frothed and a removable lid including a motor for driving a circular annular spring for frothing milk, the latter being driven by a motor in the lid. To this end, electrical energy needs to be transferred to the motor. This is done using inductive coupling. This removes the need for providing bare electrical contacts thus removing disadvantages like risk of short circuit and electrical shock hazards. To achieve this, both the base element and the lid are fitted with windings for transferring electrical energy. To improve the effectiveness of inductive coupling, frequency conversion means are provided to supplying an alternating current at a relatively high frequency to the first winding. The first winding is used as an inductive element for an oscillator as well.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national phase of PCT Appln. No. PCT/NL2010/050265 filed May 6, 2010 which claims priority to the Netherlands application 1036928 filed May 6, 2009, the disclosures of which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a device for frothing milk or other milk-based liquids and the use thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Agitation of milk in the form of frothing the milk is used e.g. for preparing beverages like cappuccinos, milky coffees, caf&#xe9; lattes, macchiato, etc. that typically comprises a liquid portion like coffee topped with a layer of frothed milk.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various devices for frothing milk is known in various types and shapes including simpler domestic ones primarily using physical agitation to froth the milk and typically more professional or advanced ones e.g. using steam from a steam pipe to agitate and thereby froth the milk.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is generally known that heating or pre-heating the milk will typically enhance the frothing process.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As mentioned, domestic milk frothers typically have one or more agitation elements to be immersed in the milk and driven by hand, electromechanically, or magnetically and thereby froth the milk. An aim may be to ensure frothing as fast as possible and/or e.g. also as uniformly as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other types of mixers for food liquids or liquid-like foods are also generally known.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent specification WO 2009/020384 discloses a device for frothing milk. Milk is contained in a container comprised by a main body and heated by means of a heating element. While heating the milk, the milk is agitated by means of a circular annular spring. This results in frothed milk for serving for example a cappuccino or other drinks. The spring is driven by a motor in a lid for closing the container. Contact between the main body and the lid for powering the motor is provided by means of open electrical contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent specification WO 2007/025789 discloses a refrigerator comprising two inductors for contactlessly transferring electrical energy to activate a fan electrical energy to a fan thereby creating air circulation in a drawer. The two inductors disclosed are bulky, making them unsuitable for use in handheld devices.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent specification U.S. Pat. No. 6,219,267 discloses a contactless connecting system between a base and a terminal providing the possibility of supplying any standard electrical appliance once it is connected to the terminal. The terminal disclosed is a bulky device and intended for supplying high power.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Electrical toothbrushes generally available in the market use inductive coupling for charging batteries to power the toothbrush. The inductive coupling transfers electrical energy at a relatively low power level, only suitable for charging the batteries. Hence, users of the toothbrush are highly recommended to power off the toothbrush before charging the batteries, by means of the product documentation.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the invention to provide a device for frothing milk or milk-based liquids that at least to an extent alleviates one or more drawbacks described above.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object is to provide a device for frothing milk that is easier and/or safer to use than currently available.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention provides in a first aspect of the invention a device for frothing milk or other milk based liquids comprising a main body, which main body forms a container for the milk or other milk based liquids, a cover fitting onto a top of the main body; and a driving element operatively coupled to an agitation element, the driving element being at least partially comprised by the cover, wherein the device further comprises an inductive coupling comprising at least one primary winding comprised by the main body and at least one secondary winding comprised by the cover, wherein power for operating the driving element is transferred from the main body to the driving element via said inductive coupling during operation of the driving element.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An advantage of such a device for frothing milk is that there are no bare contacts on the main body and the cover. This decreases or even removes the risk of short circuit between contacts. In addition, different and in particular higher voltages can be used for transferring energy/power from the main body to the driving element. This increases design freedom to provide efficient transfer of energy. Furthermore, by having no bare contacts means that the device for frothing milk may easier be cleaned. This may e.g. be because such bare contacts, e.g. as used in prior art, are usually spring loaded, which means they are flexible and can bend inwardly, resulting in an opening into the main body in which water can enter.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the primary winding and the secondary winding are substantially parallel to a top plane of the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the primary winding and secondary winding are substantially parallel to a circumference of the top of the main body and substantially perpendicular to a top plane of the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the cover and the top of the main body have a similarly shaped circumference and the primary winding follows the circumference of the top of the main body and the secondary winding follows the circumference of the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An advantage of this embodiment is that the actual orientation of the cover on the top of the main body is not relevant for the effectiveness of the inductive coupling. The reason for this is that effective inductive coupling requires proper alignment of the primary and secondary winding. In this embodiment, both windings are properly aligned when the cover is on the main body, irrespective of the orientation of for example a circular cover with respect to the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the cover comprises at least two secondary windings and the primary winding is sandwiched between the two secondary windings during operation of the driving element. An advantage of this embodiment is that the inductive coupling between the primary winding and the secondary windings is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the main body comprises at least two primary windings and wherein the secondary winding is sandwiched between the two primary windings when operating the driving element. An advantage of this embodiment is that the inductive coupling between the primary winding and the secondary windings is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, one winding is located in a stub and the other winding is located around a hole or a slit in which the stub closely fits.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, the cover can be locked onto the main body by means of a bayonet closing and the windings are located in the bayonet closing. An advantage of this embodiment is that the container is securely closed during operation of the milk frothing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, at least one ferrite core is located in the primary winding and/or the secondary winding.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the main body comprises an oscillator for generating a first alternating current at a first frequency, the oscillator being coupled to the primary winding for supplying said alternating current to the primary winding. An advantage of this embodiment is that the frequency of the alternating current provided to the first winding can be controlled by means of design independently from a frequency of an external power source. This is particularly advantageous as the efficiency of inductive coupling is partially determined by the frequency of the alternating current; inductive coupling works more efficiently at a higher frequency of the current in the primary winding.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the main body is connected to an external power source providing a second alternating current at a second frequency, the first frequency being higher than the second frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the oscillator is a Collpits oscillator. An advantage of a Collpits oscillator is that only one inductance is used, where an inductance is usually a relatively expensive component. In addition, Collpits oscillators have at least three degrees of freedom for determining the oscillating frequency, being the values of two capacitances and one inductance.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the primary winding is used as an inductor in the Collpits oscillator. An advantage of this embodiment is that only one winding/inductance is required on the primary side of the inductive coupling, whereas still at least two degrees of freedom are left, being the values of two capacitances. The requirement of only one winding/inductance at the primary side results in a cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the primary winding oscillator is increased to provide higher speed for optima frothing performance.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a milk frothing apparatus <b>100</b> as an embodiment of the device according to the invention. The milk frothing apparatus comprises a main body <b>110</b> comprising a container <b>112</b>, a heating element in the bottom of the main body (not shown), a removable lid <b>150</b> serving as a cover, comprising a driving element housing <b>152</b> comprising a motor <b>154</b> serving as a driving element, an circular annular spiral spring <b>156</b> serving as an agitation element, further referred to as spring <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The milk frothing apparatus also comprises a base element <b>102</b>. The base element is connected to a power cord (not shown) for supplying power to the milk frothing apparatus <b>100</b>. The power is transferred to the main body via a contact stub <b>104</b> to a contact hole in the main body (not shown). In the contact stub, conductive elements are located for contacting further conductive elements in the contact hole. The power is used for powering the heating element and the motor <b>154</b>. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the power cord may also be directly coupled to the main body <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The base element <b>102</b> may e.g. have a general circumference that is of a size substantially the size of a general circumference of (the lower part of) the main body <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The heating element may be configured for being able to heat the container <b>112</b> to an average temperature of about 60&#xb0; C. or so. This can bring milk being frothed (or any other liquid being frothed and/or mixed) to a temperature about 40&#xb0; C. in about 45 seconds, which is usually an acceptable time frame for frothing milk (or other liquid) and also a period of time for when frothing of a good quality may be received. Other temperatures and/or other time periods may be aimed at as well. Subsequent or in parallel to the heating, the milk is agitated by the spring <b>156</b> to froth the milk. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the milk frothing apparatus <b>100</b> may also be used with other milk based liquids or other liquids having similar characteristics enabling it to be frothed, for example due to structure and amount of proteins comprised by the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The power for driving the motor <b>154</b> for agitating the spring <b>156</b> is transferred from the main body to the motor <b>154</b> in the lid <b>150</b> by means of inductive coupling. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>shows a schematic circuit diagram of a simple inductive coupling <b>200</b> comprising a primary winding <b>202</b> and a secondary winding <b>204</b>. The primary winding <b>202</b> is connected to an AC (alternating current) current source. The alternating current in the primary winding <b>202</b> induces a magnetic field in the primary winding, resulting in a magnetic flux.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The magnetic flux is transferred from the primary winding <b>202</b> to the secondary winding <b>204</b>. This results in an alternating current in the secondary winding <b>204</b>. This alternating current can be used to supply power to further devices, like a motor, a heating element or other actuator, either directly or rectified.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The amount of electrical power transferred from the primary winding <b>202</b> to the secondary winding <b>204</b> depends on the amount of magnetic flux transferred from the primary winding to the secondary winding <b>204</b>. The amount of the magnetic flux depends &#x25a1; among others &#x25a1; on the relatively permeability of the material in the centre of the winding.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Ferrite is a material to increase the flux density in inductive devices, though other materials are known to increase the flux density in such devices. A larger flux density improves the energy transfer in an inductive coupling. The core material may e.g. be provided in the winding only (I-shaped), or in and around the winding. In the latter case, the core material could e.g. be M-shaped or W-shaped &#x25a1; with a core for each winding; the full core would result in a double M or W, either separable or not. With a core of such form the windings are around the middle leg of the core and the other legs serve to properly close the magnetic circuit as good as possible. The ferrite &#x25a1; or other material &#x25a1; core can be provided as a rod, a ring or another shape suitable to this set up.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Another factor for improved transfer of magnetic flux in inductive couplings is the distance between the primary winding <b>202</b> and the secondary winding <b>204</b>. The best inductive coupling is achieved by winding the primary winding <b>202</b> and the secondary <b>204</b> winding together. It will be appreciated that this solution is not practical if the primary winding <b>202</b> is located in the main body <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the secondary winding is located in the lid <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) as the main body <b>110</b> and the lid <b>150</b> should be separable. However, good coupling can be achieved by placing the primary winding <b>202</b> in the secondary winding <b>204</b> or vice-versa. In particular in the first case, but to a large extent also in the second case, the whole magnetic flux induced by the primary winding <b>202</b> is comprised by the secondary winding <b>204</b>. This can be achieved by placing one winding in a stub and the other around a hole in which the stub would fit.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Yet another factor for improved transfer of magnetic flux is the alignment of the primary winding <b>202</b> and the secondary winding <b>204</b>. For best transfer of the magnetic flux, a general axis of the primary winding <b>202</b> should be aligned with a general axis of the secondary winding <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>shows a schematic circuit diagram of an inductive coupling <b>210</b> comprising a primary winding <b>212</b>, a first secondary winding <b>214</b> and a second secondary winding <b>216</b>. The primary winding <b>212</b> is sandwiched between the first secondary winding <b>214</b> and the second secondary winding <b>216</b>. In this way, the secondary windings are able to catch more of the magnetic flux sent out by the primary winding <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For use with the milk frothing apparatus <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), this set up for transferring electrical energy to power the motor <b>154</b> by means of inductive coupling may be embodied in several ways, as will be apparent later on in the description. In particular, the main body <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) would comprise a stub or a plate comprising the primary winding <b>212</b> and the lid <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) would comprise a slit or opening in which the stub or plate would fit, with the first secondary winding <b>214</b> on one side of the slit or opening and the second secondary winding <b>216</b> on the other side of the slit or opening.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c </i>shows a schematic circuit diagram of an inductive coupling <b>220</b> comprising a first primary winding <b>222</b>, a second primary winding <b>224</b> and a secondary winding <b>226</b>. The secondary winding <b>226</b> is sandwiched between the first primary winding <b>222</b> and the second primary winding <b>224</b>. In this way, magnetic flux is sent by the primary windings to the secondary winding <b>226</b> from two directions, improving efficiency of the transfer of energy. In practice, for use with the milk frothing apparatus <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), this set up for transferring electrical energy to power the motor <b>154</b> would be embodied in a similar way as with the embodiment depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, though with the slit in the main body <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and a stub or plate fitting the slit in the lid <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an electrical circuit <b>300</b> comprising a base circuit <b>302</b> and a lid circuit <b>352</b>. The base circuit <b>302</b> is comprised by the main body <b>110</b> and the lid circuit is comprised by the lid <b>150</b>, in a particular embodiment by the driving element housing <b>152</b>. The terminals of the base circuit <b>302</b> are coupled to the power cord supplying electrical power to the milk frothing apparatus <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In this embodiment, the electrical power is supplied at 220V and 50 Hz. However, other embodiments are envisageable as well, like 110V and 60 Hz that is used in a smaller set of countries or at other supply voltages or frequencies. For example, the frequency of the electrical power used in aircraft is 400 Hz.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The electrical power is supplied to a first voltage divider <b>312</b> comprising a first resistor <b>331</b> and a second resistor <b>332</b>. By means of the first voltage divider <b>312</b>, the voltage supplied to the rest of the circuit can be chosen upon design of the electrical circuit <b>300</b>. The first voltage divider <b>312</b> is followed by a first rectifier <b>314</b>, comprising a diode <b>333</b> and a first capacitor <b>334</b>. The rectified voltage is, via a third resistor <b>335</b> supplied to a second voltage divider <b>316</b> comprising a fourth resistor <b>336</b> and a fifth resistor <b>337</b>. The voltage over the fifth resistor <b>337</b> is supplied as a base-emitter voltage for a cascode circuit <b>354</b> comprising a first transistor <b>338</b>, a sixth resistor <b>339</b> and a second transistor <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The voltage over the fourth transistor is divided over a second capacitor <b>341</b> and the upper part of the cascode circuit <b>354</b>; one terminal of the second capacitor <b>341</b> being connected to the output terminal of the cascode circuit <b>354</b>. Parallel to the second capacitor <b>341</b>, the electrical circuit provides an oscillator <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The oscillator <b>324</b> is a Colpitts oscillator and comprises a third voltage divider <b>320</b> comprising a seventh resistor <b>342</b> and an eight resistor <b>343</b>, a third transistor <b>344</b>, a ninth resistor <b>345</b>, a capacitive divider <b>328</b> comprising a third capacitor <b>347</b> and a fourth capacitor <b>346</b> and a first inductance <b>348</b>. Though in the electrical circuit <b>300</b> a Colpitts oscillator is used, also other LC oscillators can be used. The advantage of using a Colpitts oscillator is that only one inductance is used and freedom of design is obtained by tweaking the values of the third capacitor <b>347</b> and the fourth capacitor <b>346</b>. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that also other oscillators can be used, including, but not limited to a crystal oscillator or a fully electronic oscillator.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The frequency of the oscillator <b>324</b> can be tuned by means of the values of the third capacitor <b>347</b>, the fourth capacitor <b>346</b> and the first inductance <b>348</b>. As the first inductance <b>348</b> serves as a primary winding for transferring energy to the lid circuit, it is preferred that the value and other characteristics of the first inductance <b>348</b> are optimised for the purpose of transferring that energy.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Optimising the first inductance <b>348</b> for this and other purposes leaves the values of the third capacitor <b>347</b> and the fourth capacitor <b>346</b> for determining the frequency of the oscillator <b>324</b>. For choosing the right oscillator frequency, it is important to realise that energy transfer by inductive coupling works better at higher frequencies. Therefore, it is advantageous to use the first rectifier <b>314</b> to rectify the 220 Volt 50 Hz power received and to subsequently generate an alternating current at a different frequency instead of supplying the 220 Volt 50 Hz directly to the first inductance <b>348</b>. However, the latter option is specifically not excluded as an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The first inductance <b>348</b> is inductively coupled to a second inductance <b>362</b> comprised by the lid circuit <b>352</b> and received electrical energy from the first inductance <b>348</b> by means of inductive coupling in a inductive coupling circuit <b>322</b>. In that way, an alternating current generated by the oscillator <b>324</b> provided to the first inductance <b>348</b> results in another alternating current in the second inductance <b>362</b>, resulting in an alternating voltage over the second inductance <b>362</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">This voltage is supplies to a second rectifier <b>364</b> comprising four diodes in full bridge configuration. The output voltage over the second rectifier <b>364</b> is determined by various factors, including, but not limited to the ratio of windings in the first inductance <b>348</b> and the second inductance <b>362</b> and to the voltage over the first inductance <b>348</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Parallel to the second rectifier <b>364</b>, the two terminals other than those to which the second inductance <b>362</b> is coupled, a fifth capacitor <b>366</b> is provided to smoothen an output voltage provided by the second rectifier <b>364</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Parallel to the fifth capacitor <b>366</b>, the motor <b>154</b> (also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is provided, finally receiving the electrical energy/power (a person skilled in the art will appreciate that power is an instantaneous entity; integrating it over time results in the energy provided by the power source). Alternatively, an alternating current motor can be used, removing the need for the second rectifier <b>364</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The speed of the motor <b>154</b> depends on the amount of energy transferred by the circuit <b>300</b> and in particular on the characteristics of the inductive coupling circuit <b>322</b>. The characteristics of the inductive coupling depend to a large extent on the ratio of windings of the first inductance <b>348</b> and winding of the second inductance <b>362</b>. With a fixed number of windings on the first inductance <b>348</b> and a fixed primary voltage and current, the voltage at the secondary side can be increased in relation to the voltage at the primary side by increasing the number of windings on the second inductance <b>362</b>. As a consequence, the current through the second inductance <b>362</b> will drop.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For properly frothing milk, relatively high speeds are required. Besides optimising the characteristics of the first inductance <b>348</b> and the second inductance <b>362</b> for efficient power transfer by the inductive coupling circuit <b>322</b>, the characteristics are also optimised for achieving a motor speed best suited for frothing milk. Care should be taken to prevent a too low speed, resulting in no frothing, and to prevent a too high speed, destroying the structure of the frothed milk.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the first rectifier <b>314</b> is a half-bridge rectifier and that the second rectifier <b>364</b> is a full bridge rectifier. Both rectifiers can be embodied differently. The reason for embodying the first rectifier <b>314</b> as a half-bridge rectifier is that the cost of the components is lower. The reason for embodying the second rectifier <b>364</b> as a full bridge rectifier is that the largest amount of power received via the inductive coupling circuit <b>322</b> is transferred to the motor <b>154</b>. If in the latter case a half-bridge rectifier would be used, only half the amount of energy would be transferred to the motor <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As indicated before, the base circuit <b>302</b> is to be integrated in the main body <b>110</b> and the lid circuit <b>352</b> are to be integrated in the lid <b>150</b>. The primary winding(s) and secondary winding(s) can be integrated in the main body <b>110</b> and the lid <b>150</b> in several ways, of which various examples have been provided; further examples will be provided in the following part of the description. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that this number of examples is a non-exhaustive number of possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a more detailed view of the top of the milk frothing apparatus <b>100</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the main body <b>110</b>, the lid <b>150</b> and the motor <b>154</b>. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a primary winding <b>402</b> and a secondary winding <b>404</b>. The primary winding <b>402</b> follows the circumference of the top of the main body <b>110</b> and the secondary winding <b>404</b> follows the circumference of the lid <b>150</b>. It is noted that different orientation and/or locations of the windings may be considered. What is important is their similar orientation and closeness.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The primary winding is coupled to the power cord. This can be done either directly, via a conventional inductive power transformer or by other elements, including, but not limited to any type of AC-AC power converters including frequency conversion means as disclosed above.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The primary winding is coupled to an AC power source. This results in an alternating magnetic field and hence an alternating magnetic flux in the primary winding <b>402</b>. As the secondary winding <b>404</b> is located next to the primary winding <b>402</b>, the magnetic flux generated by the primary winding <b>402</b> passes through the secondary winding, in turn creating an AC current in the secondary winding <b>404</b>. The secondary winding <b>404</b> is coupled to the motor <b>154</b> to power the motor <b>154</b> for driving the spring <b>156</b> to froth milk in the container <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The embodiment of the device according to the invention shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is easy to use, as the actual orientation of the lid <b>150</b> on the top of the main body <b>110</b> is not relevant for the effectiveness of the inductive coupling. It is important, though, that the circumference of the top of the main body <b>110</b> is similarly shaped as the lid <b>150</b> &#x25a1; or vice versa &#x25a1; to ensure good inductive coupling. In addition, as discussed before, ferrite core elements may be used to improve inductive coupling between the primary winding <b>402</b> and the secondary winding <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A person skilled in the art will appreciate that ferrite elements are difficult to insert in the centre of the windings. However, small ferrite rods along the edge of the lid <b>150</b>, container <b>112</b> or both already improve inductive coupling. Further improvement may be achieved by replacing individual rods by a ring, in either lid, container or both.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In another embodiment, C-shaped ferrite elements are placed around the primary winding <b>402</b> with the two legs &#x25a1; of the C facing upward and C-shaped ferrite element are placed around the secondary winding <b>404</b> with the two legs of the C facing downward, facing the legs of the C-shaped elements around the primary winding <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows another more detailed view of the top of the milk frothing apparatus <b>100</b>, depicting another embodiment of the device according to the invention. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a primary winding <b>502</b> and a secondary winding <b>504</b>. The windings are located closely to each other, only separated by a small layer of preferably non-conductive material. In addition, both windings should have the same orientation to maximise the inductive coupling. To further improve the inductive coupling, both windings can be provided with a ferrite core or a core of another material having a high magnetic permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The orientation of both windings may be parallel to the circumference of the top of the main body <b>110</b> and substantially perpendicular to a top plane (as defined by the circumference of the opening for receiving a liquid of the main body <b>110</b>) of the main body <b>110</b> As depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and as a person skilled in the art will appreciate, the windings do not need to be exactly perpendicular to the top plane of the main body <b>110</b>. The more or less perpendicular orientation of the windings facilitates removal of the lid <b>150</b> from the main body <b>110</b>. This is in particular the case if the orientation of the top of the winding is tilted slightly away from the main body. The reason for this is that in this way, the lid <b>150</b> can be closed in a practical way with no obstruction. Again, it is noted that different orientation and/or locations of the windings may be considered. As an example, the orientation of the windings may be at an angle different from substantially 90&#xb0; in relation to the top plane of the main body, e.g. if the handle connects to the lid <b>150</b> and/or to the appropriate part of the main body <b>110</b> at an angle different from substantially 90&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As already disclosed above, the primary winding <b>502</b> and the secondary winding <b>504</b> can be fitted with a core, for example comprising ferrite. This can be a single, rod-shape core. In another embodiment, both windings are fitted with an M-shaped or W-shaped core, with the legs of a first core in the first winding pointing towards the legs of the legs of a second core in the second windings. In yet another example, the primary winding and the secondary winding are fit around a C-shaped core, of which the (two) legs are pointing towards each other. The cores can be oriented in various ways, without departing from the scope of the invention, as long as the legs are pointing towards each other to ensure a proper inductive coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The primary winding <b>502</b> may be located in a handle <b>506</b> of the main body <b>110</b>. This has as an advantage that no additional room is taken up by the primary winding <b>502</b>, i.e. there are no additional parts sticking out of the main body <b>110</b>. Another advantage is that a user of the milk frothing apparatus <b>100</b> has a reference for orientation as to how to align the primary winding <b>502</b> with the secondary winding <b>504</b> to ensure proper inductive coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a schematic impression of a further embodiment of the device according to the invention and in particular the location of the windings for the inductive coupling. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a first primary winding <b>602</b> and a second primary winding <b>604</b> located in the main body <b>110</b> of the milk frothing apparatus <b>100</b> and a secondary winding <b>606</b> located in the lid <b>150</b>, preferably in the driving element housing <b>152</b>. The second primary winding <b>602</b> and the second primary winding <b>604</b> are connected in series and coupled to a power source. The power source has been omitted for purposes of clarity; a person skilled in the art will, for example with the help of the electrical circuit <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) understand how to connect the windings to a suitable power source.
