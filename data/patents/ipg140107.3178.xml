<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0004486 filed on Jan. 18, 2010 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a thin-film transistor (TFT), and more particularly, to a TFT substrate and a method of fabricating the TFT substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are one of the most widely used types of flat panel displays. Generally, an LCD includes two substrates having electrodes and a liquid crystal layer interposed between the substrates. In an LCD, voltages are applied to electrodes to rearrange liquid crystal molecules of a liquid crystal layer, thereby controlling the amount of light that passes through the liquid crystal layer. As a result, a desired image is displayed on the LCD.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An LCD uses a thin-film transistor (TFT) substrate that includes a TFT for switching each pixel. A TFT substrate includes gate wiring which delivers a gate signal and data wiring which delivers a data signal. Copper, a metal having a low resistance, may be used for forming gate wiring and data wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When gate wiring and data wiring are formed using copper, a semiconductor pattern may become contaminated during an etching process for forming the data wiring. In addition, contact characteristics between the data wiring and the semiconductor pattern may deteriorate. Accordingly, a separate layer may be formed to prevent contamination of the semiconductor pattern and to enhance contact characteristics of the semiconductor pattern. However, formation of the separate layer may require an additional mask process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of the present invention provide a thin-film transistor (TFT) substrate having reduced defects and fabricated using a reduced number of masks.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings. The present invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Like numbers may refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Hereinafter, a thin-film transistor (TFT) substrate according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a layout view of a TFT substrate according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the TFT substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> taken along the lines A-A&#x2032;, B-B&#x2032;, and C-C&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, gate wiring, which delivers a gate signal, is formed on a substrate <b>10</b>. The gate wiring includes a gate line <b>22</b> and a gate electrode <b>26</b>. The gate line <b>22</b> extends horizontally, and the gate electrode <b>26</b> of a thin-film transistor is connected to the gate line <b>22</b> and protrudes from the gate line <b>22</b>. A gate pad <b>29</b> may be formed at an end of the gate wiring <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> by increasing a width of an end of the gate line <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Storage wiring <b>28</b>, which applies a storage voltage, is also formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. The storage wiring <b>28</b> extends across a pixel region to be substantially parallel to the gate line <b>22</b>. The storage wiring <b>28</b> is overlapped by a pixel electrode <b>81</b>, which will be described later, to form a storage capacitor that increases the charge storage capability of a pixel. The shape and disposition of the storage wiring <b>28</b> may vary. If sufficient storage capacitance can be generated by overlapping the pixel electrodes <b>81</b> and the gate wiring <b>22</b> and <b>26</b>, the storage wiring <b>28</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The gate wiring (including the gate line <b>22</b> and the gate electrode <b>26</b>) and the storage wiring <b>28</b> contain copper. For example, each of the gate wiring <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> and the storage wiring <b>28</b> includes a layer made of copper-based metal such as copper or a copper alloy. Since copper is a metal with low resistivity, it can reduce a signal delay or a voltage drop of the gate wiring <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> and the storage wiring <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A gate insulating film <b>30</b> is formed on the substrate <b>10</b>, the gate wiring <b>22</b> and <b>26</b>, and the storage wiring <b>28</b>. The gate insulating film <b>30</b> is formed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b>, excluding a top surface of the gate pad <b>29</b>. The gate insulating film <b>30</b> may be made of silicon oxide (SiOx), silicon nitride (SiNx), or silicon oxynitride (SiON).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> is formed on the gate insulating film <b>30</b>. The semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> may be made of hydrogenated amorphous silicon or polycrystalline silicon. The semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> may include a film made of n+ hydrogenated amorphous silicon doped with n-type impurities in high concentration on a film made of hydrogenated amorphous silicon or polycrystalline silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> may be an oxide semiconductor pattern. The oxide semiconductor pattern may contain any one of InZnO, InGaO, InSnO, ZnSnO, GaSnO, GaZnO, GaZnSnO, GaInZnO, HfInZnO, and ZnO. This oxide semiconductor has 2 to 100 times greater effective charge mobility than hydrogenated amorphous silicon, thereby showing excellent semiconductor properties.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> is formed on the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b>. The etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> prevents introduction of copper into the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> during a subsequent etching or deposition process performed to form a source electrode <b>65</b> and a drain electrode <b>66</b>. Furthermore, the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> prevents the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> from being damaged by an etchant or an etch gas. The etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> is formed to cover a channel region of the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b>. For example, to prevent exposure of the channel region of the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b>, the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> may be formed in a region overlapping the channel region and may be wider than the channel region. The etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> may be made of any one of SiOx, SiNx, and SiON.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The pixel electrode <b>81</b> and a contact layer <b>83</b> are formed on the gate insulating film <b>30</b>, the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b>, and the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b>. The contact layer <b>83</b> is made of the same material as the pixel electrode <b>81</b>. An auxiliary data pad <b>89</b> made of the same material as the pixel electrode <b>81</b> may be formed in a data pad region. The pixel electrode <b>81</b>, the contact layer <b>83</b>, and the auxiliary data pad <b>89</b> are formed of a transparent conductive film containing indium tin oxide (ITO) or indium zinc oxide (IZO).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the contact layer <b>83</b> is completely overlapped by the source electrode <b>65</b> which will be described later, and the pixel electrode <b>81</b> is completely overlapped by the drain electrode <b>66</b>, which will be described later. The contact layer <b>83</b> extends a predetermined distance beyond the drain electrode <b>66</b>. Therefore, the source electrode <b>65</b> and the drain electrode <b>66</b> directly contact the contact layer <b>83</b> and the pixel electrode <b>81</b> but do not contact the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b>. When the source electrode <b>65</b> and the drain electrode <b>66</b> contain copper, if the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> is an oxide semiconductor pattern, the contact resistance between the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> and the source and drain electrodes <b>65</b> and <b>66</b> may be high. However, according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, since the pixel electrode <b>81</b> made of a transparent conductive film and the contact layer <b>83</b> made of the same material as the pixel electrode <b>81</b> are formed to directly contact the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b>, the contact resistance between the source and drain electrodes <b>65</b> and <b>66</b> and the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Data wiring is formed on the pixel electrode <b>81</b> and the contact layer <b>83</b>. The data wiring includes a data line <b>62</b>, the source electrode <b>65</b>, and the drain electrode <b>66</b>. The data line <b>62</b> extends vertically to cross the gate line <b>22</b> and thus define a pixel. The source electrode <b>65</b> branches off from the data line <b>62</b> and extends onto the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b>. The drain electrode <b>66</b> is separated from the source electrode <b>65</b> and extends onto the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> to face the source electrode <b>65</b> with respect to the gate electrode <b>26</b> or the channel region of the thin-film transistor. A data pad <b>69</b> may be formed at an end of the data wiring <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>66</b> by increasing a width of an end of the data line <b>62</b>. The data pad <b>69</b> may be formed on the auxiliary data pad <b>89</b> which is made of the same material as the pixel electrode <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The data wiring <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>66</b> contains copper. For example, the data wiring <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>66</b> includes a layer made of copper-based metal such as copper or a copper alloy. Since copper is metal with low resistivity, it can reduce a signal delay or a voltage drop of the data wiring <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A protective film <b>90</b> is formed on the data wiring <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>66</b> and the pixel electrode <b>81</b>. The protective film <b>90</b> is formed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b> excluding top surfaces of the gate pad <b>29</b> and the data pad <b>69</b>. The protective film <b>90</b> protects the data wiring <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>66</b> and the pixel electrode <b>81</b> and planarizes a step difference of an underlying structure. The protective film <b>90</b> may be a photosensitive organic or inorganic film.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A modified example of the TFT substrate illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a modified example of the TFT substrate according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a protective film <b>90</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Hereinafter, a method of fabricating a TFT substrate, for example, a TFT substrate similar or identical to those described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 13</figref> are cross-sectional views sequentially illustrating processes included in a method of fabricating the TFT substrate according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the gate wiring <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> including the gate electrode <b>26</b> is formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. The forming of the gate wiring <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> includes forming the storage wiring <b>28</b> and the gate pad <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Specifically, a gate wiring conductive film is formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. The gate wiring conductive film contains copper. The gate wiring conductive film may be formed by sputtering. If the substrate <b>10</b> is made of soda lime glass which is weak when exposed to heat, low-temperature sputtering may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, the gate wiring conductive film is patterned by wet etching or dry etching to form the gate wiring (including the gate line <b>22</b> and the gate electrode <b>26</b>), the storage wiring <b>28</b>, and the gate pad <b>29</b>. For wet etching, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, or acetic acid may be used as an etchant. For dry etching, a chorine (Cl)-based etch gas, such as Cl<sub>2 </sub>or BCl<sub>3</sub>, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, the gate insulating film <b>30</b>, a semiconductor layer <b>40</b>, and an etch-stop film <b>50</b> are sequentially formed on the gate wiring <b>22</b> and <b>26</b>, the storage wiring <b>28</b>, and the gate pad <b>29</b>. The gate insulating film <b>30</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>40</b>, and the etch-stop film <b>50</b> may be formed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b> by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Then, a photoresist layer is coated on the etch-stop film <b>50</b> and patterned to form a first photoresist pattern <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> which is used to form the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> and the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b>. The first photoresist pattern <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> includes two regions of different thicknesses. A thick region <b>111</b> covers a region in which the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> is to be formed, and a thin region <b>112</b> covers a region in which the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> is to be formed. The first photoresist pattern <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> may be formed using a slit mask or a halftone mask.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the etch-stop film <b>50</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>40</b> are etched using the first photoresist pattern <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> as an etch mask. As a result of etching the semiconductor layer <b>40</b>, the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> is formed. The etch-stop film <b>50</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>40</b> may be wet- or dry-etched separately or may be etched simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first photoresist pattern <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> is etched back, thereby leaving the thick region <b>111</b> while removing the thin region <b>112</b>. The removal of the thin region <b>112</b> may be accomplished by an ashing process using oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the etch-stop film <b>50</b> is etched using the remaining thick region <b>111</b> of the first photoresist pattern as an etch mask. As a result of etching the etch-stop film <b>50</b>, the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> is formed. The etch-stop film <b>50</b> may be dry-etched using an etch gas such as CF<sub>3</sub>, CHF<sub>6</sub>, or Cl<sub>2</sub>. Since the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> and the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> are formed using one first photoresist pattern <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>, no additional mask is required to form the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, the remaining thick region <b>111</b> of the first photoresist pattern is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a transparent conductive film <b>80</b> and a data wiring conductive film <b>60</b>, which contains copper, are sequentially formed on the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> and the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b>. The transparent conductive film <b>80</b> and the data wiring conductive film <b>60</b> may be formed by sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>10</b>, a photoresist layer is coated on the data wiring conductive film <b>60</b> and patterned to form a second photoresist pattern <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> which is used to form the pixel electrode <b>81</b>, the contact layer <b>83</b>, the auxiliary data pad <b>89</b>, the data wiring (including the data line <b>62</b>, the source electrode <b>65</b> and the drain electrode <b>66</b>), and the data pad <b>69</b>. The second photoresist pattern <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> includes two regions of different thicknesses. A thin region <b>114</b> covers a region in which the pixel electrode <b>81</b> is to be formed, and a thick region <b>113</b> covers a region in which the contact layer <b>83</b>, the auxiliary data pad <b>89</b>, the data wiring <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>66</b>, and the data pad <b>69</b> may be formed. The second photoresist pattern <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> may be formed using a slit mask or a halftone mask.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the data wiring conductive film <b>60</b> and the transparent conductive film <b>80</b> are etched using the second photoresist pattern <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> as an etch mask. As a result of etching the transparent conductive film <b>80</b>, the pixel electrode <b>81</b>, the contact layer <b>83</b>, and the auxiliary data pad <b>89</b> are formed. The data wiring conductive film <b>60</b> in the data pad region is etched to form the data pad <b>69</b>. The transparent conductive film <b>80</b> and the data wiring conductive film <b>60</b> may be wet- or dry-etched separately or may be wet-etched simultaneously using an etchant that contains nitric acid and fluorine ions.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the second photoresist pattern <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> is etched back, thereby leaving the thick region <b>113</b> while removing the thin region <b>114</b>. The removal of the thin region <b>114</b> may be accomplished by an ashing process using oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the data wiring conductive film <b>60</b> is etched using the remaining thick region <b>113</b> of the second photoresist pattern as an etch mask. As a result of etching the data wiring conductive film <b>60</b>, the data wiring (including the data line <b>62</b>, the source electrode <b>65</b>, and the drain electrode <b>66</b>) is formed. The data wiring conductive film <b>60</b> may be wet-etched or dry-etched. In the case of wet etching, an etchant having a sufficiently high etch selectivity with respect to the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> under the data wiring conductive film <b>60</b> is used. In the case of dry etching, an ashing process for removing the thin region <b>114</b> of the second photoresist pattern and the etching process can be performed successively.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, the transparent conductive film <b>80</b> is formed before the data conductive film <b>60</b>, and the transparent conductive film <b>80</b> and the data wiring conductive film <b>60</b> are etched using the second photoresist pattern <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>. Accordingly, the number of masks used is minimized. In addition, since the contact layer <b>83</b> and the pixel electrode <b>81</b> which contact the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> are formed by patterning the transparent conductive film <b>80</b> under the data wiring conductive film <b>60</b>, contact characteristics between the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> and the source and drain electrodes <b>65</b> and <b>66</b> can be improved, especially when the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> is an oxide semiconductor pattern. Moreover, since a thick organic film is not formed between the pixel electrode <b>81</b> and the storage wiring <b>28</b>, the process of ashing the organic film may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 2</figref>, the remaining thick region <b>113</b> of the second photoresist pattern is removed. Then, the protective film <b>90</b> is formed on the source electrode <b>65</b>, the drain electrode <b>66</b>, and the pixel electrode <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The protective film <b>90</b> is formed to expose the top surfaces of the gate pad <b>29</b> and the data pad <b>69</b>. For example, if the protective film <b>90</b> is a positive photosensitive organic film, regions of the protective film <b>90</b> which correspond respectively to the gate pad <b>29</b> and the data pad <b>69</b> may be exposed to light and then developed to expose the top surfaces of the gate pad <b>29</b> and the data pad <b>69</b>. If the protective film <b>90</b> is a negative photosensitive organic film, regions other than the regions, which correspond respectively to the gate pad <b>29</b> and the data pad <b>69</b>, may be exposed to light and then developed to expose the top surfaces of the gate pad <b>29</b> and the data pad <b>69</b>. Meanwhile, if the protective film <b>90</b> is an inorganic film, the inorganic film formed on the top surfaces of the gate pad <b>29</b> and the data pad <b>69</b> is removed using a conventional photolithography process for forming a photoresist pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">To fabricate the TFT substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the process of removing the protective film <b>90</b> may further be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 13</figref>, the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> and the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> are formed using the first photoresist pattern (consisting of the thick and thin regions <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>), and the pixel electrode <b>81</b> and the data wiring <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>66</b> are formed using the second photoresist pattern (consisting of the thick and thin regions <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>). However, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, after the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> and the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> are formed using the first photoresist pattern <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>, the pixel electrode <b>81</b> may be formed by a photolithography process using a pixel electrode mask, and the data wring <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>66</b> may be formed by another photolithography process using a data wiring mask. Alternatively, the semiconductor pattern <b>42</b> and the etch-stop pattern <b>52</b> may respectively be formed by photolithography processes using a semiconductor pattern mask and an etch-stop pattern mask, and the pixel electrode <b>81</b> and the data wiring <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>66</b> may be formed using the second photoresist pattern <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>.</p>
