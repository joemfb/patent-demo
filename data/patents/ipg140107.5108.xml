<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a), this application claims the benefit of earlier filing date and right of priority to Korean Application No. 10-4006-0094143, filed on Sep. 27, 2006, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of checking modification of a transmitted message in a mobile communication terminal and a mobile communication terminal performing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCUSSION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A multimedia message service (MMS) is a messaging technology for mobile networks allowing transmitting and receiving of multimedia information by processing, converting, and selecting data in various formats, making the data suitable for various multimedia service environments.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When a user of a transmitting mobile communication terminal prepares and transmits a multimedia message according to an Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) specification, the transmitted multimedia message is transmitted to a receiving mobile communication terminal through a Multimedia Message Service Center (MMSC).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the multimedia message arrives at a receiving mobile communication terminal, the MMSC generates a delivery report and transmits the delivery report to the transmitting mobile communication terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">From the delivery report the conventional transmitting mobile communication terminal could only check whether a multimedia message was transmitted to the receiving mobile communication terminal, whether the receiving mobile communication terminal received the multimedia message or would receive the multimedia message later.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, data included in the transmitted multimedia message may be deformed by the MMSC, and thus, the receiving mobile communication terminal may receive a multimedia message comprising deformed data.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Even in this case, the delivery report will report that the data were delivered normally to the receiving mobile communication terminal, and thus, the user of the transmitting mobile communication terminal would believe that the transmitted multimedia message has been delivered properly.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect of the invention, a method of checking for modification of a message transmitted by a transmitting mobile terminal comprises transmitting an original message to a receiving mobile terminal, receiving a report message comprising information about any modification of the original message, and displaying information about the modification of the original message.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the invention, the method further comprises transmitting the original message to the receiving mobile terminal via a message server. Preferably, the original message comprises a multimedia message and the report message is received from a multimedia message service center (MMSC). Also preferably, the report message comprises a delivery report or a read report, and the delivery report or the read report further comprises an adaptation field to report detailed information about the modification of the original message.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further aspect of the invention, the displayed information comprises at least one of a size modification of the original message, a resolution modification of an image file included in the original message, a quality modification of a sound file included in the original message, a type or number modification of a media file included in the original message, and presence of a media form that is not supported by the receiving mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further aspect of the invention, the method further comprises receiving a notification message at the transmitting mobile terminal notifying arrival of the original message transmitted from the transmitting mobile terminal at the receiving mobile terminal. Preferably, the notification message is received from a short message service center (SMSC).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect of the invention, the method further comprises determining the modification by comparing a message transmitted to the receiving mobile terminal, and which is based upon the original message, and the original message.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a mobile terminal comprises a wireless transceiver for transmitting an original message to a receiving mobile terminal and receiving a report message comprising information about any modification of the original message, a controller for obtaining information about the modification of the original message from the report message, and a display for displaying information about the modification of the original message. Preferably, the original message is transmitted to the receiving mobile terminal via message server, the original message comprises a multimedia message, and the report message is received from a multimedia message service center (MMSC). Also preferably, the report message comprises a delivery report or a read report, and the delivery report or the read report further comprises an adaptation field to report detailed information about the modification of the original message.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect of the invention, in the mobile terminal, the information about the modification of the original message comprises at least one of a size modification of the original message, a resolution modification of an image file included in the original message, a quality modification of a sound file included in the original message, a type or number modification of a media file included in the original message, and presence of a media form that is not supported by the receiving mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further aspect of the invention, the mobile terminal further comprises a wireless transceiver for receiving a notification message notifying arrival of the original message transmitted from the transmitting mobile terminal at the receiving mobile terminal. Preferably, the notification message is transmitted via a short message service center (SMSC), and the modification is determined by the server by comparing a message transmitted to the receiving mobile terminal, and which is based upon the original message, and the original message.</p>
