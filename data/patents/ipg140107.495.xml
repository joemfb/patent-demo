<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Protective gear, such as chest protectors, helmets, masks, and shin guards, has long been used to protect baseball and softball catchers from pitched balls and balls deflected or &#x201c;foul-tipped&#x201d; off of bats. Chest protectors are typically made from a relatively flexible material, and generally have energy-absorbing foam or other energy-absorbing padding sewn or stitched into the flexible material for absorbing the impact of a pitched or tipped baseball or softball. Straps are commonly attached to the chest protector for securing the chest protector around the back of the catcher.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Chest protectors often include energy-absorbing padding that is stacked asymmetrically to absorb impact particularly well from objects striking the front-facing surface of the chest protector. The energy-absorbing padding is typically a closed-cell foam material capable of withstanding and absorbing significant impacts from a ball. As a result, the wearer is protected, and the ball is prevented from deflecting or bouncing a great distance from the wearer due to the energy-absorbing characteristics. An outer layer of fabric is typically stitched to the energy-absorbing padding, while an inner layer of fabric is typically stitched or compression-molded to the energy-absorbing padding.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A reversible chest protector includes internal padding configured to absorb impacts against both the front and rear-facing surfaces of the chest protector. The chest protector includes inner and outer layers of fabric that are molded to an internal foam core. The foam core optionally includes outer layers of closed-cell foam molded to the fabric layers, and an internal layer of open-cell foam molded to the closed-cell foam layers, such that the padding layup is symmetrical. Other features and advantages will appear hereinafter. The features described above can be used separately or together, or in various combinations of one or more of them.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various embodiments of the invention will now be described. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and enabling description of these embodiments. One skilled in the art will understand, however, that the invention may be practiced without many of these details. Additionally, some well-known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description of the various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The terminology used in the description presented below is intended to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention. Certain terms may even be emphasized below; however, any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this detailed description section.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Where the context permits, singular or plural terms may also include the plural or singular term, respectively. Moreover, unless the word &#x201c;or&#x201d; is expressly limited to mean only a single item exclusive from the other items in a list of two or more items, then the use of &#x201c;or&#x201d; in such a list is to be interpreted as including (a) any single item in the list, (b) all of the items in the list, or (c) any combination of items in the list.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Turning now in detail to the drawings, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a reversible chest protector <b>10</b> includes a torso-protecting region <b>14</b> and two shoulder-protecting regions <b>16</b>. The reversible chest protector <b>10</b> will be referred to herein as having a &#x201c;home&#x201d; side and an &#x201c;away&#x201d; side&#x2014;to indicate a team's differing uniform indicia&#x2014;but any other markings or indicia may be included on the two sides, or the front and rear-facing surfaces, of the protector <b>10</b>. Because the protector <b>10</b> is reversible, it may be oriented such that either the home side or the away side is the front-facing, impact-absorbing side during a given situation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the reversible chest protector <b>10</b> includes a symmetrical pad layup such that the protector <b>10</b> is capable of absorbing impacts equally from either side. In one embodiment, the chest protector <b>10</b> includes an inner foam core element <b>18</b>, two outer foam core elements <b>20</b> having substantially the same thickness as each other, and two external fabric layers. The fabric layers <b>22</b> may be made of spandex (for example, Lycra&#xae;), nylon, or of another suitable material. The foam and fabric layers are preferably molded together, via compression-molding or a similar process, to provide a rigid outer surface relative to one formed by stitching external fabric to a foam core. Any other number of core elements, made of any suitable materials, may alternatively be used.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Because the outer fabric layers <b>22</b> are compression-molded to the outer foam core elements <b>20</b>&#x2014;and each outer surface of the protector <b>10</b> is therefore relatively rigid and capable of dissipating energy&#x2014;the inner foam core element <b>18</b> does not need to absorb as much energy as a traditional foam core to dissipate the same amount of impact energy. Thus, in one embodiment, the inner foam core element <b>18</b> may be an open-cell foam, such as polyurethane foam. This inner core material preferably has a density of approximately 22 to 28 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Such a foam is typically much less expensive than a traditional closed cell, energy-absorbing foam. In this embodiment, the two outer foam core elements <b>20</b> may each be a closed-cell, energy-absorbing foam, such as a cross-linked polyethylene. This outer core material preferably has a density of approximately 100 to 110 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inner foam core element <b>18</b> may be substantially thicker than the two outer foam core elements <b>20</b> combined, since the compression-molding process provides rigid, energy-dissipating outer surfaces. In one embodiment, the inner foam core element <b>18</b> has a thickness of approximately 14.5 mm to 15.5 mm, while each outer foam core element <b>20</b> has a thickness of approximately 3.5 mm to 4.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The compression-molded chest protector <b>10</b> has the surprising ability to &#x201c;deaden&#x201d; a ball upon impact, such that the ball does not deflect or bounce far from the catcher. It was initially expected that the ball would bounce a great distance off of the protector <b>10</b> due to the relative rigidity of the outer surfaces. The compression-molded outer surfaces, however, effectively dissipate energy over a large area such that ball deflections are minimal. Thus, the compression-molded chest protector <b>10</b> provides not only reversibility and sufficient energy absorption to protect the wearer, but it also sufficiently deadens a ball upon impact such that the ball does not end up a great distance from the catcher.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, one or more adjustable straps <b>28</b>, or other elements suitable for securing the chest protector to a wearer, are connected, or detachably connected, to the chest protector <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, each of the straps <b>28</b> is connected to a clip <b>29</b> or buckle at one end, and includes an attachment element <b>30</b>, such as a plastic fastener, at its free or distal end. The attachment elements <b>30</b> alternatively may include hooks on swivel bases so that the straps <b>28</b> may be rotated when reversing the chest protector between the home and away sides, or may be any other suitable fasteners that allow for reversibility of the chest protector <b>10</b>. The adjustable straps <b>28</b> optionally are made of an elastic material, such as nylon or spandex, such that they are stretchable under loading conditions and are able to return to their original lengths when the load is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Receiving elements <b>32</b> are preferably attached, directly or indirectly (e.g., via straps), to lower side regions and to an upper region of the chest protector <b>10</b>, for receiving the attachment elements <b>30</b>. Alternatively, the attachment elements <b>30</b> may be attached to the lower side regions and the upper region of the chest protector, while the receiving elements <b>32</b> may be attached to the free ends of the adjustable straps <b>28</b>. A wearer may don the chest protector <b>10</b> by pulling it over his or her head, such that the shoulder-protecting regions <b>16</b> rest on the wearer's shoulders. The wearer may then insert the attachment elements <b>30</b> into the corresponding receiving elements <b>32</b>. If necessary, the wearer (or another person) may tighten or loosen the adjustable straps <b>28</b> to provide a proper, secure fit. Any other suitable connecting mechanisms or fastening elements that allow for reversibility of the chest protector <b>10</b> may be used to secure the chest protector <b>10</b> to the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additional padding may optionally be permanently or removably attached to the chest protector <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>, for example, one or more shoulder pads <b>40</b> or upper arm pads may be removably attached to the shoulder-protecting regions <b>16</b> of the protector <b>10</b> via hook and loop fasteners <b>42</b> and <b>42</b>&#x2032; or via any other suitable connectors. A shoulder pad <b>40</b> may include different markings or indicia on opposing sides of the shoulder pad, allowing the wearer to alternatively display home and away indicia or other information. Including one or more removable shoulder pads also provides a catcher with the option to remove, for example, a pad that would otherwise protect the catcher's throwing shoulder, thus providing increased freedom of movement when throwing a ball. Alternatively, a catcher could remove a pad that would otherwise protect the catcher's non-throwing shoulder, thus providing increased freedom of movement when reaching for a pitched, batted, or thrown ball. Other additional pads may optionally be included to protect various regions of the wearer's body.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The reversible chest protector <b>10</b> may be assembled by cutting the various foam and fabric layers to a desired size, positioning the outer foam cores <b>20</b> over the inner foam core <b>18</b>, and positioning the'fabric layers <b>22</b> over the outer foam cores <b>20</b> to form a chest protector pre-form structure. The pre-form structure may then be placed into a molding apparatus, such as a compression-molding apparatus. The chest protector pre-form is heated at a temperature of approximately 140&#xb0; C. to 160&#xb0; C. for approximately five to seven minutes to form the main body of the chest protector <b>10</b>. The main body is then allowed to cool, after which it is removed from the molding apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The receiving elements <b>32</b> (or fasteners <b>30</b>) may then be sewed, or attached via straps, to the side and upper regions of the chest protector <b>10</b>. Adjustable straps <b>28</b> may then be attached to the receiving elements via the fasteners <b>30</b> at the distal ends of the straps <b>28</b> (or via receiving elements <b>32</b> at the distal ends of the straps <b>28</b>, if the fasteners <b>30</b> are instead included on the main body of the chest protector <b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">To reverse the chest protector <b>10</b> from an outwardly facing home-side to an outwardly facing away-side, for example, a user may disconnect one or more of the fasteners <b>30</b>, move the straps <b>28</b> to the other side of the protector <b>10</b>, then reattach the fasteners <b>30</b> to the receiving elements <b>32</b>. For example, a user may disconnect the side-fasteners <b>30</b> from the side-receiving elements <b>32</b>, flip the upper receiving element <b>32</b> over to the other side of the protector <b>10</b>, then re-insert the fasteners <b>30</b> into the receiving elements <b>32</b>. The chest protector <b>10</b> may alternatively be reversed in any other suitable manner. For example, the adjustable straps <b>28</b> may be detached completely from the protector <b>10</b>, and then reattached to the other side of the protector.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Any of the above-described embodiments may be used alone or in combination with one another. Furthermore, the reversible chest protector may include additional features not described herein. While several embodiments have been shown and described, various changes and substitutions may of course be made, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention, therefore, should not be limited, except by the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
