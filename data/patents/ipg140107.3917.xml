<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to an apparatus for, and a method of, electro-optically reading targets by image capture and, more particularly, to a wide angle, athermalized, achromatic, hybrid imaging lens assembly for capturing return light from a target over a field of view of a solid-state imager of an imaging reader, and for projecting the captured return light onto the imager during reading of the target.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Solid-state imaging apparatus or imaging readers, that have been configured either as handheld, portable scanners and/or stand-mounted, stationary scanners each having a presentation window, or as vertical slot scanners each having a generally vertically arranged, upright window, or as flat-bed or horizontal slot scanners each having a generally horizontally arranged window, or as bi-optical, dual window scanners each having both generally horizontally and vertically arranged windows, have been used in many venues, such as supermarkets, department stores, and other kinds of retailers, libraries, parcel deliveries, as well as factories, warehouses and other kinds of industrial settings, for many years, in both handheld and hands-free modes of operation, to electro-optically read by image capture a plurality of symbol targets, such as one-dimensional symbols, particularly Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code symbols, and two-dimensional symbols, as well as non-symbol targets, such as driver's licenses, receipts, signatures, etc., the targets being associated with, or borne by, objects or products to be processed by the imaging readers. In the handheld mode, a user, such as an operator or a customer, held the imaging reader and manually aimed a window thereon at the target. In the hands-free mode, the user slid or swiped a product associated with, or bearing, the target in a moving direction across and past a respective window in a swipe mode, or momentarily presented the target associated with, or borne by, the product to an approximate central region of the respective window, and steadily momentarily held the target in front of the respective window, in a presentation mode. The choice depended on the type of the reader, or on the user's preference, or on the layout of the venue, or on the type of the product and target.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The imaging reader included a solid-state imager (also known as an imaging sensor) with a sensor array of photocells or light sensors (also known as pixels), which corresponded to image elements or pixels over a field of view of the imaging sensor, and an imaging lens assembly for capturing return light scattered and/or reflected from a target being imaged over a working range of distances, and for projecting the return light onto the imaging sensor to initiate capture of an image of the target as pixel data. The imaging sensor was configured as a one- or two-dimensional charge coupled device (CCD) or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) device, and included associated circuits for producing and processing an electrical signal corresponding to a one- or two-dimensional array of the pixel data over the field of view. The imaging sensor was controlled by a controller or programmed microprocessor that was operative for processing the electrical signal into data indicative of the target being imaged and, when the target was a symbol, for processing and decoding the symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The known imaging lens assembly typically comprised a plurality of lenses of different sizes and optical powers, such as a classical Cooke triplet that allowed elimination of most of the optical distortion or color aberration at the outer edge of the lenses. The Cooke triplet typically comprised a negative flint glass lens in the center of the lens assembly with a crown glass lens on each side of the center lens. The lenses were held in a lens holder and axially arranged along an optical axis. An aperture stop having a rotationally symmetrical aperture, e.g., a circular aperture, or a non-rotationally symmetrical (or asymmetrical) aperture, e.g., a rectangular or elliptical aperture, centered on the optical axis, was typically located between one of the side glass lenses and the center glass lens. In the Cooke triplet, the sum of all the lens curvatures multiplied by the indices of refraction of the lenses was typically designed to be zero, so that the field of focus is flat (zero Petzval field curvature).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditionally, each lens of the Cooke triplet was made of glass for improved thermal stability, because glass has a relatively lower coefficient of thermal expansion and a relatively lower refractive index variation over temperature, as compared to plastic, for example. Hence, an all-glass lens design was typically used to minimize focal shift over an operating temperature range. To provide the known imaging lens assembly with a wide angle field of view, e.g., greater than 50 degrees, it was known to add a fourth glass spherical lens of negative optical power in front of the Cooke triplet. Sometimes, to improve the imaging performance, a fifth glass spherical lens was added.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the all-glass imaging lens design comprised of three, four, or five or more glass lenses was relatively heavy and expensive. It was possible to reduce the number of glass lenses by configuring aspherical surfaces on a respective glass lens. However, the manufacture of aspherical surfaces on glass lenses by machining and polishing was challenging and costly. Aspherical surfaces could be readily and inexpensively molded on a plastic lens, which was also lighter than a corresponding glass lens. Nevertheless, despite the lighter weight and lower fabrication cost of the plastic lens, the thermal instability and focal shift were unacceptable in many electro-optical reading applications. Full thermal stability and full color aberration correction were not simultaneously achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a compact, lightweight and inexpensive, imaging lens assembly of high thermal stability, with minimal optical distortion or color aberration, and with a wide angle field of view, especially useful in portable and mobile applications where size, weight and cost are at a premium.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The apparatus and method components have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with one feature of this invention, a hybrid imaging lens assembly captures return light from a target over a field of view of an array of image sensors of a solid-state imager, and projects the captured return light onto the array during electro-optical reading of the target. The assembly comprises a plastic lens group having substantially no optical power of the imaging lens assembly for optical aberration compensation, and a glass lens group spaced away from the plastic lens group along an optical axis and having substantially all the optical power of the imaging lens assembly for thermal stability. The assembly also comprises an aperture stop that is located between the lens groups and that has an aperture through which the optical axis extends. A holder holds the lens groups and the aperture stop in spaced relation along the optical axis relative to the array.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the plastic lens group has a pair of plastic lenses spaced apart from each other along the optical axis. One of the plastic lenses has a negative optical power, and the other of the plastic lenses has a positive optical power. Each plastic lens has opposite aspherical surfaces. An aspherical surface on each plastic lens is convexly curved in a direction facing away from the array. The glass lens group has a pair of glass lenses. One of the glass lenses has a negative optical power, and the other of the glass lenses has a positive optical power. Each glass lens has a high index of refraction.

The aperture stop is a discrete optical component separate from the holder and is in direct surface area contact with the lens groups.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This part-plastic, part-glass, hybrid lens design is compact and achieves the above-described dual advantages of glass and plastic in which the glass lens group provides, among other things, substantial thermal stability and substantial color aberration correction, and the plastic lens group provides, among other things, not only optical aberration compensation, a lighter weight, an easier and more cost efficient manufacture, but also enables aspherical surfaces to be readily integrated in the imaging lens assembly to reduce the number of lenses required and to widen the angle of the field of view. The aspherical surfaces on the plastic lenses increase the field of view angle without requiring an extra lens. By minimizing the combined optical power of the plastic lens group, and by providing substantially all the optical power of the imaging lens assembly only by the combined optical power of the glass lens group, the assembly is athermalized, and any color aberrations introduced by the plastic lens group is corrected by the glass lens group.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turning now to the drawings, reference numeral <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> generally identifies an imaging apparatus or reader having a presentation area configured as a generally upright window <b>26</b> and a gun-shaped housing <b>28</b> supported by a base <b>32</b> for supporting the imaging reader <b>30</b> on a countertop. The imaging reader <b>30</b> can thus be used in a hands-free mode as a stationary workstation in which products are slid, swiped past, or presented to, the window <b>26</b>, or can be picked up off the countertop and held in an operator's hand and used in a handheld mode in which the reader is moved, and a trigger <b>34</b> is manually depressed to initiate imaging of a target, especially one- or two-dimensional symbols, to be read at a working distance from the window <b>26</b>. In another variation, the base <b>32</b> can be omitted, and housings of other configurations can be employed. For example, the housing can be configured as a vertical slot scanner having a generally vertically arranged, upright window, or as a flat-bed or horizontal slot scanner having a generally horizontally arranged window, or as a bi-optical, dual window scanner having both generally horizontally and vertically arranged windows, A cable, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, connected to the base <b>32</b> can also be omitted, in which case, the reader <b>30</b> communicates with a remote host by a wireless link, and the reader <b>30</b> is electrically powered by an on-board battery.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an imager or imaging sensor <b>24</b> is mounted on a printed circuit board <b>22</b> in the reader. The imaging sensor <b>24</b> is a solid-state device, for example, a CCD or a CMOS imaging sensor having an array of addressable image sensors or pixels, preferably, but not necessarily, arranged in a single, linear, one-dimensional row along an array axis, and operative for detecting return light captured by an imaging lens assembly <b>20</b> along an optical path or optical axis <b>46</b> that extends through the window <b>26</b>. The return light is scattered and/or reflected from a target or symbol <b>38</b> as pixel data over a field of view. The imaging lens assembly <b>20</b> is operative for focusing and projecting the return light onto the array of image sensors to enable the target <b>38</b> to be read. The target <b>38</b> is located anywhere in a range of working distances between a close-in working distance (WD<b>1</b>) and a far-out working distance (WD<b>2</b>). In a preferred embodiment, WD<b>1</b> is about four to six inches from the imaging sensor <b>24</b>, and WD<b>2</b> can be many feet from the window <b>26</b>, for example, around fifty feet away.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An illuminating assembly is also mounted in the imaging reader and preferably includes an illuminator or illuminating light sources <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, e.g., light emitting diodes (LEDs), and corresponding illuminating lenses <b>10</b>, <b>16</b> to uniformly illuminate the target <b>38</b> with an illuminating light having an intensity level over an illumination time period. The light sources <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> are preferably pulsed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the imaging sensor <b>24</b> and the illuminating light sources <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> are operatively connected to a controller or programmed microprocessor <b>36</b> operative for controlling the operation of these components. Preferably, the microprocessor <b>36</b> is operative for processing the return light from the target <b>38</b>, and for decoding the captured target image when the target <b>38</b> is a symbol. A memory <b>14</b> is accessible by the controller <b>36</b> for storing and retrieving data.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In operation, the controller <b>36</b> sends a command signal to pulse the illuminating light sources <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> for the illumination time period, say 500 microseconds or less, and energizes and exposes the imaging sensor <b>24</b> to collect light, e.g., illumination light and/or ambient light, from the target <b>38</b> during an exposure time period. A typical array needs about 16-33 milliseconds to acquire the entire target image and operates at a frame rate of about 30-60 frames per second.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with one aspect of this invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, the imaging lens assembly <b>20</b> provided in the reader <b>30</b> is modified to be a compact, wide angle, athermalized, achromatic, hybrid lens assembly operative for capturing return illumination light through the window <b>26</b> from the target <b>38</b> over the field of view, and for projecting the captured return illumination light from the target <b>38</b> onto the imaging sensor <b>24</b> during electro-optical reading of the target <b>38</b>. The hybrid assembly <b>20</b> includes a plastic lens group having substantially no optical power, and comprised of a pair of plastic lenses <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. The hybrid assembly <b>20</b> also includes a glass lens group having substantially all the optical power of the imaging lens assembly, and comprised of a pair of glass lenses <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. The glass lens group is spaced away from the plastic lens group along the optical axis <b>46</b>. The hybrid assembly <b>20</b> also comprises an aperture stop <b>60</b> that is located between the lens groups and that has an aperture <b>62</b> through which the optical axis <b>46</b> extends. A tubular optical barrel or holder <b>64</b> holds the lens groups and the aperture stop <b>60</b> in axially spaced relation along the optical axis <b>46</b> relative to the imaging sensor <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The plastic lenses <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are spaced apart at an air gap or spacing, e.g., about 0.5 mm, from each other along the optical axis <b>46</b>. The plastic lens <b>50</b> has a negative optical power, is constituted of a low dispersion (crown) plastic material, and has opposite aspherical surfaces, both of which are convexly curved in a direction facing away from the sensor <b>24</b>. The plastic lens <b>50</b> also has a relatively high Abbe number, e.g., about 55. The Abbe number is a measure of the plastic lens material's dispersion (variation of refractive index with wavelength) in relation to its refractive index. The other plastic lens <b>52</b> has a positive optical power, is constituted of a high dispersion (flint) plastic material, and has opposite aspherical surfaces, at least one of which is convexly curved in a direction facing away from the sensor <b>24</b>. The aspherical surface of the other plastic lens <b>52</b> located next to the aperture stop <b>60</b> can be used for wavefront modifications, extended depth of focus (EDOF) design like an axicon, negative spherical aberration, cubic mask, wavefront coding, etc. The closer the wavefront modifying surface is to the aperture stop <b>60</b>. the more consistent the wavefront modification across the imaging field of view. The plastic lens <b>52</b> also has a relatively low Abbe number, e.g., about 25. The aspherical plastic lenses <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> achieve a desired lens performance over a wide angle field of view. The aspherical plastic lenses <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are used for aberration compensation, for example, field curvature and distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The glass lens <b>54</b> is axially spaced away from the plastic lens <b>52</b> along the optical axis <b>46</b>, has a negative optical power, has a high index of refraction, e.g., preferably greater than 1.6, is constituted of a flint-type material, has a relatively low Abbe number, e.g., about 25, and has opposite spherical concave surfaces. The glass lens <b>56</b> has a positive optical power, has a high index of refraction, e.g., preferably greater than 1.6, is constituted of a crown-type material, and has a relatively high Abbe number, e.g., about 50. One surface of the glass lens <b>56</b>, which is proximal to the glass lens <b>54</b>, is generally planar. There may be an air gap between the lenses <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. Preferably, there is no air gap, and the lenses <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are cemented together as a doublet. The opposite surface of the glass lens <b>56</b> is convexly curved in a direction facing towards the sensor <b>24</b>. The lenses <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are used for thermal stability and color aberration compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The aperture stop <b>60</b> may be configured as a discrete optical component, or may be integrally molded with the holder <b>64</b>, or with the plastic lens <b>52</b>. The aperture <b>62</b> may be asymmetrical, e.g., a rectangular or elliptical aperture, or symmetrical, e.g., circular. If the imaging sensor <b>24</b> is a linear sensor that extends along an array axis, and if the aperture is asymmetrical, then the aperture <b>62</b> needs to be aligned relative to the imaging sensor <b>24</b> such that the long dimension of the asymmetrical aperture extends along a direction generally perpendicular to the elongation (array axis) of the imaging sensor <b>24</b>. There may be an air gap or spacing between the aperture stop <b>60</b> and either of the lenses <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. Preferably, the aperture stop <b>60</b> is in direct surface contact with both the lenses <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. The lenses <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b> and the aperture stop <b>60</b> are all fixed in place, preferably with an adhesive bond, within the holder <b>64</b>. The aperture stop <b>60</b> provides optimum compensation of aberrations (coma, astigmatism, distortion, etc.) since they tend to cancel each other. As a result, image distortion of less than 0.5% can be easily achieved. Image magnification stays nearly unchanged over the entire field of view on and off the optical axis <b>46</b>. Another benefit is that the physical size or diameter of the lens groups can be minimized, thereby further reducing the overall weight and volume of the assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">This part-plastic, part-glass, hybrid lens design is compact and achieves the above-described dual advantages of glass and plastic in which the glass lens group provides, among other things, substantial thermal stability and substantial color aberration correction, and the plastic lens group provides, among other things, not only optical aberration compensation, a lighter weight, an easier and more cost efficient manufacture, but also enables aspherical surfaces to be readily integrated in the imaging lens assembly to reduce the number of lenses required and to widen the angle of the field of view. The aspherical surfaces on the plastic lenses increase the field of view angle without requiring an extra lens. By minimizing the combined optical power of the plastic lens group, and by providing substantially all the optical power of the imaging lens assembly <b>20</b> only by the combined optical power of the glass lens group, the assembly is athermalized, and any color aberrations introduced by the plastic lens group is corrected by the glass lens group. In the preferred embodiment, where the imaging sensor <b>24</b> has a diagonal size of about 6.4 mm, the imaging lens assembly <b>20</b> has an effective focal length of about 5 mm, an entrance pupil diameter of about 0.8 mm, an f number of about 6.25, and a diagonal field of view of about 65 degrees. The thermal variation of the back focal distance over a temperature range of from about &#x2212;30 degrees Centigrade to about +70 degrees Centigrade is about +/&#x2212;10 microns (0.2%).</p>

Still another feature of this invention resides in a method of capturing return light from a target over a field of view of an array of image sensors of a solid-state imager, and of projecting the captured return light onto the array during electro-optical reading of the target. This method is performed by compensating optical aberration with a plastic lens group having substantially no optical power, spacing a glass lens group having substantial optical power for thermal stability away from the plastic lens group along an optical axis, positioning an aperture stop having an aperture through which the optical axis extends between the lens groups, and holding the lens groups and the aperture stop in a holder in a spaced relation along the optical axis relative to the array.</p>
