<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a network camera management system and a network camera management method for managing a camera connected to a network.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various network cameras which can be connected to a so-called IP network communicating under an IP protocol have been developed as video cameras such as a monitoring camera. Such network cameras connected to the IP network respectively have an IP address and are managed by the IP address thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When such network camera is connected to the IP network, it is managed by a server connected to the network, and images captured by the network camera are displayed on a display unit provided in the server, and are recorded in a recording unit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, there are a plurality of cameras while connecting the cameras to the network, but in the case of a large-scale monitoring camera system, sometimes there are also a plurality of servers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to view an image of a desired camera in a monitoring camera system provided with a plurality of cameras, it is necessary for a surveillant to create a layout in which IP cameras are assigned beforehand, and then locate the desired camera from the layout, or select a server managing the desired camera before selecting the camera on the supervision screen acquired by the server.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent documents 1 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-128623) discloses an example of a structure in which a plurality of cameras are connected to a server via a network and remote surveillance is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in the case of a large-scale camera system provided with a plurality of servers, it is necessary to select the server, and the operation is complex, and therefore there exists a problem that it takes a long time to select the image captured by a desired camera. Even if there is only one server, if there are a plurality of cameras, the operation to locate the desired camera is complex.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is also a system provided with a special controller connected to the server, however a system using a conventional special controller also has a problem that an operation of selecting a camera is very difficult.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been developed in view of the foregoing circumstances, and is intended to manage a plurality of network cameras simply.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is applicable when managing a plurality of cameras connected to a predetermined network.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention comprises a server for managing a plurality of cameras and controlling recording and/or displaying of an image captured by a camera, and a controller for instructing a management state of a camera on the server.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, by the operation of the controller, an image to be displayed can be dynamically selected from images captured by a plurality of cameras according to the mode instructed by the controller.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, by the operation of the controller, an image to be displayed can be dynamically selected from the images captured by a plurality of cameras according to the mode instructed by the controller, and thus even if there are a large number of cameras in a system, it is possible to display an image easy to be understood by an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the present invention, while assigning cameras for displaying and recording, it is possible to display appropriately in response to a mode set by a controller and the like at that time, and ever if there are a large number of cameras connected to the network, it may be easy to reach a desired camera which is a camera for displaying and recording an image, and the operability of such system can be improved.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view showing a structural example of a system according to the present embodiment. In the present embodiment, network cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> . . . which are video cameras capable of being connected to a network for transmitting data under an IP (Internet Protocol) protocol are prepared. The network cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> . . . , for example, are used as monitoring cameras. In the following description, the network cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> . . . are referred to as IP cameras. Only four cameras are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for the sake of facilitating the description, but in reality, a structure connected with several dozens of cameras or more can be assumed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A network <b>10</b> to which IP cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> . . . are connected may use a network established exclusively for the camera system, or common networks such as internet.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A plurality of servers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and a client <b>13</b> are connected to the network <b>10</b>. The servers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and the client <b>13</b> are composed of a computer apparatus which can be connected to the network, and a display provided in the computer apparatus thereof is used as a displaying unit for displaying an image and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each of the servers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> determines IP cameras managed thereby among IP cameras connected to the network <b>10</b>, and management is executed respectively by two servers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>. An image captured by an IP camera is transmitted via the network <b>10</b> to a server which manages the IP camera.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The servers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, upon receiving an image transmitted from an IP camera, analyze the image and perform determination process of the monitoring state. For example, the servers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> determine whether there is an intruder. Then, the acquired image is stored in a storage unit provided in the servers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>. Large capacity storage means such as a hard disk can be used as the storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The client <b>13</b> is used for browsing an image of each of the IP cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> . . . . The client <b>13</b> assigns the global number which is a static number of a camera network. A special controller <b>14</b> for controlling the servers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and each of the IP cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> . . . is connected to the client. The special controller <b>14</b> includes operation units such as a number input key, a camera selection button, a joy stick and the like for controlling the servers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and each of the IP cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> . . . . Then, a display of a computer apparatus composing the client <b>13</b> or other display means performs displaying based on an operation of the operation unit of the special controller. It is also feasible to perform the same operation by operating a keyboard provided in the computer apparatus composing the client <b>13</b> instead of the special controller <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is another structural example of the system. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a server <b>21</b> is connected to the network <b>10</b> to which a plurality of IP cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> . . . are connected, a special controller <b>22</b> is connected to the server <b>21</b>. In the example, the server <b>21</b> manages all the cameras and is provided with the functions of the servers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and the client <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The special controller <b>22</b> has the same structure as the special controller <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is yet another structural example of the system. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a plurality of servers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are connected to the network <b>10</b> to which a plurality of IP cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> . . . are connected, and the plurality of IP cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> . . . are managed respectively by each of the servers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, which is the same with the structural example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A global number assigning special client <b>33</b> and a common client <b>34</b> are provided as clients, and the client <b>34</b> is connected with the special controller <b>35</b>. The global number assigning special client <b>33</b> allocates and manages global numbers, i.e. static numbers of all IP cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> . . . , which compose the present system and are connected to the network <b>10</b>, on the network. The global numbers, for example, are numbers that an operator can allocate to the plurality of IP cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> . . . in a discretionary order by an operation using the special controller <b>35</b>. Hence, even if the servers for respectively managing the cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> . . . extend to a plurality of servers, the operator can allocate continuous numbers in a specified order. In addition, it is unnecessary to allocate global numbers to all the plurality of IP cameras prepared in the system according to the present example, and only IP cameras instructed by an operation of the operator have global numbers. The client <b>34</b> performs processes of client functions except for address management.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Besides, examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> each are a structural example of the system, and a system, in which not only the number of cameras, but also that of servers and clients, may be any number other than the number shown in the figures, can be established. The server does not always have the functions as a server, and it can be a stand-alone terminal. Moreover, the network <b>10</b> may be a network other than an IP network.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a view showing the inner structure of the server <b>11</b> and the client <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The server <b>11</b> and the client <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are to be described herein as an example, but other servers or clients may also have substantially the same structure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the client <b>13</b> is connected with the special controller <b>14</b>, and the server <b>11</b> side is also connected with an identical special controller <b>14</b>&#x2032;. Moreover, each of the modules herein may be provided with a processing unit performing their respective process, but the modules may be virtually configured by executing software installed to the server or client.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The server <b>11</b> includes a server transreceiving module <b>101</b>, and transmits data to and receives data from other devices connected to the network <b>10</b>. The server transreceiving module <b>101</b> transmits a list of IP cameras managed by the server or a list of all IP cameras to the client side. A camera image acquired by the server <b>11</b> is also transmitted by the server transreceiving module <b>101</b>. The server <b>11</b> includes an image acquiring module <b>111</b> in addition to the server transreceiving module <b>101</b>, and image data from IP cameras <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> . . . managed by the server is acquired by the image acquiring module <b>111</b>. The image data may be either image data continuously obtained as dynamic images or image data of static images obtained at a certain interval.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The server <b>11</b> includes a whole camera number list managing module <b>102</b>, and acquires a whole camera number list provided in the present system from the client <b>13</b> side. The whole camera number list managing module <b>102</b> is connected with a whole camera number list database <b>103</b>, and stores the acquired whole camera number list. The whole camera number list stored in the database <b>103</b> is stored with global number and local number of each IP camera as well as management information such as the number of unconfirmed alarms and operation history.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Moreover, the server <b>11</b> includes a camera list order determining module <b>104</b>, a server camera managing module <b>105</b>, an alarm managing module <b>106</b> and an operation history managing module <b>107</b>, and performs corresponding management by each of the modules.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The camera list order determining module <b>104</b> is a module that manages a number list of IP cameras registered in the server <b>11</b>, and can map the local number with the global number. Furthermore, the camera list order determining module <b>104</b> can manage the number of unconfirmed alarms and operation history of each of the IP cameras registered in the server <b>11</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The server camera managing module <b>105</b> stores data necessary for managing by the camera list order determining module <b>104</b> and transmits the data to the camera list order determining module <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The alarm managing module <b>106</b> is a module that manages the number of unconfirmed alarms of each of the IP cameras managed by the server <b>11</b>. When alarm information is transmitted from a camera, management process is performed in the alarm managing module <b>106</b> such that an unconfirmed state about alarm information of the camera is stored. The alarm information herein is information generated when abnormality such as an intruder is detected from an image captured by a sensor provided in a camera or a camera. Alarm information being unconfirmed indicates, for example, a state that an image from a camera in which the alarm occurs is not displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The operation history management module <b>107</b> is a module that manages the number of operation history for each of the IP cameras managed by the server <b>11</b>. The operation history management module <b>107</b> stores operation histories such as an operation of selecting and displaying an image from a camera, an operation of instructing an angular field of view, etc. of the camera with regard to past operations of a predetermined number or past operations during a predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Data from the special controller <b>14</b>&#x2032; is judged by a remote controller operation judging module <b>114</b>, and it is judged that which key of the special controller <b>14</b>&#x2032; is pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A GUI status judging module <b>113</b> judges which IP camera is selected by the controller by grasping operation information of the controller <b>14</b> or <b>14</b>&#x2032;, IP camera list management information, current screen status and so on. A displaying module <b>112</b> displays a screen of the judged result which instructs the selection.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The client <b>13</b> includes a client transreceiving module <b>201</b>, and transmits data to and receives data from a server. The client transreceiving module <b>201</b> can transreceive a unique global camera number and receive an image from the server. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the client transreceiving module <b>201</b> is configured to transmit data to and receive data from the server <b>11</b>, but it can communicate with all servers in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, the client <b>13</b> includes a whole camera list order determining module <b>202</b>, a whole camera static mapping module <b>203</b> and a whole camera number list database <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The whole camera static mapping module <b>203</b> is a module which can assign a unique number to IP cameras of all servers registered in the management client by a manual operation. For example, when a user operates on the client, special global numbers (101&#x2dc;999) are assigned to all IP cameras. During the operation on the server, each of the IP cameras can be accessed to by either its global number or its local number assigned in the range of 1 to 99. The whole camera static mapping module <b>203</b> is connected with the whole camera number list database <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The whole camera list order determining module <b>202</b> is a module that determines a number order of all IP cameras based on information of each of the IP cameras received from each server and information of the whole camera static mapping module <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Moreover, the client <b>13</b> includes a remote controller operation judging module <b>205</b>, a GUI status judging module <b>206</b>, a displaying module <b>207</b> and an image acquiring module <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The remote controller operation judging module <b>205</b> judges an operation in the special controller <b>14</b>. The GUI status judging module <b>206</b> judges the GUI status on the basis of the judgment of the operation in the special controller <b>14</b> and a current display state in the displaying module <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The displaying module <b>207</b> controls a display on the client <b>13</b> and the like, and selects a camera image acquired by the image acquiring module <b>208</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows flows of various data and images in the server <b>11</b> and the client <b>13</b> described hereinabove. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an instruction, a notice and the like from each module are performed, and a process is executed based on a notice received by a side which receives the instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a view illustrating a process example of selecting a camera number performed by an operation on the client side in the present system by using a change of the display screen. As described above, each of the IP cameras has a global number which is an address on the network, and a local number different from the global number. The local number is a number which can be set freely by an operation of an operator. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a setting screen of the local number.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, firstly, in the initial screen <b>901</b>, an image of the IP camera selected to display is displayed while a list of the local numbers is being displayed on the right corner. Images of three cameras, i.e. No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, are displayed on the screen <b>901</b>. Wherein, the image of the camera No. 1 is displayed as an enlarged image, while the images of other cameras are displayed as reduced images.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">If a camera selection button of the special controller <b>14</b> is pressed in a state of displaying the screen <b>901</b>, the screen will become a selecting screen <b>902</b> of the camera number. If a cancel button of the special controller <b>14</b> is pressed in a state of displaying the selecting screen <b>902</b>, it will return to the previous screen <b>901</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">If a camera number of two-digits or three-digits is input by using the number key in a state of displaying the selecting screen <b>902</b>, it will become a screen <b>903</b> displaying the input global number. Then, if there is a selection by which local number is to be assigned to an IP camera with the global number, it will become a screen <b>904</b> or <b>905</b> displaying an image of a camera corresponding to the selected local number. Two display forms <b>904</b>, <b>905</b> are chosen according to whether the selected camera is present in a display layout, or is absent in the display layout. And later, the allocation of the local number is determined by operating the camera selection button of the special controller <b>14</b>. Or else, cameras displayed on the initial screen are orderly selected for a number not to be input in a state of displaying the screen <b>902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in the lower side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, global numbers and local numbers are displayed on the display screen of a server side and on the display screen of a client side as a display of information of each camera by performing these selections such as number allocation operations. Besides, it is also displayed at the same time that whether there is an alarm or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As a display in the displaying unit of the server, for example, by selecting a local number for a specified IP camera, its local number and global number will be displayed in order on a display screen <b>911</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, when a camera in which an alarm occurs is selected on the server side, a local number and a global number of the camera in which an alarm occurs will be displayed in order on a display screen <b>912</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Moreover, when a static number is selected on the server side, a local number and a global number of an IP camera with the static number will be displayed in order on a display screen <b>913</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As a display in the displaying unit of the client, for example, when a camera in which an alarm occurs is selected, a global number of the camera in which an alarm occurs will be displayed on a display screen <b>914</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In addition, when a static camera number in the displaying unit of the client is selected and displayed, a global number of the camera will be displayed on a display screen <b>915</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">These display forms are performed based on a mode set by the special controller <b>14</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">That is, when a display mode of a global number order is set as the mode, images of cameras, numbers of the cameras, and the like will be displayed in an order of a global number list of each server.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When an alarm mode is set, images of cameras, numbers of the cameras and the like will be displayed based on a list of cameras having unconfirmed alarm history, which is generated by the alarm managing module <b>106</b> of each server, in the list order. The list order herein may be either displaying orderly from an earliest unconfirmed alarm, or displaying orderly from a latest unconfirmed alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When an operation history (operation mode) is set, images of cameras, numbers of the cameras and the like are displayed, in accordance with a list of cameras having operation history, in the list order, on the basis of information of the operation history managing module <b>107</b> and the like of each server. The list order herein may be either displaying orderly from an earliest operation history remaining in a record, or displaying orderly from a latest operation history remaining in the record.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Besides, although a mode of displaying camera images is set herein, recording of the camera images on a server or a client may be performed together according to these mode settings. Or else, a mode for displaying camera images and a mode for recording may be separated with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, local numbers to be allocated to cameras of each server are orderly allocated from No. 1, and global numbers to be allocated to cameras of each server are orderly allocated from No. 101. When there are 100 or less IP cameras in the whole system, the local numbers and the global numbers will not overlap. However, the local numbers and the global numbers may be respectively composed of numbers starting with an identical number such as No. 1.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an example of displaying a static mapping of all cameras by a process in the static mapping module <b>203</b> of the client. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a list of global IDs of all cameras in the system is displayed, and cameras assigned to each server are displayed at the left corner. A local number can be assigned to a global number manually by performing a GUI operation, for designating displaying a list of the global IDs, with a drag and drop operation using operation means (a pointer) such as a mouse connected to the controller <b>14</b> performed on any one of the cameras on the screen in such state. After the assignment, image and information of IP cameras can be accessed to from the client by either the local number or the global number.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Hereinafter, an action example in each of the modules of the server and the client will be described with reference to flowcharts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and figures thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a view showing an action of an operation judgment of the special controller <b>14</b> or <b>14</b>&#x2032; by the remote controller operation judging module <b>114</b> of the server and the remote controller operation judging module <b>205</b> of the client.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Firstly, monitor a hardware signal of a controller (step S<b>11</b>), and judge whether a key of the controller is pressed (step S<b>12</b>). If the key is not pressed, return to the judgment of step S<b>11</b>, and stand by until the key is pressed. If it is judged that the key is pressed by the judgment of step S<b>12</b>, determine what the pressed key (button) is (step S<b>13</b>), and inform the GUI status judging module of information of the pressed button (step S<b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a view showing a process action in the GUI status judging modules <b>113</b> and <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">If information from the remote controller operation judging module is confirmed in the GUI status judging module (step S<b>21</b>), it is judged whether the type of the operated button (key) can be determined from the information (step S<b>22</b>), and return to step S<b>21</b> if it fails to determine. If the type of the operated button (key) can be determined, a process corresponding to the type of the key is performed (step S<b>23</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, if a camera selection button is pressed, the camera selection process is performed (step S<b>24</b>). And if a number button is pressed, an input process of the pressed number is performed (step S<b>25</b>). Moreover, if a cancel button is pressed, a process canceling the present operation is performed (step S<b>26</b>). Furthermore, if other buttons are pressed, a process corresponding to each of the buttons is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a view illustrating a process example in the case of pressing a number button of the special controller.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">When the number button is pressed, check the present input digits (step S<b>31</b>), and judge whether the highest digit of the camera number, i.e. the hundredth digit, has been input (step S<b>32</b>). If the hundredth digit has not been input, inform the displaying module of &#x201c;updating the input number&#x201d; (step S<b>33</b>), and check the present input digits in step S<b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">If it is judged in step S<b>32</b> that the number of three-digits has been input, request a camera number list (step S<b>34</b>), acquire the camera number list of the present mode (step S<b>35</b>), and inform of camera selection display (step S<b>36</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0184" num="0183">3-9) The &#x201c;displaying module&#x201d; sets the IP camera selected by the user into a selected state based on information from the &#x201c;GUI status judging module&#x201d; and displays the IP camera on the screen. Moreover, a number of the selected IP camera is displayed on the number input screen. In the case of the server, a local number and a global number corresponding to the designated number will also be displayed if they exist, and in the case of the client, a global number corresponding to the designated ranking number will also be displayed if it exists. The camera selection on the camera tree is also changed.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">3-10) The number input screen disappears and the selection is ended when the user presses the camera selection button again.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Next, an action example in the case of selecting an IP camera in a state that there is a static camera number mapping in the server will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">4-1) A user presses a camera selection button of a special remote controller.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">4-2) A code, which can identify that the camera selection button is pressed, is received by a &#x201c;remote controller operation judging module&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">4-3) The &#x201c;remote controller operation judging module&#x201d; informs a &#x201c;GUI status judging module&#x201d; that the camera selection button is pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">4-4) It is judged by the &#x201c;GUI status judging module&#x201d; whether the camera selection button is pressed continuously or is pressed for the first time.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">4-5) When it is judged by the &#x201c;GUI status judging module&#x201d; that the camera selection button is pressed for the first time, it becomes a static camera selection mode, and &#x201c;SATATIC. - - - &#x201d; and a number input screen are displayed on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">4-6) If the user inputs a camera number by the special remote controller, the &#x201c;GUI status judging module&#x201d; receives a three-digits number through a &#x201c;remote controller operation judging module&#x201d;, and inquires a &#x201c;camera list order determining module&#x201d; on a client side about which one of IP cameras managed by all servers is the IP camera corresponding to the number in the present mode.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">4-7) The &#x201c;camera list order determining module&#x201d; on the server receives a global camera number from a &#x201c;whole camera list managing module&#x201d;, and determines the selected camera number based on the information.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">4-8) The &#x201c;GUI status judging module&#x201d; determines an order of camera numbers from the received information. Then, inform a &#x201c;displaying module&#x201d; of changing the camera selection status if an IP camera display box, in which the IP camera has already been selected, exists in the present layout. If the IP camera does not exist in the layout, search for the corresponding IP camera from several layouts created by the user himself, and inform the &#x201c;displaying module&#x201d; of changing the layout and camera selection status when finding out the IP camera.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">If the corresponding IP camera does not exist in the layout created by the user himself, inform the &#x201c;displaying module&#x201d; of newly and temporarily creating a layout which only displays the IP camera and displaying the layout.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">4-9) The &#x201c;displaying module&#x201d; sets the IP camera selected by the user into a selected state based on information from the &#x201c;GUI status judging module&#x201d; and displays the IP camera on the screen. Moreover, a number of the selected IP camera is displayed on the number input screen. In the case of the server, a local number and a global number corresponding to the designated number will also be displayed, and in the case of the client, a global number will also be displayed. The camera selection on the camera tree is also changed.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">4-10) The number input screen disappears and the selection is ended when the user presses the camera selection button again.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">According to a system of the present embodiment as described above, an IP camera can be designated simply and directly without depending on a server by using a client and a plurality of servers capable of managing a plurality of IP cameras. That is, no matter which server an IP camera is managed by, a process such as displaying an image of a camera can be performed by operating an operation button of a special remote controller, operating a key of a terminal on the client side, or the like, operation process such as camera assignment can be intuitively conveyed to a user, and an effect that a large-scale camera system can be managed simply is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Moreover, camera numbers of the special remote controller can be dynamically assigned and static camera numbers can be assigned in an order from a high priority for a user, i.e. an operator, and thus, an IP camera with a high priority can be selected by designating a number of the special remote controller before the user confirms states of these IP cameras himself.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">For example, without steps of selecting each server from a controller managing dozens of servers, each of which manages dozens of cameras, and confirming all the alarms of each of the IP cameras managed by the servers respectively, an IP camera with many unconfirmed alarms can be listed in a camera tree no matter which server the IP camera belongs to, and all IP cameras with unconfirmed alarms can be simply operated in a state that the IP cameras are mapped dynamically into camera numbers of the special controller in an order from the IP camera with most unconfirmed alarms.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Furthermore, global camera numbers can be manually assigned to all IP cameras of all servers regardless of abovementioned priority order by switching a mapping mode, and thus, an IP camera can be selected by using a local camera number on the server or using a static global camera number on the client after statically mapping all camera numbers. In addition, the local number and the global number are displayed in a state that the correlation therebetween is known on the server, and thus, both a person monitoring on the server and a person monitoring on the spot by using a client can identify an identical IP camera by the same number at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Specifically, an administrator, no matter on a server or on a client does he confirm a camera with many unconfirmed alarms in an unconfirmed alarm ranking mode, informs other surveillants of a global number thereof immediately, and the two can share and select the same camera simply even in a system in which there are many cameras in total.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In addition, the system structure, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, etc, of the above-mentioned embodiment only indicates an example of the structure, and is not limited to the structures shown in the figures. Moreover, an inner structure of a server and that of a client, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, etc, only indicate a structure viewed from respective functions. For example, when the server and the client are computer apparatuses, they may be configured by installing programs (software) for executing each of the functions by calculating process provided in the computer apparatus.</p>
