<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An adapter to convert an electric drill motor being configured with a standard drill bit into a screw gun includes a metal enclosure which slides over a drill chuck to accommodate drill bit and chuck portions. The device also provides a mechanical coupling pin which engages a chuck key aperture to communicate the rotary motion of the drill motor to the device. Once installed upon the drill motor, the device enables connection of standard bit sockets, screwdriver adapters, or similar driving tools. In such a manner, the user can drill a hole, slide the device over the drill chuck, and drive a fastener using the device. This eliminates the need to remove the drill bit and insert a separate driving tool in a repetitive manner to install fasteners.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">There are no current co-pending applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to drill motor adapters, and in particular, to a drill motor adapter for providing screw gun functionality compatible with an existing electric drill and drill bit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">General construction and wood working projects require a wide variety of power tools to accomplish the job properly. Two (2) such common power tools are the power drill and the power screw gun. The ability for the drill to produce a hole in just about any material and the screw gun's ability to quickly install fasteners make them very valuable for a wide range of repetitive tasks, saving time and money and reducing stress on the worker.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to the cost of these tools and the fact that they have similar physical parameters, many users find it prudent to own only a power drill and then to use the drill in a manner similar to a screw gun as needed. When the capabilities of a screw gun are needed, the user simply inserts an appropriate screwdriver bit or socket adapter into the chuck of the drill.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various attempts have been made to provide adapters for drill guns. Examples of these attempts can be seen by reference to several U.S. patents including U.S. Pat. No. 3,484,114, U.S. Pat. No. 5,090,545, U.S. Pat. No. 5,191,666, U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,206, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,333.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The use of such adapters can be unfavorable due to the fact that it must be repeated and reversed each time the user wishes to switch between the drill functions and the functions provided by the adapter. In certain cases where the adapter is to be utilized infrequently and where a range of functionality or sizing is desirable, this may acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, construction practices which require drilling a hole, inserting a fastener, and then drilling another hole, will require the removal of the drill bit or fastening driver for each and every hole, thus becoming very time consuming. Furthermore, in many construction projects, these fasteners are of a consistent size over large areas of the construction. In this case, the need to constantly interchange the drill bits and adapters is very detrimental, i.e. as compared to having both a drill and a screw gun.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there exists a need for an adapter which is smaller and cheaper than having to purchase a screw gun in addition to a drill, but which facilitates repeated use in a quick and minimally taxing manner. The development of the present invention substantially departs from the conventional solutions and in doing so fulfills this need.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the foregoing references, the inventor recognized the aforementioned inherent problems and observed that there is a need for a solution. Thus, the object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned disadvantages and provide for this need.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To achieve the above objectives, it is an object of the present invention to comprise a drill motor adapter for quickly configuring an electric drill motor to perform a screw gun function. The device has an interior bore that slidingly accommodates a standard drill chuck to allow quick conversion from a normal drilling tool to a screw driving tool.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to allow quick attachment of various sized bit sockets and other driver tools which utilize an attaching hex shaft portion. The shaft of the adapter includes a socket receiver portion at an end portion opposite the interior bore.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet still another object of the present invention is to allow installation of the device on the drill motor with having to remove a previously installed drill bit, thereby saving significant time for projects which require repeated interchange between the drill and screw driving functions. An extending shaft portion of the apparatus provides an internal drill bit clearance aperture that covers and protects the drill bit and provides sufficient separation between the hex shaft portion and the drill motor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet still another object of the present invention is to secure the device within a chuck key aperture portion of the drill chuck using a spring-loaded anti-rotation pin located within the chuck receiver portion of the apparatus. The pin is further retained in place during use by two (2) retaining rings positioned on the chuck receiver and is installed at an angle such that clockwise rotation of the drill chuck engages the pin and keeps the device installed tightly, but whereby clockwise motioning of the device when the drill is turned off will cause the pin to slide outwardly and allow easy separation and removal of the device from the drill motor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a similar pair of retaining rings to apply a holding spring force against a bit socket when inserted into the hex aperture portion of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a method of utilizing the device that provides a unique means of using an existing drill motor in a conventional manner, inserting the drill bit and drill chuck into the inner bore portion of the device while continually applying a counter-clockwise rotation of the device, rotating the device until the anti-rotation pin engages the chuck key aperture of the drill chuck, inserting a suitably sized bit socket or other driving tool into the hex aperture portion, driving fasteners into the previously drilled holes; removing the device from the drill motor by applying a clockwise rotation to disengage the anti-rotation pin, repeating the above steps to convert the drill motor back-and-forth between a drilling tool and a screw gun as needed; and, benefiting from time and equipment costs saved by using the present device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.</p>

For orientation purposes, the device <b>10</b> is illustrated here as viewed from a drill motor <b>100</b> side. The angled orientation of the pin aperture <b>24</b> enables the anti-rotation pin <b>50</b> to engage the chuck key aperture portion <b>104</b> in an angled manner, thereby mechanically communicating a normal clockwise rotation of the drill chuck <b>102</b> to the device <b>10</b> to drive a fastener. Conversely, motioning of the device <b>10</b> in a clockwise direction with the drill chuck <b>102</b> at rest, will cause the anti-rotation pin <b>50</b> to slide in an outward direction, thereby flexing the first retaining rings <b>40</b> to allow easy separation and removal of the device <b>10</b> from the drill motor <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an exploded view of the device <b>10</b>, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, is disclosed. The device <b>10</b> comprises a pair of first retaining rings <b>40</b> and a second retaining ring <b>60</b>. Said retaining rings <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> are envisioned to be made using a round cross-section spring-steel wire being formed in generally circular shapes and providing flexibility via opening portions to enable normal springing expansion and contraction. The first retaining rings <b>40</b> are sized so as to encompass and be nested within the aforementioned first retaining ring slots <b>42</b>, thereby holding the anti-rotation pin <b>50</b> within the pin aperture <b>24</b>. The second retaining ring <b>60</b> provides an external snap ring function, being nested within a respectively sized second retaining ring slot <b>62</b>. Said second retaining ring <b>60</b> further comprises a flat perimeter portion designed to protrude slightly into the internal hex aperture portion <b>34</b> of the socket receiver portion <b>32</b>, thereby securing an inserted bit socket <b>110</b> by applying a spring side force.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0053">The shaft portion <b>30</b> of the device <b>10</b> comprises a drill bit clearance aperture <b>36</b> located along a center axis which comprises a longitudinal drilled hole capable of containing a one-quarter (&#xbc;) inch drill bit <b>105</b>, thereby enabling the device <b>10</b> to be installed upon the drill motor <b>100</b> without having to remove a previously installed drill bit <b>105</b>, therefore saving time when switching between the drilling and fastener driving tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0054">It is envisioned that other styles and configurations of the present invention can be easily incorporated into the teachings of the present invention, and only one particular configuration shall be shown and described for purposes of clarity and disclosure and not by way of limitation of scope.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0055">The preferred embodiment of the present invention can be utilized by the common user in a simple and effortless manner with little or no training. After initial purchase or acquisition of the device <b>10</b>, it would be installed as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0056">The method of utilizing the device <b>10</b> may be achieved by performing the following steps: mounting a drill bit <b>105</b> into a drill chuck portion <b>102</b> of an existing drill motor <b>100</b> in a conventional manner; drilling a desired number of holes; inserting said drill bit <b>105</b> and drill chuck <b>102</b> portions of the drill motor <b>100</b> into the inner bore portion <b>22</b> of the device <b>10</b> while continually applying a counter-clockwise rotation of the device <b>10</b>; rotating the device <b>10</b> until obtaining a snapping engagement of the anti-rotation pin <b>50</b> into the chuck key aperture portion <b>104</b> of the drill chuck <b>102</b>; stopping rotation of the device <b>10</b>; inserting a suitably sized bit socket <b>110</b>, or other driving tool, into the hex aperture portion <b>34</b> of the socket receiver <b>32</b>; driving fasteners into the previously drilled holes; removing the device <b>10</b> from the drill motor <b>100</b> by applying a clockwise rotation of the device <b>10</b> to disengage the anti-rotation pin <b>50</b> from the chuck key aperture <b>104</b>; pulling the device <b>10</b> from the drill motor <b>100</b>; repeating the above steps to convert the drill motor <b>100</b> back-and-forth between a drilling tool and a screw gun as needed to complete a project; and, benefiting from time and equipment costs saved by using the present invention <b>10</b>.</p>
