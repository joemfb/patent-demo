<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to the general field of perpendicular magnetic writers with particular emphasis on delivering more flux to the ABS (air bearing surface).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Tapered write gaps have been previously used to enhance field and field gradient, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It is based on the fundamental principle of increasing the choke area around the neck region so that the sides of ABS <b>11</b> are not quite parallel but, instead, converge at an angle &#x3b8; thereby providing gradual flux concentration to bring additional field to the ABS. Because of the slope of the main pole, the area A<b>2</b> behind the ABS is larger than the area A<b>1</b> at the ABS. So a larger ratio of A<b>2</b> to A<b>1</b> corresponds to more flux concentration at the ABS. Other elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> include trailing shield <b>12</b>, write gap <b>13</b>, and main pole <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As track widths narrow, still further enhancements are needed to this flux concentration approach. While steeper tapered write gap angles can increase A<b>2</b>/A<b>1</b>, the main drawbacks are the processing difficulty and too high a sensitivity of the ABS area A<b>1</b> to the ABS lapping position &#x2018;aa&#x2019;. If the taper angle &#x3b8; is too large, a small displacement of ABS line &#x2018;aa&#x2019;, caused by the ABS lapping process, will result in a large change in both the ABS area and the physical width of the main pole. Therefore, methods for flux concentration are required that are not overly sensitive to changes in the angle at which the write gap lies relative to the ABS.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A routine search of the prior art was performed with the following references of interest being found:</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In U.S. Pat. No. 6,621,659, Shukh et al. say &#x201c;it is common to taper the pole from the larger width in the paddle region to a narrower width in the pole tip region at the ABS.&#x201d; However, the form of the taper is different from that disclosed by the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 7,151,647 (Sasaki et al&#x2014;Headway) shows a yoke portion having a wide portion, a narrow portion, and a sloping flare portion and U.S. Patent Application 2006/0044677 (Li et al&#x2014;Headway) teaches a plated bevel pole design where the top is wider than the bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 7,193,815 (Stoev et al) shows an upper section of the write shield wider than the lower section. U.S. Pat. No. 7,116,517 (He et al) teaches a T-shaped pole tip. U.S. Pat. No. 7,133,253 (Seagle et al) discloses a tapered pole tip while U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,815 (Sasaki) shows a tapered write gap as part of their FIG. 9</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It has been an object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide a perpendicular write pole that provides increased magnetic flux at the ABS.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of at least one embodiment of the present invention has been to provide a process for manufacturing said write pole.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still another object of at least one embodiment of the present invention has been to achieve the above objects without increasing the degree of taper of the pole at the ABS.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further object of at least one embodiment of the present invention has been to render performance of the completed device insensitive to small variations of the precise location of the ABS relative to other parts of the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These objects have been achieved by increasing the amount of write flux that originates above the write gap without changing the pole taper at the ABS. In a first embodiment, this is achieved by increasing the taper of the section above the write gap. In a second embodiment, this section is extended so that it overlaps the write gap laterally. In a third embodiment, a part of this section is brought closer to the ABS while keeping the main parts of the write pole and the trailing shield well separated, magnetically speaking.</p>

In reality, these bodies are embedded in one or more layers of insulating material (typically Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) which provide whatever mechanical support that is needed without influencing the performance of the device being portrayed. In the interests of simplifying both the descriptions and the figures, these supporting layers are not necessarily shown or mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the first of the new configurations disclosed in the present invention to enhance flux concentration ratio A<b>2</b>/A<b>1</b> while still keeping the taper angle of the write gap unchanged. Compared to the prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, main pole <b>14</b> taper is now formed from two layers, <b>14</b> and <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">To form layer <b>14</b>, a first trench, with sidewalls that slope at an angle &#x3b8; to the vertical, is formed in a layer of insulation (not shown) to a first depth. This trench is now just filled (overfill followed by CMP) with a layer of material suitable for the main pole followed by a non-magnetic layer (for the write gap). The (filled) first trench is then covered with a second layer of insulation (also not shown). A second trench, whose floor is aligned with the roof of the first trench, is now formed in the second insulation layer, said second trench having sidewalls that slope at an angle greater than &#x3b8;. The second trench is then just filled with the same material as the first trench, thereby forming layer <b>25</b> and completing formation of element <b>14</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This is followed by an angle-lapping step to form the appropriately sloped surface onto which non-magnetic write gap layer <b>13</b> is then deposited (as well as being simultaneously deposited onto the top surface of lower pole <b>14</b>). The process concludes with the deposition and shaping of trailing shield <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus top part <b>25</b> of layer <b>14</b> has a larger taper angle than bottom part <b>11</b>, which increases A<b>2</b> relative to A<b>1</b> without increasing the sensitivity of the ABS to the lapping angle. This is because, after tapered write gap <b>13</b> is formed, top layer <b>25</b> will be recessed from ABS <b>11</b> so that the larger taper angle will not change A<b>1</b> when ABS line &#x2018;aa&#x2019; is moved.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a 3D view of the structure after tapered write gap <b>13</b> has been formed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (cross sectional view) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (3D view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) show the 2<sup>nd </sup>embodiment of the invention. It differs from the 1<sup>st </sup>embodiment in that newly added top layer <b>45</b> is not simply an extension of bottom layer <b>14</b> with a larger taper angle. Instead, layer <b>45</b> does not need to be tapered (although using a tapered shape here would still be within the scope of the invention) In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> we show element <b>45</b> as having a rectangular cross-section (our preferred shape) but as long as there is a net increase in the A<b>2</b>/A<b>1</b> ratio, the objects of the invention will have been met. In general, element <b>45</b> will be wider than the top of write gap <b>13</b> enabling the achievement of a larger A<b>2</b>/A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Process-wise the main departure from the first embodiment is that the second trench, also aligned with the first trench and also formed in the second insulation layer, extends outwards from the mouth of the first trench (typically up to about 0.2 to 0.5 microns in each direction) and has straight, as opposed to sloping, sides. As for the first embodiment, the second trench is then just filled with the same material as before, thereby completing formation of element <b>14</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The 3<sup>rd </sup>embodiment takes a different approach from the previous two embodiments. Instead of changing the A<b>2</b>/A<b>1</b> ratio, a non-uniform write gap is formed. This is illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> which shows that extra non-magnetic layer <b>63</b> has been inserted between write pole <b>14</b> and trailing shield <b>12</b>. Thus, the write gap is narrower at the ABS and wider away from it. This reduces flux leakage from the main pole to the write shield. Consequently, for a given A<b>2</b>/A<b>1</b>, this larger separation of the main pole from the trailing shield results in more flux being delivered at the ABS, while the field gradient is unchanged since the write gap at the ABS is unchanged. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows how non-magnetic layer <b>13</b> (the write gap layer) is made up of two connected parts, both of which lie on the upper surface of element <b>14</b>&#x2014;a sloping part (on the left of the figure) and a level part (on the right).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The starting point for forming a write pole built according to the teachings of the third embodiment is similar to the point where, in the first two embodiments, layer <b>14</b> has been angle-lapped to provide a suitably tilted surface for layer <b>13</b>. After deposition of non-magnetic layer <b>13</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the non-uniform write gap can be formed by depositing 2<sup>nd </sup>write gap layer <b>93</b> which is then patterned so that it terminates at a distance (typically between about 0.05 and 0.2 microns from the ABS. The process ends with the deposition and patterning pf layer <b>12</b> to form the trailing shield, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
