<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2007-131356, filed on Dec. 14, 2007, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the present invention relate to a battery pack, and more particularly, to a battery pack that does not increase contact resistance against an external impact.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, portable electrical/electronic devices, which are compact and light, such as cellular phones, notebook computers, camcorders, and the like, are actively being developed and produced. Accordingly, a battery pack is embedded in the portable electrical/electronic devices so that the portable electrical/electronic devices may operate in a place where a separate power source is not provided. The battery pack currently adopts a rechargeable secondary battery by considering an economical aspect. Representative examples of the secondary battery are a nickel-cadmium (Ni&#x2014;Cd) battery, a nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery, a lithium (Li) battery, a lithium-ion (Li-ion) secondary battery, and the like. Particularly, an operating voltage of the lithium-ion (Li-ion) secondary battery is greater, about three times, than the operating voltage of the nickel-cadmium (Ni&#x2014;Cd) battery or the nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery, which is frequently used as a power source of portable electronic apparatuses. Also, since the energy density per unit weight is relatively greater, the lithium-ion (Li-ion) secondary battery is being widely used.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The secondary battery, as such, generally uses lithium-based oxide as positive electrode active materials and carbon material as negative electrode active materials. Generally, batteries are classified into a liquid electrolytic battery and a polymer electrolytic battery according to the type of electrolyte. In this instance, the battery using the liquid electrolyte is referred to as the lithium-ion (Li-ion) secondary battery, and the battery using the polymer electrolyte is referred to as a lithium polymer battery.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The secondary battery is formed by electrically connecting a bare cell formed by sealing a can accommodating an electrode assembly and electrolyte, and a protection circuit module. The bare cell charges/discharges electricity using a chemical reaction. The protection circuit module controls charging/discharging of the bare cell and prevents overcharging/overdischarging of the bare cell to protect the bare cell.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the bare cell and the protection circuit module are connected to form the secondary battery, electrical resistance therebetween is reduced in order to improve charging/discharging efficiency. In more detail, if the electrical resistance between the bare cell and the protection circuit module increases, the charging/discharging efficiency of the bare cell is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, the secondary battery goes through a reliability test for determining whether the secondary battery is stable against an impact in order to mount the secondary battery in an electronic product after being formed in a pack by integrally connecting the bare cell and the protection circuit module. The battery pack increases the electrical resistance between the bare cell and the protection circuit module due to an external impact. The electrical resistance increases as contact resistance increases in a part where the bare cell and the protection circuit module are connected.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Aspects of the present invention are conceived to solve the above-described and/or other problems, and thus an aspect of the present invention is to provide a battery pack that does not increase contact resistance when an impact is applied to a bare cell and a protection circuit module.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a battery pack that enhances assembling and convenience of process simultaneously.</p>

In the present embodiment, the coupling members <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> include a first coupling member <b>131</b> and a second coupling member <b>132</b>. In the present embodiment, the screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> include a first screw bolt <b>141</b> and a second screw bolt <b>142</b>.

In an opening part of the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the second coupling groove <b>113</b><i>a </i>formed in the bare cell <b>110</b>, spaces <b>112</b><i>b </i>and <b>113</b><i>b </i>having a greater diameter than that of the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the second coupling groove <b>113</b><i>a </i>are formed. Meanwhile, the bare cell <b>110</b> is the can type battery in which an electrode assembly (not shown) formed by winding a positive electrode plate (not shown), a negative electrode plate (not shown), and a separator (not shown) is sealed with a sealing assembly <b>111</b> formed of a metal material such as aluminum. The sealing assembly <b>111</b> may comprise a metal type can <b>111</b><i>b </i>having an opening end and a cap plate <b>111</b><i>a </i>closing an opening part of the can <b>111</b><i>b</i>. An electrode terminal <b>114</b> that is insulated by an insulator <b>114</b><i>a </i>may be formed in any one of the metal type can <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the cap plate <b>111</b><i>a</i>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1C</figref>, the electrode terminal <b>114</b> that is insulated by the insulator <b>114</b><i>a </i>is inserted into the cap plate <b>111</b><i>a</i>. The positive electrode of the bare cell <b>110</b> may be electrically connected to the sealing assembly <b>111</b>.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The protection circuit module <b>120</b> is electrically connected to the bare cell <b>110</b>. The electrical connection between the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> is made by connecting the negative electrode of the protection circuit module <b>120</b> to the electrode terminal <b>112</b> that is the negative electrode of the bare cell <b>110</b> by a lead tab <b>120</b><i>a</i>, and by connecting the positive electrode of the protection circuit module <b>120</b> to the sealing assembly <b>110</b> that is the positive electrode of the bare cell <b>110</b> by the first coupling member <b>131</b>. A Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) device <b>120</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is electrically connected between the negative electrode of the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and the electrode terminal <b>114</b> may block the electrical connection between the negative electrode of the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and the electrode terminal <b>114</b> when a temperature excessively increases or a current excessively flows. The protection circuit module <b>120</b> may comprise an insulating substrate <b>121</b>, a printed circuit pattern (not shown), a conductive pad <b>123</b>, a protection circuit unit <b>124</b>, and a charging/discharging terminal <b>125</b>. The conductive pad <b>123</b>, the protection circuit unit <b>124</b>, and the charging/discharging terminal <b>125</b> may be soldered to the printed circuit pattern formed on the insulating substrate <b>121</b>. The protection circuit unit <b>124</b> may selectively comprise a passive device such as a resistor, a capacitor or the like, an active device such as a field-effect transistor, a safety device such as the PTC device <b>120</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, and integrated circuits. The protection circuit unit <b>124</b> charges or discharges the bare cell <b>110</b> when the bare cell <b>110</b> is charged/discharged, and blocks a charging/discharging path of the bare cell <b>110</b> when the bare cell <b>110</b> is overheated or is in an overcurrent state, thereby preventing lifetime degradation, overheating, explosion and the like of the bare cell <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">One end of the first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> is soldered and connected to the protection circuit module <b>120</b>, and another end thereof is in contact with the bare cell <b>110</b>. On a surface where the first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> are in contact with the bare cell <b>110</b>, a first coupling hole <b>131</b><i>a </i>and a second coupling hole <b>132</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the second coupling groove <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the bare cell <b>110</b>, respectively, are formed. The first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> support the protection circuit module <b>120</b> to be disposed on a surface of the bare cell <b>110</b>, and electrically connect the positive electrode of the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b>. The first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> may comprise first sections <b>131</b><i>b </i>and <b>132</b><i>b</i>, second sections <b>131</b><i>c </i>and <b>132</b><i>c</i>, and third sections <b>131</b><i>d </i>and <b>132</b><i>d</i>. Since the first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> may be curved in the same manner, for example, the first section <b>131</b><i>b </i>of the first coupling member <b>131</b> is soldered and connected to the protection circuit module <b>120</b>. The second section <b>131</b><i>c </i>of the first coupling member <b>131</b> is curved and formed in the first section <b>131</b><i>b</i>. The third section <b>132</b><i>d </i>of the first coupling member <b>131</b> in which the first coupling hole <b>131</b><i>a </i>is formed is curved in the second section <b>131</b><i>c </i>in an opposite direction to the direction that the first section <b>131</b><i>b </i>is curved. The second section <b>131</b><i>c </i>of the first coupling member <b>131</b> and the third section <b>131</b><i>d </i>are curved, so that the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and a surface of the bare cell <b>110</b> may be formed in parallel to each other. The first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>formed in the bare cell <b>110</b> and the first coupling hole <b>131</b><i>a </i>of the first coupling member <b>131</b> are formed corresponding to each other, so that the first screw bolt <b>141</b> may be coupled perpendicularly to the bare cell <b>110</b>. Meanwhile, the second screw bolt <b>142</b> passing through the second coupling hole <b>132</b><i>a </i>formed in the third section <b>132</b><i>d </i>of the second coupling member <b>132</b> may be coupled perpendicularly to the second coupling groove <b>113</b><i>a. </i>The first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> are formed of nickel or alloy including nickel, so that the coupling and conductivity between the first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> and the protection circuit module <b>120</b> by soldering are enhanced. The first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> are disposed to face the protection circuit module <b>120</b>, so that the conductivity and coupling between the first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> are enhanced, thereby reducing contact resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first screw bolt <b>141</b> is coupled to the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>of the bare cell <b>110</b> through the first coupling hole <b>131</b><i>a </i>formed in the first coupling member <b>131</b>. The second screw bolt <b>142</b> is coupled to the second coupling groove <b>113</b><i>b </i>of the bare cell <b>110</b> through the second coupling hole <b>132</b><i>a </i>formed in the second coupling member <b>132</b>. The first and second screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> comprise body parts <b>141</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>a </i>and head parts <b>141</b><i>b </i>and <b>142</b><i>b. </i>The body parts <b>141</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>a </i>of the first and second screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> are screw-coupled to the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the second coupling groove <b>113</b><i>a </i>by forming a screw thread thereon. The head parts <b>141</b><i>b </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the first and second screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> are formed on the upper part of the body parts <b>141</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>a</i>, and have a diameter greater than that of the body parts <b>141</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>a</i>. Grooves <b>141</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and <b>142</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> marked with + are formed in the head parts <b>141</b><i>b </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the first and second screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>. In addition to the mark +, the grooves <b>141</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and <b>142</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> may be marked with &#x2212; and *. A screw driver is inserted into the grooves <b>141</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and <b>142</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> so that the first and second screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> may be screw-coupled to the bare cell <b>110</b>. The first and second screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> are coupled to the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the second coupling groove <b>113</b><i>a </i>that are formed in both side parts of the bare cell <b>110</b>, so that the protection circuit module <b>120</b> is not twisted, and the coupling between the first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> and the protection circuit module <b>120</b> by soldering, thereby preventing an increase in contact resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, a chamfer part <b>141</b><i>c </i>may be formed in a part where the head part <b>141</b><i>b </i>and the body part <b>141</b><i>a </i>of the first screw bolt <b>141</b>. Therefore, the chamfer part <b>141</b><i>c </i>of the first screw bolt <b>141</b> contacts the first coupling hole <b>131</b><i>a </i>formed in the first coupling member <b>131</b>, which increases a contact area, thereby reducing contact resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Meanwhile, the protection circuit module <b>120</b> is surrounded by a cover case to prevent a short circuit and protect it from an external impact. The cover case <b>150</b> may be hook-coupled or bonded, adhered, or taped to the protection circuit module <b>120</b> to form a cover case type battery pack. The cover case <b>150</b> along with the bare cell <b>110</b> may be surrounded with a label <b>160</b> after being coupled to the protection circuit module <b>120</b>. The charging/discharging terminal <b>125</b> may be externally exposed through a charging/discharging terminal hole <b>151</b> formed in the cover case <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The bare cell <b>110</b> may be further surrounded by an auxiliary case <b>170</b> to protect a corner part thereof from the external impact. A dual-sided tape <b>171</b> between the auxiliary case <b>170</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> may be formed to couple the auxiliary case <b>170</b> to the bare cell <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> soldered to the protection circuit module <b>120</b> are coupled with the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the second coupling groove <b>113</b><i>a </i>and the first and second screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> of the bare cell <b>110</b>, although the external impact is applied to the battery pack <b>100</b>, contact resistance between the first coupling member <b>131</b> and the second coupling member <b>132</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> is not reduced. In more detail, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, a screw bolt <b>141</b><i>f </i>is coupled to the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>formed in the bare cell <b>110</b>. When the coupling member <b>131</b> connected to the bare cell <b>110</b> by the screw bolt <b>141</b><i>f</i>, a burr <b>110</b><i>f </i>is generated. The burr <b>110</b><i>f </i>is formed by pushing an upper surface of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>by a body part <b>141</b><i>f</i><b>1</b> when the body part <b>141</b><i>f</i><b>1</b> of the screw bolt <b>141</b><i>f </i>is screw-coupled to the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>formed in the bare cell <b>110</b>. The burr <b>110</b><i>f </i>protrudes on the upper surface of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a</i>, and is formed below a head part <b>141</b><i>f</i><b>2</b> of the screw bolt <b>141</b><i>f</i>. Therefore, when the screw bolt <b>141</b><i>f </i>and the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>are coupled, the coupling member <b>131</b> between a head part <b>141</b><i>f</i><b>2</b> of the screw bolt <b>141</b><i>f </i>and the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>of the bare cell <b>110</b> is tightly adhered to the burr <b>110</b><i>f</i>, which reduces a coupling area. When an external impact is applied to the bare cell <b>110</b>, the coupling member <b>131</b> moves up and down, which further reduces the coupling area between the burr <b>110</b><i>f </i>and the coupling member <b>131</b>. Therefore, contact resistance between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the coupling member <b>131</b> increases, so that a space <b>112</b><i>b </i>having a greater diameter than that of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>is formed in an outer corner part of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>in which a burr is formed in order to remove the burr <b>110</b><i>f </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. Therefore, since a part where the burr is formed is removed, although the external impact is applied to the bare cell <b>110</b> and the protection circuit module <b>120</b>, contact resistance between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the coupling member <b>131</b> does not increase, thereby enhancing reliability of the battery pack <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1C</figref>, the battery pack <b>100</b> may further comprise an elastic member <b>180</b>. The elastic member <b>180</b> formed in the battery pack <b>100</b> supports the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b>. When the first and second coupling members <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> are coupled to the bare cell <b>110</b> by the first and second screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, the elastic member <b>180</b> absorbs an externally applied impact. The elastic member <b>180</b> is disposed in the bare cell <b>110</b> to generate elasticity pushing the protection circuit module <b>120</b>. In more detail, the first and second coupling members <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> soldered to the protection circuit module <b>120</b> are lifted, and a force is perpendicularly applied to the head parts <b>141</b><i>b </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the first and second screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> tightening the first and second coupling members <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>. Therefore, the first and second screw bolts <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> are prevented from being released, and constant contact resistance between the first and second coupling members <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The elastic member <b>180</b>, which may be formed of silicon, is coated between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the protection circuit module <b>120</b> to adhere the bare cell <b>110</b> to the protection circuit module <b>120</b>, so that the protection circuit module <b>120</b> is coupled to the bare cell <b>110</b> and is prevented from moving, thereby preventing the contact resistance between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the first and second coupling members <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> from increasing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The elastic member <b>180</b> may be formed of rubber or a foam tape including a porous material and be attached to the bare cell <b>110</b>. The rubber or the foam tape absorbs an impact applied to the cover case <b>150</b> when the protection circuit module <b>120</b> is disposed to prevent the contact resistance between the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> from increasing. The rubber or the foam tape is simply attached to the bare cell <b>110</b>, thereby easily manufacturing the battery pack <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The elastic member <b>180</b> may be formed in both side parts between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the protection circuit module <b>120</b>. When the elastic member <b>180</b> is disposed in both side parts of the protection circuit module <b>120</b>, since the elasticity of the elastic member <b>180</b> pushing the protection circuit module <b>120</b> can be perpendicularly transferred to the protection circuit module <b>120</b>, the protection circuit module <b>120</b> may perpendicularly shake by the impact. Therefore, the elastic member <b>180</b> absorbs an impact force, and the impact is reduced, so that the contact resistance between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the protection circuit module <b>120</b> is prevented from increasing.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view illustrating a dissembled battery pack according to another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the battery pack <b>200</b> of the present embodiment comprises a bare cell <b>110</b>, a protection circuit module <b>120</b>, a coupling member <b>131</b>, and a screw bolt <b>141</b>. Since the bare cell <b>110</b>, the protection circuit module <b>120</b>, the coupling member <b>131</b>, and the screw bolt <b>141</b> of the present embodiment are described in the previous embodiment, their descriptions are not repeated. In the present embodiment, the peripheral part of a coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>formed in the bare cell <b>110</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The smaller a diameter d<b>1</b> of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>formed in the bare cell <b>110</b> is, the greater a depth dt<b>1</b> of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>is. When the screw bolt <b>141</b> passes through the coupling hole <b>131</b><i>a </i>of the coupling member <b>131</b> and is screw-coupled to the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>of the bare cell <b>110</b>, since the diameter d<b>1</b> is reduced in the lower part of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>formed in the bare cell <b>110</b>, the coupling between the screw bolt <b>141</b> and the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>increases. The upper part of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>formed in the bare cell <b>110</b> is wider than the lower part thereof, which prevents a burr from being generated. A space <b>112</b><i>b </i>having a greater diameter d<b>2</b> than the diameter d<b>1</b> of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>is formed in an opening part of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a</i>, which further prevents the burr from being generated. Therefore, the coupling between the screw bolt <b>141</b> and the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>is enhanced, the generation of the burr is prevented, which prevents contact resistance from increasing even when an external impact is applied to the battery pack <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The diameter d<b>2</b> of the space <b>112</b><i>b </i>is 10% to 30% longer than the diameter d<b>1</b> of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a</i>. If diameter d<b>2</b> of the space <b>112</b><i>b </i>is 0% to 10% longer than the diameter d<b>1</b> of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a</i>, the burr is generated around the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a</i>, which may increase the contact resistance between the coupling member <b>131</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b>. If the diameter d<b>2</b> of the space <b>112</b><i>b </i>is longer than the diameter d<b>1</b> of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>by more than 30%, although the burr is prevented from being generated around the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a</i>, a contact area between the coupling member <b>131</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> is reduced, which increases the contact resistance between the coupling member <b>131</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b>. Therefore, in this instance, the diameter d<b>2</b> of the space <b>112</b><i>b </i>is 10% to 30% longer than the diameter d<b>1</b> of the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>to maintain the contact resistance between the coupling member <b>131</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> at a predetermined level value, and the burr is prevented from being generated around the coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a</i>, thereby preventing an increase in the contact resistance.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The cover case <b>450</b> surrounds the protection circuit module <b>120</b>. The first receiving groove <b>451</b><i>b </i>and the second receiving groove <b>452</b><i>b </i>are formed in the cover case <b>450</b>. The first hole <b>451</b><i>a </i>and the second hole <b>452</b><i>a </i>that pass through the center of the first receiving groove <b>451</b><i>b </i>and the second receiving groove <b>452</b><i>b </i>are formed in the first receiving groove <b>451</b><i>b </i>and the second receiving groove <b>452</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The cover case <b>450</b> is a plastic case made by molding a resin material such as polycarbonate, which protects the protection circuit module <b>120</b> from an external impact and prevents a short circuit of the protection circuit module <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a rib <b>451</b> is formed inside the cover case <b>450</b> and supports the upper surface of the protection circuit module <b>120</b> to tightly adhere the protection circuit module <b>120</b> to the bare cell <b>110</b>, which prevents the protection circuit module <b>120</b> from moving, and contact resistance between the coupling member <b>131</b> soldered to the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> from increasing.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b> are coupled with the cover case <b>450</b>, the cover case <b>450</b> more tightly adheres the coupling member <b>131</b> to the bare cell <b>110</b> to prevent an increase in the contact resistance the coupling member <b>131</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b>.</p>

The chamfer parts <b>441</b><i>c </i>and <b>442</b><i>c </i>of the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b> are slidingly inserted into the chamfer parts <b>451</b><i>c </i>and <b>452</b><i>c </i>of the cover case <b>450</b>, so that a center axis of the first hole <b>451</b><i>a </i>and the second hole <b>452</b><i>a </i>of the cover case <b>450</b> and a center axis of the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b> are disposed in the same location, thereby reducing an assembling error between the cover <b>450</b> and the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The battery pack <b>400</b> tightens the cover case <b>450</b> with the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b> and is integrally formed with the bare cell <b>110</b>. The cover case <b>450</b> tightly adheres the protection circuit module <b>120</b> to prevent the protection circuit module <b>120</b> from moving. In addition, the coupling member <b>131</b> that is soldered to the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and is electrically connected to the bare cell <b>110</b> is tightly adhered to the cover case <b>450</b>, thereby preventing the increase in the contact resistance. Meanwhile, when the first screw bolt <b>441</b> is coupled to the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>of the bare cell <b>110</b>, a space <b>112</b><i>b </i>having a greater diameter than that of the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>is formed in the upper end port of the first coupling groove <b>112</b><i>a </i>to prevent a burr from being generated, thereby preventing the increase in the contact resistance due to an external impact.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4C</figref>, an elastic member <b>180</b> formed in the battery pack <b>400</b> supports the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b>. The elastic member <b>180</b> absorbs an externally applied impact when the cover case <b>450</b> is coupled to the bare cell <b>110</b> through the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b>. In more detail, since the cover case <b>450</b> is coupled to the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b>, an impact applied to the cover case <b>450</b> is transferred to the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b>, so that the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b> shake, which may weaken the coupling between the first and second coupling grooves <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>113</b><i>a </i>formed in the bare cell <b>110</b> and the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b>. If the impact is continuously applied to the cover case <b>450</b>, since the coupling between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b>, contact resistance between the coupling member <b>131</b> tightly adhered to the first screw bolt <b>441</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> may increase. Therefore, if the elastic member <b>180</b> is inserted into the protection circuit module <b>120</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b>, and the cover case <b>450</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> are coupled through the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b>, the protection circuit module <b>120</b> presses the elastic member <b>180</b>. The elastic member <b>180</b> disposed in the bare cell <b>110</b> pushes the protection circuit module <b>120</b>, so that the first receiving groove <b>451</b><i>b </i>and the second receiving groove <b>452</b><i>b </i>of the cover case <b>450</b> perpendicularly push the head parts <b>441</b><i>b </i>and <b>442</b><i>b </i>of the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b>. Therefore, the coupling between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b> is enhanced, which prevents the increase in the contact resistance due to the external impact. Since the elastic member <b>180</b> absorbs the impact applied to the cover case <b>450</b>, the impact transferred to the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b> can be reduced, which can prevent the contact resistance between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the coupling member <b>131</b> from increasing.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Meanwhile, the receiving grooves <b>451</b><i>b </i>and <b>452</b><i>b </i>formed in the cover case <b>450</b> are coupled to the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b> and are sealed with a sealing member <b>490</b> formed of rubber or silicon, thereby preventing impurities from inserting into the receiving grooves <b>451</b><i>b </i>and <b>452</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b> do not corrode due to impurities, so that the coupling between the first and second screw bolts <b>441</b> and <b>442</b> and the bare cell <b>110</b> can be maintained. Thus, the coupling between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the cover case <b>450</b> is further maintained, which prevents the increase in the contact resistance between the bare cell <b>110</b> and the coupling member <b>131</b> due to the external impact.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The battery pack according to aspects of the present invention does not increase contact resistance between a bare cell and a protection circuit module against an external impact.</p>
