<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a powertrain system and, more particularly, to a powertrain system having a lockable differential.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Machines such as scrapers, wheel loaders, trucks, and other mobile equipment are used to perform many tasks. To effectively perform these tasks, the machines require an engine that provides significant torque through a transmission to multiple ground engaging traction devices. Such machines usually include one or more differentials that divide rotational power from the transmission between tandem pairs of traction devices. The differentials are used to simultaneously drive the traction devices while allowing them to rotate at different speeds, thereby reducing wear of the traction devices, the associated powertrain, and even the roadway during particular operations such as cornering. In some situations, however, a differential may also allow a machine to lose traction by transferring all or a majority of the power from the transmission to only the traction device that is slipping.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One way to reduce slipping of a traction device is to manually lock the differential when slipping is likely to occur or is already occurring. Locking the differential causes both of the paired traction devices to rotate at the same speed, even if one of the traction devices still does not have sufficient traction (i.e., even if the traction device is spinning faster than a travel speed of the machine). In this manner, the traction device that has adequate traction still receives enough power from the transmission to move the machine through terrain that is contributing to the slipping. Unfortunately, manual locking of a differential can lead to timing problems associated with locking and unlocking procedures. For example, it may be possible for a machine operator to attempt to lock the differential when high levels of slipping are already occurring (e.g., when one traction device is spinning much faster than the other paired traction device), which can lead to damage of the differential. Likewise it may be possible for the machine operator to retain the differential in a locked condition longer than necessary, which can lead to excessive wear of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One attempt to address one or more of the problems described above is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,255 that issued to Porter et al. on Jan. 16, 2001 (&#x201c;the '255 patent&#x201d;). In particular, the '255 patent discloses a work vehicle having a front axle with a differential and a lock that is hydraulically coupled to a solenoid valve. The solenoid valve is further coupled to a microprocessor, which has manual and automatic modes of operation. In the manual mode of operation, the solenoid valve is controlled to activate the lock and lock the differential when a foot pedal located in an operator's cab is depressed. In the automatic mode of operation, the microprocessor automatically determines when wheels of the front axle are slipping and responsively triggers the solenoid valve to activate the lock and stop the slipping. The microprocessor is further configured to determine when an articulation angle of the vehicle is greater than a programmed amount during operation in either the manual or automatic modes, and responsively trigger the solenoid valve to release the lock and reduce damage of the differential caused by cornering.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although perhaps adequate for some situations, the system of the '255 patent may be less than optimal. In particular, the system does not inhibit an operator from locking the differential during conditions that could damage the differential. In addition, the system of the '255 patent may have limited applicability, as it fails to consider parameters specific to particular types of machines during automated unlocking of the differential.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above and/or other problems of the prior art.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a powertrain system for a mobile machine. The powertrain system may include a power source, a plurality of traction devices, and a differential operatively connecting an output of the power source with the plurality of traction devices. The powertrain system may also include a manual input device movable by an operator to generate a first signal indicative of a desire to lock the differential, at least one sensor configured to generate a second signal indicative of a parameter of the mobile machine, and a controller in communication with the at least one sensor, the manual input device, and the differential.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary mobile machine <b>10</b>. Machine <b>10</b>, in the disclosed example, is an earth-moving machine such as scraper that is configured to load material at a first location, transport the material from the first location to a second location, and unload the material at the second location. It is contemplated, however, that machine <b>10</b> may embody another type of mobile machine, if desired, such as an on- or off-highway haul truck, a wheel loader, or another machine known in the art. Machine <b>10</b> may include a front tractor <b>12</b> operatively connected to a rear tractor <b>14</b>, and a bowl <b>16</b> disposed between front and rear tractors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Front and rear tractors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may cooperate to pull and push bowl <b>16</b> across a ground surface, respectively. Bowl <b>16</b> may be rigidly connected to rear tractor <b>14</b> and operatively connected to front tractor <b>12</b> via an articulated hitch assembly <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Front tractor <b>12</b> may include multiple components that interact to power and control operations of bowl <b>16</b>. Specifically, front tractor <b>12</b> may include a frame <b>20</b>, a front axle assembly <b>22</b>, a powertrain <b>24</b>, and an operator station <b>26</b>. Frame <b>20</b> may rotatably receive front axle assembly <b>22</b> and be configured to support powertrain <b>24</b>. Powertrain <b>24</b> may be configured to drive front axle assembly <b>22</b> and provide electrical and/or hydraulic power to move bowl <b>16</b>. Operator station <b>26</b>, as will be described in more detail below, may facilitate manual control of machine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Front axle assembly <b>22</b> may include, among other things, a plurality of traction devices <b>28</b>, an axle <b>30</b> associated with each of traction devices <b>28</b>, and a centrally-located differential <b>32</b> connected to interior ends of axles <b>30</b>. In the disclosed exemplary embodiment, traction devices <b>28</b> are wheels mounted at exterior ends axles <b>30</b> opposite differential <b>32</b>. It should be noted, however, that traction devices <b>28</b> other than wheels, for example tracks or belts, may utilized if desired. Differential <b>32</b> may be configured to receive a rotational input from powertrain <b>24</b> and provide a rotational output to each of axles <b>30</b> to drive traction devices <b>28</b> and thereby propel machine <b>10</b>. When one of traction devices <b>28</b> rotates at a significantly different speed than another of traction devices <b>28</b> within the same axle assembly <b>22</b> during straight travel of machine <b>10</b>, at least one of traction devices <b>28</b> is said to be slipping.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Differential <b>32</b> may include a combination of intermeshing gears and a lockable clutch (e.g., a conventional dog clutch) that interact to produce two different modes of operation during which axles <b>30</b> are either driven with a substantially equal torque or with a substantially equal speed. In particular, as is known in the art, when differential <b>32</b> is operating in an unlocked mode (i.e., when the dog clutch is unlocked), differential <b>32</b> may supply substantially equal amounts of torque to each of axles <b>30</b>, regardless of speeds of axles <b>30</b> (i.e., the speeds of axles <b>30</b> may be different when differential <b>32</b> is operating in the unlocked mode). In contrast, as is also known in the art, when operating in a locked mode (i.e., when the dog clutch is unlocked), differential <b>32</b> may be configured to drive axles <b>30</b> at about the same speeds, regardless of an amount of torque supplied to each of axles <b>30</b> (i.e., the torque supplied to axles <b>30</b> may be different when differential <b>32</b> is operating in the locked mode). Operation with differential <b>32</b> in the locked mode may make steering difficult because of the equal speeds. Because differential <b>32</b> may include a dog clutch, when differential <b>32</b> is locked, axles <b>30</b> may be coupled to each other through mechanical interference (as opposed to friction common with other types of clutches) such that slipping of traction devices <b>28</b> is not possible without damage to differential <b>32</b>. Differential <b>32</b> may be selectively caused to operate in the locked mode to maintain a tractive force of machine <b>10</b>, or in the unlocked mode to reduce wear of traction devices <b>28</b> and/or powertrain <b>24</b> during particular operations such as cornering.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Powertrain <b>24</b> may be configured to generate a power output directed through differential <b>32</b> to axles <b>30</b>. In the disclosed embodiment, powertrain <b>24</b> includes, among other things, an engine <b>34</b>, and a transmission <b>36</b> operatively coupled between engine <b>34</b> and differential <b>32</b>. Engine <b>34</b> may be any source of power known in the art, for example a combustion engine such as a diesel engine or a gasoline engine. Transmission <b>36</b> may be a power-shift transmission, a continuously variable transmission, or a hybrid transmission, as desired, and be configured to transmit a power output generated by engine <b>34</b> to differential <b>32</b> throughout a range of speed-to-torque ratios. It should be noted that powertrain <b>24</b> may include an alternative power source coupled to transmission <b>36</b>, if desired, such as an electric motor, a fuel cell/motor combination, or another source known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Operator station <b>26</b> may include an interface device <b>38</b> located proximate an operator seat and configured to generate control signals associated with operation of machine <b>10</b>. In one example, interface device <b>38</b> may be a foot switch located on a floor of operator station <b>26</b> and selectively manipulated (e.g., stepped on) by an operator to manually cause the dog clutch of differential <b>32</b> to lock and unlock. It is contemplated, however, that a different type of interface device, for example a pedal, a push button, or a lever may be utilized to control differential <b>32</b>, if desired. The same or a different interface device may be used to control operations of bowl <b>16</b>, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Articulated hitch assembly <b>18</b> (also known as a cushion hitch) may include a curved main beam <b>40</b> having a front end <b>42</b> and a back end <b>44</b>. Front end <b>42</b> of beam <b>40</b> may be connected through a vertical hinge joint <b>46</b> and a horizontal hinge joint <b>48</b> to frame <b>20</b> such that beam <b>40</b> may pivot both in the horizontal direction and in the vertical direction relative to frame <b>20</b>. A pair of steering actuators <b>50</b> (only one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be associated with vertical hinge joint <b>46</b> to provide for articulated steering of machine <b>10</b>. Specifically, steering actuators <b>50</b> may embody left and right hydraulic cylinders located to either side of beam <b>40</b> that extend and retract in opposition to each other to thereby cause beam <b>40</b> to pivot in the horizontal direction at vertical hinge joint <b>46</b>. A cushion actuator <b>52</b>, for example a hydraulic cylinder, may be associated with horizontal hinge joint <b>48</b> to provide for selective isolation of operator station <b>26</b> from vertical movements of bowl <b>16</b>. Cushion actuator <b>52</b> may be hydraulically locked during some modes of operations (e.g., during digging or unloading) such that beam <b>40</b> is inhibited from moving in the vertical direction relative to frame <b>20</b>, and unlocked during other modes of operations (e.g., during transport) to allow beam <b>40</b> and bowl <b>16</b> to float in the vertical direction relative to frame <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Back end <b>44</b> of beam <b>40</b> may be connected to bowl <b>16</b> via a pair of arms <b>54</b> located on opposing sides of beam <b>40</b> (only one side shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Each arm <b>54</b> may include a first end <b>56</b> and a second end <b>58</b>. First end <b>56</b> may be pivotally connected to back end <b>44</b> of beam <b>40</b>, while second end <b>58</b> may be pivotally connected to bowl <b>16</b>. A pair of bowl actuators <b>60</b> (only one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), for example hydraulic cylinders, may be connected between beam <b>40</b> at back end <b>44</b> and bowl <b>16</b>, and configured to selectively raise bowl <b>16</b> away from the ground surface and lower bowl <b>16</b> toward the ground surface by retractions and extensions thereof, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Bowl <b>16</b> may be rigidly supported by rear tractor <b>14</b>. During extension and retraction of bowl actuators <b>60</b>, bowl <b>16</b> may be caused to pivot in the vertical direction about a rear axle assembly <b>62</b> such that a leading end <b>64</b> of bowl <b>16</b> may be raised and lowered relative to the ground surface. In some embodiments, an additional powertrain <b>66</b> may be contained within rear tractor <b>14</b> and supported by rear axle assembly <b>62</b>. In these embodiments, powertrain <b>66</b> may be operated to drive rear axle assembly <b>62</b> and thereby push machine <b>10</b>. Powertrain <b>66</b> of rear tractor <b>14</b> may be substantially identical to powertrain <b>24</b> of front tractor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Bowl <b>16</b> may be a tool embodied as a generally hollow enclosure having an opening at leading end <b>64</b>. A horizontal blade <b>68</b> may be located at leading end <b>64</b> and positioned to selectively engage the ground surface as leading end <b>64</b> is lowered by the extension of bowl actuators <b>60</b>. In this configuration, an extension length of bowl actuators <b>60</b> may affect a depth of blade <b>68</b> into the ground surface and, in conjunction with a travel speed of machine <b>10</b>, a rate of material removal from the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, machine <b>10</b> may be equipped with a powertrain system <b>70</b> that includes components that cooperate to control differential <b>32</b> in response to various sensory and operator input. In particular, powertrain system <b>70</b> may include, among other things, a controller <b>72</b> in communication with differential <b>32</b>, transmission <b>36</b>, interface device <b>38</b>, cushion actuator <b>52</b>, bowl actuators <b>60</b>, and/or one or more sensors located throughout machine <b>10</b> and configured to generate signals indicative of performance parameters of machine <b>10</b>. Controller <b>72</b>, as will be described in more detail below, may be configured to selectively cause the dog clutch of differential <b>32</b> to lock or unlock, thereby changing the mode of operation of differential <b>32</b> and the corresponding performance of traction devices <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Controller <b>72</b> may be configured to execute instructions stored on a computer readable medium to perform a method of differential control in response to received signals. Controller <b>72</b> may include any component or combination of components for monitoring, recording, storing, indexing, processing, and/or communicating operational aspects of machine <b>10</b> described above. These components may include, for example, a memory, one or more data storage devices, a central processing unit, or any other components that may be used to run an application. Furthermore, although aspects of the present disclosure may be described generally as being stored in memory, one skilled in the art will appreciate that these aspects can be stored on or read from types of computer program products or computer-readable media, such as computer chips and secondary storage devices, including hard disks, floppy disks, optical media, CD-ROM, or other forms of RAM or ROM. Controller <b>72</b> may execute sequences of computer program instructions stored on the computer readable media to perform methods of differential control that will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The sensors that could provide input to controller <b>72</b> may include, among others, a speed sensor <b>74</b> associated with each of axles <b>30</b> and/or traction devices <b>28</b>, and a yaw rate sensor <b>76</b>. Speed and yaw rate sensors <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may embody any conventional speed and yaw rate sensors known in the art. Based on input from multiple speed sensors <b>74</b>, controller <b>72</b> may be configured to determine if slip (a difference in speed between traction devices <b>28</b>) is occurring or is likely to occur. Based on input from yaw rate sensor <b>76</b>, controller <b>72</b> may be configured to determine if and at what rate machine <b>10</b> is cornering (i.e., turning and/or articulating).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Controller <b>72</b> may be configured to determine additional information via communication with transmission <b>36</b>, cushion actuator <b>52</b>, and/or bowl actuators <b>60</b>. For example, controller <b>72</b> may be configured to determine, through communication with transmission <b>36</b> or through communication with one or more sensors (not shown) associated with transmission <b>36</b>, what the current speed-to-torque ratio (i.e., gear) is. Controller <b>72</b> may also be configured to determine, through communication with cushion actuator <b>52</b> or through communication with one or more sensors (not shown) associated with articulated hitch assembly <b>18</b>, what the current status of articulated hitch assembly <b>18</b> is (i.e., if articulated hitch assembly <b>18</b> is in a locked or float condition). Similarly, controller <b>72</b> may be configured to determine, through communication with bowl actuators <b>60</b> or through communication with one or more sensors (not shown) associated with bowl <b>16</b>, what the current position and/or loading condition of bowl <b>16</b> is.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary method stored as instructions on the computer readable medium that are executable by controller <b>72</b> to perform differential control of machine <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will be discussed in more detail in the following section to further illustrate the disclosed concepts.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The disclosed powertrain system may be applicable to any mobile machine where component protection of the machine's differential is desired. The disclosed powertrain system may help to protect the differential through regulation of both manual and automatic locking operations based on operator input and sensed performance parameters of the machine. Operation of powertrain system <b>70</b> will now be explained with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The exemplary method of controlling powertrain system <b>70</b> of machine <b>10</b> may begin with controller <b>72</b> receiving manual input from the operator of machine <b>10</b> regarding desired locking of differential <b>32</b> (Step <b>300</b>). As described above, the input may include a signal generated by interface device <b>38</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). For example, the operator may step on interface device <b>38</b> to indicate a desire to lock the dog clutch of differential <b>32</b> (when differential <b>32</b> is currently unlocked) and interface device <b>38</b> may generate a corresponding signal indicative of this desire. The operator may step on interface device <b>38</b> to indicate the desire to lock differential <b>32</b> when the operator becomes aware of slipping of traction devices <b>28</b> or, alternatively, when the operator initiates an operation where slipping is known to commonly occur. Slipping may commonly occur during loading or unloading of bowl <b>16</b>, when a resistance to forward motion of machine <b>10</b> increases and/or when the underfooting of machine <b>10</b> becomes loose and provides less traction to traction devices <b>28</b>. In like manner, the operator may step on interface device <b>38</b> again (or release interface device <b>38</b>) to indicate a desire to unlock the dog clutch of differential <b>32</b> (when differential is currently locked) and interface device <b>38</b> may generate a corresponding signal indicative of this desire. The operator may step on interface device <b>38</b> to indicate the desire to unlock differential <b>32</b> when the operator completes the operation commonly associated with slipping and/or begins a transport operation where slipping is less likely to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Based on the current status of differential <b>32</b> (i.e., whether differential <b>32</b> is currently locked or unlocked) and based on the signal from interface device <b>38</b>, controller <b>72</b> may determine whether the operator desires to lock or unlock differential <b>32</b>. For example, if differential <b>32</b> is locked when the signal from interface device <b>38</b> is received, controller <b>72</b> may determine that the operator desires to unlock differential <b>32</b> (Step <b>305</b>: Unlock). Similarly, if differential <b>32</b> is unlocked when the signal from interface device <b>38</b> is received, controller <b>72</b> may determine that the operator desires to lock differential <b>32</b> (Step <b>305</b>: Lock). When the operator desires to unlock differential <b>32</b>, controller <b>72</b> may cause the dog clutch of differential <b>32</b> to disengage (Step <b>307</b>), and control may return to step <b>300</b>. However, when the operator desires to lock differential <b>32</b> control may continue to a step <b>310</b>, where controller <b>72</b> detects various performance parameters of machine <b>10</b> that can affect successful engagement of the dog clutch.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Step <b>310</b> may be completed before, during, and/or after receiving input from the operator of machine <b>10</b> regarding the desire to lock differential <b>32</b>, (Step <b>310</b>). The performance parameters detected by controller <b>72</b> may include, among others, speeds of traction devices <b>28</b> received via sensors <b>74</b>. Controller <b>72</b> may then compare the performance parameters to an acceptable range and determine if the performance parameters have deviated from the range (Step <b>320</b>). For example, controller <b>72</b> may receive signals from sensors <b>74</b> associated with traction devices <b>28</b> and responsively determine if an actual slip value of traction devices <b>28</b> (i.e., an actual speed difference between opposing traction devices <b>28</b> or percentage difference from a machine ground speed) has deviated from an acceptable range of slip values. When the performance parameters deviate from the acceptable range, locking of differential <b>32</b> could cause damage to the dog clutch of differential <b>32</b> (e.g., the elevated difference in rotational speeds could cause the interfering components of the dog clutch to violently engage each other, resulting breakage of the components). Accordingly, in this situation, controller <b>72</b> many inhibit locking of differential <b>32</b> in response to the signal received from interface device <b>38</b> (Step <b>330</b>). However, when the performance parameters fall within the acceptable range of values, controller <b>72</b> may instead lock differential <b>32</b> in response to the manual indication provided by the operator of machine <b>10</b> (i.e., in response to the signal from interface device <b>38</b>) (Step <b>340</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">During operation of differential <b>32</b> in the locked mode, axles <b>30</b> may be driven to rotate at about the same speeds and machine <b>10</b> may be provided with enhanced traction that provides for improved productivity and/or efficiency. Once machine <b>10</b> has passed through conditions that contribute to slip, the operator should manually unlock differential <b>32</b> by again manipulating interface device <b>38</b>. In some situations, however, the operator may err and fail to unlock differential <b>32</b> when the enhanced traction is no longer necessary or beneficial. Accordingly, controller <b>72</b> may be configured to automatically override the operator and unlock differential <b>32</b> under certain conditions such that component life of traction devices <b>28</b> and/or powertrain <b>24</b> may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, after differential <b>32</b> has been locked according to operator desire (i.e., after completion of step <b>340</b>), controller <b>72</b> may detect various other performance parameters of machine <b>10</b>. In particular, controller <b>72</b> may detect a position of bowl <b>16</b>, a loading condition of bowl <b>16</b>, a speed-to-torque ratio (i.e., gear) of transmission <b>36</b>, a condition of articulated hitch assembly <b>18</b> (locked or floating), a yaw rate (i.e., a cornering rate) of machine <b>10</b>, and/or another parameter known in the art (Step <b>350</b>). Controller <b>72</b> may then determine if the detected parameter(s) are indicative of conditions during which enhanced traction is no longer desired. That is, controller <b>72</b> may determine if bowl <b>16</b> is in a transport position (as opposed to a dig or dump position), if bowl <b>16</b> is not being loaded or unloaded, if transmission <b>36</b> is in a transport gear (a higher gear as opposed to a lower dig or dump gear), if articulated hitch assembly <b>18</b> is in float (as opposed to locked, which may be required during loading of bowl <b>16</b>), and/or if machine <b>10</b> is cornering at a significant rate (as opposed to traveling in a straight line) (Step <b>360</b>). If none of these conditions exist (Step <b>360</b>: No), controller <b>72</b> may maintain the operator-desired locked condition of differential <b>32</b> (Step <b>370</b>) and control may return to step <b>300</b>. When, however, controller <b>72</b> determines that bowl <b>16</b> is in a transport position, not being loaded, or not being unloaded, that transmission <b>36</b> is in a high transport gear, that articulated hitch assembly <b>18</b> is unlocked, and/or that machine <b>10</b> is cornering at a significant rate, controller <b>72</b> may instead unlock differential <b>32</b> (Step <b>380</b>) to help protect the components of differential <b>32</b>, and control may return to step <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Because powertrain system <b>70</b> may allow for locking of differential <b>32</b> in response to manual input, the operator of machine <b>10</b> may be provided with greater control over machine operation. In addition, because powertrain system <b>70</b> may be functional to override operator commands for locking of differential <b>32</b> during conditions that could damage differential <b>32</b>, the integrity of powertrain system <b>70</b> may be preserved. Further, because powertrain system <b>70</b> may be operable based on performance parameters particular to a certain application (e.g., particular to a scraper application), additional functionality of machine <b>10</b> may be provided. For example, powertrain system <b>70</b> may allow for automatic unlocking of differential <b>32</b> based on detection of specific scraper performance parameters, regardless of the operator's original command to lock differential <b>32</b> (i.e., regardless of the current position and/or condition of interface device <b>38</b>). This functionality may help to enhance performance and/or longevity of machine <b>10</b> in the scraper application.</p>
