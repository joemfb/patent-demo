<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A smart network may include a smart network host device as well as one or more client devices configured to connect to the smart network. Each of the client devices may implement one or more services that the client device exposes to other devices connected to the smart network. Each of the client devices includes network layer 2 and 3 attributes as well as network layer 7 application attributes. The application attributes are enumerated as named services, which each client device registers with the smart network host device. When a client device needs access to a named service, the smart network host device uses layer 2, 3, and 7 attributes associated with the client device to select a suitable server for providing the named service to the client device.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/327,072, filed Apr. 22, 2010, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to automated network configuration systems and, more specifically, to device and service management based on layer 2 through layer 7 device attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Home networks, in which multiple computing and/or peripheral devices are communicatively linked together in a consumer's home, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. A home environment may include one or more computers, a wireless router, a cable modem or digital subscriber line (DSL) modem, and one or more other devices capable of connecting to the home network. Conventionally, each device in the home network must be manually configured to connect to the network and, once connected, may then communicate with other devices attached to the home network. Each connected device may offer different services to the other devices within the network or require certain services from other devices within the network. Conventionally, each device and related service must be manually configured to operate properly with other devices offering or using a certain service.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Manual configuration can technically enable devices to operate together in a given network. In practical settings, however, procedures for establishing and provisioning services within a home network are typically too involved for the majority of home network users to implement reliably. For example, a network user may need to manually reconfigure a home network router, determine a network IP address and/or hostname for each device, establish network credentials, register a networked video monitor device and a home surveillance camera, pair the monitor device with the camera, and so forth. Furthermore, in order for a device to locate another device on the home network, a device must establish communication using a unique IP address of the other device. Such connections are typically defined as peer-to-peer connections. In peer-to-peer applications, a user may be required to manually keep track of which address is associated with which device or service in order to configure the devices to communicate properly. Such manual configuration procedures present a significant challenge for unsophisticated users attempting to set up a home network and provision services on the home network.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for systems and methods that reliably and conveniently enable the user of a home network to automatically configure and provision services provided by one or more client devices on the home network.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is an exemplary illustration of an overarching network system <b>100</b> configured to implement one or more aspects of the present invention. The network system <b>100</b> comprises a smart network <b>102</b>, an external network <b>110</b>, and an applet store <b>116</b>. The external network <b>110</b> may comprise the well-known Internet or any other data network system. The smart network <b>102</b> includes a smart network host device <b>120</b> configured to transmit network data packets between the external network <b>110</b> and connected devices within the smart network <b>102</b>, such as computer <b>170</b> and client devices <b>130</b>. Any technically feasible wireless or wired physical transport technology may be implemented to transmit the network data packets. The smart network host device <b>120</b> maintains a network state model <b>178</b> that represents the different entities and related services operating within the smart network <b>102</b>. For example, if client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) implements a printer with an integrated scanner and flash memory reader, then the network state model <b>178</b> would include an entry for client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>), and related attributes for a printer service, scanner service, and file (or block device) service. New devices register with the smart network host device <b>120</b>, which then updates the network state model <b>178</b> to include the new device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A portal application <b>172</b>, residing within the computer <b>170</b>, is configured to access the network state model <b>178</b> to determine which client devices <b>130</b> are available within the smart network <b>102</b>, which services the client devices <b>130</b> provide, and to access and use the services. The portal application <b>172</b> may include one or more applets <b>174</b>, configured to extend functionality of the portal application <b>172</b>. A given applet <b>174</b> may be associated with a specific client device <b>130</b> and may facilitate specific usage models for the client device <b>130</b> via the extended functionality. When a new client device <b>130</b> registers with the smart network <b>102</b>, a most recent version of a corresponding applet <b>174</b> may not be available within the portal application <b>172</b>. However, the portal application <b>172</b> may retrieve the corresponding applet <b>174</b> or version of the corresponding applet <b>174</b> from the applet store <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The applet store <b>116</b> is configured to facilitate access to applets <b>174</b> by the portal application <b>172</b>. The applet store <b>116</b> provides storage for applets <b>174</b> corresponding to client devices <b>130</b> and makes the applets <b>174</b> available for download to the portal application <b>172</b> via the external network <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the applet store <b>116</b> occupies a well-known location, such as a universal resource locator (URL) associated with the external network <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the smart home network <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, according to one example embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the smart network <b>102</b> comprises a smart network host device <b>120</b>, one or more client devices <b>130</b>, and a wide area network (WAN) interface device <b>112</b>, coupled to the external network <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The WAN interface device <b>112</b> may implement a cable modem, digital subscriber line (DSL) modem, fiber to the home interface, or any other technically feasible device that provides digital network connectivity to the external network <b>110</b>. The WAN interface device <b>112</b> is coupled to the smart network host device <b>120</b> via a network interface <b>118</b>. In one embodiment, the network interface <b>118</b> implements the well-known Ethernet standard.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The smart network host device <b>120</b> implements a wireless network interface coupled to antenna <b>122</b>, which is configured to convert electrical signals to electromagnetic signals for transmitting data packets, and electromagnetic signals to electrical signals for receiving data packets. The antenna <b>122</b> may comprise plural independent radiator structures, each having a separate radiation pattern for implementing spatial multiplexing. In one embodiment, the wireless network interface implements one or more well-known standards, such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard 802.11, which defines a system for wireless local area networking. The antenna <b>122</b> is configured establish wireless client links <b>134</b> to antennas <b>132</b> coupled to corresponding client devices <b>130</b>. The smart network host device <b>120</b> implements layer 2 forwarding (bridging) for wireless data packets forwarded among client devices <b>130</b> as well as internet protocol (IP) layer 3 routing between an IP domain associated with the smart network <b>102</b> and the external network <b>110</b>. In this configuration, the smart network host device <b>120</b> provides related services and protocols, such as dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), network address translation (NAT), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The smart network host device <b>120</b> acts as a central authentication authority for the smart network <b>102</b> and implements authentication services for devices registering with the smart network <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, authentication is implemented via Identification (ID) devices <b>136</b> that are uniquely paired with corresponding client devices <b>130</b>. For example, client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) may be uniquely paired with ID device <b>136</b>(<b>0</b>) by a manufacturer of the client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>). An ID device <b>136</b>(<b>0</b>) is physically presented to the smart network host device <b>120</b> as an authentication credential to allow a client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) paired to the ID device <b>136</b>(<b>0</b>) to join the smart network <b>102</b>. Furthermore, the client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) is able to authenticate the smart network <b>102</b> as a trusted network by accessing credentials for the corresponding ID device <b>136</b>(<b>0</b>) specifically via the smart network <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the ID devices <b>136</b> are implemented as near field radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Each one of the RFID tags is configured to retain authentication credentials necessary to uniquely associate the one RFID tag with one instance of the client device <b>130</b>. In this way, an RFID tag may be paired with a given client device <b>130</b>. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that any technique may be implemented to generate and represent authentication credentials without departing the scope and spirit of the present invention. For example, in another embodiment, the ID devices <b>136</b> could be implemented as a physical token that includes a printed bar code on a face of the token. The bar code may encode authentication credentials for a corresponding client device <b>130</b>. In such an embodiment, the smart network host device <b>120</b> may include an optical scanner capable of reading the printed bar code from the physical token. In alternative embodiments, other forms of ID devices <b>136</b> may implement storage of the authentication credentials. For example, a universal serial bus (USB) storage device may be used to present authentication credentials to the smart network host device <b>120</b> for authenticating a related device, such as the computer <b>170</b>. In other alternative embodiments, a user may manually authenticate a client device <b>130</b> with the smart network host device <b>120</b>. For example, the user may log onto a management web page generated by the smart network host device <b>120</b> and manually enter authentication credentials, such as a printed code associated with the client device <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one usage scenario involving ID device <b>136</b>, the user wishes to add a new device, such as a smart network-enabled printer to the smart network <b>102</b>. The printer includes an ID device <b>136</b> implemented as an RFID tag that is paired to the printer. The user places the ID device <b>136</b> in close physical proximity to the smart network host device <b>120</b>, which is the able to read the ID device <b>136</b> and authenticate the printer. The printer registers with the smart network host device <b>120</b> and is then available for use by devices connected within the smart network <b>102</b>. Upon successfully reading the ID device <b>136</b>, the smart network host device <b>120</b> may indicate success to the user by flashing a light-emitting diode (LED), or by generating any technically feasible indication.</p>

Here, the smart network <b>102</b> comprises a smart network host device <b>120</b>, a smart network extender device <b>140</b>, one or more client devices <b>130</b>, and a wide area network (WAN) interface device <b>112</b>, coupled to the external network <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The WAN interface device <b>112</b>, smart network host device <b>120</b>, and one or more client devices <b>130</b> are configured to operate as previously described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition to previously described functionality, the smart network host device <b>120</b> is also configured to detect one or more smart network extender devices <b>140</b> and to establish a bridge link <b>128</b> to each of the one or more smart network extender devices <b>140</b>. Each smart network extender device <b>140</b> is configured to act as a network bridge between a client device <b>130</b> and the smart network host device <b>120</b>. For example, client devices <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>130</b>(N) may be physically located such that they are able to connect to the smart network extender device <b>140</b>, but not to the smart network host device <b>120</b>. Furthermore, the smart network extender device <b>140</b> is able to connect to the smart network host device <b>120</b> via bridge link <b>128</b>. Data packets transmitted by client devices <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>130</b>(N) and destined to the external network <b>110</b> are received by the smart network extender device <b>140</b> and retransmitted by the smart network extender device <b>140</b> via bridge link <b>128</b> to the smart network host device <b>120</b>, which then forwards the data packets to the external network <b>110</b>. Similarly, data packets from the external network <b>110</b> that are destined to any of the client devices <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>130</b>(N) are transmitted via bridge link <b>128</b> to the smart network extender device <b>140</b>, which retransmits the data packets via wireless client links <b>134</b>(<b>1</b>)-<b>134</b>(N). Persons skilled in the art will understand that wireless client links <b>134</b>(<b>1</b>)-<b>134</b>(N) may each be configured to operate on a separate channel or band, or a common channel or band. Furthermore, bridge link <b>128</b> may operate on a separate channel or band with respect to the wireless client links <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, each smart network extender device <b>140</b> is paired to an ID device <b>136</b>, which is presented as an authentication credential to the smart network host device <b>120</b> to enable the smart network extender device <b>140</b> to participate within the smart network <b>102</b>.</p>

A backhaul link <b>158</b> is established between the smart network host device <b>120</b> and the smart network connector device <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Network data traffic between client device <b>130</b>(N) and the external network <b>110</b> traverses wireless client link <b>134</b>(N), bridge link <b>128</b>, and backhaul link <b>158</b>. This network data traffic is also forwarded by smart network extender device <b>140</b>, smart network host device <b>120</b>, and smart network connector device <b>150</b>.

A client device <b>130</b> may include one or more application services, each assigned one or more layer seven (L7) service unique identifiers <b>284</b>. Each client device may therefore be characterized as having L2, L3, and any number of L7 attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The smart network host device <b>120</b> also includes a globally unique L2 address <b>260</b> and a corresponding L3 address <b>262</b> that is unique within the smart network <b>102</b>.

In one embodiment, the inter-process communications are implemented by transmitting XML messages to other devices within the smart network <b>102</b> via physical network <b>270</b>. Such an XML-based service may be defined as a set of zero or more simple object access protocol (SOAP) actions and zero or more service events and may be implemented as a set of software instructions that are executed on one or more processors included in the host device. For example, the smart network host device <b>120</b> may implement the service as a set of instructions configured to be executed by the processor complex <b>160</b>.

In one embodiment, the SDP module <b>184</b> includes a registrar server <b>220</b> and a domain name system (DNS) server <b>222</b>. The registrar server <b>220</b> implements an application programming interface (API) that enables a client device <b>130</b> to register with the smart network host device <b>120</b> and discover other client devices <b>130</b> and services having service unique identifiers <b>284</b> available within the smart network <b>102</b>. In addition to a service unique identifier <b>284</b>, a service may also have a type, version, &#x201c;friendly&#x201d; name, status, and a control URL for managing the service. The DNS server <b>222</b> implements an API for adding, updating, or deleting entries in a database <b>240</b>. The DNS server <b>222</b> may be a standard domain name system server. In alternative embodiments, the DNS server <b>222</b> may be replaced by a different type of server that implements a custom set of functions to add, update, or delete entries in the database <b>240</b>.

Each event may be identified by a uniform resource identifier (URI) and a corresponding schema for the event payload (i.e., data including information related to the event). Calls made to the event hub server <b>230</b> may include the URI associated with the event and the domain name associated with the source of the event. Once a client device <b>130</b> or service having service unique identifier <b>284</b> has registered with the event hub server <b>230</b>, the client device <b>130</b> or service may receive messages when an appropriate event occurs related to the client device <b>130</b> or service. The event hub server <b>230</b> maintains state and event subscriptions for each device within the smart network <b>102</b>. The event hub server <b>230</b> facilitates one-to-many communication within the smart network <b>102</b> via the event subscriptions.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, a first client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) may implement a service for viewing media such as recorded television programs. When the first client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) connects to the smart network <b>102</b>, the first client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) makes a call to the registrar server <b>220</b> to register the client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) and a media content service with the smart network host device <b>120</b>. The media content service executing within the first client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) may make a call to the event hub server <b>230</b> in order to register to be notified whenever an event type matching a specific type of event (e.g., a program recording finished type event) is received by the event hub server <b>230</b>. A second client device <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>) may implement a media content service for recording media on a large storage disk. When the second client device <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>) finishes recording a particular program, the media content service associated with the second client device <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>) may be configured to generate a program recording finished event and notify the event hub server <b>230</b> of the event. The event hub server <b>230</b> determines that the first client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) has subscribed to be notified whenever this type of event has been generated and, therefore, sends a message to the media content service executing on the first client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) informing the service that a program has finished recording. In response to receiving the message about the event, the first client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) may perform certain tasks based on information associated with the event. For instance, in the above example, the first client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) may update a user interface, such as a menu on a television screen, to include a listing of the recorded program in a list of available recordings.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The DHCP module <b>226</b> provides IP leases to client devices <b>130</b>.

Each device record <b>320</b> may also include an arbitrary number of service offering identifiers <b>340</b>, and an arbitrary number of service requirement identifiers <b>342</b>. Furthermore, each device record <b>320</b> may include topology data <b>354</b>. Alternatively, the topology data <b>354</b> may be stored as a separate or related data structure. The topology data <b>354</b> may represent connectivity associated with the smart network <b>102</b> using any technically feasible technique, including connectivity graphs, forwarding tables, and the like. The topology data <b>354</b> may associate different parameters with each edge and node for a given configuration. For example, a graph edge (network link) may include a maximum link bandwidth and current utilization level for the edge. Device status <b>350</b> indicates relevant operating information about a client device <b>130</b>, such as whether the client device <b>130</b> is turned on and operating normally. Link attributes <b>352</b> may include link speed and error rates.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Each service offering identifier <b>340</b> identifies a specific type of services offered by the client device that is uniquely identified within the smart network <b>102</b> by device name <b>330</b>, and associated L2 address <b>332</b> and L3 address <b>334</b>. A service requirement identifier <b>342</b> identifies a specific type of services required by the client device. The database <b>240</b> may be configured to operate in conjunction with DNS server <b>222</b>, configured to process name space queries. For example, DNS server <b>222</b> may reply to a query to bind an IP address to a device name from a device namespace. The DNS server <b>222</b> may also reply to a query to bind an IP address to a service name from a service namespace. The database <b>240</b> represents a repository of current state for the smart network <b>102</b>, including named devices and named services within the smart network <b>102</b>. The IP address may be an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or any other technically feasible L3 address. A named service may be provided by a client device <b>130</b>, or a device outside the smart network <b>102</b>, and connected to the smart network <b>102</b> via the external network <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, each client device <b>130</b> implements a TCP/IP network stack that includes a DNS client.

Once the DNS server <b>222</b> has returned an IP address and port for the registrar server <b>220</b>, the client device <b>130</b> may make a call to the registrar server <b>220</b> to register the device and any services the client device <b>130</b> makes available on the smart network <b>102</b>. In alternative embodiments, each client device <b>130</b> may discover the IP address and port for the registrar server <b>220</b> via a vendor-defined DHCP option. In such alternative embodiments, the network provisioning module <b>182</b> of the smart network host device <b>120</b> may implement a DHCP server. When a client device <b>130</b> connects to the smart network <b>102</b>, the client device <b>130</b> may call the DHCP server to acquire an IP address. During a final stage of IP address acquisition via the DHCP server, a client device <b>130</b> may be exposed to the location of the registrar server <b>220</b> via a DHCPACK message sent from the DHCP server to the DHCP client on the client device <b>130</b>. The DHCPACK message may include the URL (i.e., domain name) for the registrar server <b>220</b> that may then be resolved using the DNS server <b>222</b> to retrieve the corresponding IP address and port for the registrar server <b>220</b> on the smart network host device <b>120</b>.</p>

The client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) is configured to negotiate network credentials with the smart network host device <b>120</b> and connect to the smart network host device <b>120</b> via a secure socket connection. Once the first client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) is connected to the smart network <b>102</b>, an IP address may be assigned to the first client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) by calling a DHCP server on the smart network host device. The DHCP server may assign an unallocated IP address allocated to the smart network <b>102</b> to the first client device. Similarly, the second client device <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>) is added to the smart network <b>102</b>.
