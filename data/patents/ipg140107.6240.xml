<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A viewer of an episode of a series such as a television series may wish to access episodes of the series that the viewer missed when they were originally broadcast. Interactive applications may receive the viewer's indication of interest to record missed episodes of the incomplete series, which may include instructions regarding recording options for including the missed episodes in a series aggregation. Interactive applications may identify the episodes to be included in the series aggregation, and record the missed episodes, which may then be stored and organized to create a series aggregation, in the order that they were first broadcast with episodes that the viewer may already have available. Interactive applications may present the episodes of the series aggregation in the order that they were originally broadcast, by providing the viewer with options on how to access the episodes.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/553,492 filed Sep. 3, 2009, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/324,183 filed Dec. 29, 2005 (now abandoned). The prior applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to interactive media guidance systems and more particularly to interactive media guidance systems that record media presented as episodes in a series, such as episodes of a television program series, any other program series, or any other type of series. This invention is an improvement on the basic series recording functionality that exists today (sometimes called a &#x201c;Season Pass&#x201d;). Series recording functionality relates to a user selecting to record a program that is part of a series. When the user selects to record a program that is part of a series, a media guidance system automatically schedules to record each episode of the series that is aired or will record &#x201c;new&#x201d; episodes of the series that are aired for the first time.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When users of an interactive media guidance system discover a series late (such as late in the season of a television program series), or miss viewing or recording some or all episodes of a series (within a season or one or more seasons of an entire series), it is often difficult for users to access or to view the episodes of the series in episode order or to capture the repeats (i.e., re-runs) of episodes that were not originally recorded. While many, most, or all episodes of a series may become available over time (as re-runs), not all episodes may be available at once or in the order that they were presented in the series. For example, a television program series may be in syndication, but not all episodes of the television program series may be available at one time, and some episodes may never be re-run.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some media content may be episodic content. Episodic content typically is self-contained within each episode and does not include a common storyline with other episodes of the media content. For example, episodes of the series &#x201c;Seinfeld&#x201d; are typically episodic. Viewers may watch one episode without watching all of the previous episodes in the series to understand the story. However, other media content may be serial in nature. Serial programming is any programming containing a temporal component, such as a recommended order of viewing. Serial programming may share themes and/or plot sequences with other episodes in the series.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example of serial programming includes episodes of the series &#x201c;24.&#x201d; A user who watches an episode of the series &#x201c;24&#x201d; out of sequence may not recognize or understand certain characters, themes, or plot elements that were introduced in previous unwatched episodes. This often causes the viewer to be confused or to lose interest in the media content. To comprehend episodes of serial programming fully, other related programming must typically be watched prior to watching the serial programming, or the serial programming must be watched in the order that it was originally presented.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, for serial series, while the sequence for future viewing is particularly important, re-runs of episodes of the series will not always be available in the sequence that they were originally presented. Sequence may be important for some episodic series as well. For example, a user who watches some episodes of the series &#x201c;Seinfeld&#x201d; out of sequence may not recognize or understand certain characters, themes, or plot elements that were introduced in previous unwatched episodes. Even when television programs are in re-runs in their original season, not all episodes are necessarily provided, and the episodes that are provided may not be provided in sequence. Viewers may also simply miss an episode or series of episodes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore desirable to provide systems and methods that may allow users to record some or all episodes of a series conveniently and thereby to view the episodes of a series in order.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the principles of the present invention, an interactive media guidance application is provided that may present, in the order that the episodes were originally presented, a desired group of episodes of a past or current series. This desired group of episodes will be referred to herein as a &#x201c;series aggregation.&#x201d; As will be described in greater detail below, the series aggregation is created by collecting (e.g., compiling or recording from a remote server, an on-demand server, any other suitable server, a recording device, broadcast, or any other suitable source) episodes out of the order in which they were originally presented and may present the episodes of the series aggregation in the order in which they were originally presented. The series aggregation may be episodes from one or more seasons of a series, a user- or application-selection of episodes of a series, or any other desired group of episodes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One or more episodes within a series aggregation may already be recorded on a recording device, may already be available on-demand from a server, or may already be available through any other suitable means. Episodes that are not already recorded on a recording device, already available on-demand from a server, or already available through any other suitable means will be referred to herein as missed episodes, regardless of whether the user has previously watched or recorded the episode. In some embodiments, no episodes of a series aggregation will have been recorded, available on-demand from a server, or available through any other suitable means prior to a user indicating a desire to create a series aggregation&#x2014;i.e., in this case all episodes may be considered missed episodes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The media guidance application may receive a user's instruction to record missed episodes of a series aggregation. In one embodiment, user's instructions may simply be a user requesting the media guidance application to record missed episodes of a series aggregation using either a text or voice entry. For example, a user may simply call a toll-free number and instruct the media guidance application to record missed episodes of a series aggregation by saying, &#x201c;Create series aggregation of The Sopranos Season One.&#x201d; In another embodiment, the media guidance application may be an online website, in which the titles and seasons of various media are offered as prompts, and the user may select from menus of available media. In response to the user's instruction, the media guidance application may query one or more media sources for the missed episodes and record them. The media guidance application may organize the missed episodes in order with the episodes that the user has already recorded (if any have been recorded) or that are already available (e.g. on-demand from a server) to create an aggregation of episodes that allows the user to watch episodes of the series in order (i.e., a series aggregation).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may wait until all of the episodes of a series aggregation have been recorded before prompting the user to playback the episodes in order. In other embodiments, the media guidance application may prompt the user to begin watching episodes after a predefined number of sequential episodes has been recorded (e.g., the first three episodes of a series aggregation).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As indicated above, the series aggregation may be for a past series or a current series. In a past series, all missed episodes in the series aggregation have already been originally presented (e.g., broadcast, premiered via video-on-demand, etc.). When creating a series aggregation for a past series, all missed episodes to be recorded are considered re-runs or repeats of the original presentation of the program.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">By convention, numbering of episodes may be in the order that the episodes were originally presented. For example, episode 1.1 may be the first episode in the first season of the series (or series aggregation) that was originally presented, episode 1.2 may be the next or second episode in the first season of the series that was originally presented, and so on until the last episode in the first season of the series that was originally presented. Episode 2.1 may then be the first episode in the second season of the series, episode 2.2 may be the next or second episode in the second season, and so on until the last episode in the second season of the series, and the last episode in the last season of the series. Thus, episodes may be identified as x.y, where x is the season number, and y is the episode number in season x.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For a current series, the series aggregation may include originally presented episodes, but may also include original presentations of one or more episodes that will occur in the future. For example, a season of a program may include 23 episodes. Episodes 1.1-1.11 may have already been originally presented, episode 1.12 is currently being originally presented (i.e., broadcasted), and episodes 1.13-1.23 will be originally presented in the future. At the current time, the media guidance application may receive a user's instruction to create a series aggregation for this program. To create this series aggregation, the media guidance application may record episodes 1.1-1.11 in the manner in which the media guidance application records missed episodes (described below). If episode 1.12 is currently being presented, the media guidance application may record this program if it is available for recording or may treat this program as a missed episode if the user did not tune to the program in time to capture the whole program as a recording. Episodes 1.13-1.23 may be recorded when they are originally presented in the future. Episodes 1.13-1.23 may still be considered missed episodes and the description of missed episodes herein may apply equally to episodes of a program that are originally presented in the future. Episodes of a series that are originally presented in the future may be considered a missed episode because a user may not watch a series aggregation until episodes in a series aggregation have been recorded. Thus, the original presentation of these episodes will be missed by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Until all episodes of a series aggregation have been recorded, the series aggregation may be considered an incomplete series or an incomplete series aggregation. When recording missed episodes of an incomplete series aggregation, the media guidance application may record, in some embodiments, only missed episodes. In other embodiments, the media guidance application may also record non-missed episodes when it is desirable to replace a copy of an episode that the user has recorded (e.g., to replace a standard-definition copy with a high-definition one).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The media guidance application may record missed episodes of an incomplete series aggregation from any accessible source of media (although in some embodiments only certain predefined sources may be used). For example, the media guidance application may determine whether missed episodes will be provided as television programs over the user's broadcast, cable or satellite delivery system, Internet, Internet protocol television (IPTV) or any other means, and may schedule the missed episodes for recording. The media guidance application may, for example, query a video-on-demand (VOD) server in the user's television delivery system or another on-demand media server (such as a website), and record missed episodes on demand.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The media guidance application may also, for example, provide the user with an option to wait for the series aggregation to be available after the episodes are available from the user's &#x201c;free&#x201d; sources, or to pay a certain amount of money immediately to get the series aggregation on-demand, on a DVD, or any other suitable option. The media guidance application may also, for example, provide the user with information on how long the user would have to wait until the episodes are available from the user's &#x201c;free&#x201d; sources, so that the user can make a decision whether to pay a certain amount of money immediately to get the series aggregation on-demand, on a DVD, or any other suitable option. Also, the media guidance application may make the decision whether to get the series aggregation on-demand, on a DVD, or any other suitable option automatically based on user preferences. For example, the user may set the media guidance application always to pay a certain amount of money immediately to get the series aggregation on-demand, on a DVD, or any other suitable option, when the user would have to wait more than three months or any other user-defined time until the episodes are available from the user's &#x201c;free&#x201d; sources.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Missed episodes may be recorded using any suitable approach. In some embodiments, a missed episode may be recorded when it becomes available to the media guidance application. For example, an episode of a series may be recorded when it is broadcast, or may be downloaded immediately if available on demand. The episode may be recorded on the user's equipment or on a remote recording device (e.g., a remote server) for the user. In other embodiments, identifiers such as unique resource identifiers, episode identification numbers or universal resource locators (URLs) may be stored by the media guidance application. The media guidance application may retrieve the actual episode from the appropriate source when the user instructs the application to play the episode back.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may provide a display having options the user may select to indicate how the user wishes to view missed episodes. The options may include, for example: setting alerts for when an entire series is available from a media provider or across different media providers accessible to the user's equipment; aggregating episodes of a series; accessing episodes on-demand; obtaining a DVD of episodes; purchasing episodes via PPV if available; and downloading episodes of a series that are new to the user.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The amount of media available to users in any given media delivery system can be substantial. Consequently, many users desire a form of media guidance, an interface that allows users to efficiently navigate media selections and easily identify media that they may desire. An application which provides such guidance is referred to herein as an interactive media guidance application or, sometimes, a media guidance application or a guidance application.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Interactive media guidance applications may take various forms depending on the media for which they provide, guidance. One typical type of media guidance application is an interactive television program guide. Interactive television program guides are well-known guidance applications that, among other things, allow users to navigate among and to locate television programming viewing choices and, in some systems, digital music choices. The television programming (and music programming) may be provided via traditional broadcast, cable, satellite, Internet, IPTV or any other means. The programming may be provided on a subscription basis (sometimes referred to as premium programming), as pay-per-view programs, or on-demand such as in video-on-demand (VOD) systems. The providers of the different types of programming may be referred to herein as media sources.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With the advent of the Internet, mobile computing, and high-speed wireless networks, users are able to access media on personal computers (PCs) and devices on which they traditionally could not. Non-television-centric platforms (i.e., platforms that distribute media with equipment not part of the user's broadcast, cable or satellite television-delivery network) allow users to navigate among and locate desirable video clips, full motion videos (which may include television programs), images, music files, and other suitable media. Consequently, media guidance is also necessary on modern non-television-centric platforms. For example, media guidance applications may be provided as online applications (i.e., provided on a web-site), or as stand-alone applications or clients on hand-held computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or cellular telephones. In some systems, users may control equipment remotely via a media guidance application. For example, users may access an online media guide and set recordings or other settings on their in-home equipment. This may be accomplished by the online guide controlling the user's equipment directly or via another media guide that runs on the user's equipment. Remote access of interactive media guidance applications is discussed in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/246,392, filed Oct. 7, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For purposes of illustration, the present invention will be described herein as relating to television-centric approaches, but this is not meant to limit the invention. For example, the present invention may be applied to presenting in the order originally presented other types of media, such as audio series or on-demand media series (e.g., web sites that only make available one episode or a subset of episodes of a series at a time).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An illustrative interactive media guidance system in accordance with the present invention will be described herein, e.g., in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-19</figref>. Where appropriate, references to an illustrative media guidance system as it relates to the present invention will also appear in connection with the description of the processes, data structures, and display screens, e.g., in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A media guidance application in accordance with the present invention is provided that presents, in the order that the episodes were originally presented, a desired group of episodes of a past or current series (i.e., a series aggregation). The creation of a series aggregation may be desirable when a user of an interactive media guidance system discovers a series late (such as late in the season of a television program series or after the season of a television program series has completed), or misses viewing or recording some episodes of a series. For a program that is a serial series, the sequence for future viewing is particularly important, but re-runs of episodes of the series will not always be available in the sequence that they were presented. The creation of a series aggregation, such that the media guidance application collects (i.e., compiles or records from a remote server, an on-demand server, any other suitable server, a recording device, broadcast, or any other suitable source) a desired group of episodes, enables a user to view the episodes in the order in which they were originally presented.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The series aggregation may be episodes from one or more seasons of a television program series, a user or application selection of episodes of a series, or any other desired group of episodes. The selection of episodes of a series may be a subset of episodes that are a sequence of episodes within a season (e.g., television program series &#x201c;The Sopranos,&#x201d; episodes 3.4-3.16), a sequence of episodes within more than one season (e.g., &#x201c;The Sopranos,&#x201d; episode 4.16 through episode 5.2), non-sequential episodes of one or more seasons (e.g., &#x201c;The Sopranos,&#x201d; episodes 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.7), a special sequence of episodes (e.g., all the first and/or last episodes of each season of &#x201c;The Sopranos&#x201d;), or any other desired subset of episodes of a series within one or multiple seasons.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Once all episodes of a series aggregation have been recorded, the series aggregation may be considered a complete series aggregation. Until all episodes of a series aggregation have been recorded, the series aggregation may be considered an incomplete series aggregation. The general term &#x201c;series aggregation&#x201d; may be referred to herein as either a complete or incomplete series aggregation or both, where appropriate. The general term &#x201c;series aggregation&#x201d; is not meant to be limited to a complete or incomplete series aggregation, unless described as such.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows illustrative process <b>100</b> for creating a series aggregation that may be used in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. At step <b>102</b>, an interactive media guidance application may receive an indication of interest from a user to create a series aggregation of selected episodes of a series. In one embodiment, user's instructions may simply be a user requesting the media guidance application to record missed episodes of a series aggregation using either a text or voice entry. For example, user equipment device may include a user microphone. A user may simply instruct the media guidance application to record missed episodes of a series aggregation by saying into the microphone, &#x201c;Create series aggregation of The Sopranos Season One.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an alternate embodiment, user equipment device may include a keyboard, remote control, or other suitable device for free text entry or for making choices among presented options, such as a remote control for a menu or a mouse for PC navigation. A user may simply instruct the media guidance application to record missed episodes of a series aggregation by entering free text to a display screen using the keyboard, remote control, or other suitable device. Systems and methods for receiving a user instruction to create a series aggregation are discussed in greater detail below, e.g., in connection with the display screens of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-11</figref> and the data structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At step <b>104</b>, episodes of the selected series to be included in the series aggregation may be collected. Episodes may be collected by the media guidance application by compiling or recording them from a remote server, an on-demand server, any other suitable server, a recording device, broadcast, or any other suitable source. After episodes are collected by the media guidance application at step <b>104</b>, then process <b>100</b> may proceed to step <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">At step <b>106</b>, the episodes of the complete series aggregation may be organized and displayed in the order in which they were originally presented. The media guidance application may also inform the user that the series aggregation is complete by displaying a list of all episodes in the series aggregation in the order in which each episode was originally presented. Informing the user when the series aggregation is complete and displaying the series aggregation may be performed in various ways and will be discussed below in greater detail, e.g., in connection with a further description of step <b>116</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows illustrative substeps of step <b>104</b> for collecting episodes of a series to be included in a series aggregation that may be used in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention. At step <b>108</b>, episodes of the series to be included in the series aggregation may be identified based on the user's instruction. The episodes identified in step <b>108</b> may include all the episodes of the series aggregation. The episodes identified may be, for example, all episodes of a season of a program series. For illustration of the invention, a season of a program series &#x201c;The Sopranos&#x201d; may be discussed herein as the desired group of episodes for a series aggregation. This is not meant, however, to limit the invention to only this desired group of episodes of this program. In this illustrative example, it will also be assumed that there are 23 episodes in the season of the program series &#x201c;The Sopranos.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At step <b>110</b>, the interactive media guidance application may identify episodes of the series aggregation that are already available to the user. An episode may be identified as available to the user if it is found located in a storage device in a home network and/or other local or remote storage devices that have recorded programs available to the user. All episodes that have been recorded that are available to the user may be used to complete the series aggregation and in some embodiments it may not be necessary to record these episodes again as part of creating the series aggregation. Further details regarding storage devices and recording episodes on storage devices are discussed in greater detail below, for example in connection with the system description in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At step <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> those episodes that are currently considered missed episodes that are available for recording may be identified. An available missed episode may be an episode of the series aggregation that needs to be recorded to complete the series aggregation and that may be known to be available from one or more queried media sources currently or at some known time in the future. Further systems and methods for querying one or more media sources to determine availability of programming will be discussed in greater detail below, e.g., in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> and <b>14</b>-<b>19</b>. Examples of the one or more sources from which the media guidance application may acquire and record missed episodes include traditional broadcast, cable, or satellite programming media sources and subscription-based media sources or purchase-based media sources, pay-per-view, VOD, Internet downloads, DVD providers, IPTV or any other type of media source.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At step <b>114</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the media guidance application may record missed episodes that have been identified as available in step <b>112</b> (described below). At decision block <b>116</b> a determination may be made whether the series aggregation is complete. The series aggregation may be considered complete if all episodes of the series aggregation have been recorded for the user based on the performance of steps <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If the series aggregation is determined to be complete at decision block <b>116</b>, then process <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> may proceed to step <b>106</b>. If the series aggregation is determined to be incomplete at decision block <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, then process <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> may return to step <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> to further identify missed episodes that are available for recording.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In practice, one or more steps shown in process <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> may be combined with other steps, performed in any suitable order, modified, performed in parallel&#x2014;e.g., simultaneously or substantially simultaneously&#x2014;or deleted. For example, in one embodiment, step <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> may be deleted if it is desirable for the media guidance application to acquire all episodes of the series aggregation, regardless of whether some episodes are already available. In other embodiments, step <b>110</b> may be bypassed if the media guidance application determines that no episodes are already available to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the return to step <b>112</b> from decision block <b>116</b> when a determination is made that the series aggregation is complete may be modified. For example, in some embodiments the return to step <b>112</b> may occur continuously until missed episodes are identified as being available for recording. In other embodiments, the return to step <b>112</b> may occur at a predetermined time interval (e.g., every 10 minutes, every 30 minutes, every hour, every 12 hours, once a day, etc.). The return to step <b>112</b> may occur based on an event, such as when the media guidance application receives new program data information. When the media guidance application receives new program data information, this may indicate that more missed episodes may become available shortly in the future that were not available previously.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, recording missed episodes at step <b>114</b> may involve setting up an episode of the series aggregation for recording, and recording the episode at a later time. Therefore, the actual recording of the episode may occur after reaching decision block <b>116</b> because the episode may not be broadcast until some future time. In this embodiment, the determination of whether a series aggregation is complete at decision block <b>116</b> may involve determining if all episodes are already recorded or scheduled for recording. If this test is satisfied, process <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> may still proceed to step <b>106</b>, but the media guidance application may not inform a user that the series aggregation is complete yet because some episodes have not been recorded, because these episodes may not be broadcast until some future time (i.e., the series aggregation is incomplete). In this embodiment all missed episodes have been identified as available currently or at some future time and are being currently recorded or will be recorded at some known future time. In other embodiments, the media guidance application may present the series aggregation, but may inform the user that the series aggregation is incomplete. In another example, a user may access an incomplete series aggregation at any step in process <b>100</b>. For example, it may be desirable to access the series aggregation after step <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> when the episodes already available to the user have been identified.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A complete or incomplete series aggregation may be accessed by displaying a list of all episodes in the series aggregation, where the episodes are displayed in the order in which each episode was originally presented. As described above, in some embodiments, the media guidance application may inform a user that a series aggregation is complete at step <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. In other embodiments, the media guidance application may display an incomplete series aggregation. When an incomplete series aggregation is displayed, the media guidance application may indicate which of the episodes have been recorded, which episodes are scheduled for recording, and which episodes are not available for recording (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). In some embodiments, when an incomplete series aggregation is provided, only those episodes that have been recorded may be displayed. In other embodiments, only those episodes that have been recorded may be displayed with the episodes scheduled for recording or the episodes that are not available for recording. In some embodiments it may be desirable to display the missed episodes.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It may be desirable to access an incomplete series aggregation if a part of a specified sequence of episodes of the series aggregation has been recorded. For example, if episodes 2.1-2.3 and episodes 2.7-2.10 of &#x201c;The Sopranos&#x201d; are available, the media guidance application may begin to present the series aggregation. In this example, the user may watch episodes 2.1-2.3 and in the interim time in which the user is watching the episodes, the media guidance application may find that one or more of episodes 2.4-2.6 and 2.11-2.23 have become available and may be recorded. The media guidance application would essentially begin presenting an incomplete series aggregation from the beginning and fill in the gaps of the later missing episodes (i.e., complete the series aggregation) as the user is watching the beginning episodes.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It will be appreciated that other specified sequences of incomplete series aggregations may be accessed prior to completion. For example, continuing the same example, in some embodiments, the user may begin watching at episode 2.7 and watch episodes 2.7-2.10, while the media guidance application gathers the remaining episodes of the series aggregation from episode 2.11 onward. This may be desirable because the media guidance application may monitor a viewer's viewing history and be aware that the user has viewed or played episodes 2.1-2.6 previously. Systems and methods for monitoring viewing histories to determine programming that has been viewed or played is discussed in greater detail in connection with Ellis et al., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/374,043, filed Aug. 13, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,898,762, Ellis et al., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/105,128, filed Feb. 21, 2002, and Cordray et al., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/324,212, filed Dec. 29, 2005, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties, and below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In embodiments where a series aggregation is incomplete, a user may be provided with an opportunity to access and purchase, if necessary, missed episodes on-demand (e.g., video on-demand or VOD), from pay-per-view (PPV), from a DVD, downloading via the Internet, or in any other manner of accessing episodes other than from a broadcast media source. This embodiment may be desirable to a user if one or more episodes of a series aggregation are not available, or are available from a broadcast media source, but at a time in the future that is not desirable to the user. The time in the future may not be desirable to the user because the user would like to watch those one or more episodes of the series aggregation sooner than the time in the future when the program may be recorded by the user's recording device. For example, the system may prompt the user with, &#x201c;You have all but three episodes, and those three are available for purchase at $1.99 each. Buy now?&#x201d; or &#x201c;The system has been searching for two missing episodes for more than 90 days. Would you like to watch the series anyway, while we continue looking?&#x201d; In some embodiments the user may be provided with the opportunity to record or acquire the remaining missed episodes from VOD, PPV, DVD, the Internet or any other manner aside from a broadcast media source. This may be desirable if a user wants to expedite creating the series aggregation. In some embodiments the user may be provided a choice between continuing to create the series aggregation from a broadcast media source (without additional payment) or acquiring some or all of the remaining missed episodes from one or more of the other media sources provided above (which may require payment). In some embodiments the user could get periodic updates on when the remaining missed episodes may be available and whether they may be acquired from other media sources for a payment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The media guidance application may organize all episodes of the series aggregation at step <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and any other time the user accesses an incomplete series aggregation, present the status of a series aggregation. The organization of all episodes of the series aggregation may involve both providing a display screen showing the series aggregation and/or gathering information and/or the episodes themselves from the recording device or devices where the episodes of the series aggregation are stored. Information used in organizing the series aggregation may be stored in a local or remote database or any other storage means. The information in one or more of these databases may be in any suitable data management format, environment, or application, for example, a relational database format, an object oriented database format, a data warehouse, a data directory, a knowledge management system, or any other suitable device, environment or application for storing and indexing related information. For purposes of illustration of the invention a data structure will be described to organize the information necessary for providing the series aggregation but any format, environment, or application may be utilized. Exemplary data structures for organizing episodes of a series aggregation will be described below, for example, in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one embodiment of series aggregation information that is organized into illustrative data structure <b>200</b>. Although not shown, data structure <b>200</b> may include an identifier for the series aggregation that allows user equipment to recognize that the data structure contains series aggregation identifiers, thereby allowing the user equipment or other devices to correctly parse the data structure. It will be appreciated that multiple series aggregations may be created by the media guidance application and thus multiple instances of data structure <b>200</b> corresponding to each series aggregation may be needed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Data structure <b>200</b> may include field <b>202</b> that may include all episodes of a series aggregation. Field <b>202</b> may include a list of episodes of the series aggregation and may identify each episode using episode identifiers. Field <b>202</b> may be populated with a list of episode identifiers in response to a user's indication of interest to create a series aggregation, as in step <b>102</b> of process <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Episode identifiers for a series aggregation may be acquired from one or more of a service provider, data source, programming source, television distribution facility, or any other data provider, server, or media source (referred to herein collectively as the media sources). Episode identifiers will be discussed in further detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Field <b>202</b> may be organized in the form of a linked list of episode identifiers, an array of episode identifiers, a table of episode identifiers, or any other organization scheme of episode identifiers. It will be appreciated that all fields in data structures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> may be organized using any organization scheme. Field <b>204</b> may include all episodes recorded of the series aggregation. Field <b>206</b> may include all missed episodes of the series aggregation. Field <b>208</b> may include all missed episodes of the series aggregation that are available and/or scheduled for recording. Field <b>210</b> may include all missed episodes of the series aggregation that are unavailable.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The types of features that can be specified by the series aggregation information of data structure <b>200</b> may be more specific or less specific depending on the particular implementation. For example, data structure <b>200</b> may include a field of other episodes in a series that relate to a series aggregation. Looking back to &#x201c;The Sopranos&#x201d; example, if the series aggregation for the data structure is for season <b>1</b> of &#x201c;The Sopranos&#x201d;, this field may include episode identifiers for episodes in seasons 2-4 (i.e., episodes not in the series aggregation). This may be desirable to a user to enable a user to have episodic information for seasons or other groups of episodes for which a user is not currently creating a series aggregation.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When data structure <b>200</b> is created or instantiated for a series aggregation, field <b>204</b> may be empty because the media guidance application may not yet be aware of any episode available to a user. Field <b>206</b> may include all episodes of the series aggregation because the media guidance application considers all episodes when data structure <b>200</b> is created as missed episodes at this point in the process (i.e., step <b>108</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). Field <b>208</b> may also be empty because the media guidance application may not have scheduled any episodes for recording yet or identified any episodes as being available yet. Initially, like field <b>206</b>, field <b>210</b> may include all episodes of the series aggregation because the media guidance application may not have queried yet media sources to see if episodes are available.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When episodes are identified as available to the user (i.e., previously recorded) at step <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, episode identifiers (i.e., unique program IDs) for those episodes may be added to field <b>204</b>. When an episode identifier is added to field <b>204</b>, it may be removed from field <b>206</b> and <b>210</b> because the episode is no longer considered a missed episode or unavailable. In order to determine if an episode is available to a user the media guidance application may acquire episode identifiers for the episodes on the user's storage device (local or remote). The media guidance application may then compare the episode identifiers acquired from the user's storage device with those episode identifiers in field <b>206</b> to determine whether the episodes on the user's storage device are needed for the series aggregation. As will be described in further detail below, for example, in connection with the system description in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-19</figref>, episode identifiers may be stored with the episode on a user's storage device at the time of recording. The episode identifiers may be included in the program guide data for each episode or program and may be available for storage with the episode or in a separate storage location. In other embodiments, episode identifiers may be acquired from one or more of the media sources after the episode is stored on the user's storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When episodes are identified as available for recording at step <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, episode identifiers for those episodes may be added to field <b>208</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and removed from field <b>210</b>. At step <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, episode identifiers may be acquired as part of program information data when querying when one or more of the media sources. The episode identifiers acquired as part of the program information data in step <b>112</b> may be stored as a separate field in data structure <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or may be stored in a separate location in the user's storage device. Episodes may be identified as available for recording if an episode identifier from the program information data matches an episode identifier in field <b>210</b>. It is in response to this determination or match that the episode identifier for the matched episode is added to field <b>208</b> and removed from field <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, field <b>208</b> may include two separate fields: (1) one field for those episodes that may be available for recording, but not scheduled for recording; and (2) one field for those episodes that may be available for recording and scheduled for recording. Episodes may be available for recording, but not scheduled for recording if the episode does not meet certain qualifications. For example, an episode may not be in a desired format (e.g., a user only wants to schedule high-definition programs to be included in the series aggregation and not standard-definition programs). In an embodiment where only one of the described fields is utilized in field <b>208</b>, an episode may only be added to field <b>208</b> if it meets all qualifications. In an embodiment where two fields are utilized for field <b>208</b>, the media guidance application may be able to inform the user of episodes that do not meet all the user or system-specified qualifications. This may be beneficial to a user because a user may choose to record an episode not meeting all of the user's qualifications in order to expedite completion of a series aggregation.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Another example of episodes available but not scheduled for recording may be episodes discussed above, such as premium episodes, like on-demand episodes, pay-per-view (PPV) episodes, DVD episodes, etc. An episode may also be available but not scheduled for recording if a scheduling conflict arises in recording programs. Conflict in scheduling series aggregation episodes and how these conflicts are resolved are discussed in greater detail below, e.g., in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When episodes are recorded at step <b>114</b>, episode identifiers may first be added to field <b>208</b> to indicate they are scheduled for recording and then when they are recorded they may be added to field <b>204</b> and removed from field <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>. When a determination is made as to whether a series aggregation is complete at decision block <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the media guidance application may compare the identifiers in fields <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to determine if they are the same because this may indicate that all episodes of the series aggregation have been recorded. Alternatively, the media guidance application may determine if field <b>206</b> is empty because this may indicate that there are no missed episodes. When a determination is made that a series aggregation is complete at decision block <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the media guidance application may automatically create a DVD locally. For example, once the season of &#x201c;The Sopranos&#x201d; has been recorded locally, the media guidance application may automatically create one or more DVDs for long-term storage, with or without additional payment.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment of information for a missed episode that is organized into illustrative data structure <b>300</b>. Data structure <b>300</b> may be included as episode identifiers or entries in fields <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> of data structure <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Field <b>302</b> may include an episode identifier for a missed episode of the series aggregation that data structure <b>300</b> represents. Episode identifiers may be implemented in any number of ways, including: episode or program identification numbers that include either separately or together with the episode identifier a season identifier; identification by the name of the program, season number of the program, and episode number of the program; or any other implementation of identifying a specific episode of a series aggregation. The episode identifier in field <b>302</b> of data structure <b>300</b> allows user equipment to recognize that the data structure contains episode identifiers, thereby allowing the user equipment or other devices to correctly parse the data structure.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Field <b>304</b> may include information regarding the date, time, and channel a missed episode may be available. The particular broadcast (i.e., by date, time and channel) referred to in field <b>304</b> may be the next available broadcast that meets the user- or media guidance application-specified qualifications. In some embodiments, an episode may be available on different dates, times, and channels so field <b>304</b> may include a list of entries for the missed episode. Including a list of entries for missed episodes in field <b>304</b> may be beneficial for the following reasons. In one example, if a scheduling conflict occurs, having multiple available times to record a program may be beneficial to resolve the conflict. In addition, some of the episodes that match the missed episode identifier may have different characteristics and may be more or less desirable depending on various media guidance application settings. For example, if an episode is available in multiple formats (e.g., high-definition and standard-definition), one of these formats may be more desirable to the user than the others.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments there may be no entries in field <b>304</b> indicating that the missed episode is unavailable. In this situation, data structure <b>200</b> may be used as an identifier in fields <b>206</b> and <b>210</b>. If there are entries in field <b>304</b> indicating that the missed episode is available, data structure <b>200</b> may be used as an identifier in fields <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>. In some embodiments, field <b>304</b> may indicate if a program is available on-demand and thus the date and time aspects of this field may not be necessary. Additionally, field <b>304</b> may also indicate if a particular episode is available for purchase or free of charge.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Field <b>306</b> may indicate the one or media sources from which the missed episode is available. If there are multiple matches in field <b>304</b> for an episode, field <b>306</b> may include corresponding information for each entry in field <b>304</b>. The media sources may include a broadcast provider, satellite provider, cable provider, VOD provider, PPV provider, DVD provider such as Netflix, Blockbuster or any other DVD provider, Internet provider, any server, or any other provider of media. Each entry in field <b>306</b> may include an identifier to the media source that can provide (through broadcast transmission, downloading, mail, etc.) the episode to the user. The identifier to the media source may include an identifier or other information that indicates where the episode is available at that media source to enable acquisition of the episode.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Field <b>308</b> may include format information for each entry in field <b>304</b>. As mentioned above, episodes may be transmitted in standard-definition, high-definition, or in any other available format. Different formats of programming are discussed in greater detail below in connection with the system diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-19</figref>. Various other episode-specific information may also be included as a field in data structure <b>300</b>. Entries in field <b>308</b> may correspond with those entries in field <b>304</b>. Field <b>310</b> may include one or more users or the user equipment's history of a missed episode. For example, as discussed above, the media guidance application may monitor a viewer's viewing history to determine if a viewer has viewed or played an episode. As will be discussed below in greater detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the media guidance application may receive an instruction from the user to not record episodes viewed or played previously with the series aggregation. In this embodiment, this episode may be constructively considered &#x201c;recorded&#x201d; and its episode identifier may be removed from field <b>206</b> and added to field <b>204</b> even though the episode may not actually be recorded. Other approaches for resolving this problem using the data structures may be implemented, but, generally speaking, this approach may enable the series aggregation to be completed in accordance with the user's settings (i.e., to not record episodes the user has already viewed or played).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The types of features that can be specified by the series aggregation information of data structure <b>300</b> may be more specific or less specific depending on the particular implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an embodiment of information for a recorded episode that is organized into illustrative data structure <b>400</b>. Data structure <b>400</b> may be included as episode identifiers or entries in field <b>402</b> of data structure <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Field <b>402</b> may include an episode identifier for a recorded episode of the series aggregation that data structure <b>400</b> represents. The episode identifier in field <b>402</b> of data structure <b>400</b> allows user equipment to recognize that the data structure contains episode identifiers, thereby allowing the user equipment or other devices to correctly parse the data structure. Field <b>404</b> may include information regarding the media source in which the episode of the series aggregation is stored. For example, the episode may be stored on a storage device on a home network, on a local server, on a remote server, or any other storage device. Storage of episodes will be discussed in greater detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-19</figref>. The information about where the episode is stored on the media source may include an identifier or other information that indicates where the episode is available at that media source. Fields <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> are similar to fields <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> of data structure <b>300</b> and their description applies equally to data structure <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As described above at step <b>116</b> of process <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, the media guidance application can inform a user that a series aggregation is complete. Further details regarding the use of data structures <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, and <b>400</b> in accessing a series aggregation when it is complete are discussed in further detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The types of features that can be specified by the series aggregation information of data structure <b>400</b> may be more specific or less specific depending on the particular implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-13</figref> show illustrative display screens that may be used to implement the systems and methods of the present invention. Some of these illustrative display screens (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-11</figref>) provide a user with an opportunity to create a series aggregation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows illustrative program listings display screen <b>500</b> that displays program listings.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Display screen <b>500</b> includes program listings organized by channel, time, or any other suitable category. Display screen <b>500</b> includes program listing <b>504</b> as an exemplary program listing. Program listing <b>504</b> includes scheduled aggregation icon <b>506</b> to indicate that an episode that is identified in that listing is scheduled to be recorded as part of a series aggregation. Scheduled aggregation icon <b>506</b> may be displayed for a particular episode, for example, when a user has selected that episode to be included as part of a series aggregation at step <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A program listing may include a canceled aggregation priority icon <b>508</b> to indicate that the episode that was scheduled to be part of a series aggregation may not be recorded due to a conflict that the media guidance application resolved by canceling the scheduled recording based on aggregation priorities. Various icons may be included as part of display screen <b>500</b> to indicate an episode's status as part of a series aggregation by accessing program guide information and/or the data structures of, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.

In some embodiments the options in display screen <b>700</b> may be displayed as an overlay over the screen from which the user selected to create the series aggregation (e.g., while watching a TV program, from a grid guide, a search results display screen, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A user may move highlight window <b>712</b> over any of these options and press a remote control OK button to select the option. For example, in response to a user selection of season setup option <b>702</b>, the media guidance application may allow the user to select which season or seasons should be included in a series aggregation (see step <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The season or seasons selected may identify the episodes of the selected series to be included in the series aggregation as shown, for example, in step <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A user may also select to search for an episode. For example, the media guidance application may allow the user to select to search descriptions, reviews or any other information using a keyword or keywords. The media guidance application may also make available collateral material about a series or episode that the user is searching for. The user may also select to search for episodes or series that might be of interest. For example, the media guidance application may, in response to a user selection to set up a series aggregation for a season of &#x201c;Seinfeld&#x201d;, display a display screen which may inform the user, &#x201c;If you like Seinfeld, you may also like Curb Your Enthusiasm.&#x201d;</p>

<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Programming sources <b>1402</b> (or media sources) may be any suitable sources of television and music programming, such as television broadcasters (e.g., NBC, ABC, and HBO) or other television or music production studios. Programming sources <b>1402</b> may provide television programming in a variety of formats in high definition and standard definition, such as, for example, 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i, and any other suitable format.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Distribution facility <b>1404</b> may be a cable system headend, a satellite television distribution facility, a television broadcaster, or any other suitable facility for distributing video media (e.g., television programs, video-on-demand programs, pay-per-view programs) and audio media (e.g., music programming and music clips) to the equipment of subscribers of the corresponding cable, satellite, Internet or IPTV system. In some approaches, distribution facility <b>1404</b> may also distribute series program episodes and other media to users, such as video and audio clips, web pages, and interactive applications, that may be offered to subscribers of a given cable, satellite, Internet or IPTV system. Distribution facility <b>1404</b> may be any of the one or more media sources described herein, such as VOD provider, broadcast provider, Internet provider, or any other media source. There are typically numerous television distribution facilities <b>1404</b> in system <b>1400</b>, but only one is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Distribution facility <b>1404</b> may be connected to various user equipment devices <b>1408</b>, <b>1410</b>, and <b>1412</b>. Such user equipment devices may be located, for example, in the homes of users. User equipment devices may include user television equipment <b>1410</b>, user computer equipment <b>1412</b>, or any other type of user equipment suitable for accessing media. User equipment <b>1108</b> may be any type of user equipment (e.g., user television equipment, user computer equipment, cellular phones, handheld video players, gaming platforms, etc.) and, for simplicity, user equipment devices may be referred to generally as user equipment <b>1408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">User equipment devices <b>1408</b>, <b>1410</b>, and <b>1412</b> may receive media (such as television, music, web pages, etc.), series program episodes, and other data from distribution facility <b>1404</b> over communications paths, such as communications paths <b>1414</b>, <b>1416</b>, and <b>1418</b>, respectively. User equipment devices <b>1408</b>, <b>1410</b>, <b>1412</b> may also transmit signals to distribution facility <b>1404</b> over paths <b>1414</b>, <b>1416</b>, and <b>1418</b>, respectively. Paths <b>1414</b>, <b>1416</b>, and <b>1418</b> may be cables or other wired connections, free-space connections (e.g., for broadcast or other wireless signals), satellite links, or any other suitable link or combination of links.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A second approach illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> by which media and media guidance are provided to end users is a non-television-centric approach. In this approach media such as video (which may include television programming), audio, images, web pages, or a suitable combination thereof, are provided to equipment of a plurality of users (e.g., user equipment <b>1408</b>, user television equipment <b>1410</b>, and user computer equipment <b>1412</b>) by server <b>1430</b> via communications network <b>1426</b>. This approach is non-television-centric because media (e.g., television programming) is provided by and delivered at least partially, and sometimes exclusively, via equipment that have not traditionally been primarily focused on the television viewing experience. For example, episodes desired by a user to be in a series aggregation may be provided by the Internet. Non-television-centric equipment is playing a larger role in the television viewing experience.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some embodiments for this approach, communications network <b>1426</b> is the Internet. Thus a missed episode desired by a user to be included in a series aggregation may be downloaded from the Internet. Server <b>1430</b> may provide for example a web site that is accessible to the user's equipment and provides an online guidance application for the user. In such approaches, the user's equipment may be, for example, a PC or a hand-held device such as a PDA or web-enabled cellular telephone that incorporates a web browser. In other embodiments, server <b>1430</b> uses the Internet as a transmission medium but does not use the Web. In such approaches, the user's equipment may run a client application that enables the user to access media. In still other approaches, communications network <b>1426</b> is a private communications network, such as a cellular phone network, that does not include the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In yet other approaches, communications network <b>1426</b> includes a private communications network and the Internet. For example, a cellular telephone or other mobile-device service provider may provide Internet access to its subscribers via a private communications network, or may provide media such as video clips or television programs to its subscribers via the Internet and its own network.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The aforementioned approaches for providing media may, in some embodiments, be combined. For example, a distribution facility <b>1404</b> may provide a television-centric media delivery system, while also providing users' equipment (e.g., <b>1408</b>, <b>1410</b> and <b>1412</b>) with access to other non-television-centric delivery systems provided by server <b>1430</b>. For example, a user's equipment may include a web-enabled set-top box or a television enabled PC. Distribution facility <b>1404</b> may, in addition to television and music programming, provide the user with Internet access whereby the user may access server <b>1430</b> via communications network <b>1426</b>. Distribution facility <b>1404</b> may communicate with communications network <b>1426</b> over any suitable path <b>1434</b>, such as a wired path, a cable path, fiber-optic path, satellite path, or combination of such paths.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Media guidance applications may be provided using any approach suitable for the type of media and distribution system for which the applications are used. Media guidance applications may be, for example, stand-alone applications implemented on users' equipment. In other embodiments, media guidance applications may be client-server applications where only the client resides on the users' equipment. For example, media guidance applications may be implemented partially as a client application on control circuitry on a user's equipment (e.g., control circuitry <b>1902</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> discussed below), and partially on a remote server as a server application (e.g., server <b>1440</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> discussed below). The control circuitry may be configured to receive an indication of interest from a user to create a series aggregation of selected episodes of a series. The control circuitry may then transmit the indication to a remote server. The remote server may then collect episodes of the series, and organize the episodes in the order in which they were originally made available. The control circuitry may then receive from the remote server data indicating the collected and organized episodes.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In still other embodiments, guidance applications may be provided as web sites accessed by a browser implemented on the users' equipment. In such online embodiments, control circuitry may transmit the indication of interest as, for example, a POST command, and the data indicating the collected and organized episodes may be received in a web page. Whatever the chosen implementation, the guidance application will require information about the media for which it is providing guidance. For example, titles or names of media, brief descriptions, episode identifiers, or other information may be necessary to allow users to navigate among and find desired media selections.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some television-centric embodiments, for example, the guidance application may be a stand-alone interactive television program guide that receives program guide data via a data feed (e.g., a continuous feed, trickle feed, or data in the vertical blanking interval of a channel). Data source <b>1420</b> in system <b>1400</b> may include a program listings database that is used to provide the user with television program-related information such as scheduled broadcast times, titles, channels, ratings information (e.g., parental ratings and critic's ratings), detailed title descriptions, genre or category information (e.g., sports, news, movies, etc.), program format (e.g., standard definition, high definition), episode identifiers (such as those used in data structures <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, respectively), and information on actors and actresses. Data source <b>1420</b> may also be used to provide series program episodes, advertisements (e.g., program guide advertisements and advertisements for other interactive television applications), real-time data such as sports scores, stock quotes, news data, and weather data, application data for one or more media guidance applications or other interactive applications, and any other suitable data for use by system <b>1400</b> in display screens <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>900</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1100</b>, <b>1200</b>, <b>1300</b>, or any other display screen. As another example, data source <b>1420</b> may provide data indicating the types of information that may be included in interactive media guidance overlays (e.g., at the request of the user, absent user modification, etc.). The interactive media guidance application may query one or more media sources to perform step <b>108</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by querying data from data source <b>1420</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, programming sources <b>1402</b>, servers or other equipment, such as server <b>1430</b>, service providers such as service provider <b>1442</b>, distribution facility <b>1404</b>, a device in the home network <b>1413</b>, user equipment <b>1408</b>, <b>1410</b> or <b>1412</b>, or any other suitable media source.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Program guide data, including episode identifiers (such as those of data structures <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, respectively), may be provided to user equipment, including user equipment located on home network <b>1413</b>, using any suitable approach. For example, program schedule data and other data may be provided to the user equipment on a television channel sideband, in the vertical blanking interval of a television channel, using an in-band digital signal, using an out-of-band digital signal, or by any other suitable data transmission technique. Program schedule data and other data may be provided to user equipment on multiple analog or digital television channels. Program schedule data and other data may be provided to the user equipment with any suitable frequency (e.g., continuously, daily, in response to a request from user equipment, etc.). The frequency by which data is provided may, if desired, be linked to the querying of media sources for information regarding missed episodes (see, e.g., steps <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some television-centric embodiments, guidance data from data source <b>1420</b> may be provided to users' equipment using a client-server approach. For example, a guidance application client residing on the user's equipment may initiate sessions with server <b>1440</b> to obtain guidance data when needed. In some embodiments, the guidance application may initiate sessions with server <b>1440</b> via a home network server (e.g., a server located in home network <b>1413</b> that supports the user equipment devices located in home network <b>1413</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">There may be multiple data sources (such as data source <b>1420</b>) in system <b>1400</b>, although only one data source is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. For example, a separate data source may be associated with each of a plurality of television broadcasters and may provide data that is specific to those broadcasters (e.g., advertisements for future programming of the broadcasters, logo data for displaying broadcasters' logos in program guide display screens, etc.). Data source <b>1420</b> and any other system components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> may be provided using equipment at one or more locations. Systems components are drawn as single boxes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Data source <b>1420</b> may provide data including episode identifiers (such as those of data structures <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) to distribution facility <b>1404</b> over communications path <b>1422</b> for distribution to the associated user equipment and home network <b>1413</b> (discussed below) over paths <b>1414</b>, <b>1416</b>, <b>1418</b>, and <b>1419</b> (e.g., when data source <b>1420</b> is located at a main facility). Communications path <b>1422</b> may be any suitable communications path such as a satellite communications path or other wireless path, a fiber-optic or other wired communications path, a path that supports Internet communications, or other suitable path or combination of such paths.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some television-centric and non-television centric approaches, data source <b>1420</b> may provide guidance data directly to user equipment <b>1408</b> over path <b>1424</b>, communications network <b>1426</b>, and path <b>1428</b> (e.g., when data source <b>1420</b> is located at a facility such as one of programming sources <b>1402</b>). In some embodiments of the present invention, data source <b>1420</b> may provide guidance data directly to user equipment located on home network <b>1413</b> (discussed below) over path <b>1424</b>, communications network <b>1426</b>, and path <b>1439</b> (e.g., when data source <b>1420</b> is located at a facility such as one of programming sources <b>1402</b>). Paths <b>1424</b>, <b>1428</b>, and <b>1439</b> may be wired paths such as telephone lines, cable paths, fiber-optic paths, satellite paths, wireless paths, any other suitable paths or a combination of such paths. Communications network <b>1426</b> may be any suitable communications network, such as the Internet, the public switched telephone network, or a packet-based network.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">User equipment devices, including user equipment devices located on home network <b>1413</b> (discussed below), such as user television equipment and personal computers, may use the program schedule data and other interactive media guidance application data to display program listings and other information (e.g., information on series programs, digital music) for the user. An interactive television program guide application or other suitable interactive media guidance application may be used to display the information on the user's display (e.g., in one or more overlays that are displayed on top of video for a given television channel, such as display screens <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>900</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1100</b>, <b>1200</b>, <b>1300</b>, or any other display screen). Interactive displays may be generated and displayed for the user using any suitable approach. In one suitable approach, distribution facility <b>1404</b>, server <b>1430</b>, or another facility, may generate application display screens and may transmit the display screens to user equipment for display. In another suitable approach, user equipment may store data for use in one or more interactive displays (e.g., program schedule data, advertisements, logos, series program episodes, etc.), and an interactive media guidance application implemented at least partially on the user equipment may generate the interactive displays based on instructions received from distribution facility <b>1404</b>, server <b>1430</b> or another facility. In some embodiments of the present invention, user equipment may store only the data that is used to generate the interactive television displays (e.g., storing series program episode information, storing logo data for a particular television broadcaster only if the logo is to be included in one or more interactive television displays). In some embodiments of the present invention, user equipment may store data that is not necessarily used to generate the interactive television displays (e.g., storing advertisements associated with a particular television broadcaster that may or may not be displayed depending on, for example, the outcome of negotiations with the television broadcaster). Any other suitable approach or combination of approaches may be used to generate and display interactive overlays for the user, such as display screens <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>900</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1100</b>, <b>1200</b>, <b>1300</b>, or any other display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In still other embodiments, interactive media guidance applications (television-centric and non-television centric) may be provided online as, for example, websites. For example, server <b>1430</b> may provide an online interactive television program guide. As another example, user equipment <b>1408</b> may be a mobile device, such as a cellular telephone or personal digital assistant (PDA). The mobile device may be web-enabled to allow the user to access an online guidance application (which may be modified from its original version to make it appropriate for a cellular phone). Alternatively, the mobile device may have an applet that communicates with server <b>1430</b> to obtain guidance data via the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Server <b>1430</b> may receive program schedule data and other data (e.g., series program episode information) from data source <b>1420</b> via communications path <b>1424</b>, communications network <b>1426</b>, and communications path <b>1432</b> or via another suitable path or combination of paths. Path <b>1432</b> may be a satellite path, fiber-optic path, wired path, or any other path or combination of paths. User equipment <b>1408</b> may access the online interactive media guidance application and other sources from server <b>1430</b> via communications path <b>1428</b>. User equipment <b>1408</b> may also access the application and other services on server <b>1430</b> via communications path <b>1414</b>, distribution facility <b>1404</b>, and communications path <b>1434</b>. For example, a cable modem or other suitable equipment may be used by user equipment <b>1408</b> to communicate with distribution facility <b>1404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">User equipment such as user television equipment <b>1410</b>, user computer equipment <b>1412</b>, and user equipment located on home network <b>1413</b> may access the online interactive media guidance application and server <b>1430</b> using similar arrangements. Episodes to be included in a series aggregation may be accessed through such arrangements as well. User television equipment <b>1410</b> may access the online interactive media guidance application and server <b>1430</b> using communications path <b>1436</b> or using path <b>1416</b>, distribution facility <b>1404</b>, and path <b>1434</b>. User computer equipment <b>1412</b> may access the online interactive media guidance application and server <b>1430</b> using communications path <b>1438</b> or using path <b>1418</b>, distribution facility <b>1404</b>, and path <b>1434</b>. User equipment located on home network <b>1413</b> may access the online media guidance application and server <b>1430</b> using communications path <b>1439</b> or using path <b>1419</b>, distribution facility <b>1404</b>, and path <b>1434</b>. Paths <b>1436</b>, <b>1438</b>, and <b>1439</b> may be any suitable paths such as wired paths, cable paths, fiber-optic paths, wireless paths, satellite paths, or a combination of such paths.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In some embodiments, system <b>1400</b> may support other interactive applications in addition to the interactive media guidance applications. Such applications may be implemented using any suitable approach. For example, the interactive applications may be implemented locally on the user equipment or in a distributed fashion (e.g., using a client-server architecture in which the user equipment serves at least partly, and for at least some of the time, as the client and a server, such as server <b>1440</b> at distribution facility <b>1404</b>, server <b>1430</b>, or other suitable equipment acts as the server). Other distributed architectures may also be used if desired. Moreover, some or all of the features of the interactive applications of system <b>1400</b> (including the media guidance application) may be provided using operating system software or middleware software. Such operating system software and middleware may be used instead of or in combination with application-level software. In yet other approaches, interactive applications may also be supported by servers or other suitable equipment at one or more service providers such as service provider <b>1442</b>. Regardless of the particular arrangement used, the software that supports these features may be referred to as an application or applications.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">For example, an interactive application such as a home shopping service may be supported by a service provider such as service provider <b>1442</b> that has sales representatives, order fulfillment facilities, account maintenance facilities, and other equipment for supporting interactive home shopping features. A home shopping application that is implemented using the user equipment may be used to access the service provider to provide such features to the user. The user equipment may access service provider <b>1442</b> via distribution facility <b>1404</b> and communications path <b>1444</b> or via communications network <b>1426</b> and communications path <b>1446</b>. Communications paths such as paths <b>1444</b> and <b>1446</b> may be any suitable paths such as wired paths, cable paths, fiber-optic paths, satellite paths, or a combination of such paths.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Another example of an interactive application is a home banking application. A home banking service may be supported using personnel at facilities such as service provider <b>1442</b>. An interactive home banking application that is implemented using the user equipment may access the home banking service via distribution facility <b>1404</b> and communications path <b>1444</b> or via communications network <b>1426</b> and communications path <b>1446</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">If desired, an interactive media guidance application such as a network-based video recorder or a video-on-demand application may be supported using server <b>1440</b>, server <b>1430</b>, a home network server, or equipment at service provider <b>1442</b>. Video-on-demand content and video recorded using a network-based video recorder arrangement may be stored on server <b>1440</b> or server <b>1430</b> or a home network server or at service provider <b>1442</b> and may be provided to the user equipment when requested by users. An interactive television program guide, for example, may be used to support the functions of a personal video recorder (sometimes called a digital video recorder) that is implemented using user equipment <b>1408</b>. Illustrative equipment that may be used to support personal video recorder functions include specialized personal video recorder devices, integrated receiver decoders (IRDs), set-top boxes with integrated or external hard drives, or personal computers with video recording capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Interactive applications such as media guidance applications (e.g., interactive television program guide applications and video-on-demand applications), home shopping applications, home banking applications, game applications, and other applications (e.g., applications related to e-mail and chat or other communications functions, etc.) may be provided as separate applications that are accessed through a navigation shell application (i.e., a menu application with menu options corresponding to the applications). The features of such applications may be combined. For example, games, video-on-demand services, home shopping services, network-based video recorder functions, personal video recorder functions, navigational functions, program guide functions, communications functions, and other suitable functions may be provided using one application or any other suitable number of applications. The one or more applications may display various overlays on user equipment including, for example, interactive television information on top of video for a given television channel.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Interactive television program guide applications, home banking applications, home shopping applications, network-based video recorder and personal video recorder applications, video-on-demand applications, gaming applications, communications applications, and navigational applications are only a few illustrative examples of the types of interactive media guidance and other applications that may be supported by system <b>1400</b>. Other suitable interactive applications that may be supported include news services, web browsing and other Internet services, and interactive wagering services (e.g., for wagering on horse races, sporting events, and the like). Interactive television overlays that are displayed by these applications may also be customized in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Users may have multiple types of user equipment by which they access media and obtain media guidance. For example, some users may have home networks that are accessed by in-home and mobile devices. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, home network <b>1413</b> communicates with distribution facility <b>1404</b> and server <b>1430</b> over paths <b>1419</b> and <b>1439</b> (and, in the case of server <b>1430</b>, communications network <b>1426</b>). Such home networks <b>1413</b> may be located, for example, in homes of users or distributed, for example, among homes of users. Home networks <b>1413</b> may each include a plurality of interconnected user equipment devices, such as, for example user equipment devices <b>1408</b>, <b>1410</b> and <b>1412</b>. In some embodiments, users may control in-home devices via a media guidance application implemented on a remote device. For example, users may access an online media guidance application on a website via a personal computer at their office, or a mobile device such as a PDA or web-enabled cellular telephone. The user may set settings (e.g., recordings, reminders, or other settings) on the online guidance application to control the user's in-home equipment. The online guide may control the user's equipment directly, or by communicating with a media guidance application on the user's in-home equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-19</figref> show illustrative arrangements for user equipment. An illustrative set-top box-based arrangement for user equipment <b>1410</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. User television equipment <b>1410</b> may be stand-alone or a part of home network <b>1413</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). User television equipment <b>1410</b> may include a recording device <b>1506</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> such as a digital video recorder (e.g., a personal video recorder (PVR)) that uses a hard disk or other storage for recording episodes. Recording device <b>1506</b> may alternatively be a digital video disc recorder, compact disc recorder, video recording device, video recorder, or other suitable recording device (not shown). Equipment <b>1410</b> may also include a television <b>1508</b>. In some embodiments, such as when a user selects to create a series aggregation from high-definition channels, television <b>1208</b> may be HDTV-capable. Input/output <b>1502</b> may be connected to communications paths such as paths <b>1516</b> and <b>1536</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). Input/output functions may be provided by one or more wires or communications paths, but are shown as a single path in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. Television programming, program guide data, episode identifiers (such as those of data structures <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>), and any other suitable interactive media guidance application data or other data may be received using input/output <b>1502</b>. Commands and requests and other data generated as a result of user interactions with the interactive media guidance application may also be transmitted over input/output <b>1502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Set-top box <b>1504</b> may be any suitable analog or digital set-top box (e.g., a cable set-top box). Set-top box <b>1504</b> may contain an analog tuner for tuning to a desired analog television channel (e.g., a channel comprising television programming, interactive television data, or both, to display video for an analog television channel when a user selects to create a series aggregation from an analog television channel), and multiple other tuners may also be provided. Set-top box <b>1504</b> may also contain digital decoding circuitry for receiving digital television channels (e.g., channels comprising television or music programming, interactive television data, series program episode data, etc.). Set-top box <b>1504</b> may also contain a high-definition television tuner for receiving and processing high-definition television channels. Analog, digital, and high-definition channels may be handled together if desired.
