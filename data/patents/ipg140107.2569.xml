<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a method for manufacturing light emitting devices, and more particularly, to a method for manufacturing an LED (light emitting diode), wherein a profile of a light emergent face of the LED can be easily controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a new type of light source, LEDs are widely used in various applications. An LED often includes a base having a cavity defined therein, a pair of leads fixed in the base, a light emitting chip received in the cavity to electrically connect the two leads, and an encapsulant filling the cavity to seal the chip. Typically, the encapsulant is formed in the cavity by injecting an encapsulation liquid into the cavity and then heating the liquid to become cured and solid. Thus, the encapsulant becomes rigid to form a light emergent face with a predetermined shape. However, during conversion from liquid to solid, the encapsulant contracts, whereby the light emergent face is recessed. Thus, a concave light emergent face is naturally formed after the encapsulant is cured. The concave degree of the concave light emergent face is difficult to control whereby the concave light emergent face affects the light emergent angle of the LED and causes the light distribution of the LED becoming undesirable. If too much encapsulation liquid is injected into the cavity, a convex light emergent face is formed; like the naturally formed concave light emergent face, the convex degree of the naturally formed convex light emergent is difficult to control, whereby the convex emergent face also undesirably affects the optical characteristics of the LED.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">What is needed, therefore, is a method for manufacturing an LED which can overcome the limitations described above.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>, a method for manufacturing an LED <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is shown. The method mainly includes several steps as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Firstly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, a base <b>10</b> with two leads <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> (i.e., a rear lead <b>21</b> and a front lead <b>22</b>) is provided. The base <b>10</b> may be made of a single monolithic piece of epoxy, silicon or other suitable electrically insulative materials. The base <b>10</b> defines a cavity <b>11</b> in a top face thereof. The cavity <b>11</b> is circular and located at a central area of the top face of the base <b>10</b>. An inner circumferential face <b>12</b> of the base <b>10</b> defining the cavity <b>11</b> is a part of a periphery of a cone. Two holes <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> (i.e., a left hole <b>13</b> and a right hole <b>14</b>) are defined in a left face and a right face of the base <b>10</b>, respectively. The two holes <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> are aligned with each other. Each hole <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> is semicircular and recesses from the top face of the base <b>10</b> to form a top opening (not labeled). Each hole <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> also communicates the cavity <b>11</b> with an outside environment. The two leads <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are inserted into the base <b>10</b> from a front face and a rear face of the base <b>10</b>, respectively. The two leads <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> have inner ends (not labeled) exposed within a bottom of the cavity <b>11</b> and facing each other, and outer ends extending outwardly beyond the base <b>10</b>. The two inner ends of the leads <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are insulated from each other via a spacer <b>23</b>. The two leads <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> may be made of metal or other suitable electrically conductive materials.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A light emitting chip <b>30</b> is then fixed in the cavity <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The light emitting chip <b>30</b> may be made of semiconductor materials such as GaN, InGaN, AlInGaN. The light emitting chip <b>30</b> emits light when being electrified. The light emitting chip <b>30</b> is attached on a top face of the inner end of the rear lead <b>21</b>. Two wires <b>31</b> connect the light emitting chip <b>30</b> with the two inner ends of the two leads <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>. The two holes <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> are located higher than the light emitting chip <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A cover <b>40</b> is further placed on the base <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>. The cover <b>40</b> may be made of transparent materials such as glass, silicone or the like. The cover <b>40</b> has a profile similar to the top face of the base <b>10</b>. The cover <b>40</b> is attached on the top face of the base <b>10</b> to cover the cavity <b>11</b> and the top openings of the two holes <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. The attachment of the cover <b>40</b> to the top face of the base <b>10</b> may be achieved by gluing. The cavity <b>11</b> can only communicate with the outside environment through the two holes <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> after the cover <b>40</b> is attached on the base <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an encapsulation fluid <b>60</b> is filled in the cavity <b>11</b>. The encapsulation fluid <b>60</b> may be made of transparent materials such epoxy or silicone. The encapsulation fluid <b>60</b> is injected into the cavity <b>11</b> through the right hole <b>14</b>. During injection of the encapsulation fluid <b>60</b> into the cavity <b>11</b>, air <b>70</b> in the cavity <b>11</b> is gradually expelled by the encapsulation fluid <b>60</b> to exit the cavity <b>11</b> from the left hole <b>13</b>. After the air <b>70</b> in the cavity <b>11</b> is fully exhausted from the cavity <b>11</b>, the encapsulation liquid <b>60</b> is substantially filled in the whole cavity <b>11</b> and contacts a bottom face of the cover <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, the two holes <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> are defined in the base <b>10</b> to act an encapsulation liquid inlet and an air outlet, respectively. Alternatively, only one hole can be defined in the base <b>10</b> to simultaneously act as the encapsulation liquid inlet and the air outlet if the hole is large enough.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Finally, the encapsulation liquid <b>60</b> in the cavity <b>11</b> is cured under a temperature ranging between 100 to 200 degrees centigrade. The cured encapsulation liquid <b>11</b> becomes rigid to form an encapsulant <b>50</b> in the cavity <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The encapsulant <b>50</b> fills the two holes <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> to seal the two holes <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. The encapsulant <b>50</b> has a refractive index larger than that of the cover <b>40</b>. The encapsulant <b>50</b> has a hardness less than that of the cover <b>40</b>. Since the encapsulation liquid <b>60</b> keeps joining the bottom face of the cover <b>40</b> during heating, the encapsulant <b>50</b> does not form any gap in an interface between the encapsulant <b>50</b> and the cover <b>40</b>. Therefore, the light emergent from the encapsulant <b>50</b> and the cover <b>40</b> can maintain its predetermined orientation, and the light distribution of the LED <b>100</b> will not be affected.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the bottom face of the cover <b>40</b> is flat and a top face of the cover <b>40</b> which functions as a light emergent face of the LED <b>100</b> is also flat. Alternatively, the cover <b>40</b> can also be changed to have other shapes. For example, the cover <b>40</b> may have a flat bottom face and an upwardly curved (convex) top face, or a downwardly curved bottom face and a flat top face, or a flat bottom face and a concave top face, depending on the actual requirements. Since the cover <b>40</b> can be easily machined or molded, the convex degree or the concave degree of the top face or bottom face thereof can be easily controlled; thus, the cover <b>40</b> will not unfavorably affect the optical characteristics of the LED <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is believed that the present disclosure and its advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the examples hereinbefore described merely being preferred or exemplary embodiments.</p>
