<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to functionalized polymers and methods for their manufacture.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the art of manufacturing tires, it is desirable to employ rubber vulcanizates that demonstrate reduced hysteresis, i.e., less loss of mechanical energy to heat. For example, rubber vulcanizates that show reduced hysteresis are advantageously employed in tire components, such as sidewalls and treads, to yield tires having desirably low rolling resistance. The hysteresis of a rubber vulcanizate is often attributed to the free polymer chain ends within the crosslinked rubber network, as well as the dissociation of filler agglomerates.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Functionalized polymers have been employed to reduce the hysteresis of rubber vulcanizates. The functional group of the functionalized polymer may reduce the number of free polymer chain ends via interaction with filler particles. Also, the functional group may reduce filler agglomeration. Nevertheless, whether a particular functional group imparted to a polymer can reduce hysteresis is often unpredictable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Functionalized polymers may be prepared by post-polymerization treatment of reactive polymers with certain functionalizing agents. However, whether a reactive polymer can be functionalized by treatment with a particular functionalizing agent can be unpredictable. For example, functionalizing agents that work for one type of polymer do not necessarily work for another type of polymer, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Lanthanide-based catalyst systems are known to be useful for polymerizing conjugated diene monomers to form polydienes having a high content of cis-1,4 linkage. The resulting cis-1,4-polydienes may display pseudo-living characteristics in that, upon completion of the polymerization, some of the polymer chains possess reactive ends that can react with certain functionalizing agents to yield functionalized cis-1,4-polydienes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The cis-1,4-polydienes produced with lanthanide-based catalyst systems typically have a linear backbone, which is believed to provide better tensile properties, higher abrasion resistance, lower hysteresis, and better fatigue resistance as compared to the cis-1,4-polydienes prepared with other catalyst systems such as titanium-, cobalt-, and nickel-based catalyst systems. Therefore, the cis-1,4-polydienes made with lanthanide-based catalysts are particularly suitable for use in tire components such as sidewalls and treads. However, one disadvantage of the cis-1,4-polydienes prepared with lanthanide-based catalysts is that the polymers exhibit high cold flow due to their linear backbone structure. The high cold flow causes problems during storage and transport of the polymers and also hinders the use of automatic feeding equipment in rubber compound mixing facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Because functionalized polymers are advantageous, especially in the manufacture of tires, there exists a need to develop new functionalized polymers that give reduced hysteresis and reduced cold flow.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, a reactive polymer is prepared by polymerizing conjugated diene monomer with a coordination catalyst, and this reactive polymer can then be functionalized by reaction with a nitroso compound. The resultant functionalized polymers can be used in the manufacture of tire components. In one or more embodiments, the resultant functionalized polymers, which include cis-1,4-polydienes, exhibit advantageous cold-flow resistance and provide tire components that exhibit advantageously low hysteresis.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Examples of conjugated diene monomer include 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 1,3-pentadiene, 1,3-hexadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 2-ethyl-1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 3-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, and 2,4-hexadiene. Mixtures of two or more conjugated dienes may also be utilized in copolymerization.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one or more embodiments, the reactive polymer is prepared by coordination polymerization, wherein monomer is polymerized by using a coordination catalyst system. The key mechanistic features of coordination polymerization have been discussed in books (e.g., Kuran, W., <i>Principles of Coordination Polymerization</i>; John Wiley &#x26; Sons: New York, 2001) and review articles (e.g., Mulhaupt, R., <i>Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics </i>2003, volume 204, pages 289-327). Coordination catalysts are believed to initiate the polymerization of monomer by a mechanism that involves the coordination or complexation of monomer to an active metal center prior to the insertion of monomer into a growing polymer chain. An advantageous feature of coordination catalysts is their ability to provide stereochemical control of polymerizations and thereby produce stereoregular polymers. As is known in the art, there are numerous methods for creating coordination catalysts, but all methods eventually generate an active intermediate that is capable of coordinating with monomer and inserting monomer into a covalent bond between an active metal center and a growing polymer chain. The coordination polymerization of conjugated dienes is believed to proceed via &#x3c0;-allyl complexes as intermediates. Coordination catalysts can be one-, two-, three- or multi-component systems. In one or more embodiments, a coordination catalyst may be formed by combining a heavy metal compound (e.g., a transition metal compound or a lanthanide compound), an alkylating agent (e.g., an organoaluminum compound), and optionally other co-catalyst components (e.g., a Lewis acid or a Lewis base). In one or more embodiments, the heavy metal compound may be referred to as a coordinating metal compound.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Various procedures can be used to prepare coordination catalysts. In one or more embodiments, a coordination catalyst may be formed in situ by separately adding the catalyst components to the monomer to be polymerized in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. In other embodiments, a coordination catalyst may be preformed. That is, the catalyst components are pre-mixed outside the polymerization system either in the absence of any monomer or in the presence of a small amount of monomer. The resulting preformed catalyst composition may be aged, if desired, and then added to the monomer that is to be polymerized.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Useful coordination catalyst systems include lanthanide-based catalyst systems. These catalyst systems may advantageously produce cis-1,4-polydienes that, prior to quenching, have reactive chain ends and may be referred to as pseudo-living polymers. While other coordination catalyst systems may also be employed, lanthanide-based catalysts have been found to be particularly advantageous, and therefore, without limiting the scope of the present invention, will be discussed in greater detail.</p>

In one or more embodiments, the halogen/Ln molar ratio can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 20:1, in other embodiments from about 1:1 to about 10:1, and in other embodiments from about 2:1 to about 6:1.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The lanthanide-based catalyst composition can be formed by various methods.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, the lanthanide-based catalyst composition may be formed in situ by adding the catalyst ingredients to a solution containing monomer and solvent, or to bulk monomer, in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. In one embodiment, the alkylating agent can be added first, followed by the lanthanide compound, and then followed by the halogen-containing compound, if used, or by the compound containing a non-coordinating anion or the non-coordinating anion precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In another embodiment, the lanthanide-based catalyst composition may be preformed. That is, the catalyst ingredients are pre-mixed outside the polymerization system either in the absence of any monomer or in the presence of a small amount of at least one conjugated diene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which may be from about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. to about 80&#xb0; C. The amount of conjugated diene monomer that may be used for preforming the catalyst can range from about 1 to about 500 moles, in other embodiments from about 5 to about 250 moles, and in other embodiments from about 10 to about 100 moles per mole of the lanthanide compound. The resulting catalyst composition may be aged, if desired, prior to being added to the monomer that is to be polymerized.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In yet another embodiment, the lanthanide-based catalyst composition may be formed by using a two-stage procedure. The first stage may involve combining the alkylating agent with the lanthanide compound either in the absence of any monomer or in the presence of a small amount of at least one conjugated diene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which may be from about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. to about 80&#xb0; C. The amount of monomer employed in the first stage may be similar to that set forth above for performing the catalyst. In the second stage, the mixture formed in the first stage and the halogen-containing compound, non-coordinating anion, or non-coordinating anion precursor can be charged in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner to the monomer that is to be polymerized.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one or more embodiments, a solvent may be employed as a carrier to either dissolve or suspend the catalyst in order to facilitate the delivery of the catalyst to the polymerization system. In other embodiments, monomer can be used as the carrier. In yet other embodiments, the catalyst can be used in their neat state without any solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one or more embodiments, suitable solvents include those organic compounds that will not undergo polymerization or incorporation into propagating polymer chains during the polymerization of monomer in the presence of the catalyst. In one or more embodiments, these organic species are liquid at ambient temperature and pressure. In one or more embodiments, these organic solvents are inert to the catalyst. Exemplary organic solvents include hydrocarbons with a low or relatively low boiling point such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Non-limiting examples of aromatic hydrocarbons include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, and mesitylene. Non-limiting examples of aliphatic hydrocarbons include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isopentanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, and petroleum spirits. And, non-limiting examples of cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, and methylcyclohexane. Mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. As is known in the art, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons may be desirably employed for environmental reasons. The low-boiling hydrocarbon solvents are typically separated from the polymer upon completion of the polymerization.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Other examples of organic solvents include high-boiling hydrocarbons of high molecular weights, such as paraffinic oil, aromatic oil, or other hydrocarbon oils that are commonly used to oil-extend polymers. Since these hydrocarbons are non-volatile, they typically do not require separation and remain incorporated in the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The production of the reactive polymer according to this invention can be accomplished by polymerizing conjugated diene monomer in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of the coordination catalyst. The introduction of the catalyst, the conjugated diene monomer, and any solvent, if employed, forms a polymerization mixture in which the reactive polymer is formed. The amount of the catalyst to be employed may depend on the interplay of various factors such as the type of catalyst employed, the purity of the ingredients, the polymerization temperature, the polymerization rate and conversion desired, the molecular weight desired, and many other factors. Accordingly, a specific catalyst amount cannot be definitively set forth except to say that catalytically effective amounts of the catalyst may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one or more embodiments, the amount of the coordinating metal compound (e.g., a lanthanide compound) used can be varied from about 0.001 to about 2 mmol, in other embodiments from about 0.005 to about 1 mmol, and in still other embodiments from about 0.01 to about 0.2 mmol per 100 gram of monomer.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one or more embodiments, the polymerization may be carried out in a polymerization system that includes a substantial amount of solvent. In one embodiment, a solution polymerization system may be employed in which both the monomer to be polymerized and the polymer formed are soluble in the solvent. In another embodiment, a precipitation polymerization system may be employed by choosing a solvent in which the polymer formed is insoluble. In both cases, an amount of solvent in addition to the amount of solvent that may be used in preparing the catalyst is usually added to the polymerization system. The additional solvent may be the same as or different from the solvent used in preparing the catalyst. Exemplary solvents have been set forth above. In one or more embodiments, the solvent content of the polymerization mixture may be more than 20% by weight, in other embodiments more than 50% by weight, and in still other embodiments more than 80% by weight based on the total weight of the polymerization mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In other embodiments, the polymerization system employed may be generally considered a bulk polymerization system that includes substantially no solvent or a minimal amount of solvent. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the benefits of bulk polymerization processes (i.e., processes where monomer acts as the solvent), and therefore the polymerization system includes less solvent than will deleteriously impact the benefits sought by conducting bulk polymerization. In one or more embodiments, the solvent content of the polymerization mixture may be less than about 20% by weight, in other embodiments less than about 10% by weight, and in still other embodiments less than about 5% by weight based on the total weight of the polymerization mixture. In another embodiment, the polymerization mixture contains no solvents other than those that are inherent to the raw materials employed. In still another embodiment, the polymerization mixture is substantially devoid of solvent, which refers to the absence of that amount of solvent that would otherwise have an appreciable impact on the polymerization process. Polymerization systems that are substantially devoid of solvent may be referred to as including substantially no solvent. In particular embodiments, the polymerization mixture is devoid of solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The polymerization may be conducted in any conventional polymerization vessels known in the art. In one or more embodiments, solution polymerization can be conducted in a conventional stirred-tank reactor. In other embodiments, bulk polymerization can be conducted in a conventional stirred-tank reactor, especially if the monomer conversion is less than about 60%. In still other embodiments, especially where the monomer conversion in a bulk polymerization process is higher than about 60%, which typically results in a highly viscous cement, the bulk polymerization may be conducted in an elongated reactor in which the viscous cement under polymerization is driven to move by piston, or substantially by piston. For example, extruders in which the cement is pushed along by a self-cleaning single-screw or double-screw agitator are suitable for this purpose. Examples of useful bulk polymerization processes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,351,776, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one or more embodiments, all of the ingredients used for the polymerization can be combined within a single vessel (e.g., a conventional stirred-tank reactor), and all steps of the polymerization process can be conducted within this vessel. In other embodiments, two or more of the ingredients can be pre-combined in one vessel and then transferred to another vessel where the polymerization of monomer (or at least a major portion thereof) may be conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The polymerization can be carried out as a batch process, a continuous process, or a semi-continuous process. In the semi-continuous process, the monomer is intermittently charged as needed to replace that monomer already polymerized. In one or more embodiments, the conditions under which the polymerization proceeds may be controlled to maintain the temperature of the polymerization mixture within a range from about &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C., in other embodiments from about 0&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C., and in other embodiments from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C. In one or more embodiments, the heat of polymerization may be removed by external cooling by a thermally controlled reactor jacket, internal cooling by evaporation and condensation of the monomer through the use of a reflux condenser connected to the reactor, or a combination of the two methods. Also, the polymerization conditions may be controlled to conduct the polymerization under a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere to about 50 atmospheres, in other embodiments from about 0.5 atmosphere to about 20 atmosphere, and in other embodiments from about 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres. In one or more embodiments, the pressures at which the polymerization may be carried out include those that ensure that the majority of the monomer is in the liquid phase. In these or other embodiments, the polymerization mixture may be maintained under anaerobic conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Some or all of the resulting polymer chains may possess reactive ends before the polymerization mixture is quenched. As noted above, the reactive polymer prepared with a coordination catalyst may be referred to as a pseudo-living polymer. In one or more embodiments, a polymerization mixture including reactive polymer may be referred to as an active polymerization mixture. The percentage of polymer chains possessing a reactive end depends on various factors such as the type of catalyst, the type of monomer, the purity of the ingredients, the polymerization temperature, the monomer conversion, and many other factors. In one or more embodiments, at least about 20% of the polymer chains possess a reactive end, in other embodiments at least about 50% of the polymer chains possess a reactive end, and in still other embodiments at least about 80% of the polymer chains possess a reactive end. In any event, the reactive polymer can be reacted with nitroso compounds to form the functionalized polymer of this invention.</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The amount of the co-functionalizing agent that can be added to the polymerization mixture may depend on various factors including the type and amount of catalyst used to synthesize the reactive polymer and the desired degree of functionalization. In one or more embodiments, where the reactive polymer is prepared by employing a lanthanide-based catalyst, the amount of the co-functionalizing agent employed can be described with reference to the lanthanide metal of the lanthanide compound. For example, the molar ratio of the co-functionalizing agent to the lanthanide metal may be from about 1:1 to about 200:1, in other embodiments from about 5:1 to about 150:1, and in other embodiments from about 10:1 to about 100:1.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The amount of the co-functionalizing agent employed can also be described with reference to the nitroso compound. In one or more embodiments, the molar ratio of the co-functionalizing agent to the nitroso compound may be from about 0.05:1 to about 1:1, in other embodiments from about 0.1:1 to about 0.8:1, and in other embodiments from about 0.2:1 to about 0.6:1</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In one or more embodiments, the nitroso compound (and optionally the co-functionalizing agent) may be introduced to the polymerization mixture at a location (e.g., within a vessel) where the polymerization has been conducted. In other embodiments, the nitroso compound may be introduced to the polymerization mixture at a location that is distinct from where the polymerization has taken place. For example, the nitroso compound may be introduced to the polymerization mixture in downstream vessels including downstream reactors or tanks, in-line reactors or mixers, extruders, or devolatilizers.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In one or more embodiments, the nitroso compound (and optionally the co-functionalizing agent) can be reacted with the reactive polymer after a desired monomer conversion is achieved but before the polymerization mixture is quenched by a quenching agent. In one or more embodiments, the reaction between the nitroso compound and the reactive polymer may take place within 30 minutes, in other embodiments within 5 minutes, and in other embodiments within one minute after the peak polymerization temperature is reached. In one or more embodiments, the reaction between the nitroso compound and the reactive polymer can occur once the peak polymerization temperature is reached. In other embodiments, the reaction between the nitroso compound and the reactive polymer can occur after the reactive polymer has been stored. In one or more embodiments, the storage of the reactive polymer occurs at room temperature or below under an inert atmosphere. In one or more embodiments, the reaction between the nitroso compound and the reactive polymer may take place at a temperature from about 10&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C., and in other embodiments from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C. The time required for completing the reaction between the nitroso compound and the reactive polymer depends on various factors such as the type and amount of the catalyst used to prepare the reactive polymer, the type and amount of the nitroso compound, as well as the temperature at which the functionalization reaction is conducted. In one or more embodiments, the reaction between the nitroso compound and the reactive polymer can be conducted for about 10 to 60 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In one or more embodiments, after the reaction between the reactive polymer and the nitroso compound (and optionally the co-functionalizing agent) has been accomplished or completed, a quenching agent can be added to the polymerization mixture in order to protonate the reaction product between the reactive polymer and the nitroso compound, inactivate any residual reactive polymer chains, and/or inactivate the catalyst or catalyst components. The quenching agent may include a protic compound, which includes, but is not limited to, an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, an inorganic acid, water, or a mixture thereof. An antioxidant such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol may be added along with, before, or after the addition of the quenching agent. The amount of the antioxidant employed may be in the range of 0.2% to 1% by weight of the polymer product.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In other embodiments, before the polymerization mixture is quenched with a quenching agent, the reaction product between the reactive polymer and the nitroso compound is further reacted with an electrophilic reagent. Useful electrophilic reagents include those that can be defined by the formula R&#x2014;X, where R is a mono-valent organic group, and X is a halogen atom, a sulfonate group, or a thiosulfonate group. Exemplary halogen atoms include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine atoms. Exemplary sulfonate groups include methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and trifluoromethanesulfonate groups. Exemplary thiosulfonate groups include methanethiosulfonate, benzenethiosulfonate, p-toluenethiosulfonate, and trifluoromethanethiosulfonate groups.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Specific examples of useful electrophilic reagents include methyl chloride, methyl bromide, methyl iodide, trimethylsilyl chloride, trimethylsilyl bromide, trimethylsilyl iodide, methyl methanesulfonate, methyl benzenesulfonate, methyl p-toluenesulfonate, methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, methyl methanethiosulfonate, trimethylsilyl methanesulfonate, trimethylsilyl benzenesulfonate, trimethylsilyl p-toluenesulfonate, trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, and trimethylsilyl methanethiosulfonate.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">When the reaction involving the electrophilic reagent has been completed, a quenching agent and/or an antioxidant may be added to the polymerization mixture, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Once the polymerization mixture has been quenched, the various constituents of the polymerization mixture may be recovered. In one or more embodiments, the unreacted monomer can be recovered from the polymerization mixture. For example, the monomer can be distilled from the polymerization mixture by using techniques known in the art. In one or more embodiments, a devolatilizer may be employed to remove the monomer from the polymerization mixture. Once the monomer has been removed from the polymerization mixture, the monomer may be purified, stored, and/or recycled back to the polymerization process.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The polymer product may be recovered from the polymerization mixture by using techniques known in the art. In one or more embodiments, desolventization and drying techniques may be used. For instance, the polymer can be recovered by passing the polymerization mixture through a heated screw apparatus, such as a desolventizing extruder, in which the volatile substances are removed by evaporation at appropriate temperatures (e.g., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 170&#xb0; C.) and under atmospheric or sub-atmospheric pressure. This treatment serves to remove unreacted monomer as well as any low-boiling solvent. Alternatively, the polymer can also be recovered by subjecting the polymerization mixture to steam desolventization, followed by drying the resulting polymer crumbs in a hot air tunnel. The polymer can also be recovered by directly drying the polymerization mixture on a drum dryer.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">While the reactive polymer and the nitroso compound (and optionally the co-functionalizing agent) are believed to react to produce a novel functionalized polymer, which can be protonated or further modified, the exact chemical structure of the functionalized polymer produced in every embodiment is not known with any great degree of certainty, particularly as the structure relates to the residue imparted to the polymer chain end by the nitroso compound and optionally the co-functionalizing agent. Indeed, it is speculated that the structure of the functionalized polymer may depend upon various factors such as the conditions employed to prepare the reactive polymer (e.g., the type and amount of the catalyst) and the conditions employed to react the nitroso compound (and optionally the co-functionalizing agent) with the reactive polymer (e.g., the types and amounts of the nitroso compound and the co-functionalizing agent).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In one or more embodiments, one of the products resulting from the reaction between the nitroso compound and the reactive polymer may, after reaction with a quenching agent or an electrophilic reagent, include a functionalized polymer defined by one of the formulae:</p>

In one embodiment, these polymers may exhibit a single glass transition temperature. In particular embodiments, the polymers may be hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In one or more embodiments, the functionalized polymers of this invention may be cis-1,4-polydienes having a cis-1,4-linkage content that is greater than 60%, in other embodiments greater than about 75%, in other embodiments greater than about 90%, and in other embodiments greater than about 95%, where the percentages are based upon the number of diene mer units adopting the cis-1,4 linkage versus the total number of diene mer units. Also, these polymers may have a 1,2-linkage content that is less than about 7%, in other embodiments less than 5%, in other embodiments less than 2%, and in other embodiments less than 1%, where the percentages are based upon the number of diene mer units adopting the 1,2-linkage versus the total number of diene mer units.

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Advantageously, the functionalized polymers of this invention exhibit improved cold-flow resistance and provide rubber compositions that demonstrate reduced hysteresis. The functionalized polymers are particularly useful in preparing rubber compositions that can be used to manufacture tire components. Rubber compounding techniques and the additives employed therein are generally disclosed in <i>The Compounding and Vulcanization of Rubber</i>, in <i>Rubber Technology </i>(2<sup>nd </sup>Ed. 1973).</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The rubber compositions can be prepared by using the functionalized polymers alone or together with other elastomers (i.e., polymers that can be vulcanized to form compositions possessing rubbery or elastomeric properties). Other elastomers that may be used include natural and synthetic rubbers. The synthetic rubbers typically derive from the polymerization of conjugated diene monomers, the copolymerization of conjugated diene monomers with other monomers such as vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers, or the copolymerization of ethylene with one or more &#x3b1;-olefins and optionally one or more diene monomers.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Exemplary elastomers include natural rubber, synthetic polyisoprene, polybutadiene, polyisobutylene-co-isoprene, neoprene, poly(ethylene-co-propylene), poly(styrene-co-butadiene), poly(styrene-co-isoprene), and poly(styrene-co-isoprene-co-butadiene), poly(isoprene-co-butadiene), poly(ethylene-co-propylene-co-diene), polysulfide rubber, acrylic rubber, urethane rubber, silicone rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, and mixtures thereof. These elastomers can have a myriad of macromolecular structures including linear, branched, and star-shaped structures.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The rubber compositions may include fillers such as inorganic and organic fillers. Examples of organic fillers include carbon black and starch. Examples of inorganic fillers include silica, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, mica, talc (hydrated magnesium silicate), and clays (hydrated aluminum silicates). Carbon blacks and silicas are the most common fillers used in manufacturing tires. In certain embodiments, a mixture of different fillers may be advantageously employed.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In one or more embodiments, carbon blacks includes furnace blacks, channel blacks, and lamp blacks. More specific examples of carbon blacks include super abrasion furnace blacks, intermediate super abrasion furnace blacks, high abrasion furnace blacks, fast extrusion furnace blacks, fine furnace blacks, semi-reinforcing furnace blacks, medium processing channel blacks, hard processing channel blacks, conducting channel blacks, and acetylene blacks.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In particular embodiments, the carbon blacks may have a surface area (EMSA) of at least 20 m<sup>2</sup>/g and in other embodiments at least 35 m<sup>2</sup>/g; surface area values can be determined by ASTM D-1765 using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) technique. The carbon blacks may be in a pelletized form or an unpelletized flocculent form. The preferred form of carbon black may depend upon the type of mixing equipment used to mix the rubber compound.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The amount of carbon black employed in the rubber compositions can be up to about 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber (phr), with about 5 to about 40 phr being typical.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Some commercially available silicas which may be used include Hi-Sil&#x2122; 215, Hi-Sil&#x2122; 233, and Hi-Sil&#x2122;190 (PPG Industries, Inc.; Pittsburgh, Pa.). Other suppliers of commercially available silica include Grace Davison (Baltimore, Md.), Degussa Corp. (Parsippany, N.J.), Rhodia Silica Systems (Cranbury, N.J.), and J.M. Huber Corp. (Edison, N.J.).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In one or more embodiments, silicas may be characterized by their surface areas, which give a measure of their reinforcing character. The Brunauer, Emmet and Teller (&#x201c;BET&#x201d;) method (described in <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., vol. </i>60, p. 309 et seq.) is a recognized method for determining the surface area. The BET surface area of silica is generally less than 450 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Useful ranges of surface area include from about 32 to about 400 m<sup>2</sup>/g, about 100 to about 250 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and about 150 to about 220 m<sup>2</sup>/g.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The pH's of the silicas are generally from about 5 to about 7 or slightly over 7, or in other embodiments from about 5.5 to about 6.8.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In one or more embodiments, where silica is employed as a filler (alone or in combination with other fillers), a coupling agent and/or a shielding agent may be added to the rubber compositions during mixing in order to enhance the interaction of silica with the elastomers. Useful coupling agents and shielding agents are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,842,111, 3,873,489, 3,978,103, 3,997,581, 4,002,594, 5,580,919, 5,583,245, 5,663,396, 5,674,932, 5,684,171, 5,684,172 5,696,197, 6,608,145, 6,667,362, 6,579,949, 6,590,017, 6,525,118, 6,342,552, and 6,683,135, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The amount of silica employed in the rubber compositions can be from about 1 to about 100 phr or in other embodiments from about 5 to about 80 phr. The useful upper range is limited by the high viscosity imparted by silicas. When silica is used together with carbon black, the amount of silica can be decreased to as low as about 1 phr; as the amount of silica is decreased, lesser amounts of coupling agents and shielding agents can be employed. Generally, the amounts of coupling agents and shielding agents range from about 4% to about 20% based on the weight of silica used.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">A multitude of rubber curing agents (also called vulcanizing agents) may be employed, including sulfur or peroxide-based curing systems. Curing agents are described in Kirk-Othmer, E<smallcaps>NCYCLOPEDIA OF </smallcaps>C<smallcaps>HEMICAL </smallcaps>T<smallcaps>ECHNOLOGY</smallcaps>, Vol. 20, pgs. 365-468, (3<sup>rd </sup>Ed. 1982), particularly <i>Vulcanization Agents and Auxiliary Materials</i>, pgs. 390-402, and A.

Vulcanizing agents may be used alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Other ingredients that are typically employed in rubber compounding may also be added to the rubber compositions. These include accelerators, accelerator activators, oils, plasticizer, waxes, scorch inhibiting agents, processing aids, zinc oxide, tackifying resins, reinforcing resins, fatty acids such as stearic acid, peptizers, and antidegradants such as antioxidants and antiozonants.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">All ingredients of the rubber compositions can be mixed with standard mixing equipment such as Banbury or Brabender mixers, extruders, kneaders, and two-rolled mills. In one or more embodiments, the ingredients are mixed in two or more stages. In the first stage (often referred to as the masterbatch mixing stage), a so-called masterbatch, which typically includes the rubber component and filler, is prepared. To prevent premature vulcanization (also known as scorch), the masterbatch may exclude vulcanizing agents. The masterbatch may be mixed at a starting temperature of from about 25&#xb0; C. to about 125&#xb0; C. with a discharge temperature of about 135&#xb0; C. to about 180&#xb0; C. Once the masterbatch is prepared, the vulcanizing agents may be introduced and mixed into the masterbatch in a final mixing stage, which is typically conducted at relatively low temperatures so as to reduce the chances of premature vulcanization. Optionally, additional mixing stages, sometimes called remills, can be employed between the masterbatch mixing stage and the final mixing stage. One or more remill stages are often employed where the rubber composition includes silica as the filler. Various ingredients including the functionalized polymers of this invention can be added during these remills.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The mixing procedures and conditions particularly applicable to silica-filled tire formulations are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,227,425, 5,719,207, and 5,717,022, as well as European Patent No. 890,606, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the initial masterbatch is prepared by including the functionalized polymer of this invention and silica in the substantial absence of coupling agents and shielding agents.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The rubber compositions prepared from the functionalized polymers of this invention are particularly useful for forming tire components such as treads, subtreads, sidewalls, body ply skims, bead filler, and the like. Preferably, the functional polymers of this invention are employed in tread and sidewall formulations. In one or more embodiments, these tread or sidewall formulations may include from about 10% to about 100% by weight, in other embodiments from about 35% to about 90% by weight, and in other embodiments from about 50% to about 80% by weight of the functionalized polymer based on the total weight of the rubber within the formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Where the rubber compositions are employed in the manufacture of tires, these compositions can be processed into tire components according to ordinary tire manufacturing techniques including standard rubber shaping, molding and curing techniques. Typically, vulcanization is effected by heating the vulcanizable composition in a mold; e.g., it may be heated to about 140&#xb0; C. to about 180&#xb0; C. Cured or crosslinked rubber compositions may be referred to as vulcanizates, which generally contain three-dimensional polymeric networks that are thermoset. The other ingredients, such as fillers and processing aids, may be evenly dispersed throughout the crosslinked network. Pneumatic tires can be made as discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,866,171, 5,876,527, 5,931,211, and 5,971,046, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested. The examples should not, however, be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention. The claims will serve to define the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Synthesis of Unmodified cis-1,4-Polybutadiene</heading>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">To a 2-gallon nitrogen-purged reactor equipped with turbine agitator blades were added 1383 g of hexane and 3083 g of 20.6 wt % butadiene in hexane. A preformed catalyst was prepared by mixing 8.08 ml of 4.32 M methylaluminoxane in toluene, 1.83 g of 20.6 wt % 1,3-butadiene in hexane, 0.65 ml of 0.537 M neodymium versatate in cyclohexane, 7.33 ml of 1.0 M diisobutylaluminum hydride in hexane, and 1.40 ml of 1.0 M diethylaluminum chloride in hexane. The catalyst was aged for 15 minutes and charged into the reactor. The reactor jacket temperature was then set to 65&#xb0; C. Forty five minutes after addition of the catalyst, the polymerization mixture was cooled to room temperature. The resulting polymer cement was coagulated with 12 liters of isopropanol containing 5 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol and then drum-dried. The Mooney viscosity (ML<sub>1+4</sub>) of the resulting polymer was determined to be 26.5 at 100&#xb0; C. by using a Monsanto Mooney viscometer with a large rotor, a one-minute warm-up time, and a four-minute running time. As determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the polymer had a number average molecular weight (M<sub>n</sub>) of 111,800, a weight average molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>) of 209,500, and a molecular weight distribution (M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub>) of 1.87. The infrared spectroscopic analysis of the polymer indicated a cis-1,4-linkage content of 94.4%, a trans-1,4-linkage content of 5.1%, and a 1,2-linkage content of 0.5%.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The cold-flow resistance of the polymer was measured by using a Scott plasticity tester. Approximately 2.6 g of the polymer was molded, at 100&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes, into a cylindrical button with a diameter of 15 mm and a height of 12 mm. After cooling down to room temperature, the button was removed from the mold and placed in a Scott plasticity tester at room temperature. A 5-kg load was applied to the specimen. After 8 minutes, the residual gauge (i.e., sample thickness) was measured and taken as an indication of the cold-flow resistance of the polymer. Generally, a higher residual gauge value indicates better cold-flow resistance.</p>

<p id="p-0155" num="0154">To a 2-gallon nitrogen-purged reactor equipped with turbine agitator blades were added 1631 g of hexane and 2835 g of 22.4 wt % butadiene in hexane. A preformed catalyst was prepared by mixing 6.10 ml of 4.32 M methylaluminoxane in toluene, 1.27 g of 22.4 wt % 1,3-butadiene in hexane, 0.49 ml of 0.537 M neodymium versatate in cyclohexane, 5.53 ml of 1.0 M diisobutylaluminum hydride in hexane, and 1.05 ml of 1.0 M diethylaluminum chloride in hexane. The catalyst was aged for 15 minutes and charged into the reactor. The reactor jacket temperature was then set to 65&#xb0; C. Seventy two minutes after addition of the catalyst, the polymerization mixture was cooled to room temperature. The resulting polymer cement was coagulated with 12 liters of isopropanol containing 5 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol and then drum-dried. The properties of the resulting polymer are summarized in Table 1.</p>

A preformed catalyst was prepared by mixing 9.55 ml of 4.32 M methylaluminoxane in toluene, 2.03 g of 22.0 wt % 1,3-butadiene in hexane, 0.77 ml of 0.537 M neodymium versatate in cyclohexane, 8.67 ml of 1.0 M diisobutylaluminum hydride in hexane, and 1.65 ml of 1.0 M diethylaluminum chloride in hexane. The catalyst was aged for 15 minutes and charged into the reactor. The reactor jacket temperature was then set to 65&#xb0; C. Fifty minutes after addition of the catalyst, the polymerization mixture was cooled to room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">About 428 g of the resulting unmodified polymer cement was transferred from the reactor to a nitrogen-purged bottle, followed by addition of 5.7 ml of 0.41 M nitrosobenzene (NSB) in toluene. The bottle was tumbled for 30 minutes in a water bath maintained at 65&#xb0; C.
