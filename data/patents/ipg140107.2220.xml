<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is in the field of arthritis and pharmacotherapy of arthritis and joint diseases. More specifically, the present invention is directed to novel peptides which home to joints and uses thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease (1). Both the joint-resident and systemic antigens have been invoked in the pathogenesis of RA (2, 3). Furthermore, the joints are frequently targeted in pathological conditions associated with systemic autoimmunity (4). A major challenge in this regard lies in defining the mechanisms underlying the selective targeting of the joints in the face of systemic autoimmunity. The migration of pathogenic T cells and other leukocytes into the joints depends on the interaction between the leukocytes and the target organ vasculature. In addition, angiogenesis plays am important role in the disease process in RA (5, 6). Thus, targeting the blood vessels is of major interest for developing novel therapeutic interventions in this disease (5-8).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The vascular bed of individual tissues is highly specialized, with endothelial cells expressing unique molecules (9, 10). Furthermore, during the process of angiogenesis, the new blood vessels express many cell surface molecules not found in normal blood vessels. The use of in vivo screening of phage peptide display libraries has been instrumental in identifying tissue/organ-specific and disease-specific vascular markers (9, 11-13). The molecular differences in the vascular endothelium of various tissues/organs have been termed as &#x201c;molecular addresses&#x201d; or &#x201c;zip codes&#x201d; (9-11). For example, a nonapeptide was found to home to normal breast tissue and to bind to aminopeptidase P in breast vasculature (14). Similarly, peptides homing specifically to brain, kidney, lung, heart, skin, pancreas, retina, and prostate have been identified (9). In all of these tissues, the phage was localized in the blood vessels. The main target of phage-encoded peptide ligands has been the tumors (15-19); the vasculature of the inflamed joint has not been probed in that manner.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The prior art is deficient in novel peptides that home to joints as well as methods of their use. The present invention fulfills this longstanding need and desire in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention identified peptides that home to the inflamed joint using on the adjuvant arthritis (AA) model of human RA and performing ex vivo and in vivo enrichment and screening of the phage peptide library in arthritic Lewis rats. It was an object of the present invention to identify peptides that can distinguish between the vasculature of inflamed joints and other inflamed/uninflamed tissues, and that can inhibit the recruitment of inflammatory cells into joints. It is another object of the present invention to identify peptides with anti-angiogenic activity. Described herein is the identification of joint-homing peptides with these attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a peptide that homes to a joint of an animal, wherein the peptide comprises an amino acid motif selected from the group consisting of NQR and ADK.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method of treating a subject having an arthritic joint, comprising the step of administering to the subject a pharmacologically effective dose of the composition of the present invention.</p>

As used herein &#x201c;another&#x201d; may mean at least a second or more. Furthermore, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, &#x201c;about&#x201d; refers to a numeric value, including, for example, whole numbers, fractions, and percentages, whether or not explicitly indicated. The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; generally refers to a range of numerical values (e.g., +/&#x2212;5-10% of the recited value) that one of ordinary skill in the art would consider equivalent to the recited value (e.g., having the same function or result). In some instances, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; may include numerical values that are rounded to the nearest significant figure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmacologically effective dose&#x201d; (or a derivative or variation thereof) is an amount of a peptide of the invention or composition containing the same that alleviates, totally or partially, the pathophysiological effects of a treatment indication of the invention (including, for example, treatment of an inflammatory, autoimmune or arthritic condition or a subject at risk of developing a an inflammatory, autoimmune or arthritic condition). Unless otherwise indicated when referring to the administration of a peptide of the invention or composition containing the same, said peptide of the invention or composition containing the same is administered at a concentration that is a pharmacologically effective dose. A pharmacologically effective dose will depend upon, for example, subject size, gender, magnitude of the associated disease, condition, or injury, and genetic or non-genetic factors associated individual pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties of the administered antibacterial peptide of the invention or composition containing the same.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In other embodiments, the compounds of the invention comprise one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative substitutions, in which an amino acid is exchanged for another having similar properties, can be made in a compound of the invention by techniques well known by one of ordinary skill in the art. Conservative amino acid substitutions typically fall in the range of about 1 to 2 amino acid residues. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues can be substituted without activity or immunological properties can be found using computer programs well known in the art, such as DNASTAR software, or in Dayhoff et al. (1978) in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure (Natl. Biomed. Res. Found., Washington, D.C.). Amino acid substitutions conservative in nature are when, for example, the substituted amino acid has similar structural and/or chemical properties (including, for example, molecular weight, polarity, isoelectric point, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, charge, etc.) (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,098,015, which along with all other references cited herein is incorporated by reference in its entirety). Examples of conservative replacements are substitution of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, or a threonine with a serine. Specifically, amino acids are generally divided into families: (1) acidic&#x2014;aspartate and glutamate; (2) basic&#x2014;lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar&#x2014;alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; (4) uncharged polar&#x2014;glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine threonine, and tyrosine; (5) aromatic amino acids&#x2014;phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Animals</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Lewis (LEW/SsNHsd; RT.1<sup>I</sup>) rats were purchased from Harlan. Four-to-six week old male rats were used. The rats were housed in the vivarium of the University of Maryland School of Medicine and were handled in accordance with the school's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Phage Library and Ex Vivo/In Vivo Phage Screening</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The CX7C library displayed on the T7Selected415-1 phage (Novagen) was prepared as described previously (9, 14). This library was subjected to sequential ex vivo and in vivo phage selection. For the ex vivo selection, 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>cells from the harvested synovial tissue were incubated overnight at at 4&#xb0; C. with 5&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>plaque-forming units (pfu) of a CX7C library. These cells were washed to remove unbound phage and then incubated with mouse anti-rat CD31 antibody. The CD31+ cells were then isolated using rat anti-mous IgG1 microbeads. Phage bound to the CD31+ cells was rescued, tittered, and amplified using <i>Escherichia coli </i>BL21</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For the in vivo selection, the phage pool (5&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>pfu) from the foregoing screen was injected into an arthritic Lewis rat via the tail vein under anesthesia. The phage was allowed to circulate for 10 min, after which the rat was perfused through the left ventricle with PBS containing 1% BSA to clear unbound phage in the vascular lumen. The synovial tissue along with the control tissues, e.g., kidney, lung or skin, was excised, and the phage thus recovered from the synovium was reinjected into another arthritic Lewis rat at a comparable disease stage. This procedure was repeated three times. In each experiment, the nonrecombinant phage was injected as a control into a separate rat for determining the relative selectivity of the phage for a given tissue. After the last round of in vivo selection, the phage clones were chosen at random and grown as individual phage in liquid culture. Thereafter, the recombinant phage's coding region isert was amplified by PCR (PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler; MJ Research) and subjected to automatic DNA sequencing at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Biopolymer/Genomic Core Facility.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Synthetic Peptides</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Peptides were synthesized at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Biopolymer/Genomic Core Facility, GenScript Corporation, and Peptide International. For easy description, each peptide was given an abbreviated name, e.g., ADK or NQR.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The complete amino acid sequences of the peptides are as follows: ADK peptide, CRNADKFPC (SEQ ID NO: 1); NQR peptide, CLDNQRPKC (SEQ ID NO: 2); RGD peptide, RGDfK (SEQ ID NO: 3). The RGDfK peptide was chosen over CDCRGDCFC (SEQ ID NO: 4), i.e., RCD-4C (SEQ ID NO: 4) because of the relative ease of synthesis, and the two peptides have a similar affinity for &#x3b1;v integrins (21). In addition, the RGDfK (SEQ ID NO: 3) peptide may be more resistant to proteolysis because of its small ring and D-amino acid residue.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The synthetic peptide corresponding to the selected phage-encoded peptide was diluted in PBS and injected i.v. into Lewis rats beginning either at the onset or just after the onset of arthritis after Mtb injection. The peptide was injected to rats on alternate days at a dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg body weight. A total of three or four injections were given to each rat. Control animals received an equal volume of PBS. All rats were graded regularly for clinical signs of arthritis (36). The hind paws of these rats were harvested and processed for histopathological examination.</p>

<heading id="h-0035" level="1">Results</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The vasculature of arthritic joints of Lewis rats was probed using a phage peptide display library. Phages specific for arthritic joints were identified and isolated using a combination of ex vivo and in vivo phage screening. For ex vivo screening, CD31-expressing endothelial cells from the joints of an arthritic rat were used. Two rounds of ex vivo enrichment produced a phage pool that bound 66-fold more efficiently to the endothelial cells compared with the nonrecombinant phage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, Left).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ex vivo selected phage was injected i.v. into an arthritic rat, and subsequent three rounds of in vivo selection yielded a 53-fold enrichment of the phage recovered from the synovial tissue, whereas no enrichment was observed in the control tissues, namely the lung and the kidney (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, Right). Three phage insert sequences ADK (CRNADKFPC, SEQ ID NO: 1), NQR (CLDNQRPK, SEQ ID NO: 2) and RGD-4C (CDCRGDCFC; SEQ ID NO: 4) were enriched in two independent experiments, which yielded 20-50 phage clones with these sequences. The RGD-4C peptide has been identified in previous phage screens that used purified integrins or tumors as the target (15, 20). As described above, an alternative RGD peptide RGDfK (SEQ ID NO: 3) was used, which has an affinity for &#x3b1;v integrins similar to that of RGD-4C (21), as a positive control in most of the experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Compared with the nonrecombinant control phage, the selected phage encoding the three peptides (one each) accumulated in the inflamed joints by 109-fold more for ADK, 23-fold more for NQR, and 15-fold more for RGD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The accumulation within inflamed skin was 103-fold greater, 14-fold greater, and 16-fold greater, respectively. Thus, of the three phages, the NQR-encoding phage showed partial preference for inflamed joints relative to inflamed skin. None of these three phage clones showed significant binding to various normal (noninflamed) tissues tested, including the skin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). Thus, the three phage clones selected demonstrated specificity for inflamed joints and skin, suggesting the presence of target molecules that are preferentially expressed during inflammation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The specificity of binding of the phage clones to the vascular endothelium of inflamed joints was further established. Examination of the hind paw sections of the phage-injected arthritic rats showed preferential binding of the selected phage clones to the joint vasculature (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). This phage binding was inhibited by the cognate synthetic peptide but not the unrelated peptides when administered to rats before injection of the phage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Furthermore, no binding of the phage clones to the uninflamed normal joints of Lewis rats was detected. These results demonstrate the specificity of binding of the phages/peptides for the vasculature of the inflamed joint and suggest that they each bind to different receptors.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The specificity was further validated by testing the binding of fluorescein-labeled NQR peptide to CD31-expressing endothelial cells from an arthritic rat joint and from a control tissue, the liver. The NQR peptide bound specifically to the joint-derived, but not to the liver-derived, endothelial cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). Furthermore, the NQR peptide colocalized with CD31 on the joint-derived endothelial cells. Similar results were found when using the ADK peptide. In addition, NQR peptide was transported across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm and the nucleus, with most peptide accumulating in the perinuclear area by 45 min after addition to the cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>). The internalized NQR might be involved in regulation of gene expression and interaction with the signaling pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The inflamed joint-homing peptides was also examined for their antiarthritic activity using the AA model. Intravenous injection of the peptides into rats around the time of onset of arthritis showed that the NQR peptide, but not the ADK peptide, suppressed the arthritic process in a dose-dependent manner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, Left). The RGD peptide also suppressed arthritis; NQR and RGD were equally effective in this regard (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, Middle). These two peptides also were effective in down-modulating arthritis when injected just after the onset of AA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, Right). The joints of the NQR-treated arthritic rats showed much less damage than the joints of arthritic rats treated with PBS instead of a peptide (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). Similar results were obtained in RGD-treated rats. Importantly, NQR-treated animals showed significantly less leukocyte infiltration into the joints than nontreated arthritic or ADK-treated arthritic rats (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). This effect was more marked on CD3+ T cells than on CD11b/c+ myeloid cells.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To gain further insight into the antiarthritic activity of the NQR peptide, the effects of NQR, ADK, and RGD peptides on endothelial cell tube formation were examined, which reflects the process of angiogenesis. The NQR and RGD peptides inhibited tube formation, whereas ADK peptide had no effect (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). This pattern was directly correlated with the antiarthritic activity of the NQR and RGD peptides and the lack of such activity by the ADK peptide (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, both the NQR and ADK peptides bound to endothelial cells. The endothelial cell surface receptors involved in binding are not yet defined. Because peptides containing the RGD motif are known to bind to &#x3b1;v integrins and inhibit the attachment of cells to RGD-containing adhesive proteins, such as vitronectin, the NQR and ADK peptides were tested in a cell attachment assay. Neither peptide had any effect on the attachment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to vitronectin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In contrast, the RGD peptide significantly inhibited cell attachment, and the effect was dose-dependent. These results suggest that the antiarthritic activity of the NQR peptide is not mediated by &#x3b1;v integrin binding.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The activities of the NQR, ADK and, RGD peptides were further explored by examining their effect on VEGF-induced signaling events using HUVECs. Distinct profiles of signaling intermediates were found in the ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways. The NQR peptide induced a decrease in pERK but had no effect on pAkt, whereas the opposite was observed with the RGD peptide (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>). The ADK peptide had no effect. These results further distinguish the NQR and RGD peptides.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The phage peptide display methodology has been used to identify specific peptides that bind differentially to the vascular endothelium of different normal and diseased tissues. However, most previous studies focused on tumors, and there is little information on the vasculature of inflamed joints. The present invention identified three phage-encoded peptides (NQR, ADK, and RGD) that home selectively to an inflamed joint without any significant targeting to normal (uninflamed) tissues. The RGD peptide has been described previously and designated as RGD-4C (15, 20). Apparently NQR and ADK bind to different receptors/receptor domains on the endothelial cell surface than RGD. This inference is supported by three findings: (i) no cross-inhibition of phage binding by these peptides; (ii) inhibition of attachment of HUVECs to vitronectin, which involves integrin &#x3b1;v&#x3b2;3 integrin, by RGD peptide, but not by NQR or ADK peptide; and (iii) differential alterations in the MAP kinase signaling pathway events induced by NQR peptide versus RGD peptide. The precise identity of the receptors that bind NQR and ADK peptides to vascular endothelial cells remains to be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In terms of functional properties, NQR and RGD, but not ADK, suppressed arthritis. ADK peptide apparently binds to a receptor that does not trigger a detectable tissue response. The antiarthritic activity of NQR is likely attributable, at least in part, to inhibition of angiogenesis and resulting inhibition of leukocyte migration into the inflamed joint. However, one cannot exclude an effect on the survival of the incoming leukocytes. A systemic effect that would reduce leukocyte ingress seems unlikely, given the lack of a known target for the peptide outside the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Although the currently available drugs aimed at limiting inflammation and tissue damage in arthritis are quite potent, their use is associated with significant adverse effects (22). The present invention supports that NQR and ADK peptides can be exploited for therapeutic purposes for delivering drugs with anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, or bone damage-protective properties, as well as for delivering imaging molecules or nanoparticles, into inflamed joints (23). The success of a similar approach for antitumor therapy in model systems is elaborated below. By not binding or penetrating the normal tissues, the joint-homing peptides can be a useful arsenal in preventing systemic toxicity and enhancing benefit/risk ratio for antiarthritic compounds conjugated with such peptides. Because these peptides represent randomly generated sequences, there is no inherent bias in their interaction with the target proteins in the joints.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the case of tumors, which share the process of neoangiogenesis with arthritis, peptides binding to tumor vasculature have been identified and exploited for suppression of tumor growth in model systems (15, 24-27). For example, a peptide coupled to the anticancer drug doxorubicin was found to be a more efficiacious anticancer agent compared with the drug alone when tested against human breast cancer tissue implanted as a xenograft in nude mice (15). Similarly, aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) has been identified as a target for inhibiting angiogenesis and peptides containing an NGR motif have been identified as homing peptides that recognize this enzyme in angiogenic vessels (24).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the case of arthritis, a peptide (CKSTHDRLC) homing to the human synovial tissue engrafted s.c. in severely combined immunodeficiency mice has been identified (28). However, neither the antiarthritic activity of this peptide nor any mechanistic functional study using that peptide was reported. Furthermore, the anatomic and physiological milieu of the synovial joint can not be fully replicated in grafted synovial tissue. The present study examined in detail the mechanisms underlying the antiarthritic activity of NQR and RGD peptides in the AA model. The NQR sequence also appeared twice in the aforementioned study using human synovium xenografts for phage library screening (28). Another set of studies (7, 8, 29) was based on the interaction between the RGD motif and &#x3b1;v&#x3b2;3 integrin. For example, fibronectin peptides containing the RGD sequence were shown to inhibit both clinical arthritis and leukocyte recruitment into the joints in rats with streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis (30). In another study, intra-articular injection of an RGD peptide (RGDfV, SEQ ID NO: 6), which served as an antagonist for &#x3b1;v&#x3b2;3, was shown to reduce clinical arthritis, synovial angiogenesis, and joint damage in rabbits with antigen-induced arthritis (7). As mentioned earlier, a similar antiarthritic effect of RGDfK peptide was also observed in rats with AA in the present study. However, the RGD motif-bearing peptides bind to integrins that are rather widely distributed in the vasculature of diverse tissues and thus may compromise joint specificity. In addition, an antibody antagonist of &#x3b1;v&#x3b2;3 showed limited efficacy in a phase II trial in RA patients (5). In this context, the results herein showing that both NQR and ADK differ in their receptor specificity from RGD offer new ligands for further examination of the pathogenesis and treatment of arthritis. Another study found that the RGD-4C-displaying phage homed to inflamed synovium, but not to other tissues of DBA/1 mice with collagen-induced arthritis. Moreover, RGD-4C peptide covalently linked to a proapoptotic heptamer dimer-suppressed arthritis, whereas a simple mixture of the peptide and the heptamer failed to do so (8). In this context, the present invention observed a direct antiarthritic activity of the RGD peptide, as did previous investigators using the rabbit model of arthritis (7). This difference may be related to the different animal model systems used or to differences in experimental conditions. Another group described the suppression of AA after treatment with RGD-displaying liposomes for the delivery of encapsulated dexamethasone phosphate into joints (29). Apoptosis of the hyperplastic synovium in rabbits (31) after the administration of a proapoptotic peptide, (KLAKLAK)<sub>2 </sub>(SEQ ID NO: 7), fused to a synovial-targeted transduction peptide, HAP-1, also has been reported. Soluble mediators of angiogenesis produced by endothelial cells of inflamed synovium, such as the Ley/H glycoconjugate (32), also represent attractive targets for inhibiting angiogenesis in the treatment of arthritis.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Studies conducted in the K/BXN model of antibody-mediated arthritis have revealed that distal joints of the paws of mice might be particularly vulnerable to arthritis induction due to a vacular leak (4). The transfer of arthritogenic antibodies was found to cause macromolecular vasopermeability at sites prone to developing arthritis. This vasopermeability required mast cells, neutrophils, FcR&#x3b3;III, histamine, and serotonin, along with some contribution from the gut or the liver. In comparison, these results offer an interesting perspective on target organ selectivity in predominantly T-cell-mediated arthritis, and are distinct from yet complementary to studies describing regional vasopermeability in antibody-mediated arthritis using the K/BXN model (4). NQR and ADK peptide ligands may be used to identify their natural target molecules within the joint tissue. These peptides may uncover new targets that may not have otherwise been implicated in the disease process. Furthermore, a similar approach might pave the way for effective therapeutic approaches for other autoimmune diseases besides arthritis (33-35).</p>
