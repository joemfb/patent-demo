<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">According to a driving method of applying a reverse bias voltage, capacitance occurs due to a stacked structure of a conductor, an insulator and a conductor, or due to a structure of a TFT. This capacitance prevents normal operation. The invention provides a pixel configuration including at least a driving transistor for driving a light emitting element and a switching transistor for controlling the driving transistor, wherein the switching transistor is turned on in the case of applying a forward bias voltage after applying a reverse bias voltage. As a result, it is prevented that the potential changes due to unwanted capacitive coupling.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a driving method of applying a reverse bias voltage is applied, however, capacitance occurs due to a stacked structure of a conductor, an insulator and a conductor, or due to a structure of a TFT. This capacitance prevents normal operation of a light emitting device, that is, a light emitting element slightly emits light during a non-lighting period (this phenomenon is referred to as black float).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing, the invention provides a driving method of applying a reverse bias voltage correctly, and a light emitting device for achieving the driving method.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To solve the aforementioned problem, the invention provides a pixel configuration having at least a first transistor (also referred to as a driving transistor) for driving a light emitting element and a second transistor (also referred to as a switching transistor) for controlling the first transistor, wherein the switching transistor is turned on in the case of applying a reverse bias voltage, thereby a gate electrode of the driving transistor can be brought into an electrically non-floating state. When a reverse bias voltage is applied to the light emitting element, the driving transistor is turned on. Meanwhile, when a forward bias voltage is applied, a signal for turning off the driving transistor (non-lighting signal) so that the light emitting element emits no light is inputted to the switching transistor that is on. Accordingly, black float where the light emitting element emits light during a non-lighting period can be prevented.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although the invention will be described by way of Embodiment Modes with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, unless such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the invention, they should be construed as being included therein. Note that in all the drawings for describing Embodiment Modes, the same portion or a portion having the same function is denoted by the same reference numeral, and description thereof is omitted.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment Mode 1</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this embodiment mode, a pixel configuration and a driving method thereof are described.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a pixel configuration having a signal line <b>10</b>, a switching transistor <b>11</b>, a driving transistor <b>12</b>, a scan line <b>13</b>, a power supply line <b>14</b>, a capacitor <b>15</b>, and a light emitting element <b>16</b>. A pixel area is constituted by a plurality of such pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Connection in this pixel is described. The switching transistor <b>11</b> is provided at an intersection of the signal line <b>10</b> and the scan line <b>13</b>. One electrode of the switching transistor <b>11</b> is connected to the signal line <b>10</b> while a gate electrode thereof is connected to the scan line <b>13</b>. One electrode of the driving transistor <b>12</b> is connected to the power supply line <b>14</b> while a gate electrode thereof is connected to the other electrode of the switching transistor <b>11</b>. The capacitor <b>15</b> is provided to hold a gate-source voltage of the driving transistor <b>12</b>. In this embodiment mode, one electrode of the capacitor <b>15</b> is connected to the power supply line <b>14</b> while the other electrode thereof is connected to the gate electrode of the driving transistor <b>12</b>. Note that the capacitor <b>15</b> is not necessarily provided when, for example, the driving transistor <b>12</b> has large gate capacitance and small leak current. The light emitting element <b>16</b> is connected to the other electrode of the driving transistor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A driving method of such a pixel is described.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the switching transistor <b>11</b> is turned on, a video signal is inputted from the signal line <b>10</b>. Charges are accumulated in the capacitor <b>15</b> in accordance with the video signal. When the charges accumulated in the capacitor <b>15</b> exceed a gate-source voltage (Vgs) of the driving transistor <b>12</b>, the driving transistor <b>12</b> is turned on. Then, a current is supplied to the light emitting element <b>16</b> to emit light. At this time, the driving transistor <b>12</b> can operate in either the linear region or the saturation region. If operating in the saturation region, the driving transistor <b>12</b> can supply a constant current. Meanwhile, if operating in the linear region, the driving transistor <b>12</b> can be driven at a low voltage, leading to low power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The driving method of the pixel is described with reference to timing charts.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are timing charts of one frame period in the case of writing an image 60 times per second. The ordinate represents a scan line G (from the first to the last row) whereas the abscissa represents time.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">One frame period includes m (m is a natural number of 2 or more) subframe periods SF<b>1</b>, SF<b>2</b>, . . . , SFm, each of which includes writing periods Ta<b>1</b>, Ta<b>2</b>, . . . , Tam and display periods (lighting periods) Ts<b>1</b>, Ts<b>2</b>, . . . , Tsm respectively. One frame period also includes a reverse bias voltage applying period. In this embodiment mode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, one frame period includes subframe periods SF<b>1</b>, SF<b>2</b> and SF<b>3</b>, and a reverse bias voltage applying period (FRB). In the subframe periods SF<b>1</b>, SF<b>2</b> and SF<b>3</b>, the writing periods Ta<b>1</b> to Ta<b>3</b> are performed, followed by the display periods Ts<b>1</b> to Ts<b>3</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows a writing period, a display period and a reverse bias voltage applying period of a certain row (i-th row). A reverse bias voltage applying period appears after a writing period and a display period alternately appear. A period having the writing period and the display period is referred to as a forward bias voltage applying period.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">During a forward bias voltage applying period, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the switching transistor <b>11</b> is turned on and a signal (lighting signal) is inputted from the signal line <b>10</b> so that the light emitting element <b>16</b> emits light. Then, the driving transistor <b>12</b> is turned on, a current is supplied from the power supply line <b>14</b>, and the light emitting element <b>16</b> emits light.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A reverse bias voltage applying period includes a period when the switching transistors <b>11</b> of all the pixels are simultaneously turned on, that is, all the scan lines are turned on (ON period), and a period when a reverse bias voltage is applied (applying period). Note that during the reverse bias voltage applying period, a WE signal is inputted and the light emitting element emits no light.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">After the reverse bias voltage applying period, the switching transistors <b>11</b> of all the pixels are simultaneously turned off, that is, all the scan lines are turned off (OFF period). In this embodiment mode, the forward bias voltage applying period includes the OFF period.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the invention, during the ON period included in the reverse bias voltage applying period, the switching transistor <b>11</b> is controlled to be turned on. Therefore, the gate electrode of the driving transistor <b>12</b> can be brought into an electrically non-floating state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Specifically, when the switching transistor <b>11</b> is turned on, point A is brought into an electrically non-floating state. Accordingly, it is prevented that the potential at the point A changes due to unwanted capacitive coupling mainly between the point A and the point B when the reverse bias voltage applying period is transferred to the forward bias voltage applying period. As a result, the light emitting element can be prevented from emitting light due to unwanted capacitive coupling during the OFF period.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the prior art, the switching transistor is turned off before and after the reverse bias voltage is applied. Therefore, the point A is brought into a floating state, and the potential at the point A changes due to unwanted capacitive coupling between the point A and point B, thereby the light emitting element may emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Note that the light emitting element should be in a non-lighting state before and after the reverse bias voltage applying period as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Thus, a signal for bringing the light emitting element into the non-lighting state (referred to as a non-lighting signal) is inputted to the signal line <b>10</b> connected to the switching transistor <b>11</b>. For example, a High signal is inputted if a P-channel transistor is used as the driving transistor <b>12</b>, while a Low signal is inputted if an N-channel transistor is used as the driving transistor <b>12</b>. These signals are inputted from a signal line driver circuit. Then, it is prevented that the potential at the point A changes due to unwanted capacitive coupling mainly between the point A and the point B before and after the reverse bias is applied. Consequently, black float can be prevented during the forward bias voltage applying period.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Subsequently, the switching transistor <b>11</b> is turned off during the OFF period, and the next frame period starts thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to such a driving method, a reverse bias voltage can be applied while preventing the light emitting element from emitting light. As a result, accurate image display can be achieved and the light emitting element can operate for a longer time.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, an erasing period (SE) is provided immediately before the reverse bias voltage applying period. During the erasing period, data that has been written during the subframe period immediately before the erasing period, namely during SF<b>3</b> in this embodiment mode, is sequentially erased. This is because during the ON period, the switching transistors <b>11</b> are simultaneously turned on after the display period of the pixels of the last row is completed, and thus each pixel of the first row and the like has an unnecessary display period. The erasing period allows image display to be performed correctly.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> shows a waveform of a signal inputted to the scan line <b>13</b>. The WE signal is at L (Low) level during a period T<b>1</b> while at H (High) level during a period T<b>2</b>. Note that the H level and the L level mean potentials with a relative difference. Each of the periods T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> corresponds to half of one gate selection period (one horizontal period), and the period T<b>1</b> is also referred to as a first subgate period while the period T<b>2</b> is also referred to as a second subgate period.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">During the first subgate period, a signal (GDb) is inputted from a second scan line driver circuit to the scan line of the i-th row in synchronism with the WE signal. Meanwhile, during the second subgate period, a signal (GDa) is inputted from a first scan line driver circuit to the scan line of the i-th row in synchronism with the WE signal. When one gate selection period thus includes a plurality of subgate periods, a displaying video signal and an erasing video signal can be written from a signal line during each writing period. Accordingly, no erasing transistor is required to be provided, which results in high aperture ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> shows the WE signal, a reverse bias voltage applying control signal (GL), and potentials of an anode (ANODE) and a cathode (CATHODE) during the reverse bias voltage applying period (FRB). During the reverse bias voltage applying period, first, the WE signal and the GL become H level during the ON period. Then, during the applying period (RB), the potential of the anode is inverted, that is, it becomes L level when the initial potential is at H level. Subsequently, the potential of the cathode is inverted, that is, it becomes H level when the potential of the anode is at L level. The potential of the anode returns to the initial value and the potential of the cathode returns to the initial value thereafter. When the potentials of the anode and the cathode are alternately inverted in this manner, a reverse bias voltage can be applied correctly. A reverse bias voltage is applied to the light emitting element during such an applying period. Then, the GL becomes L level during the OFF period.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Such a control is performed by a driver circuit such as a scan line driver circuit and a signal line driver circuit. In specific, the control is performed by a switch circuit provided in the scan line driver circuit or the signal line driver circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Note that the timing of applying a reverse bias voltage to the light emitting element <b>16</b>, namely the reverse bias voltage applying period is not limited to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4E</figref>. That is to say, the reverse bias voltage applying period is not necessarily provided for each frame period, nor in the latter part of one frame period. The ON period is only required to be provided immediately before the applying period (RB) and the OFF period is only required to be provided immediately after the applying period (RB). In addition, the order of inverting the potentials of the anode and the cathode of the light emitting element is not limited to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4E</figref>. That is, the potential of the anode may decrease after the potential of the cathode increases.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">By applying a reverse bias voltage to the light emitting element, degradation of the light emitting element can be improved and reliability can be increased. In the light emitting element, an initial defect where an anode and a cathode are short-circuited may occur due to the deposition of foreign material, pinholes due to a slight unevenness of the anode or the cathode, and roughness of the electroluminescent layer. In a pixel having such an initial defect, light emission and non-light emission are not carried out in accordance with signals, and almost all currents flow through the short-circuited portion so that the pixel emits no light, which results in faulty display of images. Further, this short circuit may occur in any pixel. Thus, when a reverse bias voltage is applied to the light emitting element as described in this embodiment mode, a current is locally supplied only to the short-circuited portion, and the short-circuited portion generates heat. As a result, the short-circuited portion can be oxidized or carbonized to be insulated, and a current is supplied to an area other than the short-circuited portion, thereby the luminance corresponding to a signal can be obtained. Thus, even when an initial defect occurs, the defect can be corrected and images can be displayed with high quality by applying a reverse bias voltage. Note that such insulation of the short-circuited portion is preferably performed before shipment of a display device.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Not only the initial defect, but also another defect where the anode and the cathode are short-circuited may occur as time passes. Such a defect is also called a progressive defect. However, according to the invention, a reverse bias voltage can be applied to the light emitting element periodically. Therefore, even when the progressive defect occurs, the defect can be corrected and images can be displayed with high quality.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">By applying a reverse bias voltage, image burn-in can also be prevented. The image burn-in is caused by degradation of the light emitting element <b>16</b>; however, the degradation can be reduced by applying a reverse bias voltage. As a result, the image burn-in can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In general, degradation of a light emitting element progresses rapidly in the initial stage and gradually slows down with time. That is to say, in a pixel, a light emitting element that has degraded in the initial stage does not degrade easily. Accordingly, all the pixels preferably emit light before shipment of a display device or during a period when no image is displayed, which causes degradation of a pixel that has not degraded and allows degradation of all the pixels to progress at the same rate. Such a configuration where all the pixels emit light during a period when no image is displayed may be adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As set forth above, the light emitting element can operate for a longer life when being applied with a reverse bias voltage correctly. In addition, according to the invention, it is prevented that the potential changes due to unwanted capacitive coupling, therefore, the light emitting element can be prevented from emitting light during a reverse bias voltage applying period, leading to an accurate driving method of the light emitting element.</p>

<p id="p-0166" num="0165"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> shows a timing chart of the signals A, B, A<b>2</b>, and Bb, the clock signal CK, the signal outputted from the output terminal OUT<b>1</b>, and the signal outputted from the output terminal OUT<b>2</b>, which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As shown in the timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, in the flip flop circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, what is called a fall timing at which the signal from the output terminal OUT<b>1</b> varies from the power supply voltage VDD to the power supply voltage VSS is not determined by the clock signal CK but by the signal A<b>2</b> from the output terminal OUT<b>1</b> of the stage before the previous stage. Accordingly, when the transistor <b>202</b> is turned on in synchronism with the signal A<b>2</b> from the output terminal OUT<b>1</b> of the stage before the previous stage, the transistor <b>202</b> can be completely turned off during a period T<b>1</b>. Thus, it can be prevented that the signal falls early as shown by a dashed line <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">It is preferable that the channel width W of the N-channel transistor in the clocked inverter <b>221</b>, which supplies the power supply voltage VSS to the output terminal OUT<b>1</b>, be larger than that of the P-channel transistor <b>201</b> in the clocked inverter <b>212</b>, which supplies the power supply voltage VDD to the output terminal OUT<b>1</b>. According to such a structure, during a period T<b>3</b>, the clocked inverter <b>221</b> can have higher capacity of current supply to the output terminal OUT<b>1</b> than the clocked inverter <b>212</b>; therefore, the output terminal OUT<b>1</b> can be maintained at the power supply voltage VSS more correctly during the period T<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Further in the flip flop circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, input of the clock signal CK is controlled by the switching element (transmission gate <b>206</b>) that operates in synchronism with the signal B. Thus, it is possible to reduce the load of wirings for supplying the clock signal CK to the flip flop circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In general, a clocked inverter has two N-channel transistors connected in series and two P-channel transistors connected in series. When two transistors are connected in series, however, on-current tends to decrease. In order to increase the on-current, the two transistors connected in series are required to have a large channel width W. As a result, a transistor using the gate (gate capacitance) of the two transistors as load is also required to have a large channel width W, and thus the load of the whole clocked inverter increases, which prevents high frequency operation. According to the invention, however, it is not necessary to use a double gate transistor (two transistors connected in series) for controlling voltage supply to the output terminal of the clocked inverter, and a single gate transistor can be used instead. Accordingly, the transistor is not required to have a large channel width W and the size of the transistor can be made smaller, leading to high integration. In addition, since it is possible to reduce the load of the element using the gate of the transistors as load, the load of the whole clocked inverter can be reduced and high frequency operation is achieved. Further, capacity of current supply to the output terminal can be improved while reducing the channel width W. Accordingly, it can be prevented that the waveform of a signal outputted from the flip flop circuit becomes dull due to the load of the circuit of the subsequent stage.</p>
