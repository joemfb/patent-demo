<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is entitled to the benefit of, and claims priority to, provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61/133,788, filed Jul. 2, 2008 and entitled &#x201c;METHOD FOR SELECTIVELY REMOVING AN ABRADABLE COATING FROM A SUBSTRATE USING AN ABRASIVE WATER JET,&#x201d; the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for selectively removing portions of an abradable coating from a substrate using a mask or stencil and a water jet, or an abrasive water jet to create a pattern of raised ridges on the abradable coating of the substrate. In typical applications of the present invention, the abradable coating may be a thermal barrier coating (TBC) bonded over a bond coat, or it may be a more abradable coating applied over the TBC, such as a TBC having a filler. A typical bond coat applied to turbine components is known in the trade as a MCrAIY coating.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Materials for gas turbine combustion components, such as liners, shrouds, blades, and the like, have reached their limits relative to heat in the turbine which may exceed the melting point of the components. Two methods are currently used to increase component life in the turbine. The first method is to add holes to the component so that air or other cooling gas can exit the holes and create a film of air across the surface which helps keep it cool. The second method is to add a coating, such as a TBC coating, to the surface of the part. The present invention relates to turbine components or other substrates that have a coating added using the second method. By way of example, the shroud of a turbine usually is in the form of a continuous ring or a series of panels sequentially arranged in a cylindrical pattern to form an enclosure for a rotating turbine rotor having radially extending turbine blades. Somewhat recently, an abradable coating has been added to the surface of the TBC on a turbine shroud to allow a better seal between the blade tips and housing. Upon initial rotation, the rotating blades on the turbine rotor actually cut into the abradable coating, creating a better seal which improves compression in the turbine. There are a variety of abradable materials that may be used depending on the particular application, such as, for example, a TBC coating having a polyester filler that makes the coating more abradable, nickel graphite and AlSi-polyester. However, the abradable coating may be formed of a variety of other similar and known materials, depending on the application of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Included in the abradable coating is a pattern of raised ridges that project outwardly from the surface of the shroud. Currently, these ridges are formed using a thermal spray process and a mask or stencil. The mask is a flat piece of metal with a pattern of openings cut into it. The abradable coating is sprayed through openings in the mask onto the shroud. The openings in the mask allow for the abradable coating to pass through the mask and onto the surface of the shroud, creating the pattern of raised ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unfortunately, the abradable coating builds up in the openings in the mask and quickly begins to reduce the amount of coating which is deposited onto the shroud. Because the mask is repeatedly clogged, the mask must be changed frequently, causing interruption in the thermal spray process. These interruptions may result in the coating being formed as a number of stacked layers instead of the preferred single, uniform layer, and in some cases requires a total rework of the component. This increases the cycle time for the process, lowers the quality with the creation of varying mask openings due to coating buildup, decreases coating bond due to the interruption of the thermal spray process to clean the mask, decreases coating bond due to the addition of lubrication on the mask to reduce coating buildup, and/or significantly degrades the coating integrity and product life.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a need exists for a method of creating the ridges on the substrate that avoids the repetitive, labor-intensive process that is created by using the current thermal spray process and mask.</p>

They include a water jet head <b>24</b> having a mixing chamber <b>26</b> that receives water from a water source <b>28</b>. The apparatus <b>23</b> includes a source <b>30</b> of an abrasive material which is selectively delivered through a metering device <b>31</b> to the mixing chamber <b>26</b>, and the combined water and abrasive is delivered from a delivery nozzle <b>32</b> as a jetted fluid stream or abrasive water jet <b>34</b>, usually in the range of 5,000 psi to 55,000 psi. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the delivery nozzle <b>32</b> is manipulated relative to the workpiece about a plurality of axes (e.g. five axes, as indicated by arrows) by a plurality of motors <b>36</b>, only one of which is shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and these motors are controlled through a conventional control system <b>38</b> that includes a conventional programmable computer (not shown) to position and move the delivery nozzle <b>32</b> relative to the workpiece <b>11</b>, and to properly control the various parameters associated with the apparatus <b>23</b> to vary the material removal rate of the abrasive water jet <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a typical industrial gas turbine component whose abradable coating can be formed utilizing the method of the present invention, but it will be understood that the present invention may be used with many other substrates and other turbine components. The turbine component in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is one typical panel <b>11</b> of a conventional turbine shroud which, as described above, includes a plurality of such panels sequentially arranged in a cylindrical pattern to form an enclosure for a rotating turbine rotor having radially extending turbine blades (not shown). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the composition of a typical shroud panel <b>11</b>. A conventional bond coat <b>14</b> (e.g. a MCrAIY coating) has been applied to the parent material <b>15</b>, and a TBC <b>13</b> has been applied over the bond coat <b>14</b>. Finally, an abradable coating <b>12</b> has been applied over the TBC <b>13</b>. It is the outer surface of the abradable coating <b>12</b> on the shroud panel <b>11</b> that will be engaged by the tips of the rotating turbine blades. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the abradable coating is a TBC coating that includes an AlSi-polyester and nickel graphite filler which provides a more abradable coating than the TBC alone, but other similar abradable coatings may be used, or in some applications of the present invention the conventional TBC layer on the bond coat may form the abradable coating.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of a typical mask or stencil <b>16</b> used to create a pattern of raised ridges in the abradable coating <b>12</b> in accordance with the present invention. The mask <b>16</b> is usually flat, thin, and includes an impervious base portion <b>17</b> in which a desired pattern of openings or slots <b>18</b> pass through the thickness of the mask <b>16</b>. The pattern of the openings <b>18</b> in the mask <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is merely representative of only one of a large number of different patterns that may be formed in the mask <b>16</b>. In many applications of the present invention where air is intended to pass through the furrows, it is preferred to form the openings <b>18</b> with a curved or wavy configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, so that the furrows <b>24</b> formed by the jet passing through the openings <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) will have a more extended length as compared with furrows extending in a straight line, and will therefore provide improved cooling of the shroud panel by the air that passes through the curved furrows <b>24</b>. The mask <b>16</b> is preferably formed of steel, stainless steel, or carbides, but other suitable materials may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a metal substrate, such as the turbine shroud panel <b>11</b> or other workpiece with an abradable coating <b>12</b> that needs to be selectively removed, is mounted on the workpiece holding system <b>35</b>, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the mask <b>16</b> is mounted in position by the workpiece holding system <b>35</b> so that it is adjacent to and above the outer surface of the abradable coating <b>12</b> as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the arrangement of the shroud panel <b>11</b>, the mask <b>16</b>, and the water jet nozzle <b>32</b>. The water jet nozzle <b>32</b> will be moved relative to the workpiece holding system <b>35</b> and the shroud panel <b>11</b> by the control system <b>38</b> of the water jet apparatus <b>23</b> as shown in the exploded view of <b>5</b>A. The direction of movement of the water jet nozzle <b>32</b> by the control system <b>38</b>, which is indicated by the direction arrow <b>19</b>, results in the water jet nozzle <b>32</b> being moved along the extent of each of the openings <b>18</b>, and the water jet <b>34</b> will penetrate the mask <b>16</b> by passing through each of the openings <b>18</b> and the cutting force of the water jet <b>34</b> will remove portions of the abradable coating located beneath the openings <b>18</b> while leaving in place the portions of the abradable coating <b>12</b> that are not located beneath the openings <b>18</b> to thereby form the raised ridges <b>22</b> on the outer surface of the shroud panel <b>11</b>. Thus, by using the high pressure water jet <b>34</b> to remove selected portions of the abradable coating <b>12</b>, furrows or grooves <b>24</b> are formed in the surface of the abradable coating <b>12</b> that correspond to the openings <b>18</b> in the masks <b>16</b>, and the remaining raised ridges <b>22</b> of the abradable coating <b>12</b> are thereby formed between these furrows.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a plan view of the shroud panel <b>11</b> after it has been processed in accordance with the present invention, with the resulting pattern of raised ridges <b>22</b> on the surface of the TBC coating <b>13</b> due to the removal of the sections of the abradable coating <b>12</b> below the openings <b>18</b> of the mask <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-section view of the shroud panel <b>11</b> taken along line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> of the finished shroud panel <b>11</b> that further shows the resultant ridges <b>22</b> left on the surface of the TBC <b>13</b>. Where the turbine component is one panel <b>11</b> of a turbine shroud that forms an enclosure for a rotating turbine blade, the raised ridges <b>22</b> will provide a seal for the rotating turbine blade as described above. When the jet <b>34</b> passes through the openings <b>18</b> in the mask <b>16</b> the abrasive effect caused by the jet <b>34</b> dissipates somewhat as the jet <b>34</b> penetrates the abrasive coating <b>12</b>, and as a result the furrows are usually formed as inverse pyramids as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Preferably, in turbine shroud panels, the ridges <b>22</b> will typically have a height of about 0.045-inch, a width of about 0.075-inch at the base of the ridges, and a width of about 0.020-inch at the top of the ridges <b>22</b>, but these dimensions may vary.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It will be expressly understood, however, that the configuration of the ridges <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are representative only, and the mask <b>16</b> may also be designed to form ridges in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and patterns, depending on the application of the present invention. Likewise, the mask may be designed to form the furrows or spaces between the ridges in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and patterns, depending on how the furrows are to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention is not to be limited to the use of an abrasive water jet and can be carried out as described above with an abrasive water jet, or in some applications with a water only jet, or by a combination of passes with an abrasive water jet followed by or preceded by passes with a water only jet. Although use of the abrasive water jet will reduce cycle time, different factors or conditions may make it desirable to utilize a water jet only in the above combinations.</p>
