<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-377785, filed on Dec. 28, 2005. The entire subject matter of the application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description relates to one or more electronic devices and computer usable media for changing a dialog box to be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, when a personal computer (hereinafter, simply referred to as a PC) controls a printer connected therewith to print a document, an operation of printing the document is performed after configuring settings for pages to be printed, the number of copies, and double face printing on a print setting window (so-called dialog box) displayed by driver software installed in the PC being run.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, a printer driver has further been improved to provide multiple functions and high performances. Conventionally, there has been provided a help function as a support function that allows a user to smoothly perform a printing operation effectively using such a printer driver. When the user wishes to know a procedure of configuring the print settings, for example, by pressing a help key on the screen, the user can refer to a descriptive text regarding the procedure displayed on a screen that the help function provides.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the conventional help function can help the user to effectively use the printer driver, while it is impossible to promptly reach intended setting items associated with a function the user wishes to use or know with a user supporting message provided by the conventional help function. Therefore, a beginner cannot effectively utilize the multifunctional driver with the conventional help function. In addition, when a rank beginner utilizes the conventional help function, it takes a lot of time until the printing operation is performed after reading the descriptive text displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To solve such a problem, there have been invented a printer system and a printing method that allow even the rank beginner to effectively utilize the multifunctional printer driver and to promptly reach the desired print setting items (see Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. HEI 11-73281).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, in order to improve a retrievable property and operability of a printer in the case of utilizing a box provided in the printer as a storage device, there have been invented a printing system configured to designate a printing job to be processed among printing jobs inputted into a plurality of boxes of the printer by an information processing device, and the information processing device, printer, printing method, and program used for the printing system (see Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 2002-323962).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an example of Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. HEI 11-73281, although operations of retrieving and displaying a dialog box are performed, in the case of configuring a setting with the dialog box, information on another setting to be updated associated with the setting is not displayed. Therefore, it might cause a problem that a setting unnecessary for the user is configured.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an example of Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 2002-323962, although it is possible to call for a print dialog box on a box dialog box and configure settings for the printing operation, there are not described details about the settings for the printing operation such as retrieving and displaying the dialog box.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Aspects of the present invention are advantageous in that there can be provided one or more improved electronic device and computer usable media with which it is possible to search and display a process of setting items to be configured until a dialog box for configuring an intended setting item to be updated is displayed in addition to searching the dialog box.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is noted that various connections are set forth between elements in the following description. It is noted that these connections in general and, unless specified otherwise, may be direct or indirect and that this specification is not intended to be limiting in this respect. Aspects of the invention may be implemented in computer software as programs storable on computer-readable media including but not limited to RAMs, ROMs, flash memory, EEPROMs, CD-media, DVD-media, temporary storage, hard disk drives, floppy drives, permanent storage, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">General Overview</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to aspects of the present invention, there is provided an electronic device provided with a plurality of functions, which comprises: a display system configured to display a setting window for configuring setting items for each of the plurality of functions of the electronic device; an input system through which information for configuring the setting items for each of the plurality of functions is inputted on the setting window displayed on the display system; a setting item information storing system configured to store setting item information that includes location information associated with each of the setting items; a setting information storing system configured to store setting information that includes information on an intended setting item to be configured and information on other setting items to be configured prior to configuring the intended setting item associated with each other; a searching system configured to search the intended setting item based on a keyword inputted through the input system and the setting item information stored in the setting item information storing system; a setting information generating system configured to generate setting information that includes information on the intended setting item searched by the searching system and information on said other setting items to be configured prior to configuring the searched setting item associated with each other based on the setting item information stored in the setting item information storing system; and a display control system configured to control the display system to display the setting information generated by the setting information generating system and a setting window for each of the searched setting item and said other setting items to be configured prior to configuring the searched setting item, based on the setting item information and setting information.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to some aspects, it is possible not only to search an intended setting item, but also to check setting items to be configured prior to configuring the intended setting item. Therefore, a user can easily reach the intended setting item that the user wishes to configure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Optionally, the setting items for the plurality of functions of the electronic device may be categorized based on a hierarchy structure. In this case, the setting item information storing system may be configured to store the setting item information that includes hierarchy structural location information based on the hierarchy structure of the setting items associated with each of the setting items.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to some aspects, by referring to the hierarchy structural location information, there is required less searching time than a searching method of sequentially tracing setting operations based on a conventional help function. In addition, it is possible to check how the user can reach the intended setting item from a current setting item.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Optionally, the setting information storing system may be configured to store the setting information, generated by the setting information generating system based on the setting item information, which includes information on setting operations for said other setting items to be configured prior to configuring the intended setting item in an order in which the setting operations are to be configured from a setting for a current setting item based on the hierarchy structure of the setting items.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to some aspects, by referring to the setting information configured as above, since it is possible to check a process of the settings to be configured prior to configuring the intended setting item, the searching time is further reduced.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Optionally, the setting item information storing system may be configured to store the setting item information that includes condition information, which represents a setting condition for a setting item one hierarchy level higher than each of the setting items, the setting condition being necessary for configuring each of the setting items after configuring the setting item one hierarchy level higher than each of the setting items.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to some aspects, by referring to the setting item information configured as above, it is possible to check a setting condition necessary for reaching a setting item from a setting item one hierarchy level higher than the setting item to be reached. Therefore, the user can easily reach the intended setting item.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Optionally, when the searching system has searched a plurality of setting items as the intended setting item, the searching system may be configured to select the intended setting item in accordance with input information inputted through the input system from the plurality of setting items searched by the searching system.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to some aspects, even when the searching system has searched a plurality of setting items as the intended setting item, it is possible to select the intended setting item from the plurality of setting items searched. Thereby, it is possible to search the intended setting item even based on a vague input information (keyword) inputted through the input system.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer usable medium having computer readable instructions that cause a computer to serve as: a display system configured to display a setting window for configuring setting items for each of the plurality of functions of the electronic device; an input system through which necessary information is inputted to configure the setting items for each of the plurality of functions on the setting window displayed on the display system; a setting item information storing system configured to store setting item information that includes location information associated with each of the setting items; a setting information storing system configured to store setting information that includes information on an intended setting item to be configured and information on other setting items to be configured prior to configuring the intended setting item associated with each other; a searching system configured to search the intended setting item based on a keyword inputted through the input system and the setting item information stored in the setting item information storing system; a setting information generating system configured to generate setting information that includes information on the intended setting item searched by the searching system and information on said other setting items to be configured prior to configuring the searched setting item associated with each other based on the setting item information stored in the setting item information storing system; and a display control system configured to control the display system to display the setting information generated by the setting information generating system and a setting window for each of the searched setting item and said other setting items to be configured prior to configuring the searched setting item.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The communication I/F <b>4</b> is configured with a network adapter having an interface function between a Local Area Network (LAN) <b>92</b> and itself. Thereby, communication with devices connected with the LAN <b>92</b> such as the printer <b>91</b> is attained.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The display portion <b>5</b> is configured with a display device such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) device and CRT device. The operating portion <b>6</b> is configured with a pointing device such as a mouse or an operating means such as a keyboard.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The control circuit <b>2</b> is configured as a normal computer, and provided with a CPU <b>21</b>, ROM <b>22</b>, RAM <b>23</b>, input/output interface (I/O) <b>24</b>, and bus line <b>25</b> for connecting those elements. The CPU <b>21</b> performs a control operation based on the OS program <b>3</b>S stored in the HDD <b>3</b>. The OS program <b>3</b>S is run using a work memory for an OS <b>2</b>S on the RAM <b>23</b> as a working area. In addition, the application program <b>3</b>A and printer driver program <b>3</b>P are run using a work memory for an application <b>2</b>A and work memory <b>2</b>P for a printer driver on the RAM <b>23</b> as working areas, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The printer <b>91</b> is connected with the LAN <b>92</b> to be capable of data communication with the PC <b>1</b>, and perform a printing process in response to receiving an instruction from the PC <b>1</b>. In order for the printer <b>91</b> to operate in this manner, the printer driver <b>8</b>P corresponding to the printer <b>91</b> is required to be installed into the PC <b>1</b>. It is noted that although the printer <b>91</b> is indirectly connected with the PC <b>1</b> through the LAN <b>92</b> in the embodiment, it may directly be connected with the PC <b>1</b> through a parallel port or a USB port (both not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An operation of the PC <b>1</b> will be described. The PC <b>1</b> attains the function of the printer driver <b>8</b>P shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with CPU <b>21</b> running the printer driver program <b>3</b>P stored in the HDD <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The printer driver <b>8</b>P is a module that generates printing data depending on the printer <b>91</b> as an output device and transmits the printing data, and includes a main image generating portion <b>81</b>, setting portion <b>82</b>, image size acquiring portion <b>83</b>, image arranging portion <b>84</b>, minifying portion <b>85</b>, and output portion <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When a user creates an arbitrary manuscript with the application <b>8</b>A of a level than the printer driver <b>8</b>P and provides a printing instruction for printing the manuscript, manuscript data are supplied to the printer driver <b>8</b>P to print the manuscript with the printer <b>91</b>. In response to the manuscript data being supplied, the main image generating portion <b>81</b> generates image data of image to be printed (data of a main image), for example, as bit map data based on the supplied manuscript data. Then, a dialog box &#x201c;Print Settings for Printer&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is displayed on a screen of the display portion <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Operating the operating portion <b>6</b> while watching a dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d;, the user configures settings for a media type (paper type), quality (image quality), paper size, page layout (the number of printed pages per paper), a border line for indicating a border of each of pages in the case of printing a plurality of pages on each paper, a print orientation (portrait/landscape), the number of copies, and the like. Further, when changing settings for other functions, the user opens a dialog box &#x201c;Advanced&#x201d; or &#x201c;Support&#x201d;, and configures setting items included in each of the dialog boxes (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After the setting by the user has been completed and a button &#x201c;Apply&#x201d; has been clicked, in the printer driver <b>8</b>P, the image arranging portion <b>84</b> creates layout data based on instructions that has been provided to the setting portion <b>82</b> based on the setting data inputted.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At this time, when a manuscript size read out by the image size acquiring potion <b>83</b> is different from a paper size, or when two or more manuscripts are printed on a single page, the manuscript size is minified to conform to the paper size by the minifying portion <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, when a button &#x201c;OK&#x201d; is clicked, after the same operations as the case of the button &#x201c;Apply&#x201d; being clicked have been performed, the layout data created by the image arranging portion <b>84</b> are sent to the output portion <b>86</b>. Then, the layout data are sent to the printer <b>91</b> via the communication I/F <b>4</b> and the LAN <b>92</b>, and the printing operation is performed by the printer <b>91</b> based on the layout data.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a dialog searching process will be explained. Firstly, when the user creates a manuscript and issues the print instruction with the application <b>8</b>A at a higher level than the printer driver <b>8</b>P, the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; in the dialog box &#x201c;Print Settings for Printer&#x201d;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, is displayed on the screen of the display portion <b>5</b> (S<b>1</b>). Here, when a button &#x201c;Search&#x201d; is clicked (S<b>2</b>: Yes), a searching dialog box <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is displayed (S<b>3</b>), for example, in a manner overlapped in front of the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, when a name of a setting item to be configured or a portion thereof (keyword) is inputted in a keyword entry field of the searching dialog box <b>1</b> (S<b>4</b>) and a button &#x201c;Jump&#x201d; is clicked (S<b>5</b>: Yes), the searching dialog box <b>1</b> is closed (S<b>6</b>). A dialog box for a setting item whose name corresponds to or includes the inputted keyword is searched with reference to the dialog information <b>3</b>D (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>: to be described in detail later) stored in the HDD <b>3</b> (S<b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Subsequently, as a result of the searching, when two or more setting items (dialog boxes) corresponding to the inputted keyword have been found (S<b>8</b>: Yes), a searching dialog box <b>2</b> for selecting a keyword as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is displayed (S<b>9</b>), and an intended keyword is selected (S<b>10</b>). An example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the result of the searching in the case where a keyword &#x201c;color&#x201d; is inputted. There are stored in the dialog information keywords &#x201c;Color&#x201d; and &#x201c;Color Density (Color Enhancement)&#x201d;. Therefore, there are displayed setting item names including the keyword &#x201c;color&#x201d; and setting item names listed in front and in the rear thereof. In addition, such a configuration that only the setting item names including the keyword &#x201c;color&#x201d; are displayed may be possible.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When, on the searching dialog box <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for instance, &#x201c;Color Density (Color Enhancement)&#x201d; is selected (S<b>11</b>:Yes), the searching dialog box <b>2</b> is closed (S<b>12</b>). Then, a dialog jumping process (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>: to be described in detail later) for going to the intended setting item (dialog box) &#x201c;Color Density (Color Enhancement)&#x201d; is executed (S<b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">On the other hand, when only one keyword is found as a result of the searching, for example, in the case where the keyword &#x201c;Color Density&#x201d; is inputted into the entry field of the searching dialog box <b>1</b> (S<b>8</b>: No), the dialog jumping process is executed without the searching dialog box <b>2</b> being displayed (S<b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, when the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is displayed and a &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button (or a button indicated by a sign &#x201c;x&#x201d; in the center of &#x201c;&#x25a1;&#x201d;, the same applies to following drawings) is clicked (S<b>2</b>: No&#x2192;S<b>14</b>: Yes), the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d;, that is, the dialog box &#x201c;Print Settings for Printer&#x201d; is closed (S<b>15</b>), and another process of the application <b>8</b>A is executed. Further, when one of operations other than clicking the &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button (S<b>14</b>: No), a process according to the operation is performed (S<b>16</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, when the searching dialog box <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is displayed and a &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button is clicked (S<b>5</b>:No&#x2192;S<b>17</b>: Yes), the searching dialog box <b>1</b> is closed (S<b>18</b>), and the process goes back to the step of S<b>1</b>, where the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, when the searching dialog box <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is displayed and a &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button is clicked (S<b>11</b>: No&#x2192;S<b>19</b>: Yes), the searching dialog box <b>2</b> is closed (S<b>20</b>), and the process goes back to the step of S<b>3</b>, where the searching dialog box <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 10</figref>, the dialog jumping process corresponding to the step of S<b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will be described. Firstly, for example, when the keyword &#x201c;Color Density (Color Enhancement)&#x201d; is selected and the &#x201c;Jump&#x201d; button is clicked on the searching dialog box <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is executed a dialog change information generating process (S<b>31</b>: to be described in detail later) where the dialog change information list <b>3</b>L (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>: to be described in detail later) is generated with reference to the dialog information <b>3</b>D (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>: to be described in detail later) and the jump destination information <b>3</b>J (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>: to be described in detail later).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Subsequently, a dialog change information window is displayed on the screen of the display portion <b>5</b> (S<b>32</b>) based on the dialog change information list <b>3</b>L (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>: to be described in detail later). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an example of the dialog change information window, where there is displayed dialog change information in the case where a dialog box to be displayed is changed from the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; being currently displayed to a dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d;. The dialog change information window shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> indicates a procedure of operations as follows: firstly, a &#x201c;Set&#x201d; button is clicked on the &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; dialog box to open a dialog box &#x201c;Quality&#x201d;; subsequently, a check box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; is checked to change a state of the setting item from an OFF (invalid) state to an ON (valid) state; finally, a &#x201c;Setting&#x201d; button is clicked so as to open the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the user judges that there is no problem in the dialog change process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and an &#x201c;OK&#x201d; button is clicked on the dialog change information window shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (S<b>33</b>: Yes), the dialog change information window is closed (S<b>34</b>), and the intended dialog box is opened (S<b>35</b>). In order to change the dialog box to be displayed, in a state where the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; is displayed on the screen of the display portion <b>5</b>, firstly, the dialog box &#x201c;Print Quality&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is displayed in a manner overlapped on the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d;. Next, there is displayed a state where the check box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; is checked. Then, the same display image as the &#x201c;Setting&#x201d; button being clicked is displayed, and the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is displayed. Here, the user can adjust the color density.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is displayed, in order to indicate that the intended dialog box has finally been opened, a title bar (a frame portion in which characters &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; is displayed) may be configured to blink a predetermined number of times such as three times, or to be displayed in a color different from a normal display color for a predetermined time period such as three seconds after the intended dialog box has been opened.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the meantime, when a &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button is clicked in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, settings up to a setting immediately prior to adjusting the color density, i.e., settings up to &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; set in the ON (valid) state are effective. At this time, contents read into the work memory <b>2</b>P for the printer driver is totally cleared. In addition, there may be possible such a configuration that the dialog boxes are sequentially displayed to track back the dialog change process indicated in the dialog change information list <b>3</b>L (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>: to be described in detail later) from the currently displayed dialog box (the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d;) to the dialog box on which the &#x201c;Search&#x201d; button has been clicked (the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d;) when the &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button is clicked, and that at that time, the settings configured are restored to their original state.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, when the user does not wish to configure the settings for &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d;, after clicking the &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button at the time the dialog change information window shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is displayed (S<b>33</b>: No S<b>36</b>: Yes), the dialog change information window is closed (S<b>37</b>), and the process goes back to the state where the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; is displayed (S<b>1</b>). At this time, contents read into the work memory ZP for the printer driver are totally cleared.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 17</figref>, the dialog change information generating process corresponding to the step of S<b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> will be described. Firstly, the printer driver setting information <b>3</b>K stored in the HDD <b>3</b> is read into the work memory <b>2</b>P for the printer driver (S<b>41</b>). Next, with reference to the dialog information <b>3</b>D (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>: to be described in detail later) and the jump destination information <b>3</b>J (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>: to be described in detail later), dialog information regarding the current dialog box and the dialog box as a jump destination inputted on the searching dialog box <b>2</b> is obtained (S<b>42</b>). Further, a current dialog location (to be described in detail later) is read into a dialog location information buffer whose memory area is secured in the work memory <b>2</b>P for the printer driver.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Subsequently, there is executed a process of comparing main dialog locations for the current dialog box and the dialog box as the jump destination (S<b>43</b>: to be described in detail later). In the same manner, there are executed a process of comparing sub dialog locations for the current dialog box and the dialog box as the jump destination (S<b>44</b>: to be described in detail later), and then a process of comparing sub-sub dialog locations for the both dialog boxes (S<b>45</b>: to be described in detail later). Then, based on the dialog change information updated through the steps of S<b>43</b> to S<b>45</b>, information on the dialog change process is obtained, so as to generate the dialog change information list <b>3</b>L (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>: to be described in detail later) (S<b>46</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the main dialog location comparing process corresponding to the step of S<b>43</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> will be described. Firstly, with reference to the dialog information <b>3</b>D (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>: to be described in detail later), the main dialog location for the currently displayed dialog box is compared with the main dialog location for the dialog box as the jump destination (S<b>51</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows an example of the dialog information <b>3</b>D. The dialog information <b>3</b>D is configured with information on dialog name, information on dialog location, and condition information. The dialog location is expressed as a hexadecimal number with three digits that represent the main dialog location, sub dialog location, sub-sub dialog location in sequence from the largest digit, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For example, the location of the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; is represented as a main dialog location <b>1</b> (0x100). In addition, the location of the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; is expressed by &#x201c;0x111&#x201d;, as it is in a sub-sub dialog location <b>1</b> (0x001) that is located at a further lower level than a sub dialog location <b>1</b> (0x000: the dialog box &#x201c;Quality&#x201d;) that is located at a lower level than the main dialog location <b>1</b> (0x100: the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d;). Further, the dialog location of the dialog box &#x201c;User Defined Size&#x201d; is expressed by &#x201c;0x120&#x201d;, as it is in a sub dialog location <b>2</b> (0x020) that is located at a lower level than the main dialog location <b>1</b> (0x100).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition, the condition information represents a condition required for opening a corresponding sub dialog box or sub-sub dialog box. Condition information &#x201c;0&#x201d; means no condition. In addition, condition information &#x201c;1&#x201d; for the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; means that it is required for opening the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; to configure a setting for &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; ON (valid). Further, condition information &#x201c;2&#x201d; for the dialog box &#x201c;User Defined Size&#x201d; means that it is required for opening the dialog box &#x201c;User Defined Size&#x201d; to set a paper size to a user defined size.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows an example of the jump destination information <b>3</b>J. The jump destination information <b>3</b>J represents a location of a setting item to be configured as the jump destination, and includes location information A that represents a location of a dialog box containing the setting item as the jump destination and location information B that represents a location of the setting item as the jump destination in the dialog box containing it. The location information A is expressed as a hexadecimal number with three digits that represent the main dialog location, sub dialog location, sub-sub dialog location in sequence from the largest digit, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">For example, the location information A of the setting item &#x201c;Color Density&#x201d; is expressed by &#x201c;0x111&#x201d;, as the setting item &#x201c;Color Density&#x201d; is included in the sub-sub dialog location <b>1</b> (0x001: the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d;) that is located at a further lower level than the sub dialog location <b>1</b> (0x010: the dialog box &#x201c;Quality&#x201d;) that is located at a lower level than the main dialog location <b>1</b> (0x100: the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d;). Further, the location information B of the setting item &#x201c;Color Density&#x201d; is expressed by &#x201c;1&#x201d;, as the setting item &#x201c;Color Density&#x201d; is located at the head of the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In addition, the location information A of the setting item &#x201c;User Defined Size&#x201d; is expressed by &#x201c;0x120&#x201d;, as the setting item &#x201c;User Defined Size&#x201d; is included in the sub dialog location <b>2</b> (0x020: the dialog box &#x201c;User Defined Size&#x201d;) that is located at a lower level than the main dialog location <b>1</b> (0x100: the dialog box &#x201c;Basic&#x201d;). Further, since the setting item &#x201c;User Defined Size&#x201d; is set on the dialog box &#x201c;User Defined Size&#x201d;, the location information B thereof is expressed by &#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It is noted that the dialog location (0x111) of the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> represents the location of the dialog box for actually configuring settings for &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d;, while the location information A (0x110) of the jump destination for &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; represents the location of the dialog box for performing an operation for opening the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> again, when the main dialog location of the currently displayed dialog box is the same as that of the dialog box as the jump destination (S<b>51</b>: Yes), the process is terminated, and the next process of comparing sub dialog locations is started (S<b>44</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Meanwhile, when the main dialog location of the currently displayed dialog box is different from that of the dialog box as the jump destination (S<b>51</b>: No), the dialog location of the currently displayed dialog box is read into the dialog location information buffer. Then, it is checked whether a numerical value of the digit for the sub-sub dialog location of the dialog location stored in the dialog location information buffer is a numerical value other than &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>52</b>). When it is judged that the numerical value of the digit for the sub-sub dialog location of the dialog location stored in the dialog location information buffer is a numerical value other than &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>52</b>: Yes), information &#x201c;The sub-sub dialog box is closed&#x201d; is added to the dialog change information (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>: to be described in detail later) (S<b>56</b>). Then, the information on the sub-sub dialog location of the dialog location stored in the dialog location information buffer is cleared (S<b>57</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Next, it is checked whether a numerical value of the digit for the sub dialog location of the dialog location stored in the dialog location information buffer is a numerical value other than &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>53</b>). When it is judged that the numerical value of the digit for the sub dialog location of the dialog location stored in the dialog location information buffer is a numerical value other than &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>53</b>: Yes), information &#x201c;The sub dialog box is closed&#x201d; is added to the dialog change information (S<b>58</b>). Then, the information on the sub dialog location of the dialog location stored in the dialog location information buffer is cleared (S<b>59</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Subsequently, with reference to the dialog location information as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, it is checked whether a condition for the condition information exists on a process until the main dialog box for the jump destination is opened (namely, whether a value other than &#x201c;0&#x201d; for the condition information exists on the process until the main dialog box for the jump destination is opened) (S<b>54</b>). When a value of the condition information is different from that in the printer driver setting information <b>3</b>K as the current settings, or when a condition for the condition information exists on the process until the main dialog box for the jump destination is opened (S<b>54</b>: Yes), the condition information is added to the dialog change information (S<b>60</b>). Finally, information &#x201c;The main dialog box is changed&#x201d; is added to the dialog change information. Then, the current dialog location is replaced with the main dialog location included in the location information A, obtained from the jump destination information <b>3</b>J, of the dialog box as the jump destination (S<b>55</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When the currently displayed dialog box is changed from &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> to &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, since the main dialog location (I) for &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; (0x100) is the same as the main dialog location (<b>1</b>) for &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; (0x111), no step of S<b>52</b> to S<b>60</b> is executed in the aforementioned process.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In addition, when the currently displayed dialog box is changed from &#x201c;Custom Image Type&#x201d; (0x210) to &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; (0x111) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the main dialog locations for the both dialog boxes are different (the main dialog location for &#x201c;Custom Image Type&#x201d; is &#x201c;2&#x201d;, while that for &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; is &#x201c;1&#x201d;), and the dialog location of the dialog box &#x201c;Color Enhancement&#x201d; stored in the dialog location information buffer corresponds to a location of a sub-sub dialog box. Therefore, information of &#x201c;The sub-sub dialog box is closed&#x201d;, &#x201c;The sub dialog box is closed&#x201d;, and &#x201c;The main dialog box is changed to &#x201c;Advanced (Color)&#x201d;&#x201d; is added to the dialog change information. Then, the location information A (0x200) for the dialog box &#x201c;Advanced (Color)&#x201d; as the jump destination is obtained and defined as a current dialog location. It is noted that since the value of the condition information for &#x201c;Advanced (Color)&#x201d; is &#x201c;0&#x201d;, no condition information is added to the dialog change information.</p>
