<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for fulfilling requests in an inventory system includes receiving a request indicating an activity to be completed. The method also includes selecting a holder to fulfill the request and an inventory station at which to fulfill the request. The inventory station is associated with a queue that includes a plurality of queue spaces. The method further includes moving the selected holder from a first location to a second location remote from the selected inventory station. Additionally, the method also includes determining that a trigger event has occurred and, in response to determining that the trigger event has occurred, moving the selected holder from the second location to a queue space of a queue associated with the selected inventory station.</p>

More generally, however, management module <b>15</b> may select suitable components to complete tasks associated with a particular operation request <b>60</b> based on any appropriate factors, considerations, or criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After management module <b>15</b> selects suitable components and/or elements to complete operation request <b>60</b>, management module <b>15</b> may then communicate information to the selected components indicating tasks to be completed by these components or their operators and/or identifying one or more of the other selected components involved in completion of the requested operation. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, management module <b>15</b> communicates task requests <b>62</b> to selected components to communicate information regarding tasks to be completed by the receiving components and/or other components to be involved in completing the relevant tasks. Task requests <b>62</b> may represent communication of any suitable form to initiate completion of tasks by the receiving components, such as instructions, commands, and/or requests appropriately formatted for the receiving components.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The selected components may then utilize the received information to complete tasks associated with the relevant operation request <b>60</b>. For example, based on instructions received from management module <b>15</b>, a selected mobile drive unit <b>20</b> may move a selected inventory holder <b>30</b> to a selected inventory station <b>50</b> so that an operator of the selected inventory station <b>50</b> may pick requested inventory items <b>32</b> from the selected inventory holder <b>30</b> and pack them for shipment. Similarly, an operator of an inventory station <b>50</b> may receive information from management module <b>15</b> identifying inventory items <b>32</b> to be selected from an inventory holder <b>30</b> moved to the relevant inventory station <b>50</b> and packed in a container <b>42</b> as part of fulfilling an operation request <b>60</b> received by management module <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Because, in particular embodiments, the operation of inventory system <b>10</b> is constrained by limits on space, system components, and/or other resources, the efficient use of such resources may increase the throughput and efficiency of inventory system <b>10</b>. As a result, in particular embodiments, management module <b>15</b> may employ various techniques to progressively move, or &#x201c;drift,&#x201d; inventory holders <b>30</b>, container holders <b>40</b>, or other components of inventory system <b>10</b> towards inventory stations <b>50</b>, other system resources, or other destinations within workspace <b>70</b>. By moving the relevant component towards its destination in stages, management module <b>15</b> may be able to time its arrival in a manner that results in more efficient use of space and system resources.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To facilitate this drifting, certain areas within workspace <b>70</b> may be designated as drift spaces <b>90</b>, where components can wait until an appropriate event has occurred triggering further movement of the component, either to another intermediate location or a final destination. Drift spaces <b>90</b> may represent any appropriately sized and shaped area of workspace <b>70</b> and may be located at any suitable location within workspace <b>70</b>. Additionally, as noted above, drift spaces <b>90</b> may represent fixed, predetermined locations within workspace <b>70</b> or may represent a dynamically allocated areas of workspace <b>70</b> that may be selected and designated as appropriate during operation of inventory system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Drift spaces <b>90</b> may be used by management module <b>15</b> in any appropriate manner in completing the tasks associated with operation requests <b>60</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, management module <b>15</b> may park a component destined for a particular system resource, such as an inventory station <b>50</b>, in a drift space <b>90</b> until certain conditions are satisfied (e.g., the resource becomes available for use by the component or the number of other components waiting in the vicinity of the system resource falls below some maximum threshold). This may allow management module <b>15</b> to limit congestion in the vicinity of the system resource but also allow management module <b>15</b> to reduce the completion time of the relevant operation by positioning the relevant component closer to the system resource while the component waits for the system resource.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, the use of drift spaces <b>90</b> may allow a system component to be positioned close to multiple different instances of a particular system resource and move to the first instance that becomes available. For example, a component may be moved to a drift space <b>90</b> removed from all active inventory stations <b>50</b> but in relatively close proximity to these inventory stations <b>50</b>. The component may then wait in its drift space <b>90</b> until an inventory station <b>50</b> needs the component or an inventory station <b>50</b> becomes available to complete a task involving that component. Because the component is moved to an appropriate drift space <b>90</b> prior to an inventory station <b>50</b> becoming available or needing the component, the component can be quickly repositioned at any of the inventory stations <b>50</b> as soon as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, in certain embodiments, a particular drift space <b>90</b> may be designated exclusively for drifting particular types of components, drifting components associated with a particular trigger event, drifting components for a particular purpose, and/or drifting components destined for a particular location. For example, a first drift space <b>90</b> may be designated as a waiting place for inventory holders <b>30</b> responding to specific retrieval requests <b>160</b>, while a second drift space <b>90</b> may be designated as a waiting place for container holders <b>40</b> waiting for a container request <b>260</b> to fulfill. Depending on the configuration of inventory system <b>10</b>, such exclusive drift spaces <b>90</b> may be designated when inventory system <b>10</b> begins operation or at any appropriate time during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Alternatively, a particular drift space <b>90</b> may be designated for use for any type of drifting, and drift spaces <b>90</b> may be used interchangeably by components of inventory system <b>10</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, a particular drift space <b>90</b> may be used, at different times, as a waiting place for both inventory holders <b>30</b> and container holders <b>40</b> en route to various different locations. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, a type of a particular drift space <b>90</b> may be designated dynamically during operation of inventory system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As a result, drift spaces <b>90</b> may be used in many different ways to provide improved efficiency and throughput in inventory system <b>10</b>. Additionally, in particular embodiments, drift spaces <b>90</b> may be used flexibly to dynamically optimize the effectiveness of inventory system <b>10</b>. Consequently, the use of drift spaces <b>90</b> may provide numerous benefits in inventory system <b>10</b>. Specific embodiments, however, may provide some, none, or all of these benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> provide specific examples of how drift spaces <b>90</b> may be used in particular embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b> in fulfilling particular types of operation requests <b>60</b>. As explained further below, in particular embodiments, the use of drift spaces <b>90</b> may limit congestion, reduce task-completion times, and/or otherwise improve system efficiency or throughput. As a result, certain embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b> may provide a number of operational benefits. Specific embodiments may, however, provide some, none, or all of these benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate one example of how drift spaces <b>90</b> can be used in particular embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b> to improve system efficiency in responding to particular types of operation requests <b>60</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> describe the operation of certain embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b> in responding to a particular type of operation request <b>60</b> (referred to here as a &#x201c;retrieval request <b>160</b>&#x201d;) that identifies one or more inventory items <b>32</b> to be retrieved from storage in inventory system <b>10</b>. In response to receiving retrieval request <b>160</b>, management module <b>15</b> instructs mobile drive units <b>20</b> to transport inventory holders <b>30</b> storing inventory items <b>32</b> requested by retrieval request <b>160</b> to a particular inventory station <b>50</b> so that the requested inventory items <b>32</b> can be collected and prepared for shipping. If several inventory holders <b>30</b> are involved in fulfilling retrieval request <b>160</b>, management module <b>15</b> may utilize drift spaces <b>90</b> to position one or more of these inventory holders <b>30</b> close to the relevant inventory station <b>50</b> and then move them to that inventory station <b>50</b> as space becomes available nearby. Thus, as explained further below, drift spaces <b>90</b> may allow management module <b>15</b> to limit the number of inventory holders <b>30</b> that are placed in the vicinity of the relevant inventory station <b>50</b> while at the same time reducing the lengthy wait time that could result if additional inventory holders <b>30</b> had to be retrieved from their original storage spaces <b>76</b> when inventory station <b>50</b> was ready to process these inventory holders <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an overhead view of a particular embodiment of inventory system <b>10</b> in fulfilling an example retrieval request <b>160</b>. As noted above, retrieval request <b>160</b> is an operation request <b>60</b> that identifies one or more types of inventory items <b>32</b> to be retrieved from storage in inventory system <b>10</b>. In particular embodiments, retrieval request <b>160</b> may represent a customer order received by inventory system <b>10</b> and may identify one or more inventory items <b>32</b> to be packaged and shipped to the ordering customer. Inventory items <b>32</b> ordered by the customer may be retrieved from inventory holders <b>30</b> at an inventory station <b>50</b> and packaged for shipping (e.g., in a container <b>42</b>) or otherwise processed in accordance with the retrieval request <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the illustrated example, management module <b>15</b> responds to retrieval request <b>160</b> by selecting an inventory station <b>50</b>, one or more inventory holders <b>30</b>, and one or more mobile drive units <b>20</b> to fulfill retrieval request <b>160</b>. As noted above, management module <b>15</b> may select these components based on any appropriate considerations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example in which management module <b>15</b> selects three mobile drive units <b>20</b> (shown as mobile drive units <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, and <b>20</b><i>c</i>) three inventory holders <b>30</b> (shown as inventory holders <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, and <b>30</b><i>c</i>) to fulfill retrieval request <b>160</b> at a selected inventory station (shown as inventory station <b>50</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">After selecting the relevant components, management module <b>15</b> may communicate one or more task requests <b>62</b> to each of the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> to facilitate transport of the selected inventory holders <b>30</b> to the selected inventory station <b>50</b>. The task requests <b>62</b> transmitted to each mobile drive unit <b>20</b> identify a selected inventory holder <b>30</b> in terms of its location or an identifier associated with the selected inventory holder <b>30</b>. The selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> then move to the selected inventory holders <b>30</b> (as shown by arrows <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and dock with them. After docking, the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> begin moving the selected inventory holders <b>30</b> towards the selected inventory station <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Depending on the number of inventory holders <b>30</b> selected to fulfill retrieval request <b>160</b>, the size of a queue associated with the selected inventory station <b>50</b>, and/or other appropriate considerations, management module <b>15</b> may instruct one or more mobile drive units <b>20</b> to temporarily move their associated inventory holder <b>30</b> to a drift space <b>90</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, management module <b>15</b> is configured to drift one or more inventory holders <b>30</b> destined for a particular inventory station <b>50</b> when the number of inventory holders <b>30</b> en route to that inventory station <b>50</b> is greater than two. As a result, in the illustrated example, management module <b>15</b> drifts one of the selected inventory holders <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>instead of moving the relevant inventory holder <b>30</b> directly to inventory station <b>50</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, if management module <b>15</b> decides, in responding to retrieval request <b>160</b>, to drift one or more inventory holders <b>30</b>, management module <b>15</b> may select the inventory holder <b>30</b> or inventory holders <b>30</b> to drift based on any suitable criteria or consideration. For example, management module <b>15</b> may select inventory holders <b>30</b> to drift based on the distance between the drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> and the selected inventory station <b>50</b>, the inventory items <b>32</b> stored by the drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> (e.g., to allow retrieved inventory items <b>32</b> to be packaged in a particular order in a container <b>42</b>), the time required for the corresponding mobile drive unit <b>20</b> to transport the drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> to the selected inventory station <b>50</b>, and/or any other appropriate considerations or criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The mobile drive units <b>20</b> associated with inventory holders <b>30</b> to be drifted, then move the drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> to one of drift spaces <b>90</b>, while the remaining mobile drive units <b>20</b> move their corresponding inventory holders <b>30</b> to the selected inventory station <b>50</b>. In particular embodiments, management module <b>15</b> may select a particular drift space <b>90</b> for each drifted inventory holder <b>30</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, management module <b>15</b> selects an appropriate drift space <b>90</b> for each drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> from a list of currently-available drift spaces <b>90</b> and communicates a task request <b>62</b> identifying the selected drift space <b>90</b> and/or its locations to the mobile drive unit <b>20</b> docked to the drifted inventory holders <b>30</b>. Alternatively, in particular embodiments, mobile drive units <b>20</b> may themselves determine the drift spaces <b>90</b> that are available and select a particular drift space <b>90</b> from among the available drift spaces <b>90</b>. Thus, in the illustrated example, mobile drive units <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>move their respective inventory holders <b>30</b> to inventory station <b>50</b><i>a </i>(as shown by arrows <b>304</b><i>a </i>and <b>304</b><i>b</i>). Additionally, management module <b>15</b> selects drift space <b>90</b><i>a </i>for inventory holder <b>30</b><i>c </i>and instructs mobile drive unit <b>20</b><i>c </i>to move inventory holder <b>30</b><i>c </i>to drift space <b>90</b><i>a</i>. Mobile drive unit <b>20</b><i>c </i>then moves to drift space <b>90</b><i>a </i>(as shown by arrow <b>306</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> then wait in drift spaces <b>90</b> until one or more trigger events occur. These trigger events may represent any suitable events associated with the drifted inventory holders <b>30</b>, the selected inventory station <b>50</b>, any other component of inventory station <b>50</b>, and/or any aspect of the operation of inventory system <b>10</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, the trigger events may be selected, in part, to limit the number of inventory holders <b>30</b> that are moved into the vicinity of the selected inventory station <b>50</b> at any given time. Thus, in such embodiments, the trigger events may relate to or involve the expiration of a delay period, an indication from the selected inventory station <b>50</b> (or an operator of the selected inventory station <b>50</b>) that a certain number of the selected inventory holders <b>30</b> have been processed, or any other occurrence that indicates or suggests a certain number of the selected inventory holders <b>30</b> have been or should have been moved out of the vicinity of the selected inventory station <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Furthermore, in particular embodiments, a particular inventory holder <b>30</b> may wait in drift spaces <b>90</b> until multiple trigger events occur. For example, in certain embodiments, a particular drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> may wait in a drift space <b>90</b> until one or more other drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> move towards their final destinations and some other trigger event occurs. This may allow drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> to depart from drift spaces <b>90</b> in a particular order, based on a time of arrival, a priority level, and/or other factors. Furthermore, different inventory holders <b>30</b> may be associated with different trigger events. Consequently, in particular embodiments, all drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> in drift spaces <b>90</b> may wait for the same trigger event or events, and their corresponding mobile drive units <b>20</b> may move them to their destination when the trigger event or events occur. In other embodiments or under other circumstances, different inventory holders <b>30</b> may be associated with different trigger events, with each drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> waiting in a drift space <b>90</b> until the trigger event associated with that particular drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Depending on the configuration and capabilities of management module <b>15</b> and mobile drive units <b>20</b>, management module <b>15</b> may notify a mobile drive unit <b>20</b> associated with a particular drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> that the trigger event associated with that inventory holder <b>30</b> has occurred, the mobile drive unit <b>20</b> may itself determine that the trigger event has occurred, or both components may be configured to detect some or all of the trigger events occurring in inventory system <b>10</b>. Additionally, in particular embodiments, the trigger event may represent receipt, by the relevant mobile drive unit <b>20</b>, of instructions (e.g., task requests <b>62</b>) from management module <b>15</b> or another element of inventory system <b>10</b> instructing that mobile drive unit <b>20</b> to move an inventory holder <b>30</b> from a drift space <b>90</b> in which it is waiting to another destination.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Once the trigger event associated with a particular drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> has occurred and/or the mobile drive unit <b>20</b> transporting that drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> has received any appropriate notification of such occurrence, the transporting mobile drive unit <b>20</b> moves the relevant inventory holder <b>30</b> to its destination. At its destination, the drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> is processed in accordance with the retrieval request and inventory items <b>32</b> identified by retrieval request <b>160</b> are removed from the drifted inventory holder <b>30</b>. These inventory items <b>32</b> may be combined with inventory items <b>32</b> selected from other inventory holders <b>30</b> to complete fulfillment of retrieval request <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the illustrated example, the trigger event associated with drifted inventory holder <b>30</b><i>c </i>is the departure of one or more inventory holders <b>30</b> from queue <b>80</b><i>a </i>associated with inventory station <b>50</b><i>a</i>. As a result, when management module <b>15</b> determines that mobile drive unit <b>20</b><i>a </i>has exited queue <b>80</b><i>a </i>of inventory station <b>50</b> (as shown by arrow <b>308</b>), management module <b>15</b> transmits a task request <b>62</b> to mobile drive unit <b>20</b><i>c</i>, which is waiting in drift space <b>90</b><i>a</i>. In response to this task request <b>62</b>, mobile drive unit <b>20</b><i>c </i>moves inventory holder <b>30</b><i>c </i>to inventory station <b>50</b><i>a </i>(as shown by arrow <b>310</b>). At inventory station <b>50</b><i>a</i>, inventory items <b>32</b> identified by retrieval request <b>160</b> are then removed from inventory holder <b>30</b><i>c </i>to complete the fulfillment of retrieval request <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> focuses on an example embodiment of inventory system <b>10</b> that implements the described techniques in a particular manner, various embodiments may implement the utilized techniques in any appropriate manner. For example, in the described embodiment, a particular mobile drive unit <b>20</b> transports each drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> or container holder <b>40</b> to a drift space <b>90</b> and then waits with the drifted holder until the trigger event or events occur. In alternative embodiments, however, mobile drive units <b>20</b> may transport drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> to drift spaces <b>90</b> and leave these drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> in drift spaces <b>90</b>. Other mobile drive units <b>20</b> may then be responsible for moving the drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> to their final destination once the trigger event or events occur. Moreover, in particular embodiments, a particular mobile drive unit <b>20</b> or group of mobile drive units <b>20</b> may be used to move all drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> between drift spaces <b>90</b> and a final destination of the drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> and/or between the various drift spaces <b>90</b> to manage the use of drift spaces <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Additionally, as noted above, drift spaces <b>90</b> in workspace <b>70</b> may, in particular embodiments, be utilized for more than one purpose or may be associated with more than one destination in workspace <b>70</b>. Consequently, a particular drift space <b>90</b> may, at various different times, be used to drift inventory holders <b>30</b> destined for multiple different inventory stations <b>50</b>. As a result, in fulfilling a subsequent retrieval request <b>160</b>, the process described above may be repeated with a second mobile drive unit <b>20</b> destined for a second inventory station <b>50</b> waiting in the same drift space <b>90</b> for a particular trigger event to occur. Thus, in particular embodiments, drift spaces <b>90</b> may be used to flexibly drift mobile drive units <b>20</b> and inventory holders <b>30</b> destined for different inventory stations <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, although the description above describes, for purposes of simplicity, an example in which a final destination is selected for drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> before they begin drifting, in alternative embodiments, a final destination for drifted devices may not be chosen until the relevant devices have begun drifting or until after these devices have finished drifting. For example, in particular embodiments, an inventory holder <b>30</b> may be selected for fulfilling a received order, but the inventory station <b>50</b> at which the received order will be fulfilled may not be determined until later. In such embodiments, the determination may be delayed altogether or a group of candidate inventory stations <b>50</b> may be selected when the relevant order is received but a specific inventory station <b>50</b> from the candidate group may not be selected until a later time. In such embodiments, management module <b>15</b> may select an inventory holder <b>30</b> or inventory holders <b>30</b> to fulfill the received order but determine that certain necessary or beneficial conditions have not been satisfied and may delay selection of a corresponding inventory station <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, management module <b>15</b> may determine that a container holder <b>40</b> on which a particular order will be stored is not yet available. As a result, management module <b>15</b> may drift one or more inventory holders <b>30</b> associated with the order until the container holder <b>40</b> becomes available. Furthermore, to optimize throughput of system <b>10</b>, management module <b>15</b> may wait to choose the inventory station <b>50</b> at which the order will ultimately be completed until the relevant container holder <b>40</b> is available. As a result, management module <b>15</b> may instruct mobile drive units <b>20</b> to retrieve the relevant inventory holders <b>30</b> and transport those inventory holders <b>30</b> to drift spaces <b>90</b>. When an appropriate triggering event occurs (such as a particular order holder <b>40</b> becoming available), management module <b>15</b> may select an inventory station <b>50</b> at which to fulfill the received order and instruct mobile drive units <b>20</b> to move the drifted inventory holders <b>30</b> to the relevant inventory station <b>50</b>. As a result, the use of drift spaces <b>90</b> may allow management module <b>15</b> to select the optimal inventory station <b>50</b> at which to complete the received order based on the state of system <b>10</b> when the relevant container holder <b>40</b> finally becomes available.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Additionally, in particular embodiments, management module <b>15</b> may select a particular inventory holder <b>30</b> to fulfill multiple different orders at multiple different inventory stations <b>50</b>. In such embodiments, management module <b>15</b> may use drift spaces <b>90</b> to temporarily store the relevant inventory holder <b>30</b> before and during completion of the different orders, so that this inventory holder <b>30</b> can be positioned close to the relevant inventory stations <b>50</b> while its orders are still being completed. Consequently, in such embodiments, management module <b>15</b> may drift a particular inventory holder <b>30</b> until one (or a particular one) of the inventory stations <b>50</b> fulfilling the multiple orders associated with the drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> becomes available. After being transported to the available inventory station <b>50</b>, the inventory holder <b>30</b> may then be returned to drift spaces <b>90</b> until another inventory station <b>50</b> completing an order associated with that inventory holder <b>30</b> becomes available.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Thus, in general, drift spaces <b>90</b> can be used to move inventory holders <b>30</b> or other components of inventory system <b>10</b> towards their destination without increasing the congestion in the immediate vicinity of the destination. Limiting the congestion around inventory stations <b>50</b> and other system resources can improve efficiency and throughput in certain embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b>. As a result, particular embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b> can provide several operational benefits. Specific embodiments, however, may provide some, all, or none of these benefits.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Operation begins at step <b>400</b> in the illustrated example with management module <b>15</b> receiving retrieval request <b>160</b>. As noted above, retrieval request <b>160</b> indicates one or more inventory items <b>32</b> to be retrieved from inventory system <b>10</b>. In response to receiving retrieval request <b>160</b>, management module <b>15</b> selects components of inventory system <b>10</b> to fulfill retrieval request <b>160</b> at step <b>402</b>. As part of selecting components to fulfill retrieval request <b>160</b>, management module <b>15</b>, in the described embodiment, selects one or more inventory holders <b>30</b> storing inventory items <b>32</b> identified by retrieval request <b>160</b>, an inventory station <b>50</b> at which to fulfill retrieval request <b>160</b>, and one or more mobile drive units <b>20</b> to transport the selected inventory holders <b>30</b> to the selected inventory station <b>50</b>. As discussed above, management module <b>15</b> may select these components based on any appropriate criteria or considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">At step <b>404</b>, management module <b>15</b> instructs each of the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> to move towards a storage space <b>76</b> associated with a particular one of the selected inventory holders <b>30</b>.

The selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> then begin to move their corresponding inventory holders <b>30</b> towards the selected inventory station <b>50</b> at step <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At any point while fulfilling retrieval request <b>160</b>, management module <b>15</b> may decide, based on any appropriate factors, to drift one or more of the selected inventory holders <b>30</b> to limit congestion in the vicinity of the selected inventory station <b>50</b>, prevent an overflow of the queue <b>80</b> associated with the selected inventory station <b>50</b>, or otherwise improve the efficiency or throughput of inventory system <b>10</b>. For example, in the illustrated example, management module <b>15</b>, at step <b>410</b>, determines whether the number of selected inventory holders <b>30</b> exceeds the number of queue spaces <b>82</b> available in a queue <b>80</b> associated with the selected inventory station <b>50</b>. The available queue spaces <b>82</b> may represent queue spaces <b>82</b> in the relevant queue <b>80</b> that management module <b>15</b> has not already reserved for specific inventory holders <b>30</b> destined for the associated inventory station <b>50</b>, queue spaces <b>82</b> not already occupied by inventory holders <b>30</b>, or queue spaces <b>82</b> that are deemed available based on any other suitable criteria. If the number of selected inventory holders <b>30</b> does not exceed the number of queue spaces <b>82</b> available in the associated queue <b>80</b>, then operation continues at step <b>412</b> with all of the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> continuing on to the selected inventory station <b>50</b>. At step <b>414</b>, the selected inventory holders <b>30</b> are then processed (e.g., requested inventory items <b>32</b> are removed from the selected inventory holders <b>30</b>) and retrieval request <b>160</b> is completed at step <b>430</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">If, however, the number of selected inventory holders <b>30</b> does exceed the number of queue spaces <b>82</b> available in the associated queue <b>80</b>, then management module <b>15</b>, according to this example operation, decides to drift one or more inventory holders <b>30</b>, as shown by steps <b>416</b>-<b>426</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Specifically, at step <b>416</b>, management module <b>15</b> instructs a particular mobile drive unit or units <b>20</b> to move towards a drift space <b>90</b> in workspace <b>70</b>. At step <b>418</b>, the relevant mobile drive unit or units <b>20</b> move to a drift space <b>90</b>. Depending on the configuration of inventory system <b>10</b>, management module <b>15</b> may select the drift space <b>90</b> to be used or the relevant mobile drive unit <b>20</b> may itself choose a particular drift space <b>90</b>. At step <b>420</b>, the other mobile drive units <b>20</b> transporting inventory holders <b>30</b> continue on to the selected inventory station <b>50</b> where they are processed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The drifted mobile drive unit or units <b>20</b> then wait, at step <b>422</b>, for a trigger event to occur. In the illustrated example, the trigger event relates to one or more queue spaces <b>82</b> becoming available in a queue <b>80</b> associated with the selected inventory station <b>50</b>. As a result, management module <b>15</b> and/or the drifted mobile drive unit or units <b>20</b> monitor the availability of queue spaces <b>82</b> in the queue <b>80</b> associated with the selected inventory station <b>50</b> and detect when an additional queue space <b>82</b> becomes available. For example, in particular embodiments, management module <b>15</b> may maintain a database in which information on the availability of queue spaces <b>82</b> (such as information on granted queue space reservations or location data for inventory holders <b>30</b> in workspace <b>70</b>). In such embodiments, management module <b>15</b> may determine based on this information when queue spaces <b>82</b> become available and may communicate this information to mobile drive units <b>20</b> to allow mobile drive units <b>20</b> to determine when queue spaces <b>82</b> become available. If the appropriate component determines at step <b>424</b> that no additional queue spaces <b>82</b> have become available, the waiting mobile drive unit or units <b>20</b> continue to wait with operation returning to step <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">If, instead, the appropriate component determines that an additional queue space <b>82</b> has become available, the waiting mobile drive unit <b>20</b> or one of the waiting mobile drive units <b>20</b> moves to the selected inventory station <b>50</b> at step <b>426</b>. When the released mobile drive unit <b>20</b> arrives at the selected inventory station <b>50</b>, the drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> may then be processed at step <b>428</b>. For example, an operator of the selected inventory station <b>50</b> may remove inventory items <b>32</b> identified by retrieval request <b>160</b> from the drifted inventory holder <b>30</b> and place them in a container <b>42</b> associated with retrieval request <b>160</b>. If additional inventory holders <b>30</b> remain in drift spaces <b>90</b>, steps <b>424</b>-<b>428</b> may be repeated for each as additional queue spaces <b>82</b> become available.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Once all the inventory items <b>32</b> requested by retrieval request <b>160</b> have been picked from the selected inventory holders <b>30</b>, the packed container <b>42</b> may be shipped and/or fulfillment of retrieval request <b>160</b> may otherwise be completed as shown at step <b>430</b>. Operation of inventory system <b>10</b> in fulfilling retrieval request <b>160</b> may then end as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate another example of how drift spaces <b>90</b> can be used in particular embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b> to improve system efficiency in responding to particular types of operation requests <b>60</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> describe the operation of certain embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b> in responding to another type of operation request <b>60</b> (referred to here as a &#x201c;container request <b>260</b>&#x201d;) that requests delivery of containers <b>42</b> to a particular inventory station <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">More specifically, in particular embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b>, a container holder <b>40</b> may be positioned beside each inventory station <b>50</b>. As noted above, containers <b>42</b> may represent boxes, pallets, or other suitable containers on or in which inventory items <b>32</b> may be grouped for storage, shipping, or other purposes. Positioning a container holder <b>40</b> next to each inventory station <b>50</b> may allow operators of inventory stations <b>50</b> to quickly obtain containers <b>42</b> when fulfilling retrieval requests <b>160</b> or other requests that involve containers <b>42</b>. Operators can quickly reach into or onto the container holder <b>40</b> positioned next to their inventory station <b>50</b> whenever a new container <b>42</b> is needed. When the supply of containers <b>42</b> in the container holder <b>40</b> positioned next to an operator's inventory station <b>50</b> is exhausted, management module <b>15</b> may instruct a mobile drive unit <b>20</b> to deliver another container holder <b>40</b> having a fresh supply of containers to that operator's inventory station <b>50</b>. As a result, inventory system <b>10</b> can ensure that a steady supply of containers <b>42</b> are provided to an inventory station <b>50</b> without requiring operators to leave inventory stations <b>50</b> to retrieve additional containers <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, to reduce the delay experienced between use of the final container <b>42</b> in or on the container holder <b>40</b> positioned next to a particular inventory station <b>50</b> and delivery of another container holder <b>40</b> stocked with containers <b>42</b> to that inventory station <b>50</b>, inventory system <b>10</b> may utilize drift spaces <b>90</b> to locate container holders <b>40</b> loaded with containers <b>42</b> near to inventory stations <b>50</b>. When inventory system <b>10</b> is operational, one or more container holders <b>40</b> may be moved from an initial storage space <b>74</b> or other location to drift spaces <b>90</b> to wait until needed or requested by a particular inventory station <b>50</b>. Then, when the supply of containers <b>42</b> at a particular inventory station <b>50</b> is exhausted, a container holder <b>40</b> waiting in a drift space <b>90</b> may be moved to the relevant inventory station <b>50</b>. By positioning stocked container holders <b>40</b> in drift spaces <b>90</b>, certain embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b> may reduce the amount of time required to deliver a new container holder <b>40</b> to depleted inventory stations <b>50</b> and increase the number of retrieval requests <b>160</b> and/or other operation requests <b>60</b> that each inventory station <b>50</b> can process over a given period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in particular, shows an overhead view of a specific embodiment of inventory system <b>10</b> in fulfilling an example container request <b>260</b>. As noted above, container request <b>260</b> is an operation request <b>60</b> used in certain embodiments of inventory system <b>10</b> to request delivery of containers <b>42</b> to a particular inventory station <b>50</b>. In particular embodiments, container request <b>260</b> may represent an instruction, message, or notification sent by the relevant inventory station <b>50</b> to management module <b>15</b> indicating that the supply of containers <b>42</b> at the relevant inventory station <b>50</b> has been exhausted and/or requesting additional containers <b>42</b> be delivered to the relevant inventory station <b>50</b>. Management module <b>15</b> responds to container requests <b>260</b> by instructing a mobile drive unit <b>20</b> to transport a container holder <b>40</b> to the requesting inventory station <b>50</b>. To limit the amount of time required to deliver another container holder <b>40</b> to inventory station <b>50</b>, management module <b>15</b> may select a container holder <b>40</b> waiting in a drift space <b>90</b> relatively near to inventory stations <b>50</b> to fulfill the container request <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">More specifically, at an appropriate time during operation of inventory system <b>10</b>, management module <b>15</b> may select one or more container holders <b>40</b> to drift until management module <b>15</b> receives its next container request <b>260</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, when inventory system <b>10</b> initially starts up, management module <b>15</b> may select one or more mobile drive units <b>20</b> and one or more container holders <b>40</b> and instruct a selected mobile drive unit <b>20</b> to move a selected container holder <b>40</b> to each active inventory station <b>50</b>. Management module <b>15</b> may also have one or more container holders <b>40</b> transported to drift spaces <b>90</b>. Workspace <b>70</b> may be configured so that drift spaces <b>90</b> are located relatively close to inventory stations <b>50</b> and, in particular embodiments, closer than many or all of storage spaces <b>76</b>. In the illustrated example, inventory stations <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are initially active, and operation begins with container holders <b>40</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as container holders <b>40</b><i>x</i>-<i>z</i>) positioned next to each inventory station <b>50</b> currently active.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">While inventory system <b>10</b> is positioning container holders <b>40</b> near inventory stations <b>50</b> or at an appropriate point in time before or after positioning such container holders <b>40</b>, inventory system <b>10</b> may also move one or more container holders <b>40</b> to drift spaces <b>90</b>. For example, management module <b>15</b> may select one or more mobile drive units <b>20</b> and one or more container holders <b>40</b> and instruct the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> to move the selected container holders <b>40</b> to drift spaces <b>90</b>. In the illustrated example, management module <b>15</b> selects mobile drive units <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and container holders <b>40</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and instructs mobile drive units <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>to move container holders <b>40</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>to drift spaces <b>90</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, respectively (as shown by arrows <b>502</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>504</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>). In particular embodiments, the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> may then undock from the drifted container holders <b>40</b> and move away to begin completing other tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Once the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> and container holders <b>40</b> are positioned in drift spaces <b>90</b>, inventory system <b>10</b> can begin to respond to container requests <b>260</b> using container holders <b>40</b> waiting in drift spaces <b>90</b>. As noted above, container requests <b>260</b> request delivery of additional containers <b>42</b> to a particular inventory station <b>50</b>. Depending on the configuration of inventory system <b>10</b>, container requests <b>260</b> may be transmitted by an inventory station <b>50</b> (or its operator) when the requesting inventory station <b>50</b> becomes active, the supply of containers <b>42</b> at the requesting inventory station <b>50</b> is exhausted, and/or any other event occurs prompting a need for additional containers at the requesting inventory station <b>50</b>. In the illustrated example, after mobile drive units <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>have moved container holders <b>40</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>to drift spaces <b>90</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, management module <b>15</b> receives a first container request <b>260</b><i>a </i>from inventory station <b>50</b><i>d </i>indicating that inventory station <b>50</b><i>d </i>has been activated.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In response to a container request <b>260</b>, management module <b>15</b> may instruct an appropriate mobile drive unit <b>20</b> to deliver a container holder <b>40</b> from a drift space <b>90</b> to the requesting inventory station <b>50</b>. If more than one container holder <b>40</b> are waiting in drift spaces <b>90</b>, management module <b>15</b> selects one of the waiting container holders <b>40</b> to fulfill the received container request <b>260</b>. Management module <b>15</b> may select the appropriate container holder <b>40</b> based on the length of time the selected contain holder <b>40</b> has been waiting in its drift space <b>90</b>, the number of containers the selected container holder <b>40</b> stores, a distance between the requesting inventory station <b>50</b> and the drift space <b>90</b> in which the selected container holder <b>40</b> is waiting, and/or any other suitable considerations or factors. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, management module <b>15</b> manages the drifted container holders <b>40</b> waiting in drift spaces <b>90</b> in a first-in/first-out manner, with the container holder <b>40</b> that has been waiting for the longest amount of time being selected to fulfill received container requests <b>260</b>. As a result, management module <b>15</b> selects container holder <b>40</b><i>a </i>to fulfill container request <b>260</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">After selecting a drifted container holder <b>40</b> to fulfill a received container request <b>260</b>, management module <b>15</b> may instruct a particular mobile drive unit <b>20</b> to transport the drifted container holder <b>40</b> to the requesting inventory station <b>50</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, management module <b>15</b> instructs mobile drive unit <b>20</b><i>d </i>to move container holder <b>40</b><i>a </i>to the requesting inventory station <b>50</b>, inventory station <b>50</b><i>d</i>. The relevant mobile drive unit <b>20</b> may then move to and dock with the drifted container holder <b>40</b> and transport the drifted container holder <b>40</b> to the requesting inventory station <b>50</b>. Thus, in the illustrated example, mobile drive unit <b>20</b><i>d </i>moves to container holder <b>40</b><i>a </i>and transports container holder <b>40</b><i>a </i>to inventory station <b>50</b><i>d </i>to fulfill first container request <b>260</b><i>a </i>(as shown by arrows <b>506</b> and <b>508</b>, respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In particular embodiments, management module <b>15</b> may replace container holders <b>40</b> that are released from drift spaces <b>90</b> to fulfill container requests <b>260</b>. Specifically, management module <b>15</b> may select a container holder <b>40</b> from a storage space <b>76</b>, a station where container holders <b>40</b> are loaded with containers <b>42</b>, or any other location in inventory system <b>10</b> and dispatch a mobile drive unit <b>20</b> to move that container holder <b>40</b> to the vacated drift space <b>90</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, management module <b>15</b> instructs mobile drive unit <b>20</b><i>e </i>to retrieve container holder <b>40</b><i>d </i>and move container holder <b>40</b><i>d </i>to the drift space <b>90</b> vacated by container holder <b>40</b><i>a </i>(as shown by arrows <b>510</b> and <b>512</b>, respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As a result, in particular embodiments, inventory system <b>10</b> may maintain a continually-restocked supply of container holders <b>40</b> in drift spaces <b>90</b> and may be able to fulfill multiple container requests <b>260</b> using container holders <b>40</b> waiting in drift spaces <b>90</b>. To illustrate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows management module <b>15</b> receiving a second container request <b>260</b><i>b </i>from inventory station <b>50</b><i>b </i>after fulfilling first container request <b>260</b><i>a</i>. Second container request <b>260</b><i>b </i>indicates, for example, that inventory station <b>50</b><i>c </i>has exhausted the supply of containers <b>42</b> stored by container holder <b>40</b><i>z </i>initially positioned next to inventory station <b>50</b><i>c</i>. In response to second container request <b>260</b><i>b</i>, management module <b>15</b> selects a container holder <b>40</b> (container holder <b>40</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and instructs a particular mobile drive unit <b>20</b> (mobile drive unit <b>20</b><i>f </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to move to and dock with the drifted container holder <b>40</b> (as shown by arrow <b>514</b>). Additionally, management module <b>15</b> may also instruct a mobile drive unit <b>20</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) docked to the exhausted container holder <b>40</b> (container holder <b>40</b><i>z </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to move the exhausted container holder <b>40</b> away from the requesting inventory station <b>50</b> (as shown by arrow <b>516</b>) so that the transporting mobile drive unit <b>20</b> can then position the drifted container holder <b>40</b> next to the requesting inventory station <b>50</b> (as shown by arrow <b>518</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Thus, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates, drift spaces <b>90</b> can also be used to drift container holders <b>40</b>, inventory holders <b>30</b>, or other components of inventory system <b>10</b> when the final destination of the relevant component is not yet determined. This may allow inventory system <b>10</b> to position components such as container holders <b>40</b> and inventory holders <b>30</b> relatively near to several potential destinations prior to a need or use arising for the relevant component at a particular one of the destinations.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating example operation of the embodiment of inventory system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

At step <b>602</b>, management module <b>15</b> instructs the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> to move to storage spaces <b>76</b> or other locations in which the selected container holders <b>40</b> are initially stored. At step <b>604</b>, the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> then move to and dock with the selected container holders <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">At step <b>606</b>, management module <b>15</b> instructs the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> to move the selected container holders <b>40</b> to drift spaces <b>90</b>.

In particular embodiments, the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> may then undock and move away from the selected container holders <b>40</b>, leaving the selected container holders <b>40</b> in drift spaces <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At step <b>610</b>, the selected mobile drive units <b>20</b> subsequently wait in drift spaces <b>90</b> for a trigger event to occur. In particular embodiments, the trigger event relates to or is triggered by a need for containers <b>42</b> arising at a particular inventory station <b>50</b>. For example, in the described embodiment, inventory stations <b>50</b> transmit container requests <b>260</b> to management module <b>15</b> to request delivery of containers <b>42</b> and/or to indicate their supply of containers <b>42</b> is exhausted. As a result, management module <b>15</b> determines, at step <b>612</b>, whether management module <b>15</b> has received a container request <b>260</b>. If not, operation returns to step <b>610</b> and the drifted container holders <b>40</b> continue to wait in drift spaces <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In response to determining it has received a container request <b>260</b>, management module <b>15</b> selects, at step <b>614</b>, one of the plurality of container holders <b>40</b> waiting in drift spaces <b>90</b> to fulfill the received container request <b>260</b>. As noted above, management module <b>15</b> may select a container holder <b>40</b> to fulfill the received container request <b>260</b> based on any appropriate considerations or criteria.
