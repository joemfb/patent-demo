<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates in general to multimedia-content delivery systems, and more particularly, to a method and system for identifying protected content on a content delivery system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The rapid growth in Internet usage has given users access to a wide range of sources for text, audio, video, and multimedia content provided in many different formats. At the same time, the costs of producing content have plummeted, allowing end-users to produce and distribute a substantial amount of media content. As a result, websites that offer free content-hosting services, such as YouTube and MySpace, have become popular both with amateur content providers and with an ever-growing audience.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The exponential growth in the use of content-sharing websites and networks has made it increasingly difficult to monitor user activity. The distribution of copyrighted and otherwise protected content has become a common problem for such websites, as users mix protected content in with the user-generated content intended to be distributed on such websites. Similarly, many such websites and networks prohibit the distribution of pornographic, explicit, or inflammatory content. In fact, the operators of content-sharing sites and networks may face lawsuits from copyright holders and complaints from offended users if protected and/or prohibited content is not identified and removed. Nonetheless, policing the distribution of such files can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Given the exponential growth in the amount of user-uploaded content available on such content-sharing sites, traditional approaches to applying audio/video content detection techniques are no longer effective. Implementation of process-intensive approaches that require in-depth analysis of the content and/or transmission of massive amounts of signature data would result in system configurations that are economically unviable due to cost and complexity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with the present invention, the disadvantages and problems associated with content delivery systems have been substantially reduced or eliminated. In particular, a content-delivery system is disclosed that provides flexible techniques for identifying protected content.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a method for processing media files includes receiving a request to download a first media file and, in response to receiving the request, generating a first signature that describes a first characteristic of the first media file. The method also includes determining whether the first signature matches any of a first plurality of stored signatures. The method also includes generating a second signature that describes a second characteristic of the first media file in response to determining that the first signature matches one of the first plurality of stored signatures. Additionally the method includes determining whether the second signature matches any of a second plurality of stored signatures and, in response to determining that the second signature matches one or more of the second plurality of stored signatures, denying the request to download the first media file.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Technical advantages of certain embodiments of the present invention include the ability to identify content that is protected, prohibited, and/or otherwise worthy of special processing on a content-delivery system. Additionally, particular embodiments may provide for the optimized use of time and processing resources in identifying the relevant content. Particular embodiments of the content delivery system may also include flexible and customizable techniques for addressing the use of protected or prohibited content that may limit the need for human involvement. Other technical advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. Moreover, while specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include all, some, or none of the enumerated advantages.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a particular embodiment of a system <b>10</b> for delivering media content to clients <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>from submitted content store <b>22</b>. System <b>10</b> includes clients <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, content sources <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, content management server <b>16</b>, transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and <i>e</i>-<i>g</i>; signature server <b>20</b>, submitted content store <b>22</b>, protected signature store <b>24</b>, and protected thumbnail store <b>26</b>, and a network <b>28</b>. Signature server <b>20</b> receives submitted content files <b>30</b> from users through content management server <b>16</b> and transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and analyzes submitted content files <b>30</b> to determine their contents. By minimizing the time and system resources utilized in analyzing submitted content files <b>30</b>, particular embodiments of signature server <b>20</b> provide efficient techniques for identifying and managing protected content.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, within system <b>10</b>, content sources <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and clients <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>connect to content management server <b>16</b> through network <b>28</b>. Content management server <b>16</b> connects to submitted content store <b>22</b> and manages access to submitted content store <b>22</b>. Additionally, content management server <b>16</b> connects to transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and forwards submitted content files <b>30</b> to transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>for transcoding. Transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are coupled to signature server <b>20</b> and transmit content signatures for submitted content files <b>30</b> to signature server <b>20</b> for analysis. Similarly, transcoders <b>18</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>are also coupled to signature server <b>20</b> and transmit content signatures for protected content files <b>32</b> to signature server <b>20</b>. Based on a comparison of these content signatures, signature server <b>20</b> determines whether submitted content files <b>30</b> include protected content and, if so, initiates an appropriate remedial action, such as refusing to upload submitted content files <b>30</b> or notifying a human operator <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">More specifically, clients <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>display content retrieved from submitted content store <b>22</b> to users, such as subscribers to a web site or content-sharing service. Clients <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may each represent any type of device appropriate to display one or more type of content utilized in system <b>10</b>. Examples of clients <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may include, but are not limited to, computers, video-enabled telephones, media players (such as audio- and/or video-capable iPods), televisions, and portable communication devices. In general, however, clients <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may include any appropriate combination of hardware, software, and/or encoded logic suitable to provide the described functionality. Clients <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may couple to network <b>28</b> through a dedicated connection, wired or wireless, or may connect to network <b>28</b> as needed to access media content. For example, clients <b>12</b>, such as portable media players, may connect temporarily to network <b>28</b> to download submitted content files <b>30</b> but then disconnect before displaying content from the submitted content files <b>30</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates, for purposes of example, a particular number and type of clients <b>12</b>, alternative embodiments of system <b>10</b> may include any appropriate number and suitable type of clients <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Content sources <b>14</b> provide media content, such as submitted content files <b>30</b>, to system <b>10</b>. Content from content sources <b>14</b> is uploaded through network <b>28</b> to submitted content store <b>22</b> and made available for display by clients <b>12</b>. For example, media content such as video and audio files may be entered into a content source <b>14</b><i>a</i>, such as a computer, and sent over network <b>28</b> to be stored in submitted content store <b>22</b> for subsequent access by users through clients <b>12</b>.

For example, content store <b>12</b> may include, or be configured to accept, detachable storage media, such as compact discs (CDs) or digital video discs (DVDs). In such embodiments, content may be introduced into system <b>10</b> as a result of detachable storage media containing submitted content files <b>30</b> being coupled to or accessed by content store <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Content management server <b>16</b> processes requests from content sources <b>14</b> to upload submitted content files <b>30</b> to submitted content store <b>22</b> and from clients <b>12</b> to download submitted content files <b>30</b> from submitted content store <b>22</b>. Content management server <b>16</b> may additionally authenticate users, execute content search requests, and/or otherwise facilitate interaction between users and the content-provision services offered by system <b>10</b>.

Transcoders <b>18</b> may modify the media content by translating, transcoding, transrating, encoding, rendering, and/or processing or otherwise modifying the relevant content to the requirements of a particular client <b>12</b>. As specific examples, transcoders <b>18</b> may modify submitted content files <b>30</b> by changing the codec, bit-rate, associated communication protocol, type of storage medium, compression, and/or digital rights management information of the relevant content. Particular embodiments of system <b>10</b> may only support fixed input and/or output formats and, as a result, may not include any transcoders <b>18</b>. Additionally, in particular embodiments, transcoding may be done independently from the signature matching performed by signature server <b>24</b>.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a particular embodiment of system <b>10</b> in which transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are responsible for generating at least a portion of the content signatures used by signature server <b>20</b> to compare submitted content files <b>30</b> to protected content files <b>32</b>. In the illustrated example, after decoding submitted content files <b>30</b> and before re-encoding submitted content files <b>30</b>, transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>generate one or more lightweight content signatures (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) that can be quickly generated using a minimal amount of processing resources. Transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may then transmit these lightweight signatures to signature server <b>20</b> to be used as in the first level of multi-level signature analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, in particular embodiments, one or more transcoders <b>18</b> may be responsible for generating content signatures for protected content files <b>32</b> received by system <b>10</b>.

In the illustrated embodiment, system <b>10</b> includes transcoders <b>18</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>that are dedicated to generating content signatures for protected content files <b>32</b>. More specifically, in the illustrated embodiment, transcoders <b>18</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>generate lightweight content signatures for protected content files <b>32</b> that utilize the same algorithms as those used by transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. These lightweight content signatures are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as first-level protected signatures <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c. </i></p>

If signature server <b>20</b> determines that a sufficiently high level of similarity exists between a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> and one or more protected content files <b>32</b>, signature server <b>20</b> may initiate an appropriate remedial action, such as refusing an upload or download request, removing a copy or copies of submitted content file <b>30</b>, or notifying a supervisor <b>42</b>, to prevent the submitted content file <b>30</b> from being used and/or misused on system <b>10</b>. In particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may also be responsible for maintaining information describing protected content files <b>32</b> in protected signature store <b>24</b> and protected thumbnail store <b>26</b>. Additionally, as described further below, signature server <b>20</b> may utilize multi-level signature analysis techniques to provide more efficient use of the processing resources available to system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In general, content management server <b>16</b>, transcoders <b>18</b>, and signature server <b>20</b> may each represent any appropriate combination of hardware, software, and/or encoded logic suitable to provide the described functionalities. In particular embodiments, each of content management server <b>16</b>, transcoders <b>18</b>, and signature server <b>20</b> represents a physically separate server programmed to operate as described herein. Alternatively, in particular embodiments, any of content management server <b>16</b>, transcoders <b>18</b>, and signature server <b>20</b> may share or represent the same physical components. For example, in particular embodiments, system <b>10</b> may include a server that houses a plurality of digital signal processor (DSP) groups that are collectively capable of providing the functionality described for both transcoders <b>18</b> and signature server <b>20</b>. As a result, transcoders <b>18</b> and signature server <b>20</b> may be housed in a single physical component. More generally, however, the functionality provided by content management server <b>16</b>, transcoders <b>18</b>, and signature server <b>20</b> may in particular embodiments be divided among the various physical components of system <b>10</b> in any appropriate manner.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Submitted content store <b>22</b> stores submitted content files <b>30</b> transmitted to submitted content store <b>22</b> by transcoders <b>18</b>, while protected signature store <b>24</b> and protected thumbnail store <b>26</b> store information relating to protected content files <b>32</b>, as described further below. Submitted content store <b>22</b>, protected signature store <b>24</b>, and protected thumbnail store <b>26</b> may represent or include any appropriate type of memory devices. Moreover, stores <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b> may comprise any collection and arrangement of volatile or non-volatile, local or remote devices suitable for storing data, such as for example random access memory (RAM) devices, read only memory (ROM) devices, magnetic storage devices, optical storage devices, or any other suitable data storage devices. In particular embodiments, submitted content store <b>22</b> represents a storage area network (SAN) to which submitted content files <b>30</b> are uploaded. Such a SAN may receive and store, for example, video and sound files from a plurality of different sources, the files having a variety of different formats and characteristics. Additionally, content thumbnails are only one example of the types of content signatures that may be utilized in particular embodiments of system <b>10</b>. As a result, in particular embodiments, protected thumbnail store <b>26</b> may be replaced by storage for alternative types of signatures or omitted altogether.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Submitted content files <b>30</b> represent media content submitted by users for storage on content provision system <b>10</b>, while protected content files <b>32</b> represent media content used by content provision system <b>10</b> to identify protected content and/or other content of interest. In general, submitted content files <b>30</b> and protected content files <b>32</b> may represent media content structured in any appropriate manner. Examples of content files <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> include Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), Windows Media Video (WMV), Audio Video Interleave (AVI), and Quicktime video files; audio content such as Waveform audio (WAV), MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3), and/or Windows Media Audio (WMA) files; image data such as Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) or Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files; and/or content of any other appropriate type or format. For example, a particular embodiment of content provision system <b>10</b> may be specifically configured to support such formats as Microsoft DV, Video for Windows, DirectShow, QuickTime, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, Windows Media, DivX, MP3, PCM WAV, AVISynth script, Audio Compression Manager (ACM), Macromedia Flash, RealVideo, VOB (DVD-Video image), Windows bitmap (BMP), TGA, TIFF, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and JPEG and, when requested, process, modify, or convert the stored media for output as one or more of an MPEG-2, MPEG-4, or SDI-encoded video stream to clients <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, content management server <b>16</b>, transcoders <b>18</b>, and signature server <b>20</b> interact to satisfy requests to upload submitted content files <b>30</b> from content sources <b>14</b> and to download submitted content files <b>30</b> for clients <b>12</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, content is uploaded from content sources <b>14</b> to system <b>10</b> in the form of submitted content files <b>30</b>. More specifically, in the illustrated example, a client <b>12</b> transmits a submitted content file <b>30</b> to content management server <b>16</b> for storage on submitted content store <b>22</b>. Subsequently clients <b>12</b> may request download of submitted content files <b>30</b> from submitted content store <b>22</b> for playback or display to users.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To illustrate this process, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example in which a user attempts to upload a submitted content file <b>30</b>, here submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a</i>, to submitted content store <b>22</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the user attempts to upload submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>by transmitting submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>to content management server <b>16</b>. For example, a user may attempt to upload submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>to a content-sharing website as part of a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) POST operation. In response, content management server <b>16</b> stores the submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>in an appropriate location within submitted content store <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Users may then be able to download submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>from content source <b>14</b> for viewing on clients <b>12</b>. Users may download submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>in any appropriate manner based on the configuration and capabilities of content management server <b>16</b>, transcoders <b>18</b>, and/or other appropriate components of system <b>10</b>. In particular embodiments, users may download a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> by transmitting a download request <b>44</b> of an appropriate form to content management server <b>16</b> and/or transcoder <b>18</b>. Download request <b>44</b> may represent any appropriate message, query, and/or other communication by which clients <b>12</b> may request the download of a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> stored in submitted content store <b>22</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, a client <b>12</b> may transmit a download request <b>44</b>, such as an HTTP request identifying a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> stored on submitted content store <b>22</b>, to content management server <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In response to receiving download request <b>44</b>, content management server <b>16</b> may retrieve the requested submitted content file <b>30</b> (here, submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a</i>) from submitted content store <b>22</b>. Content management server <b>16</b> may then initiate a signature analysis process to determine whether the submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>represents and/or includes protected content. As part of this process, content management server <b>16</b> transmits submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>to a selected one of transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. In particular embodiments, the selected transcoder <b>18</b> decodes submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>from its original media format to raw content (e.g., raw video). In the illustrated embodiment, the selected transcoder <b>18</b> then generates one or more content signatures based on the raw content from submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a</i>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of system <b>10</b> in which transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>generate first-level and second-level content signatures, in alternative embodiments, signature server <b>20</b>, other components of system <b>10</b>, or components external to system <b>10</b> may instead be responsible for generating one or more of the content signatures utilized by system <b>10</b>. For example, the copyright holder for protected content files <b>32</b> may generate content signatures for protected content files <b>32</b> and transmit these to system <b>10</b> for use in signature analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The generated content signatures each describe one or more characteristics of submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a</i>. Each content signature may represent a file, a collection of one or more values, a binary indication of whether a particular condition is satisfied by the corresponding submitted content file <b>30</b>, and/or any appropriately structured information that describes characteristics of the corresponding content files. Examples of these content signatures may include, but are not limited to, image histograms, grayscale values, chroma values, frequency domain representations of the image (e.g., a wavelet representation), the results of object identification algorithms (e.g., an indication of whether a face was detected at a particular location within the content file or foliage was detected in the background of the content file), the results of other pattern recognition algorithms, and/or any other appropriate description of the contents of the corresponding content files. Additionally, in particular embodiments, these content signatures may represent a portion of the relevant content file itself. Moreover, for multimedia content, each content signature may represent characteristics of the video portion of the content, the audio portion, or both. An example technique for generating a particular type of first-level signature are discussed in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, as noted above, the content signatures generated by transcoders <b>18</b> may represent part of the first-level in a multi-level signature analysis process. Moreover, these content signatures may be generated using a set of lightweight signature-generating algorithms that can be quickly generated and/or generated using a limited amount of processing capacity. Thus, in the illustrated example, the selected transcoder <b>18</b> generates a plurality of first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>based on submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>and transmits these first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> to signature server <b>20</b> for analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Meanwhile, at any appropriate time while system <b>10</b> is operational, system <b>10</b> may receive protected content files <b>32</b> containing protected content. As used in this description and the claims that follow, &#x201c;protected content&#x201d; may include any form of copyrighted, restricted-use, or licensed content, or any content users of system and/or the general public are not authorized to use. In particular embodiments, &#x201c;protected content&#x201d; may also include pornographic, explicit, and/or offensive content, or content that users may be prohibited from using or disseminating on system <b>10</b> for any other reason.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the illustrated embodiment, as system <b>10</b> receives protected content files <b>32</b>, protected content files <b>32</b> are transmitted to one or more transcoders <b>18</b> responsible for processing protected content (transcoders <b>18</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Similar to transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, transcoders <b>18</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>decode protected content files <b>32</b> and generate first-level protected signatures <b>36</b> from the resulting raw video. Transcoders <b>18</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>utilize the same first-level signature generation algorithms as transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>use to generate first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b>. Additionally, in particular embodiments, transcoders <b>18</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>may generate one or more second level content signatures for protected content files <b>32</b>, such as protected thumbnails <b>40</b>, for each protected content file <b>32</b>. Each protected thumbnail <b>40</b> represents a portion of the corresponding protected content files <b>32</b>, such as one or more frames. In particular embodiments, each protected thumbnail <b>40</b> represents a time average of multiple (e.g., five) consecutive frames of the corresponding protected content files <b>32</b>. Transcoders <b>18</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>may transmit these first-level protected signatures <b>36</b> and protected thumbnails <b>40</b> to signature server <b>20</b>. Signature server <b>20</b> may then store first-level protected signatures <b>36</b> in protected signature store <b>24</b> and protected thumbnails <b>40</b> in protected thumbnail store <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As a result, when signature server <b>20</b> receives first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> from one of transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, signature server <b>20</b> may compare each first-level submitted signature <b>34</b> for submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>to a corresponding set of first-level protected signatures <b>36</b> maintained by signature server <b>20</b>. For example, if submitted content signature <b>34</b><i>a </i>represents gray scale values extracted from submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a</i>, signature server <b>20</b> compares submitted content signature <b>34</b><i>a </i>to a set of protected content signatures <b>36</b>, each representing gray scale values generated from a different protected content file <b>32</b> recognized by system <b>10</b>. Similarly, if submitted content signature <b>34</b><i>b </i>represents chroma values extracted from submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a</i>, signature server <b>20</b> compares submitted content signature <b>34</b><i>b </i>to another set of protected content signatures <b>36</b>, each representing chroma values generated from a different protected content file <b>32</b> recognized by system <b>10</b>. Signature server <b>20</b> may perform these comparisons in any appropriate manner based on the configuration and capabilities of signature server <b>20</b>. One example of how such comparisons may be implemented in particular embodiments of signature server <b>20</b> is discussed in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Signature server <b>20</b> then determines, based on the comparison between first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> and their corresponding first-level protected signatures <b>36</b>, whether submitted content file <b>30</b> is sufficiently similar to one or more protected content files <b>32</b> to warrant remedial action and/or further investigation. For example, as noted above, signature server <b>20</b> may utilize a multi-level technique for signature analysis and may perform multiple different levels of signature comparisons. As a result, in response to determining that first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> are sufficiently similar to one or more corresponding set of first-level protected signatures <b>36</b>, signature server <b>20</b> may generate additional content signatures from submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a</i>. For example, in the illustrated example, signature server <b>20</b> generates or retrieves an additional signature, such as submitted thumbnail <b>38</b>, that is created using a signature generation algorithm different from those used to generate first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In particular embodiments, the additional signature or signatures generated by signature server <b>20</b> may represent part of a second-level of signature analysis that utilizes a more detailed comparison of submitted content files <b>30</b> and protected content files <b>32</b>. In particular embodiments, second-level signature analysis may consider aspects of submitted content files <b>30</b> that will not vary as a result of any rotation, translation or scaling of submitted content files <b>30</b>. For example, this second-level signature analysis may utilize signature generation algorithms that consider on frequency domain characteristics of the relevant content files including Gabor filters, Fourier-Mellin transforms, and wavelet analysis of the relevant content.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, in particular embodiments, this second-level requires a greater expenditure of time and/or processing capacity than the first-level signature analysis that generates and compares first-level signatures <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. As a result, in such embodiments, the first level of signature analysis may allow signature server <b>20</b> to easily determine that certain submitted content files <b>30</b> do not comprise protected content and thereby dramatically reduce the number of submitted content files <b>30</b> for which signature server <b>20</b> performs second-level signature analysis. This may, in turn, significantly reduce the time and/or processing resources that are used in identifying protected content.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After generating or retrieving the appropriate second-level signatures (e.g. submitted thumbnails <b>38</b>), signature server <b>20</b> compares the relevant second-level signature to a second set of protected content signatures (e.g., protected thumbnails <b>40</b>). This second set of protected content signatures is generated using the same second-level signature algorithm or algorithms used to generate the second-level submitted signatures. As noted above, in particular embodiments, this second-level comparison may involve a more detailed comparison of one or more characteristics of submitted content file <b>30</b> to those of protected content files <b>32</b>. If this more detailed comparison indicates that submitted content file <b>30</b> matches one or more protected content files <b>32</b>, signature server <b>20</b> determines that submitted content file <b>30</b> may represent and/or include protected content.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In response to determining that submitted content file <b>30</b> may represent and/or include protected content, signature server <b>20</b> may initiate one or more remedial actions with respect to submitted content file <b>30</b>. These remedial actions may include any appropriate steps to prevent submitted content file <b>30</b> from being uploaded to submitted content store <b>22</b> and/or downloaded by clients <b>12</b>, to remove protected content from submitted content file <b>30</b>, and/or to otherwise to manage storage and use of submitted content file <b>30</b>. As one example, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may refuse (or instruct appropriate components of system <b>10</b> to refuse) the request to download submitted content file <b>30</b> from submitted content store <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Moreover, signature server <b>20</b> may (or may instruct appropriate components of system <b>10</b> to) remove submitted content file <b>30</b> from submitted content store <b>22</b>, flag submitted content file <b>30</b> as protected, or take other appropriate steps to ensure submitted content file <b>30</b> is not downloaded by subsequent users. As a result, signature server <b>10</b> may avoid having to repeat the analysis of submitted content file <b>30</b> for future requests associated for that same submitted content file <b>30</b>. As one specific example, in particular embodiments, users may be able to initiate keyword searches to identify desired content stored in submitted content store <b>22</b>. In such embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may take appropriate steps to prevent submitted content file <b>30</b> from being displayed as part of search results for a subsequent searches regardless of whether submitted content file <b>30</b> matches the keywords associated with those subsequent searches. As a result, in particular embodiments, users may be prevented from requesting submitted content files <b>30</b> containing protected content even without the protected content being removed from submitted content store <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As another example, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may notify (or instruct appropriate components of system <b>10</b> to notify) the user attempting to download submitted content file <b>30</b> that the request is being denied. Signature server <b>20</b> may notify the relevant user in any appropriate manner based on the configuration of system <b>10</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may transmit an HTTP response to the user indicating that the request to download submitted content file <b>30</b> to system <b>10</b> has been declined. Alternatively, signature server <b>20</b> may transmit an email message to user requesting that the user contact an operator of system <b>10</b> to discuss whether submitted content file <b>30</b> should be uploaded to or downloaded from system <b>10</b>. In particular embodiments, this email may include all or a portion of the submitted content file <b>30</b> and all or a portion of a matching protected content file <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As yet another example, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may submit submitted content file <b>30</b> for human review. For example, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may transmit submitted content file <b>30</b> to a human operator <b>42</b> of system <b>10</b> for review. In particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may additionally transmit a protected content file <b>32</b> matching submitted content file <b>30</b> to human operator <b>42</b>. The relevant information may be communicated to human operator <b>42</b> in any appropriate manner based on the configuration and capabilities of system <b>10</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may generate an email message that includes submitted content file <b>30</b> and all or a portion of protected content files <b>32</b> and transmit this email message to human operator <b>42</b> for review.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">After receiving submitted content file <b>30</b>, human operator <b>42</b> may review submitted content file <b>30</b> and, if appropriate, the corresponding protected content files <b>32</b> to determine whether submitted content file <b>30</b>, in fact, represents or includes protected content. Human operator <b>42</b> may then initiate additional remedial actions to prevent use or misuse of the relevant protected content. For example, human operator <b>42</b> may deny the request to download submitted content file <b>30</b> and notify the user attempting to download submitted content file <b>30</b> that the request has been denied.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Returning to the example, if signature server <b>20</b> instead determines during either first-level or second-level signature analysis, that submitted content file <b>30</b> does not include or represent any protected content, signature server <b>20</b> may instruct transcoder <b>18</b> or other components of system <b>10</b> to allow the requesting client <b>12</b> to download the relevant submitted content file <b>30</b>. As a result, transcoder <b>18</b> may complete transcoding of submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a</i>. As part of this process, transcoder <b>18</b> may encode the raw video from which the relevant transcoder <b>18</b> originally generated the content signatures in a format appropriate for playback or display on the requesting client <b>12</b>. In particular embodiments, this may, under certain circumstances, result in requested content files <b>30</b> being encoded in a different format than they were originally stored in submitted content store <b>22</b>. For example, submitted media file <b>30</b><i>a </i>may be encoded based on a first codec when originally uploaded to system <b>10</b> but, after signature analysis has been completed, transcoder <b>18</b> may encode submitted media file <b>30</b><i>a </i>based on a second codec appropriate for display on the requesting client <b>12</b>. Transcoder <b>18</b> may then transmit the encoded submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>to the requesting client <b>12</b>, directly or indirectly through another component of system <b>10</b> (such as content management server <b>12</b>). The requesting client <b>12</b> may then begin playback or display of submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, in particular embodiments, system <b>10</b> supports techniques for efficiently identifying protected content submitted by users. By providing a multi-level identification process, particular embodiments of system <b>10</b> may limit the possibility that submitted content will be incorrectly flagged as protected content without requiring system <b>10</b> to utilize excessive amounts of time and/or processing resources. In particular, by applying time- or resource-intensive signature algorithms to a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> only after determining a minimum likelihood that the submitted content file <b>30</b> comprises protected content, system <b>10</b> may limit the frequency with which these time- or resource-intensive algorithms are utilized during signatures analysis. Furthermore, by limiting the number of protected content files <b>32</b> to which the submitted content file <b>30</b> is compared during second-level signature analysis, particular embodiments of system <b>10</b> may further reduce time and resources expended in analyzing submitted content files <b>30</b> to identify protected content. Additionally, in embodiments in which signature analysis is carried out by multiple different components working together, this multi-level signature analysis may reduce the frequency with which the more detailed and larger signatures are transmitted between the relevant components and/or stored in temporary memory. As a result, in particular embodiments, network bandwidth and memory usage may also benefit from the described techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Overall, the more efficient use of network processing, transmission, and/or storage resources may allow signature analysis to be performed as part of a realtime or near-realtime transcode process with minimal affect on the upload or download time of the user. Consequently, submitted content files <b>30</b> may be analyzed during the transcoding process and available for viewing immediately after uploading without any delay for review. As a result, particular embodiments of system <b>10</b> may provide numerous operational benefits. Specific embodiments, however, may provide some, none, or all of these benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a particular embodiment of content provision system <b>10</b> in which signature server <b>24</b> compares content signatures from submitted content files <b>30</b> to signatures generated from specific protected content files <b>32</b>, content provision system <b>10</b> may, in particular embodiments, manage the submission and/or replay of submitted content files <b>30</b> to prevent general categories of prohibited content from being submitted or replayed. For example in particular embodiments, signature server may prevent pornographic content from being stored on content provision system <b>10</b>. In such embodiments, instead of comparing content signatures of submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>to signatures associated with specific protected content files <b>32</b>, signature server <b>20</b> may compare content signatures of submitted content file <b>30</b><i>a </i>to generic signature templates defining typical characteristics of pornographic content, such as the presence of certain skin-toned patterns in submitted content.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may additionally or alternatively be responsible for ensuring that duplicate copies of submitted content files <b>30</b> are not stored on content provision system <b>10</b>. As a result, after generating or receiving content signatures of a particular submitted content file <b>30</b>, signature server <b>20</b> may store these content signatures for comparison to submitted content files <b>30</b> received at a later time. In such embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may then initiate a remedial action or further investigation if a content signature previously generated matches content signatures from any previously uploaded submitted content file <b>30</b>. For example, signature server <b>20</b> may decline a request to upload a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> if signature server <b>20</b> determines, based on previously generated first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b>, that the relevant submitted content file <b>30</b> has already been uploaded to system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, although the description above focuses, for the sake of simplicity, on embodiments in which signature server <b>20</b> performs only two levels of signature analysis, alternative embodiments of system <b>10</b> may be configured to perform any appropriate number of levels of signature analysis. As a result, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may, in response to identifying a match between a second-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> and second-level signatures for one or more protected content files <b>32</b>, initiate a third and/or additional levels of signatures analysis. As part of these additional levels, signature server <b>20</b> may generate and utilize additional content signatures as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Furthermore, although the description above also focuses on an embodiment in which signature analysis is performed when submitted content files <b>30</b> are uploaded, signature analysis may be performed at any appropriate time during operation. In particular, signature analysis may alternatively be done when submitted content files <b>30</b> are downloaded for use. For example, in particular embodiments, transcoders <b>18</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>and signature server <b>20</b> may represent or include components operated by a content provider or owner of protected content files <b>32</b>. In such embodiments, system <b>10</b> may include a web robot, or &#x201c;bot,&#x201d; or other appropriate components capable of retrieving submitted content files <b>30</b> stored on a submitted content store <b>22</b> of the content-sharing network. This web robot may then be able to initiate signature analysis of the retrieved content files <b>30</b> to determine whether any of the content available on the content-sharing network represents protected content owned by the content provider.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a conceptual illustration of how particular embodiments of system <b>10</b> may implement the multi-level signature analysis techniques discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As noted above, the various levels of signature analysis may, in specific embodiments, be performed by any appropriate components within system <b>10</b>. As a result, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a first component or set of components (represented by cloud <b>100</b>) performs a first-level of signature analysis, a second component or set of components (represented by cloud <b>102</b>) performs a second-level of signature analysis, and a human operator <b>42</b> performs a final confirmation. In alternative embodiments, as noted above, system <b>10</b> may include any appropriate number of signature-analysis levels.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In particular embodiments, first group <b>110</b> of submitted content files <b>30</b> includes all submitted content files <b>30</b> uploaded by users of system <b>10</b>. The component or components responsible for performing the first-level of signature analysis generate first-level signatures for first group <b>110</b> and first-level signatures for the protected content files <b>32</b> recognized by system <b>10</b>. The first-level analysis component(s) then compare first-level signatures for all submitted content files <b>30</b> with first-level signatures for all protected content files <b>32</b>. In particular embodiments, the algorithms used in this first-level comparison are selected to minimize false negatives and to limit the amount of time and system resources required to complete first-level analysis. Based on the first-level comparison, the first-level analysis component(s) identify second group <b>112</b>, a subset of the files in first group <b>110</b>, to be submitted for second-level signature analysis. Second group <b>112</b> represents those submitted content files <b>30</b> that exhibit a sufficient level of similarity with one or more protected content files <b>32</b> to warrant more detailed review.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The component or components (represented by cloud <b>102</b>) responsible for performing the second-level of signature analysis then receive second group <b>112</b>. The second-level analysis component(s) may then generate second-level signatures for second group <b>112</b> and any protected content files <b>32</b> identified as matching the second group <b>112</b> during first-level signature analysis. Based on this comparison, the second-level analysis component(s) identify third group <b>114</b>, a subset of the files in second group <b>112</b>, to be submitted for human review. Third group <b>114</b> represents those submitted content files that exhibit a sufficient level of similarity with one or more protected content files <b>32</b>, based on a comparison of second-level signatures, to warrant human review.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as a two-level analysis, the analysis performed by system <b>10</b> may include a third and/or additional layers. In general, the analysis performed by system <b>10</b> may involve any appropriate number of levels. Furthermore, in particular embodiments, the signature analysis performed may become more complex with each successive level. In particular embodiments, this complexity may relate to the amount of time, processing capacity, and/or network communication bandwidth expended in completing the various different levels of analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As discussed further below, the submitted content files <b>30</b> in third group <b>114</b> may then be reviewed by human operator <b>42</b>. As part of this human review, each of the submitted content files <b>30</b> in third group <b>114</b>, or portions of those files, may be forwarded to human operator <b>42</b> for review. The matching protected content file or files <b>32</b>, or portions thereof, may also be forwarded to human operator <b>42</b>. Human operator <b>42</b> may then compare each file from third group <b>114</b> to the protected content files <b>32</b> identified by second-level signature analysis to determine whether the submitted content files <b>30</b> in the third group <b>114</b> represent or include protected content. If appropriate, human operator <b>42</b> may then initiate a remedial action to prevent the relevant submitted content files <b>30</b> from being uploaded or otherwise manage the transmission and/or storage of those submitted content files <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Consequently, as can be seen by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the number of submitted content files <b>30</b> reviewed decreases with each stage of the process. By using lightweight signatures to eliminate non-matching submitted content files <b>30</b> in the first level, system <b>10</b> may greatly reduce the number of submitted content files <b>30</b> that advance to the time- or resource-intense stages of the multi-level process and/or to human review. This may, in turn, increase the overall performance and throughput of system <b>10</b> and result in a content-screening process that is economically feasible in terms of the processing and network bandwidth consumed. For example, in particular embodiments, appropriately-selected first-level signature analysis algorithms may limit the number of submitted content files <b>30</b> reaching second-level analysis to only ten percent (10%) of the files in first group <b>110</b> with only a minimal amount of protected content avoiding detection.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Additionally, as discussed further below, by adjusting the configuration of system <b>10</b>, an operator of system <b>10</b> can control the number of submitted content files <b>30</b> that advance through each stage of analysis. This may allow the operator to achieve an acceptable tradeoff between the expenditure of resources and the detection of protected content. As a result, in particular embodiments, the operator may be able to control the impact of signature analysis on overall system performance. For example, if it is determined that an unacceptable amount of protected content is avoiding detection, the operator may reduce the minimum level of similarity required for a submitted content file <b>30</b> to advance to second-level signature analysis. By contrast, if system performance is being substantially degraded as a result of second-level (or higher) signature analysis, the operator may increase the minimum level of similarity required for submitted content files <b>30</b> to advance to the second level.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating in greater detail the functional contents and operation of a particular embodiment of transcoder <b>18</b>. As illustrated, transcoder <b>18</b> includes a network interface module <b>200</b>, a queue <b>202</b>, a pre-processing module <b>204</b>, a decoding module <b>206</b>, a plurality of first-level signature modules <b>208</b>, a second-level signature module <b>210</b>, an encoding module <b>212</b>, a processor <b>214</b>, and a memory <b>216</b>. As noted above, with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, signature-generation functionality may be divided between transcoder <b>18</b> and signature server <b>20</b> in any appropriate manner and, as a result, first-level signature modules <b>208</b> and/or second-level signature module <b>210</b> may not be included in certain embodiments of transcoder <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Network interface module <b>200</b> facilitates communication between transcoder <b>18</b> and content management server <b>16</b>, signature server <b>20</b>, and/or other components of system <b>10</b>.

To support multiple simultaneous content flows, network interface module <b>200</b> may include multiple ports through which network interface module <b>200</b> can receive/transmit multiple flows simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Queue <b>202</b> stores received content until pre-processing module <b>206</b> is available to process the content. In particular embodiments, queue <b>202</b> represents a portion of memory <b>216</b> used to buffer content until pre-processing can begin. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows only a single queue <b>202</b> located at the front of the illustrated datapath, transcoders <b>18</b> may include additional queues <b>202</b> to buffer data transferred between any of modules <b>204</b>-<b>212</b> or to buffer data while being processed by a particular module <b>204</b>-<b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Each of pre-processing module <b>204</b>, decoding module <b>206</b>, first-level signature modules <b>208</b>, second-level signature module <b>210</b>, and encoding module <b>212</b> provides certain processing functionality, as described further below. Pre-processing module <b>204</b>, decoding module <b>206</b>, first-level signature modules <b>208</b>, second-level signature module <b>210</b>, and encoding module <b>212</b> may each represent any appropriate combination of hardware, software, and/or encoded logic suitable to provide the described functionality. Additionally, modules <b>204</b>-<b>212</b> may together and individually represent a single physical component or any appropriate number of separate physical components depending on the configuration of transcoder <b>18</b>. In particular embodiments, modules <b>204</b>-<b>212</b> represent software applications executing on processor <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Processor <b>214</b> may represent or include any form of processing component, including dedicated microprocessors, general purpose computers, or other processing devices capable of processing electronic information. Examples of processor <b>214</b> include microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and any other suitable specific or general purpose processors. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates, for the sake of simplicity, an example embodiment of transcoder <b>18</b> that includes a single processor <b>214</b>, transcoder <b>18</b> may include any number of processors <b>214</b> configured to interoperate in any appropriate manner.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Memory <b>216</b> stores processor instructions, codecs, routing tables, and/or any other parameters or data utilized by elements of transcoder <b>18</b> during operation. Memory <b>216</b> may comprise any collection and arrangement of volatile or non-volatile, local or remote devices suitable for storing data, such as for example random access memory (RAM) devices, read only memory (ROM) devices, magnetic storage devices, optical storage devices, or any other suitable data storage devices. Although shown as a single functional element in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, memory <b>216</b> may include one or more memory devices local to and specifically associated with components or modules of transcoder <b>18</b>. Furthermore, in particular embodiments, all or a portion of memory <b>216</b> may represent a hard drive contained within transcoder <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In operation, pre-processing module <b>204</b> receives a content file (such as submitted content files <b>30</b> or protected content files <b>32</b>) transmitted to transcoder <b>18</b> for transcoding and/or signature generation. Pre-processing module <b>204</b> may perform any appropriate decrypting, filtering, logging, and/or other forms of processing to the received content file prior to decoding. After any appropriate pre-processing, pre-processing module <b>204</b> transmits the received content file to decoding module <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In particular embodiments, pre-processing module <b>204</b> may be configured to recognize specific protected content within a submitted content file <b>30</b> and process the received content file as appropriate. For example, if it is determined that a large number of users are uploading copies of a particular protected content file <b>32</b>, pre-processing module <b>204</b> may be configured to recognize characteristics of that specific content file. As a result, pre-processing module <b>204</b> may be configured to identify characteristics such as file size, media type (e.g., video, audio), time duration, and/or other characteristics of the protected content file to quickly determine that a submitted content file <b>30</b> is a copy of the relevant protected content file <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, a large number of users may attempt to upload a particular Super Bowl commercial immediately after the Super Bowl or to upload a song by a popular artist in the weeks after the artist releases the song. Thus, pre-processing module <b>204</b> may be configured to quickly recognize these specific protected content files <b>32</b>. Depending on the configuration of transcoder <b>18</b> and system <b>10</b> generally, system <b>10</b> may then perform higher-level signature analysis of the relevant file to confirm the match and/or initiate a remedial action.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Decoding module <b>206</b> decodes the received content file from an initial codec. Decoding module <b>206</b> may have access to decoding information for a number of different codecs and, as a result, decoding module <b>206</b> may be capable of decoding submitted content files <b>30</b> encoded using any of several different codecs. Decoding module <b>206</b> may use filename extensions, data provided by content management server <b>16</b>, and/or any other appropriate information to determine an appropriate codec to use in decoding the requested content. After decoding the received content file, decoding module <b>206</b> transmits the raw content to first-level signature modules <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">First-level signature modules <b>208</b> each receive raw content from decoding module <b>206</b> and generate a first-level signature (such as a first-level submitted signature <b>34</b> or a first-level protected signature <b>36</b>) from the raw content. As noted above, in particular embodiments, the algorithms utilized by first-level signature modules <b>208</b> may represent lightweight content signatures that can be quickly generated with little use of processing resources. First-level signature modules <b>208</b> then transmit these first-level signatures to signature server <b>20</b> for use in first-level signature analysis. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an embodiment of transcoder <b>18</b> in which first-level signature modules <b>208</b> all generate first-level signatures based on decoded content, in particular embodiments, one or more first-level signature modules <b>208</b> may generate first-level signatures using encoded content.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Second-level signature module <b>210</b> receives raw content from decoding module <b>206</b> or first-level signature modules <b>208</b> and generates a second-level signature based on the received raw content. As noted above, in particular embodiments, second-level signature module <b>210</b> utilizes an algorithm that is more time- or resource-intense than the algorithms utilized by first-level signature modules <b>208</b>. Additionally, in particular embodiments, second-level signature module <b>210</b> may generate a signature that represents a portion of the raw content from the received content file itself. For example, second-level signature module <b>210</b> may generate a thumbnail (such as a submitted thumbnail <b>38</b> or a protected thumbnail <b>40</b>) representing one or more frames of the received content file. Moreover, in particular embodiments, these thumbnails may represent a time-average of multiple frames of the received content file. Second-level signature module <b>210</b> may then transmit these second-level signatures to signature server <b>20</b> for use in second-level signature analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In particular embodiments, second-level signature generation is only initiated at the request of signature server <b>20</b>. As a result, in such embodiments, if signature server <b>20</b> determines based on first-level signature analysis that signature server <b>20</b> does not need to perform second-level signature analysis on a particular content file, raw content from that content file may bypass second-level signature module <b>210</b> or pass through second-level signature module <b>210</b> without triggering the generation of a second-level signature. Thus, second-level signature module <b>210</b> may receive requests, instructions, and/or other forms of control signals from signature server <b>20</b> instructing second-level signature module <b>210</b> to generate a second-level signature.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Encoding module <b>212</b> receives the raw content from decoding module <b>206</b>, first-level signature modules <b>208</b>, and/or second-level signature module <b>210</b>. Encoding module <b>212</b> may encode the received raw content in a format appropriate for storage on submitted content store <b>22</b> or elsewhere on system <b>10</b>. Alternatively, encoding module <b>212</b> may encode the received raw content in a format appropriate for transmission to or display by a particular client <b>12</b>. Depending on the configuration and capabilities of transcoder <b>18</b>, encoding module <b>212</b> can be configured to support any number of codecs, and encoding module <b>212</b> can utilize information provided by client <b>12</b>, content management server <b>16</b>, or any other suitable component of system <b>10</b> to determine an appropriate codec to use in encoding the requested content. After encoding the requested content, encoding module <b>212</b> transmits the encoded content to network interface module <b>200</b> for transmission to submitted content store <b>22</b> or a requesting client <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Additionally, in transcoders <b>18</b> that are responsible for processing submitted content files <b>30</b>, encoding module <b>212</b> may receive instructions from signature server <b>20</b> indicating whether encoding module <b>212</b> is permitted to store a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> on submitted content store <b>22</b> and/or transmit a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> to a requesting client <b>12</b>. As a result, encoding module <b>212</b> may, depending on the remedial actions signature server <b>20</b> is configured to initiate, discard encoded content from a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> if signature server <b>20</b> indicates to transcoder <b>18</b> that the relevant submitted content file <b>30</b> comprises protected content.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Furthermore, for transcoders <b>18</b> responsible for processing protected content files <b>32</b>, there may be no need to encode raw content from protected content files <b>32</b> after first-level signature modules <b>208</b> have generated the corresponding first-level protected signatures <b>36</b>. As a result, in such embodiments, encoding module <b>212</b> may be configured to discard the raw content received by encoding module <b>212</b> from protected content files <b>32</b>. For similar reasons, encoding module <b>212</b> may be omitted entirely from transcoders <b>18</b> committed to full-time processing of protected content files <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates, for the sake of simplicity, an example embodiment of transcoder <b>18</b> that includes only a single datapath, transcoder <b>18</b> may be configured to include any appropriate number of datapaths. As a result, transcoder <b>18</b> may include multiple instantiations of pre-processing module <b>204</b>, decoding module <b>206</b>, the set of first-level signature modules <b>208</b>, second-level signature module <b>210</b>, and enhancing module <b>212</b>. Additionally, in such embodiments, transcoder <b>18</b> may also include such components as a load balancer and/or multiplexer to divide incoming traffic between the various datapaths and to consolidate the output of the various datapaths for transmission across system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the process by which a particular type of first-level signature is made in a particular embodiment of a first-level signature module <b>208</b>. In particular, the illustrated technique produces a signature or signatures based on grayscale value associated with the relevant content file, such as a submitted content file <b>30</b> (as shown) or a protected content file <b>32</b>. The steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be combined, modified, or deleted where appropriate. Additional steps may also be added to the example operation. Furthermore, the described steps may be performed in any suitable order.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this example, signature-generation begins at step <b>250</b> with grayscale extraction of the received video content input. Grayscale extraction generates a grayscale version of each frame in the received video content that may be used by the remainder of the algorithm. This may eliminate the effect of color on the remaining algorithm and reduce a user's ability to manipulate the colors of protected video content to avoid detection.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">First-level signature module <b>208</b> then temporally filters the grayscale content at step <b>252</b>. As a result, signature module <b>208</b> may generate a time-average of a sequential group of video frames in the grayscale-extracted content. The remainder of the algorithm may then be applied to this time-averaged, or &#x201c;temporally blurred,&#x201d; frame. As a result, first-level signature module <b>208</b> may also prevent time-shifting from undermining the ability of system <b>10</b> to detect protected content.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Additionally, as part of temporally filtering the received content, first-level signature module <b>208</b> may also detect rapid pans or other visual effects that may suggest a massive change in the view. This may allow the temporal filter algorithm to detect scene changes and reset at a point in the video content where a stable scene is detected. Furthermore, in particular embodiments, the temporal filter algorithm may produce temporal-deviation indicators that indicate whether the output of the temporal filtering algorithm is producing a consistent output before allowing the output to be processed further. Inconsistent frames may then be discarded to reduce erroneous results.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The series time-averaged frame produced by the temporal filtering may then be normalized to reduce or eliminate various properties that might hinder signature analysis, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> at steps <b>254</b>-<b>258</b>. The steps completed during normalization may vary depending on the type of media being analyzed, expected user-modifications, and any other appropriate considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">For example, in the illustrated example, first-level signature module <b>208</b> normalizes received content by performing a Gaussian blur on the time-averaged frames at step <b>254</b>. In particular embodiments, this Gaussian blur reduces the sharpness of details. As a result, the Gaussian blur may reduce the impact that signal noise in the submitted content (whether introduced intentionally or unintentionally) has on signature analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the illustrated example, after performing a Gaussian blur on time-averaged frames, first-level signature module <b>208</b> may then perform a contrast stretch at step <b>256</b>. As part of performing this contrast stretch, first-level signature module <b>208</b> may increase the range of contrast present in the time-averaged frame to encompass the entire range recognizable within the relevant video format. This may improve image contrast, making images within the time-averaged frames easier to detect.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Then, after performing the contrast stretch, first-level signature module <b>208</b>, in the illustrated example, performs a histogram equalization at step <b>258</b>. Histogram equalization may increase the local contrast of images, allowing areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast without affecting the global contrast. As a result, histogram equalization increases the relative contrast between neighboring regions with similar contrast level. This may further improve image detection and analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">After normalization is complete, first-level signature module <b>208</b> may then perform segmentation on the normalized frames at step <b>260</b>.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">At step <b>262</b>, first-level signature module <b>208</b> completes the generation of this particular first-level signature by performing a scaled summation of the grayscale values of the various segments generated in step <b>260</b>.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In operation, signature server <b>20</b> receives various signatures generated by transcoders <b>18</b> (such as transcoders <b>18</b><i>e</i>-<i>g</i>) based on protected content files <b>32</b> received by system <b>10</b>. In particular embodiments, these signatures include one or more first-level protected signatures <b>36</b> for each protected content files <b>32</b> with each first-level protected signature <b>36</b> being generated by a different signature generation technique. These signatures may also include one or more second-level protected signature, such as protected thumbnail <b>40</b>, that includes additional information regarding the associated protected content file <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Signature server <b>20</b> may then store first-level protected signatures <b>36</b> in protected signature store <b>24</b> and protected thumbnails <b>40</b> in protected thumbnail store <b>26</b>.

This process is described in further detail below with respect to the processing of first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">After successfully mapping the first-level signatures for a particular protected content file <b>32</b> to a memory address, first-level comparison module <b>204</b> may store information in the mapped memory address to indicate that first-level signatures for a protected content files <b>32</b> map to that memory address. For example, in particular embodiments, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> may store a file identifier <b>312</b> for the relevant protected content files <b>32</b> in the mapped memory address. File identifier <b>312</b> may represent any appropriate information identifying the relevant protected content file <b>32</b>. Examples of file identifier <b>312</b> include, but are not limited to, a file name or storage location for the protected content file <b>32</b> that mapped to that memory address <b>314</b>, a link to a storage location for that protected content file <b>32</b>, a file name or storage location for a second-level signature associated with that protected content file <b>32</b>, a link to the relevant second-level signature, and/or any other information identifying the relevant protected content file <b>32</b> or its associated content signatures. As a result, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may build a map space <b>316</b> of memory locations in memory <b>216</b> that include all memory locations to which the first-level signatures associated with any of the received protected content files <b>32</b> map.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">After receiving content signatures for one or more protected content files <b>32</b>, signature server <b>20</b> may begin signature analysis of submitted content files <b>30</b>. As part of this process, signature server <b>20</b> may receive first-level signatures for a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> from one of transcoders <b>18</b>. In response to receiving first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b>, signature server <b>20</b> initiates first-level signature analysis using first-level comparison module <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">More specifically, in the illustrated example, signature server <b>20</b> receives first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>associated with a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> from a transcoder <b>18</b> or other appropriate element of system <b>10</b>. After receiving first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> from transcoders <b>18</b>, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> compares the first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> to corresponding first-level signatures for each of the protected content files <b>32</b> recognized by system <b>10</b>. Based on this comparison, signature server <b>20</b> determines whether to proceed with second-level signature analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In particular embodiments, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> may include a plurality of mapping modules <b>306</b> each associated with a particular signature algorithm and capable of mapping first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> generated with the associated signature algorithm to an address or range of addresses in memory <b>216</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, one of the first-level signature algorithms utilized by transcoders <b>18</b> may generate a chroma value for various portions of a selected frame of submitted content file <b>30</b> and then sum these chroma values to generate a first-level submitted signature based on these chroma values. A mapping module <b>306</b> associated with this chroma-based signature algorithm may then map the most-significant digits of this sum to a range of addresses in memory <b>216</b>. As a result, by successively mapping all of the first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> to an increasingly smaller sub-range of addresses and, ultimately, to one or more final addresses, signature server <b>20</b> may determine, based on the content of the final addresses, whether submitted content file <b>30</b> matches any of the protected content files <b>32</b> already processed by signature server <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">For instance, in the illustrated example, signature server <b>20</b> receives a plurality of two-bit first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> associated with submitted content file <b>30</b>. During first-level signature analysis, a first mapping module <b>306</b> (represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by mapping module <b>306</b><i>a</i>) maps a first-level submitted signature <b>34</b><i>a </i>associated with submitted content file <b>30</b> to a range of addresses in memory <b>216</b> (represented by bracket <b>318</b><i>a</i>). A second mapping module (mapping module <b>306</b><i>b</i>) may then map first-level submitted signature <b>34</b><i>b </i>to a sub-range range of addresses (represented by bracket <b>318</b><i>b</i>) within the address range identified by mapping module <b>306</b><i>a</i>. A third mapping (mapping module <b>306</b><i>c</i>) may then map first-level submitted signature <b>34</b><i>c </i>to a final memory address <b>314</b> (or final range of addresses) within memory <b>316</b> (represented by arrow <b>320</b>). Signature server <b>20</b> then determines whether any information is stored in memory address <b>314</b>. If not, signature server <b>20</b> determines that submitted content file <b>30</b> does not match any of the protected content files <b>32</b> recognized by signature server <b>20</b>. As a result, response module <b>310</b> may, in particular embodiments, notify a particular transcoder <b>18</b> that transcoder <b>18</b> is permitted to upload submitted content file <b>30</b> to submitted content store <b>22</b> and/or perform another requested operation with respect to submitted content file <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">If, instead, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> determines that information is stored in final memory address <b>314</b>, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> determines that first-level signatures for submitted content file <b>30</b> match first-level signatures for one or more protected content files <b>32</b>. In particular embodiments, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> may additionally determine the identity of the matched protected content files <b>32</b> based on file identifiers <b>312</b> stored in final memory address <b>314</b>. Furthermore, in response to determining that first-level signatures of submitted content file <b>30</b> match first-level signatures of one or more protected content files <b>32</b>, signature server <b>20</b> may initiate second-level signature analysis to perform a more detailed comparison of submitted content file <b>30</b> and protected content files <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As part of performing second-level signature analysis, signature server <b>20</b> may request second-level signatures for submitted content file <b>30</b> from one of transcoders <b>18</b>. In response, an appropriate transcoder <b>18</b> may transmit second-level signatures for submitted content file <b>30</b> to signature server <b>20</b>. Additionally, signature server <b>20</b> may retrieve second-level signatures for protected content files <b>32</b> from protected thumbnail store <b>26</b> or other locations within system <b>10</b>. In particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may only retrieve second-level signatures for protected content files <b>32</b> that matched submitted content file <b>30</b> during first-level signature analysis. For example, signature server <b>20</b> may utilize file identifiers <b>312</b> stored at the memory address <b>314</b> identified during first-level signature analysis to retrieve specific protected thumbnails <b>40</b> from protected thumbnail storage <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may map a second-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> (such as a submitted thumbnail <b>38</b>) to a memory location in a similar fashion to that described for first-level signature analysis. As a result, in such embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may include a second-level signature mapping module (not shown) to map the second-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> to an address in memory <b>214</b>. Signature server <b>20</b> may store, at a particular memory address, file identifiers <b>312</b> for protected content files <b>32</b> whose second-level signatures also map to that address. Alternatively, signature server <b>20</b> may do a bit-by-bit comparison of the second-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> to the second-level signatures for all matching protected files <b>32</b> identified during first-level signature analysis. More generally, however, signature server <b>20</b> may compare the second-level signatures of submitted content file <b>30</b> with the second-level signatures of the relevant protected content files <b>32</b> in any appropriate manner based on the configuration and capabilities of signature server <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">If signature server <b>20</b> determines that the second-level signature of submitted content file <b>30</b> does not match the second-level signatures of any of the protected content files <b>32</b> identified during first-level signature analysis, signature server <b>20</b> determines that submitted content file <b>30</b> does not match any of the protected content files <b>32</b> recognized by signature server <b>20</b>. As a result, response module <b>310</b> may, in particular embodiments, notify content an appropriate transcoder <b>18</b> that the relevant transcoder <b>18</b> is permitted to upload submitted content file <b>30</b> to submitted content store <b>22</b> and/or perform another requested operation with respect to submitted content file <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">If, instead, signature server <b>20</b> determines that the second-level signature of submitted content file <b>30</b> matches the second-level signatures of one or more protected content files <b>32</b>, signature server <b>20</b> may instruct response module <b>310</b> to initiate one or more remedial actions. As noted above, these remedial actions may represent any appropriate action executed, initiated, or induced by signature server <b>20</b> to limit or prevent use or misuse of the relevant protected content. In particular embodiments, remedial actions taken by signature server <b>20</b> may prevent submitted content file <b>30</b> from being uploaded to submitted content store <b>22</b> or subsequently downloaded from submitted content store <b>22</b>, notify users or human operator <b>42</b> that submitted content file <b>30</b> comprises protected content, or otherwise modify the manner in which submitted content file <b>30</b> is stored on or transmitted within system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As one example, response module <b>310</b> may refuse a request to upload submitted content file or instruct content management server <b>16</b> to do so. For example, if the signature server <b>20</b> determines that second-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> matches the second-level signature for one or more protected content files <b>32</b>, response module <b>310</b> may inform (e.g., via an HTTP response or email message) a user attempting to upload submitted content file <b>30</b> that submitted content file <b>30</b> will not be uploaded. Alternatively, response module <b>310</b> may instruct content management server <b>16</b> to refuse the upload request and to inform the relevant user.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As another example, response module <b>310</b> may generate an email message identifying submitted content file <b>30</b> and indicating that submitted content file <b>30</b> appears to represent or include protected content. Response module <b>310</b> may then transmit the email to a user attempting to upload or download submitted content file <b>30</b> and request that user to contact an operator of system <b>10</b> (such as human operator <b>42</b>) to confirm that submitted content file does not represent or include protected content. Additionally or alternatively, response module <b>310</b> may transmit the email message to human operator <b>42</b> and request that human operator <b>42</b> verify that submitted content file <b>30</b> does not, in fact, represent or include protected content. In addition, in particular embodiments, response module <b>310</b> may include all or a portion of submitted content file <b>30</b> and/or any matched protected content files <b>32</b> to facilitate review by operator <b>42</b>. For example, response module <b>310</b> may include a thumbnail of one or more frames each of submitted content file <b>30</b> and the matched protected content files <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As yet another example, signature server <b>20</b> may log information about a user attempting to upload, download, or otherwise use submitted content file <b>30</b>, such as a user name or internet protocol (IP) address. Because such behavior may violate a user agreement associated with a particular embodiment of system <b>10</b>, signature server <b>20</b> may monitor and record usage of protected content files <b>32</b>. An operator of system <b>10</b> may then take disciplinary action against the relevant user, such as terminating the user's account on system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Thus, signature server <b>20</b> may provide a number of techniques for efficiently identifying protected content within submitted content files <b>30</b>. In particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may reduce the time and processing resources expended in identifying protected content by limiting the number of comparison performed during signature analysis. Additionally, particular embodiments of signature server may map content signatures to memory locations, which may also reduce the time and processing resources required to determine whether a particular submitted content file <b>30</b> matches any protected content files <b>32</b>. As a result, particular embodiments of signature server <b>20</b> may provide several benefits. Specific embodiment may, however, provide some, none, or all of these benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In addition, although the description above describes, for purposes of simplicity, an embodiment of signature server in which signature server <b>20</b> receives or generates each of first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> once for submitted content file <b>30</b>, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> may instead utilize signature algorithms that are applied to a single frame or other portion of submitted content file <b>30</b>. In such embodiments, the described process may be repeated for multiple frames of a submitted content file <b>30</b>. For example, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> may sample a frame of submitted content file <b>30</b> every five seconds, and perform first-level signature analysis on each of these sampled frames.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Additionally, instead of sampling a single frame at each sampling interval, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> may sample a time-averaged aggregation of multiple frames. As a result, in particular embodiments, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> may account for the possibility that any protected content in submitted content file <b>30</b> has been temporally shifted. For example, if a user attempts to upload a submitted content file <b>30</b> that includes a portion of a protected movie time-shifted by thirty (30) seconds, particular embodiments of system <b>10</b> may be capable of correctly identifying the time-shifted submitted content file <b>30</b> as containing protected content.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Furthermore, in such embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may initiate second-level signature analysis only after matching first-level submitted signatures <b>34</b> for multiple frames of submitted content file <b>30</b> to corresponding signatures for multiple frames of protected content files <b>32</b>. For example, signature server <b>20</b> may be configured to initiate second-level signature analysis only after matching a threshold number of frames from submitted content file <b>30</b> to frames of protected content files <b>32</b>. As a result, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> may count the number of matches between first-level signatures of submitted content file <b>30</b> and protected content files <b>32</b>, and second-level comparison module <b>308</b> may initiate second-level signature analysis only after first-level comparison module <b>304</b> has determined that more than a threshold number of frames have been matched.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Additionally, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may be capable of adjusting this minimum threshold number to optimize the effectiveness of the signature analysis performed by signature server <b>20</b> and/or the system resources expended to perform that analysis. For example, signature server <b>20</b> may raise the minimum threshold if signature server <b>20</b> too frequently initiates second-level signature analysis for all submitted content files <b>30</b> or if signature server <b>20</b> too frequently initiates second-level signature analysis for submitted content files <b>30</b> that are ultimately determined not to comprise protected content. For example, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may adjust the minimum threshold based on a number of false positive results generated by signature server <b>20</b> during a predetermined period of time. These false positive results may represent, or be estimated based upon, any appropriate indication that second-level signature analysis is being too frequently performed on submitted content files <b>30</b>. The number of false positive results may be calculated or estimated based on the number of false positives actually generated from a sample set of requests (e.g., during quality-control testing), the number of remedial actions taken (e.g., the total number of download requests declined) over a predetermined time period, the number of times signature server <b>20</b> detects a match between a first-level submitted signature <b>34</b> and a first-level protected signature <b>36</b> over a predetermined time period, the number of complaints received from users regarding declined download requests, and/or any other indication that the first-level signature analysis performed by signature server <b>20</b> incorrectly suggested or predicted that the requested submitted content file <b>30</b> contained protected content. If the number of false positives generated during a specified period of time exceeds a predetermined maximum, signature server <b>20</b> may increase the threshold to reduce the frequency with which signature server <b>20</b> initiates second-level analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">By contrast, if it is determined that a significant number of submitted content files <b>30</b> that contain protected content are passing through first-level signature analysis undetected, this minimum threshold may be lowered to further limit the amount of protected content passing through signature analysis undetected. For example, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may adjust the minimum threshold based on a number of false negative results generated by signature server <b>20</b> during a predetermined period of time. These false negative results may represent, or be estimated based upon, any appropriate indication that second-level signature analysis is not being performed frequently enough and/or too many submitted content files are being downloaded/uploaded without appropriate remedial actions being initiated. For example, the number of false negative results may be calculated or estimated based on the number of false negatives actually generated from a sample set of requests (e.g., during quality-control testing), the total number of remedial actions taken (e.g., the total number of download requests declined) over a predetermined time period, the number of times signature server <b>20</b> detects a match between a first-level submitted signature <b>34</b> and a first-level protected signature <b>36</b> over a predetermined time period, the number of complaints received from content owners regarding protected content being distributed on system <b>10</b>, and/or any other indication that the first-level signature analysis performed by signature server <b>20</b> incorrectly suggested or predicted that the requested submitted content file <b>30</b> did not contain any protected content. If the number of false negatives generated during a specified period of time exceeds a predetermined maximum, signature server <b>20</b> may decrease the threshold to increase the frequency with which signature server <b>20</b> initiates second-level analysis. Thus, first-level comparison module <b>304</b> (or other appropriate components of signature server <b>20</b>) may tune the minimum threshold to optimize both the amount of time and resources spent on second-level analysis and the frequency with which protected content escapes signature analysis undetected.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The minimum threshold may also be adjusted to maintain a particular level of network traffic. Thus, as the number of users that are active and/or currently uploading submitted content files <b>30</b> to system <b>10</b> increases, the minimum threshold may be increased. This may reduce the frequency with which system <b>10</b> initiates second-level analysis and, as a result, limit the amount of network traffic resulting from the exchange of second-level signatures between the various components responsible for generating and matching second-level signatures. Additionally, this may limit the frequency with which second-level analysis is initiated at times when the network is receiving a large number of upload/download requests from users to prevent a backlog of requests from forming. By contrast, as the number of users that are active and/or uploading/downloading submitted content files <b>30</b> to system <b>10</b> decreases, system <b>10</b> may devote additional network bandwidth to the exchange of second-level signatures between the relevant components by reducing this minimum threshold. As a result, signature analysis techniques can be also adjusted to optimize use of available network bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> is a flowchart illustrating example operation of a particular embodiment of signature system <b>10</b> in determining whether a submitted content file <b>30</b> represents or includes protected content. Although the example focuses on a particular embodiment of system <b>10</b> in which transcoders <b>18</b> are responsible for generating all content signatures for submitted content files <b>30</b> and protected content files <b>32</b>, in particular embodiments of system <b>10</b>, signatures server <b>20</b> (or other appropriate components of system <b>10</b>) may instead generate some or all content signatures used by signature server <b>20</b> during analysis. More generally, the steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> may be combined, modified, or deleted where appropriate. Additional steps may also be added to the example operation. Furthermore, the described steps may be performed in any suitable order without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Operation begins at step <b>400</b> with content management server <b>16</b> receiving a request to upload a submitted content file <b>30</b>. At step <b>402</b>, content management server <b>16</b> stores submitted content file <b>30</b> on submitted content store <b>22</b>. In particular embodiments, one or more transcoders <b>18</b> may transcode submitted content file <b>30</b> into a particular format (e.g., a commonly-requested encoding) before storing the submitted content file <b>30</b> on submitted content store <b>22</b>. In alternative embodiments, content management server <b>16</b> may store submitted content file <b>30</b> in the same form and format as submitted content file <b>30</b> is received.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Users may then retrieve submitted content file <b>30</b> from submitted content store <b>22</b> by requesting the file from content management server <b>20</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, a user may user a client <b>12</b> to transmit a download request (e.g., an HTTP request) over network <b>28</b> to content management server <b>16</b>. This download request may identify submitted content file <b>30</b> or otherwise request download of submitted content file <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">At step <b>404</b>, content management server <b>16</b> receives the download request. Content management server <b>16</b>, in particular embodiments, forwards the download request to a selected transcoder <b>18</b> or otherwise notifies the selected transcoder <b>18</b> of the request at step <b>406</b>. The selected transcoder <b>18</b> may then retrieve the requested submitted content file <b>30</b> at step <b>408</b>. In alternative embodiments, content management server <b>16</b> may itself retrieve the requested submitted content file <b>30</b> from submitted content store <b>22</b> and transmit submitted content file <b>30</b> to the selected transcoder <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">At step <b>410</b>, the selected transcoder <b>18</b> decodes submitted content file <b>30</b>. The selected transcoder <b>18</b> then generates one or more first-level signatures based on submitted content file <b>30</b> at step <b>412</b>. The first-level signature or signatures describe at least a first characteristic of submitted media file <b>30</b>. Although, in the example described by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, first-level signatures are generated from a decoded copy of submitted content file <b>30</b>, in particular embodiments, some or all of first-level signatures may be generated from encoded content without decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Transcoder <b>18</b> then transmits the first-level signatures for submitted content file <b>30</b> to signature server <b>20</b> at step <b>414</b>. As discussed above, signature server <b>20</b> has access to a collection of first-level signatures for protected content files <b>32</b>. Each of these stored first-level signatures describes a characteristic of a particular protected content file <b>32</b>. Upon receiving the first-level signature of submitted content file <b>30</b>, signature server <b>20</b> determines, at step <b>416</b>, whether the first-level signatures of submitted content file <b>30</b> match the set of first-level signatures for any protected content files <b>32</b> stored on signature server <b>20</b>. If not, signature server <b>20</b> permits submitted content file <b>30</b> to be downloaded with operation continuing at step <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">If, instead, signature server <b>20</b> determines that the first-level signatures for submitted content file <b>30</b> match the first-level signatures for one or more protected content files <b>32</b>, signature server <b>20</b> may identify the protected content files <b>32</b> having first-level signatures matching the first-level signatures of submitted content file <b>30</b> at step <b>418</b>. For example, in particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> maps the first-level signatures for submitted content file <b>30</b> to a particular memory location. Information identifying protected content files <b>32</b> having first-level signatures that map to this memory location may be stored in the location. At step <b>420</b>, signature server <b>20</b> retrieves second-level signatures associated with the identified protected content files <b>32</b> from protected signature store <b>24</b> or another storage location within system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">At step <b>422</b>, signature server <b>20</b> requests that a second-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> be generated by the selected transcoder <b>18</b>. In response, the selected transcoder <b>18</b> generates a second-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> and transmits the second-level signature to signature server <b>20</b> at step <b>424</b>. The second-level signature describes at least a second characteristic of submitted content file <b>30</b>. In particular embodiments, as noted above, the second-level signature may comprise a portion of submitted content file <b>30</b> itself, such as a thumbnail of submitted content file <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">At step <b>426</b>, signature server <b>20</b> determines whether the second-level signature of submitted content file <b>30</b> matches any of the second-level signatures for the identified protected content files <b>32</b>. If signature server <b>20</b> determines that the second-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> does not match the second level-signature for any of the identified protected content files <b>32</b>, signature server <b>20</b> permits submitted content file <b>30</b> to be uploaded with operation continuing at step <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">If, instead, signature server <b>20</b> determines that the second-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> matches a second-level signature for one of the identified protected content files <b>32</b>, signature server <b>20</b> initiates a remedial action. The remedial action may represent any appropriate action taken to prevent the submitted content file <b>30</b> from being used and/or misused on system <b>10</b>. Examples of the remedial action that may be initiated by signature server <b>20</b> in particular embodiments include, but are not limited to, instructing content management server <b>16</b> to decline the request to download or store submitted content file <b>30</b>, notifying the user that submitted content file <b>30</b> comprises protected content, and transmitting submitted content file <b>30</b> to a human operator for review. In the illustrated example, signature server <b>20</b> initiates a remedial action by denying the download request (or by instructing other components of system <b>10</b> to deny the download request) at step <b>428</b>. In particular embodiments, signature server <b>20</b> may also take steps to ensure that submitted content file <b>30</b> is not accessed by subsequent requests, such as by removing submitted content file <b>30</b> from submitted content store <b>22</b>, flagging submitted content file <b>30</b> as protected, and/or preventing submitted content file from being identified as a result in searches of submitted content store <b>22</b>. Operation of signature server <b>20</b> may then end with respect to uploading submitted content file <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">If, however, signature server <b>20</b> determines, at step <b>416</b>, that the first-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> doesn't match the first-level signature for any of protected content files <b>32</b> or if signature server <b>20</b> determines, at step <b>426</b>, that the second-level signature for submitted content file <b>30</b> doesn't match the second-level signature for any of the matched protected content files <b>32</b>, then signature server <b>20</b> may notify the relevant transcoder <b>18</b> that transcoder <b>18</b> can complete the download request at step <b>430</b>. Transcoder <b>18</b> may then encode the raw content of submitted content file <b>30</b> in an appropriate format at step <b>432</b>. As noted above, in particular embodiments, transcoder <b>18</b> may support multiple different formats and may encode submitted content file <b>30</b> in a different format than submitted content file <b>30</b> was encoded when stored in submitted content store <b>22</b>. For example, at the outset of the described signature analysis, transcoder <b>18</b> may decode submitted content file <b>30</b> based on a first codec (e.g., a codec associated with the original encoding of submitted content file <b>30</b>) and, after successfully completing the signature analysis, encode submitted content file <b>30</b> based on a second codec (e.g., a code suitable for transmission to or display by the requesting client <b>12</b>). Transcoder <b>18</b> may then transmit the encoded submitted content file <b>30</b> to the requesting client <b>12</b> at step <b>434</b>. Operation of signature server <b>20</b> may then end with respect to downloading submitted content file <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>.</p>
