<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention are generally directed to a method, apparatus and system to manage distributed channel access with time reservation. In this regard, in accordance with but one example implementation of the broader teachings of the present invention, a reservation agent is introduced. In accordance with but one example embodiment, the reservation agent employs an innovative method to reserve an overestimated amount of time to transmit and then to release any unused time reserved. The reservation may not know the precise duration of the transmission a priori because it may not know the transmit rate, it may not know the amount of data to be sent, or it may not know how many retransmissions will be required. According to one example method, the reservation agent may broadcast a frame that will inhibit other devices in the network from attempting to broadcast for a specified amount of time and then may broadcast a frame to release any used portion of the time reservation, as described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the invention can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an example network environment suitable for implementing the reservation agent, in accordance with one example embodiment of the invention. In accordance with the illustrated example embodiment, network environment <b>100</b> may include one or more of stations <b>102</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>112</b>, reservation agent <b>104</b>, and network areas <b>106</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> coupled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Reservation agent <b>104</b>, as described more fully hereinafter, may well be used in electronic appliances and network environments of greater or lesser complexity than that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Also, the innovative attributes of reservation agent <b>104</b> as described more fully hereinafter may well be embodied in any combination of hardware and software.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Stations <b>102</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>112</b> may represent laptop, desktop, or handheld computing devices or any other computing devices or appliances that can access network resources through a wireless network and that host reservation agent <b>104</b>. As used herein, a wireless network generally represents any network wherein communications do not require the use of wires or cables. Examples of wireless networks include, but are not limited to, wireless local area networks (WLAN), wireless metropolitan area networks (WMAN), wireless wide are networks (WWAN), and wireless personal area networks (WPAN). In one embodiment, though the present invention is not so limited, stations <b>102</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>112</b> may represent The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) 802.11n (amendment to 802.11 standard, under development) compliant stations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Network areas <b>106</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> may represent the maximum signal ranges for stations <b>102</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>112</b>, respectively. Though depicted as two-dimensional circles for illustration purposes, network areas <b>106</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> may be three-dimensional and may be any shape based on obstructions, terrain, and other factors. In one embodiment, stations <b>102</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>112</b> may be located such that each can communicate with the others, thereby creating a network with shared channel access.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reservation agent <b>104</b> may have an architecture as described in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Reservation agent <b>104</b> may also perform one or more methods for managing channel access with a time reservation, such as the method described in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of an example reservation agent architecture, in accordance with one example embodiment of the invention. As shown, reservation agent <b>104</b> may include one or more of control logic <b>202</b>, memory <b>204</b>, wireless network interface <b>206</b>, and reservation engine <b>208</b> coupled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, to be developed more fully below, reservation agent <b>104</b> may include a reservation engine <b>208</b> comprising one or more of reserve services <b>210</b>, transmit services <b>212</b>, and/or release services <b>214</b>. It is to be appreciated that, although depicted as a number of disparate functional blocks, one or more of elements <b>202</b>-<b>214</b> may well be combined into one or more multi-functional blocks. Similarly, reservation engine <b>208</b> may well be practiced with fewer functional blocks, i.e., with only transmit services <b>212</b>, without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present invention, and may well be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. In this regard, reservation agent <b>104</b> in general, and reservation engine <b>208</b> in particular, are merely illustrative of one example implementation of one aspect of the present invention. As used herein, reservation agent <b>104</b> may well be embodied in hardware, software, firmware and/or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As introduced above, reservation agent <b>104</b> may have the ability to reserve channel access for longer than necessary to transmit and then to release any excess time reservation when finished transmitting. In one embodiment, reservation agent <b>104</b> may overestimate the amount of time needed to transmit based on the size of the communication to be transmitted. In the same and other embodiments, reservation agent <b>104</b> may reserve a predefined maximum amount of time to transmit. One skilled in the art would appreciate that reservation agent <b>104</b> can provide for efficient use of a network channel by minimizing collisions between communications of network devices and minimizing unused channel access.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein control logic <b>202</b> provides the logical interface between reservation agent <b>104</b> and its host station (for example <b>102</b>). In this regard, control logic <b>202</b> may manage one or more aspects of reservation agent <b>104</b> to provide a communication interface from station <b>102</b> to wireless network communications, e.g., through wireless interface <b>206</b> and one or more antenna(e).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one aspect of the present invention, though the claims are not so limited, control logic <b>202</b> may receive event indications such as, e.g., receipt from the host station of a communication to be transmitted. Upon receiving such an indication, control logic <b>202</b> may selectively invoke the resource(s) of reservation engine <b>208</b>. As part of an example method for managing distributed channel access with time reservation, as explained in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, control logic <b>202</b> may selectively invoke reserve services <b>210</b> or release services <b>214</b> that may reserve or release channel access, respectively. Control logic <b>202</b> also may selectively invoke transmit services <b>212</b>, as explained in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to transmit to one or more other station(s). As used herein, control logic <b>202</b> is intended to represent any of a wide variety of control logic known in the art and, as such, may well be implemented as a microprocessor, a micro-controller, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), programmable logic device (PLD) and the like. In some implementations, control logic <b>202</b> is intended to represent content (e.g., software instructions, etc.), which when executed implements the features of control logic <b>202</b> described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Memory <b>204</b> is intended to represent any of a wide variety of memory devices and/or systems known in the art. According to one example implementation, though the claims are not so limited, memory <b>204</b> may well include volatile and non-volatile memory elements, possibly random access memory (RAM) and/or read only memory (ROM). Memory <b>204</b> may be used to store communication(s) to be transmitted and/or a network allocation vector (NAV), which may indicate if the network channel is reserved and for how long.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Wireless network interface <b>206</b> provides a path through which reservation agent <b>104</b> can communicate with other network devices, for example among stations <b>102</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>112</b>. Wireless network interface <b>206</b> is intended to represent any of a wide variety of network interfaces and/or controllers known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As introduced above, reservation engine <b>208</b> may be selectively invoked by control logic <b>202</b> to reserve an overestimated amount of time to transmit a communication(s), to transmit the communication(s), and to release any excess time reservation no longer needed. In accordance with the illustrated example implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reservation engine <b>208</b> is depicted comprising one or more of reserve services <b>210</b>, transmit services <b>212</b> and release services <b>214</b>. Although depicted as a number of disparate elements, those skilled in the art will appreciate that one or more elements <b>210</b>-<b>214</b> of reservation engine <b>208</b> may well be combined without deviating from the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reserve services <b>210</b>, as introduced above, may provide reservation agent <b>104</b> with the ability to reserve an overestimated amount of time to transmit a communication(s). In one example embodiment, reserve services <b>210</b> may generate a frame to be transmitted that when received by other stations in the wireless network, causes the other stations to not transmit on the network channel for a specified amount of time. Reserve services <b>210</b> may also respond to the receipt of such frames by setting a medium reservation timer (referred to here as NAV) to keep from transmitting on the network channel for a specified amount of time. In one example embodiment, the amount of time to reserve may based on the size of the communication(s) and an underestimate of the rate of transfer that can be achieved. Although the present invention is not so limited, the overestimated time reservation may be a maximum available time reservation. Other methods of overestimating the amount of time to reserve that do not deviate from the scope of the present invention will occur to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As introduced above, transmit services <b>212</b> may provide reservation agent <b>104</b> with the ability to transmit the communication(s). Transmit services <b>212</b> may first verify that a NAV is not active indicating that another station has reserved the network channel. In one embodiment, transmit services <b>212</b> may include error correction capabilities to ensure that each frame was properly transmitted and received. In one example embodiment, transmit services <b>212</b> may retransmit frames that were not properly received.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Release services <b>214</b>, as introduced above, may provide reservation agent <b>104</b> with the ability to release any excess time reservation after the communication(s) have been transmitted. In one embodiment, release services <b>214</b> may generate a frame to be transmitted that when received by other stations in the wireless network, causes the other stations to transmit at will on the network channel. Reserve services <b>210</b> may also respond to the receipt of such frames by clearing a NAV that had kept the station from transmitting on the network channel. In one example embodiment, release services <b>214</b> may use a quality of service (QoS) frame as defined in The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) 802.11e (amendment to 802.11 standard, under development), for example a QoS-Null frame with a zero duration value addressed to the broadcast address may be interpreted as an indication to clear the NAV. In another example embodiment, release services may use another frame that is understood by the network stations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart of an example method for managing distributed channel access with time reservation, in accordance with one example embodiment of the invention. It will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that although the following operations may be described as a sequential process, many of the operations may in fact be performed in parallel or concurrently. In addition, the order of the operations may be re-arranged without departing from the spirit of embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to but one example implementation, the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> begins with control logic <b>202</b> invoking reserve services <b>210</b> to reserve (<b>302</b>) an overestimated time reservation. In one example embodiment, reserve services <b>210</b> of station <b>102</b> may generate a frame that is transmitted by transmit services <b>212</b> (provided, there is no NAV restriction) through wireless network interface <b>206</b> to stations <b>108</b> and <b>112</b>. In one example embodiment, stations <b>108</b> and <b>112</b> receive the frame from station <b>102</b> and set a NAV that gives station <b>102</b> use of the network channel for a specified amount of time that from the point of view of station <b>102</b> is an overestimate of the amount of time actually needed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Next, transmit services <b>212</b> may be invoked to transmit (<b>304</b>). In one example embodiment, transmit services <b>212</b> of station <b>102</b> may broadcast (and rebroadcast if necessary) frames to station <b>108</b> and/or station <b>112</b> for as long as a time reservation is active.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Control logic <b>202</b> may then release (<b>306</b>) the time reservation by invoking release services <b>214</b>. In one example embodiment, when transmit services <b>212</b> no longer needs a time reservation of the network channel (for example, when finished transmitting a communication), release services <b>214</b> of station <b>102</b> may generate a frame that is transmitted through wireless network interface <b>206</b> to stations <b>108</b> and <b>112</b>. In one example embodiment, stations <b>108</b> and <b>112</b> receive the frame from station <b>102</b> and clear a NAV, thereby freeing up access to the network channel.</p>

In this regard, storage medium <b>400</b> includes content <b>402</b> (e.g., instructions, data, or any combination thereof) which, when executed, causes the appliance to implement one or more aspects of reservation agent <b>104</b>, described above.</p>
