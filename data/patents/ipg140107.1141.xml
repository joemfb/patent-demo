<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope to those who are skilled in the art. Numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example embodiments may be embodied in many different forms and that neither should be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having,&#x201d; are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;engaged to&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, engaged, connected or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly engaged to&#x201d;, &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there may be no intervening elements or layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; etc.). As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Terms such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and other numerical terms when used herein do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;inner,&#x201d; &#x201c;outer,&#x201d; &#x201c;beneath&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Spatially relative terms may be intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the example term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated <b>90</b> degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Initially, it is noted that for the sake of brevity throughout the disclosure the term &#x201c;liquid&#x201d; may be used to refer to any substances that may be used in a dispensing apparatus according to aspects of this disclosure. Similarly, it is noted that throughout the disclosure, for the sake of brevity, the term &#x201c;spray&#x201d; may be used to refer to how substances may be expelled from a nozzle of a dispensing apparatus according to aspects of this disclosure. However, this term is not intended to be limiting and may be interchangeable with other terms (e.g., mist, fine spray, coarse spray, stream, etc.) that describe how substances such as liquid may be expelled from the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An illustrative embodiment of an apparatus for dispensing a liquid as a spray according to one aspect of the disclosure is shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is an end view of an illustrative embodiment of an apparatus for dispensing a liquid as a spray according to aspects of the disclosure. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a sectional view of the illustrative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> may include a container or tube <b>101</b> (generally referred to as &#x201c;tube <b>101</b>&#x201d; herein) and a nozzle <b>103</b>. The tube <b>101</b> may include a compressible section <b>105</b> and a tip section <b>107</b>. The nozzle <b>103</b> may engage with the tip section <b>107</b> of the tube <b>101</b>. According to aspects of the disclosure, the tube <b>101</b> may hold a liquid. For example, the compressible section <b>105</b> of the tube <b>101</b> may hold the liquid. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> may also include channels <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b, </i><b>109</b><i>c, </i>a spin chamber <b>111</b> and an orifice <b>113</b> through which the liquid contained in the tube <b>101</b> may be dispensed as a spray.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The operation of the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> is described below. As discussed above, the tube <b>101</b> may include a compressible section <b>105</b> and the compressible section <b>105</b> may contain a liquid. In order to expel the liquid from the tube <b>101</b>, a user may compress the compressible section <b>105</b> of the tube <b>101</b>. By compressing the compressible section <b>105</b> of the tube <b>101</b>, the liquid in the tube <b>101</b> may be forced from the compressible section <b>105</b> of the tube <b>101</b> into the tip section <b>107</b>. Further, the liquid may be forced from the tip section <b>107</b> through the channels <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b, </i><b>109</b><i>c, </i>and into a spin chamber <b>111</b>. As the liquid travels around the spin chamber <b>111</b>, the liquid is atomized and dispensed as a spray through the orifice <b>113</b> at the end of the nozzle <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Given the general description of various example aspects of the disclosure provided above, more detailed descriptions of various specific example features of dispensing apparatus structures according to the disclosure are provided below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Initially, according to aspects of the disclosure, the dispensing apparatus may have closed (or &#x201c;off&#x201d;) configuration and an open (or &#x201c;on&#x201d;) configuration. It is noted that the closed configuration may be useful in preventing leaking or contamination of the liquid. In such embodiments of the disclosure, the user may rotate the nozzle <b>103</b> relative to the tube <b>101</b> to convert the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> from a closed configuration to an open configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the nozzle <b>103</b> may be engaged with the tip section <b>107</b> of the tube <b>101</b>. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the nozzle <b>103</b> may be engaged with the tip section <b>107</b> of the tube <b>101</b> by an interference fit. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the tip section <b>107</b> may include protrusions that interfere with grooves in the interior of the nozzle <b>103</b>. According to aspects of the disclosure, the engagement means between the tube <b>101</b> and the nozzle <b>103</b> may allow for the nozzle <b>103</b> to be rotated relative to the tube <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, according to aspects of the disclosure, the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> may include a stopping system which stops the rotation of the nozzle <b>103</b> relative to the tube <b>101</b> at particular positions. For example, according to aspects of the disclosure, the nozzle <b>103</b> and the tip <b>107</b> may each include one or more stops that will stop the rotation of the nozzle <b>103</b> relative to the tube <b>101</b> at particular positions. The stops may be positioned on the exterior of the tip <b>107</b> and the interior of the nozzle <b>103</b> so as to interfere with each other at particular positions and, thereby, stop the rotation of the nozzle relative to the tube <b>101</b> at particular positions (e.g., the open position and the closed position).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to aspects of the disclosure, the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> may include one or more fluidic channels for providing fluidic communication between the tube <b>101</b> and an orifice <b>113</b> of nozzle <b>103</b>. For example, the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> may include one or more of each of channels <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b </i>and <b>109</b><i>c. </i>For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> includes two channels <b>109</b><i>a, </i>two channels <b>109</b><i>b, </i>and two channels <b>109</b><i>c. </i>The channels may be a recess or opening in either the tip section <b>107</b> or the nozzle <b>103</b>, defined between the two portions (i.e., the tip section <b>107</b> or the nozzle <b>103</b>) or according to aspects of the disclosure, the tube <b>101</b> and nozzle <b>103</b> may conjointly include the channels <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b, </i>and <b>109</b><i>c. </i>For example, according to some embodiments, such as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the tip section <b>107</b> may include channel <b>109</b><i>a. </i>According to some embodiments, such as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the nozzle <b>103</b> may include channel <b>109</b><i>b. </i>According to some embodiments of the disclosure, the channel <b>109</b><i>c </i>may be included in either the tip section <b>107</b> or the nozzle <b>103</b>. Further, according to some embodiments of the disclosure, the channel <b>109</b><i>c </i>may be included in the same portion (i.e., the tip section <b>107</b> or the nozzle <b>103</b>) as the spin chamber <b>111</b> which will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Regardless of which portion they are formed within, the channels <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b </i>and <b>109</b><i>c </i>may be aligned with each other to form a passage or waterway. For example, according to aspects of the disclosure, when aligned, such as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, channel(s) <b>109</b><i>c </i>may connect the channel(s) <b>109</b><i>b </i>with the spin chamber <b>111</b>. Further, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, channel(s) <b>109</b><i>b </i>may connect with the channel(s) <b>109</b><i>a. </i>Hence, liquid may travel from the tube <b>101</b> through the channels, <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b </i>and <b>109</b><i>c </i>to the spin chamber <b>111</b> to be dispensed through orifice <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is noted that when the dispensing apparatus is positioned at particular orientations (e.g., during an intended use) channels <b>109</b><i>b </i>may be considered vertical channels while channels <b>109</b><i>a </i>and channels <b>109</b><i>c </i>are considered horizontal channels. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, channels <b>109</b><i>b </i>may be relatively perpendicular to channels <b>109</b><i>a </i>and channels <b>109</b><i>c. </i>Hence, merely for reference purposes, channels <b>109</b><i>b </i>will be referred to as vertical channels and channels <b>109</b><i>a </i>and <b>109</b><i>c </i>will be referred to as horizontal channels.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As discussed above, the nozzle <b>103</b> may be rotated relative to the tube <b>101</b> between a first position and a second position. In the first position, vertical channel(s) <b>109</b><i>b </i>aligns with each of horizontal channel(s) <b>109</b><i>b </i>and <b>109</b><i>c </i>(e.g., as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) such that the waterway is created. In the second position, the nozzle is rotated so that vertical channel(s) <b>109</b><i>b </i>does not align with each of horizontal channel(s) <b>109</b><i>a </i>and instead the channel <b>109</b><i>a </i>is sealed by the section of the interior of the nozzle <b>103</b>. In this way, the tube <b>101</b> is sealed and leakage may be prevented. In other words, the first position would be the open position wherein the channels are aligned with each other so that <b>109</b><i>a </i>communicates with <b>109</b><i>b </i>and <b>109</b><i>c </i>in order to allow liquid to flow from the tube <b>101</b> through the channels <b>109</b> and into the spin chamber <b>111</b>. The second position would be the closed position wherein the channel <b>109</b><i>a </i>is sealed. Hence, it is understood, that the nozzle <b>103</b> may be rotated relative to the tube <b>101</b> between the first (or open) position and the second (or closed) position. According to aspects of this disclosure, the first and second positions may be <b>90</b> degrees apart. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, if the nozzle <b>103</b> were rotated 90 degrees, each of the two vertical channels <b>109</b><i>b </i>would be moved out of alignment with the horizontal channels <b>109</b><i>a </i>and <b>109</b><i>c </i>and, hence, the tube <b>101</b> would be sealed by the interior wall of the nozzle <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As discussed above, according to aspects of the disclosure, there may be one or multiple channels <b>109</b><i>a, </i>one or multiple channels <b>109</b><i>b </i>and one or multiple channels <b>109</b><i>c. </i>In embodiments which include multiple channels of each of <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b, </i><b>109</b><i>c, </i>each of the multiple channels <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b, </i>and <b>109</b><i>c </i>may be positioned appropriately to form sets. For example, a set of two channels <b>109</b><i>a </i>may be positioned 180&#xb0; from each other (e.g., as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). As another example, a set of three channels <b>109</b><i>a </i>may be positioned 120&#xb0; from each other. Sets of the other channels <b>109</b><i>b </i>and <b>109</b><i>c </i>may be positioned similarly. Further, each set of channels (e.g., <b>109</b><i>a</i>) may be positioned so that when properly aligned it may communicate with a respective set other channels (e.g., <b>109</b><i>b </i>and <b>109</b><i>c</i>) and multiple waterways may be provided. However, it is noted that according to aspects of this disclosure, that channels do not have to be formed in sets. Further it is noted, that channels <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b, </i><b>109</b><i>c </i>may be positioned at various increments such as 30&#xb0;, 45&#xb0;, 60, 90&#xb0;, etc. For example, it is noted that vertical channels <b>109</b><i>b </i>may be angularly located at any angle. For example, in one embodiment the vertical channels <b>109</b><i>b </i>may be 90&#xb0; apart for two positions [one off/closed and one on/open] or may be 60&#xb0; apart for three positions [one off/closed and two on/open with two different spray patterns].</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to aspects of this disclosure, the nozzle <b>103</b> may include an atomizer. In the illustrative embodiment, the atomizer may be in the form of a spin chamber <b>111</b>. It is noted that according to aspects of the disclosure, the spin chamber <b>111</b> may be positioned in either the nozzle <b>103</b> or the tube <b>101</b> or defined by a combination of the engagement of the nozzle <b>103</b> and the tube <b>101</b>. For example, according to aspects of the disclosure, the tube <b>101</b> and nozzle <b>103</b> may conjointly include a spin chamber <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to aspects of the disclosure, the waterways formed by the channels <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b, </i>and <b>109</b><i>c </i>and communicate with the spin chamber <b>111</b> such that liquid from the tube <b>101</b> may be introduced into the spin chamber <b>111</b>. As the liquid is introduced into the spin chamber, it may create a vortex in the center of the spin chamber <b>111</b> that sucks air into the spin chamber <b>111</b>. For example, the liquid may flow circumferentially around the walls of the spin chamber to create the vortex. Therefore, in the spin chamber <b>111</b>, the liquid is atomized by air that is brought down the center of the vortex which is created by the spinning liquid. The atomized liquid exits through the nozzle orifice <b>113</b>. In some embodiments the atomized liquid may form a conical spray.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is noted that the angle at which the channel <b>109</b><i>c </i>connects the vertical channel <b>109</b><i>b </i>with the spin chamber <b>111</b> may affect how the liquid is dispensed from the dispensing apparatus. For example, if the channel <b>109</b><i>c </i>connects to the spin chamber <b>111</b> at an angle such as at a tangent as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, then when the liquid is introduced to the spin chamber <b>111</b>, a fine mist may be produced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> schematically illustrates a fine mist being dispensed from the illustrative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to aspects of the disclosure. Alternatively, if the channel <b>109</b><i>c </i>connects with the spin chamber <b>111</b> without being angled (e.g., on a direct path from the vertical channel <b>109</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> or toward the center of the spin chamber <b>111</b>), then when the liquid is introduced to the spin chamber <b>111</b>, a stream is produced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> schematically illustrates a stream being dispensed from the illustrative embodiment according to aspects of the disclosure. Alternatively, if the channel <b>109</b><i>c </i>connects the vertical channel with the spin chamber <b>111</b> at an intermediate angle, then when the liquid is introduced to the spin chamber <b>111</b>, a more coarse mist is produced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> schematically illustrates a coarse mist being dispensed from the illustrative embodiment according to aspects of the disclosure. Hence, it is understood that the greater the angle at which the horizontal channel <b>109</b><i>c </i>connects the vertical channel with the spin chamber <b>111</b>, the finer the spray will be. Hence, it is also understood, that the channels <b>109</b><i>c </i>may be configured such that they are directed at various angles to get a course spray, fine spray, mist or other type of spray pattern. According to aspects of this disclosure, a tube <b>101</b> and spray nozzle <b>103</b> conjointly may have an almost infinitely adjustable spray pattern. Further, while according to aspects of the disclosure, one set of horizontal channels <b>109</b><i>c </i>may be included in the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> (such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), alternatively, according to other aspects of the disclosure, several sets of horizontal channels <b>109</b><i>c </i>(e.g., two or three sets) may be included in a single dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> so that the type of spray may be varied as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to some embodiments of this disclosure, the compressible section <b>105</b> of the tube <b>101</b> may have a larger diameter or cross-section than the diameter or cross section of the tip <b>107</b>. Further, the diameter or cross section of the tip section <b>107</b> may be smaller than the diameter or cross section of the nozzle <b>103</b>. Additionally, the wall of the compressible section <b>105</b> may be tapered from a first end, which is farthest from the nozzle <b>103</b>, towards a second end, which is adjacent the nozzle <b>103</b> so that the compressible section <b>105</b> narrows as it approaches the nozzle <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to some aspects of this disclosure, the tube <b>101</b> may be made of a plastic material such as polypropylene, high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or some other type of plastic. For example, the compressible section <b>105</b> and the tip section <b>107</b> may each be made from polypropylene. Further, the nozzle <b>103</b> may be made from polypropylene. Additionally, other structures in the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b>, such as the atomizer may be made from a plastic material such as polypropylene, high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or some other type of plastic. According to some embodiments of this disclosure, the entire tube <b>101</b> may be made from a single material and the wall thicknesses of the different sections (e.g., the compressible section <b>105</b>, the tip section <b>107</b>) are varied in order to provide appropriate rigidity. For example, according to one embodiment the tube is made of polypropylene and the wall thickness of tip section <b>107</b> may be approximately twice the wall thickness of the compressible section <b>105</b>. In this way, the tip section <b>107</b> is more rigid than the compressible section <b>105</b>. A more rigid tip may be desirable as it will prevent buckling. However, this is merely one embodiment. Of course, according to different embodiments, different portions of the dispensing apparatus may be of different materials (e.g., rubber, foil, or other materials), have different thicknesses, different rigidities, etc. For example, the tip section <b>107</b> and the nozzle <b>103</b> may be made from different materials that are more rigid than the compressible section <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to aspects of this disclosure, the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> may be created by forming the tube <b>101</b> out of polypropylene, high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, or some other type of plastic. This may be done via conventional processes such as molding, etc. Further, the liquid may then be placed into the compressible section <b>105</b> of the tube <b>101</b>. Additionally, once the fluid is within the tube <b>101</b>, the tube <b>101</b> may be sealed. For example, the end of the compressible section <b>105</b> may be heat sealed via a crimping means. The above described process for forming the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> is merely an example of one such process by which the dispensing apparatus may be formed and, of course, different variations of the process or other processes may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Particular aspects of the disclosure may relate to a dispenser configured for dispensing a liquid (e.g., a medicine or other chemical) in a nasal passageway. For example, according to some embodiments of this disclosure, the nozzle <b>103</b> may be sized to fit comfortably in the nasal cavity. Such nasal application embodiments may provide the pharmaceutical industry with an innovative dispensing package that will expel liquid as a spray or mist from the tip of a squeezable tube or other container.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Particular substances that may be used in conjunction with such an embodiment of the disclosure may include: NASOBOL (Itra-nasal Testoserone), ANDRODERM, NOSEAFIX, Bepotastine, Civamide, Ereska, FluNsure, Intranasal Diazepam, Midazoam, Morphine Gluconate, Nasal LORAZEPAM, NASCOBAL, Pieconaril, Rylomine, and SinuNase.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to some aspects of this disclosure, the overall length of the dispensing apparatus <b>101</b> may be in the range of 2 inches or less. Further, according to aspects of the disclosure, the channels, such as horizontal channel <b>109</b><i>c </i>may be in the range of 0.01 to 0.02 inch. However, these dimensions are merely illustrative and other sizes and ranges may be used as well. In fact, the sizes and ranges may vary dramatically depending on the use. For example, a dispenser for the nasal passage is this is merely one embodiment of the disclosure and, therefore, should not be construed as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is noted that according to aspects of the disclosure, a dispensing apparatus has relatively few parts. For example, conventional dispensers, such as trigger sprayers may contain 13 or more parts. Hence, in contrast to such dispensers, a dispensing apparatus according to aspects of the disclosure, may be advantageous in that it may have less parts, require less assembly time, be cheaper to manufacture, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the disclosure. Individual elements or features of a particular embodiment are generally not limited to that particular embodiment, but, where applicable, are interchangeable and can be used in a selected embodiment, even if not specifically shown or described. The same may also be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the disclosure, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
