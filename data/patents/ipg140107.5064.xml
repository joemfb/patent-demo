<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate enabling multiple address access between two or more networks. A home agent can update a binding cache with a particular proxy binding update (PBU) to include two or more network gateway IP addresses associated with a user equipment (UE) within two or more networks or systems. When the UE in idle mode moves between networks or systems to which registration has occurred, an attachment procedure is not performed since the home agent includes the network gateway IP addresses related to such UE. Thus, inter-system idle mode mobility is enabled without having to perform a full attachment, re-registration, or de-registration based on the network location of the UE.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent application Ser. No. 60/965,033 entitled &#x201c;IDLE MODE MOBILITY MANAGEMENT IN A MULTI-ACCESS SYSTEM USING PMIP&#x201d; which was filed Nov. 16, 2007. The entirety of the aforementioned application is herein incorporated by reference.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">I. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description relates generally to wireless communications, and more particularly to idle mode management within multi-access systems and/or networks.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">II. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication; for instance, voice and/or data can be provided via such wireless communication systems. A typical wireless communication system, or network, can provide multiple users access to one or more shared resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, . . . ). For instance, a system can use a variety of multiple access techniques such as Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Code Division Multiplexing (CDM), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and others.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems can simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Wireless communication systems oftentimes employ one or more base stations that provide a coverage area. A typical base station can transmit multiple data streams for broadcast, multicast and/or unicast services, wherein a data stream may be a stream of data that can be of independent reception interest to a mobile device. A mobile device within the coverage area of such base station can be employed to receive one, more than one, or all the data streams carried by the composite stream. Likewise, a mobile device can transmit data to the base station or another mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Area tracking within a wireless communication system enables a tracking area location for user equipment (e.g., mobile device, mobile communication apparatus, cellular device, smartphone, etc.) to be defined. Typically, a network can request or page the user equipment (UE) in which the UE can respond with such tracking area location. This enables the tracking area location of the UE to be communicated and updated to the network.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Across multiple networks or systems (e.g., 3GPP, non-3GPP, CDMA2000, etc.), each network or system performs idle mode mobility in a system-specific manner. In turn, paging areas and downlink packet termination nodes are different and system-specific. Since each network or system includes particular techniques, a UE moving from one system or network to another typically performs a full attach procedure regardless if the UE has attached to the system or network before. For example, a UE moving in a first network can perform a full attach procedure. The UE can then move to a second network and perform a full attach procedure. Yet, if the UE moves back to the first network, the UE will perform a full re-attach procedure. Such conventional techniques are inefficient in terms of conserving UE batter life and/or signal overhead.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Various embodiments are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more embodiments. It may be evident, however, that such embodiment(s) may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used in this application, the terms &#x201c;agent,&#x201d; &#x201c;manager,&#x201d; &#x201c;broadcaster,&#x201d; &#x201c;gateway,&#x201d; &#x201c;pager,&#x201d; &#x201c;tracker,&#x201d; &#x201c;module,&#x201d; &#x201c;system,&#x201d; and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component can be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components can communicate by way of local and/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The techniques described herein can be used for various wireless communication systems such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), single carrier-frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) and other systems. The terms &#x201c;system&#x201d; and &#x201c;network&#x201d; are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system can implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), CDMA2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. CDMA2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system can implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system can implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is an upcoming release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) utilizes single carrier modulation and frequency domain equalization. SC-FDMA has similar performance and essentially the same overall complexity as those of an OFDMA system. A SC-FDMA signal has lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) because of its inherent single carrier structure. SC-FDMA can be used, for instance, in uplink communications where lower PAPR greatly benefits access terminals in terms of transmit power efficiency. Accordingly, SC-FDMA can be implemented as an uplink multiple access scheme in 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) or Evolved UTRA.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, various embodiments are described herein in connection with a mobile device. A mobile device can also be called a system, subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile, remote station, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, terminal, wireless communication device, user agent, user device, or user equipment (UE). A mobile device can be a cellular telephone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, computing device, or other processing device connected to a wireless modem. Moreover, various embodiments are described herein in connection with a base station. A base station can be utilized for communicating with mobile device(s) and can also be referred to as an access point, Node B, or some other terminology.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Moreover, various aspects or features described herein can be implemented as a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques. The term &#x201c;article of manufacture&#x201d; as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media. For example, computer-readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strips, etc.), optical disks (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD), etc.), smart cards, and flash memory devices (e.g., EPROM, card, stick, key drive, etc.). Additionally, various storage media described herein can represent one or more devices and/or other machine-readable media for storing information. The term &#x201c;machine-readable medium&#x201d; can include, without being limited to, wireless channels and various other media capable of storing, containing, and/or carrying instruction(s) and/or data.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wireless communication system <b>100</b> is illustrated in accordance with various embodiments presented herein. System <b>100</b> comprises a base station <b>102</b> that can include multiple antenna groups. For example, one antenna group can include antennas <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, another group can comprise antennas <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, and an additional group can include antennas <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. Two antennas are illustrated for each antenna group; however, more or fewer antennas can be utilized for each group. Base station <b>102</b> can additionally include a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, etc.), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Base station <b>102</b> can communicate with one or more mobile devices such as mobile device <b>116</b> and mobile device <b>122</b>; however, it is to be appreciated that base station <b>102</b> can communicate with substantially any number of mobile devices similar to mobile devices <b>116</b> and <b>122</b>. Mobile devices <b>116</b> and <b>122</b> can be, for example, cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld communication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, and/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system <b>100</b>. As depicted, mobile device <b>116</b> is in communication with antennas <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, where antennas <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> transmit information to mobile device <b>116</b> over a forward link <b>118</b> and receive information from mobile device <b>116</b> over a reverse link <b>120</b>. Moreover, mobile device <b>122</b> is in communication with antennas <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, where antennas <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> transmit information to mobile device <b>122</b> over a forward link <b>124</b> and receive information from mobile device <b>122</b> over a reverse link <b>126</b>. In a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, forward link <b>118</b> can utilize a different frequency band than that used by reverse link <b>120</b>, and forward link <b>124</b> can employ a different frequency band than that employed by reverse link <b>126</b>, for example. Further, in a time division duplex (TDD) system, forward link <b>118</b> and reverse link <b>120</b> can utilize a common frequency band and forward link <b>124</b> and reverse link <b>126</b> can utilize a common frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each group of antennas and/or the area in which they are designated to communicate can be referred to as a sector of base station <b>102</b>. For example, antenna groups can be designed to communicate to mobile devices in a sector of the areas covered by base station <b>102</b>. In communication over forward links <b>118</b> and <b>124</b>, the transmitting antennas of base station <b>102</b> can utilize beamforming to improve signal-to-noise ratio of forward links <b>118</b> and <b>124</b> for mobile devices <b>116</b> and <b>122</b>. Also, while base station <b>102</b> utilizes beamforming to transmit to mobile devices <b>116</b> and <b>122</b> scattered randomly through an associated coverage, mobile devices in neighboring cells can be subject to less interference as compared to a base station transmitting through a single antenna to all its mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Base station <b>102</b> (and/or each sector of base station <b>102</b>) can employ one or more multiple access technologies (e.g., CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, . . . ). For instance, base station <b>102</b> can utilize a particular technology for communicating with mobile devices (e.g., mobile devices <b>116</b> and <b>122</b>) upon a corresponding bandwidth. Moreover, if more than one technology is employed by base station <b>102</b>, each technology can be associated with a respective bandwidth. The technologies described herein can include following: Global System for Mobile (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA), cdmaOne (IS-95), CDMA2000, Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), MediaFLO, Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB), Digital Video Broadcasting&#x2014;Handheld (DVB-H), etc. It is to be appreciated that the aforementioned listing of technologies is provided as an example and the claimed subject matter is not so limited; rather, substantially any wireless communication technology is intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Base station <b>102</b> can employ a first bandwidth with a first technology. Moreover, base station <b>102</b> can transmit a pilot corresponding to the first technology on a second bandwidth. According to an illustration, the second bandwidth can be leveraged by base station <b>102</b> and/or any disparate base station (not shown) for communication that utilizes any second technology. Moreover, the pilot can indicate the presence of the first technology (e.g., to a mobile device communicating via the second technology). For example, the pilot can use bit(s) to carry information about the presence of the first technology. Additionally, information such as a SectorID of the sector utilizing the first technology, a CarrierIndex indicating the first frequency bandwidth, and the like can be included in the pilot.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to another example, the pilot can be a beacon (and/or a sequence of beacons). A beacon can be an OFDM symbol where a large fraction of the power is transmitted on one subcarrier or a few subcarriers (e.g., small number of subcarriers). Thus, the beacon provides a strong peak that can be observed by mobile devices, while interfering with data on a narrow portion of bandwidth (e.g., the remainder of the bandwidth can be unaffected by the beacon). Following this example, a first sector can communicate via CDMA on a first bandwidth and a second sector can communicate via OFDM on a second bandwidth. Accordingly, the first sector can signify the availability of CDMA on the first bandwidth (e.g., to mobile device(s) operating utilizing OFDM on the second bandwidth) by transmitting an OFDM beacon (or a sequence of OFDM beacons) upon the second bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The subject innovation can enable a user equipment (UE) to be idle (e.g., an idle mode, wherein an idle mode is a mode in which no signaling is generated) within a plurality of networks or access systems. For instance, a UE typically registers and/or performs a full-attach procedure with each network the UE is located within regardless of whether the UE has registered or attached to such network before. For instance, a UE traveling/moving from a first network to a second network and back to the first network would typically need to perform registration and full-attachment procedures for the first network, the second network, and the move back to the first network. The subject innovation can allow the UE to avoid full re-attach procedures. Thus, when the UE gets back to a system or network, the UE does not need to perform a re-attach procedure as the tracking system already has a state for such UE unless tracking area (TA) registration expired or the UE detects movement to a new TA.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In general, the UE is registered to a home agent with one home agent address using proxy mobile IP. This can avoid sending a proxy binding update (PBU) at any idle mode movement across systems or networks. When the home agent receives downlink data, the home agent can simultaneously broadcast the packets to the mobile access gateways (MAGs) (e.g., the systems or networks to which the UE has registered). Upon such broadcast, the gateway/MAG pages the UE. When the UE becomes active in a system, the respective MAG can de-register the MAG address of the systems or networks the UE is not located in order to terminate broadcasting. The de-registration can be done with a wild-card option<b>1</b> as the gateway in the system to which the UE is located may not know the address of the gateway in the systems or networks the UE is not located. When the UE becomes idle again, the MAG can re-establish the state for the home agent within the adding or reinstatement of the previously de-registered MAG addresses (e.g., using a wild-card option<b>2</b>). In other words, the home agent does not remove the entry related to the systems or networks the UE is not located when receiving the wild-card option but just blocks the entry and makes it valid again when receiving the wild-card option<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrated is a home agent <b>200</b> for employment within a wireless communications environment. The system <b>200</b> can include a home agent <b>200</b> that can receive proxy mobile Internet protocol (PMIP) requests in order to attach and register a UE to a network or system. The home agent <b>200</b> can be a base station or a portion thereof, a mobile device or a portion thereof, or substantially any communications apparatus that receives data transmitted in a wireless communications environment. The home agent <b>200</b> can include an address manager <b>202</b> that tracks network gateway IP addresses for the networks or systems to which the UE is located or travels. For example, the home agent <b>200</b> can receive a PMIP request to attach a UE to a first network, wherein based upon such PMIP request, the address manager <b>202</b> can store a first network gateway IP address within a binding cache (not shown). It is to be appreciated that the address manager <b>202</b> can update the binding cache with any suitable number of network IP addresses based at least in part upon the location of a UE. In other words, when the UE moves or travels into a system or network, the address manager <b>202</b> can update, delete, block, or add a respective network gateway IP address into the binding cache. By registering the network gateway IP address within the binding cache within the home agent <b>200</b>, the ULE can perform in an idle mode across such registered networks or systems without a full re-attach procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, the home agent <b>200</b> can receive a first PMIP request from a UE which can initiate an attachment procedure for the UE to a first network. It is to be appreciated that the home agent <b>200</b> can receive any suitable number of PMIP requests in order to attach a UE to any suitable number of networks or systems. The address manager <b>202</b> can update the binding cache with a first network gateway IP address related to such PMIP request. The address manager <b>202</b> can update the binding cache with any suitable number of network gateway IP addresses. By updating the binding cache within the home agent <b>200</b> via the address manager <b>202</b> with each of the networks and/or systems, idle mode mobility across numerous systems or networks can be provided. In other words, the UE need not de-register or re-register with networks or systems while in idle mode. The subject innovation enables seamless transitions across various networks (e.g., 3GPP, non-3GPP, CDMA2000, universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS), etc.) while a UE is in idle mode.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Upon receipt of a portion of downlink data, the home agent <b>200</b> can locate the ULE in idle mode regardless of which network or system such UE resides based at least in part upon the home agent <b>200</b> and/or address manager <b>202</b> storing network gateway IP addresses. The home agent <b>200</b> can further include a downlink data broadcaster <b>204</b> that can simultaneously broadcast data to the registered networks based upon attachment and registration with the home agent <b>200</b>. Within the respective networks or systems, a paging and/or tracking technique can be employed (e.g., discussed in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In response to such paging and/or tracking technique, a PBU can be received by the home agent <b>200</b>. It is to be appreciated that the downlink data broadcaster <b>204</b> can transmit a portion of data simultaneously to any suitable number of networks or systems that are registered and/or listed with the home agent <b>200</b>. Additionally, upon the receipt of a portion of uplink data within a network, the home agent <b>200</b> can receive an active mode indication from the UE which can initiate the communication of a PBU.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an example, the binding cache within the home agent <b>200</b> can be updated with a proxy binding update (PBU), wherein the PBU can include a PBU source address. In general, the PBU can include a specific flag/option that employs the removal of any address (e.g., wild-card delete PBU) in the binding cache except the source address of the PBU. Upon receipt of such PBU, the address manager <b>202</b> can store, add, block, delete, and/or update the binding cache accordingly. In other words, the source address can be reflective of the system or network to which the UE is located and identifies the network gateway IP address to which the home agent <b>200</b> can utilize to communicate data. Upon the UE returning to an idle mode, a specific flag/option can employ the addition of any address (e.g., wild-card add PBU) in the binding cache that was removed during the wild-card delete (see above). For instance, the wild-card delete PBU can block the network gateway IP addresses within the binding cache and then activate (e.g., unblock) the addresses upon receiving a wild-card add PBU.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, although not shown, it is to be appreciated that home agent <b>200</b> can include memory that retains instructions with respect to receiving a first proxy mobile Internet Protocol (PMIP) request from a user equipment (UE) within a first network to attach to the first network, registering the UE with a first network gateway IP address within a home agent based upon the first PMIP request, receiving a second PMIP request from the UE within a second network to attach to the second network, registering the UE with a second network gateway IP address within the home agent based upon the second PMIP request, and utilizing at least one of the first network gateway IP address or the second network gateway IP address to allow the UE to execute an idle mode between the first network and the second network without performing at least one of a re-registration of the UE during such idle mode or a de-registration of the UE during such idle mode.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, illustrated is a wireless communications system <b>300</b> that facilitates employing idle mode mobility for user equipment within two or more networks. The system <b>300</b> includes at least one network (e.g., a first network <b>302</b> and a second network <b>304</b>, herein collectively referred to as &#x2018;network 302 and/or 304&#x2019;) that communicates with a user equipment (UE) <b>306</b> (and/or any number of disparate UEs (not shown)). The network <b>302</b> and/or <b>304</b> can transmit information to UE <b>306</b> over a forward link channel; further network <b>302</b> and/or <b>304</b> can receive information from UE <b>306</b> over a reverse link channel. Moreover, system <b>300</b> can be a MIMO system. Additionally, the system <b>300</b> can operate in an OFDMA wireless network, a 3GPP LTE wireless network, etc. Also, the components and functionalities shown and described below in the network <b>302</b> and/or <b>304</b> can be present in the UE <b>306</b> as well and vice versa, in one example; the configuration depicted excludes these components for ease of explanation. Moreover, it is to be appreciated that for the sake of brevity, the system <b>300</b> is described with a first network <b>302</b> and a second network <b>304</b>, although it is to be appreciated that there can be any suitable number of networks.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The system <b>300</b> can further include the home agent <b>200</b>, the address manger <b>202</b>, and the downlink data broadcaster <b>204</b> which can be substantially similar to agents, managers, and broadcasters previously described. The system <b>300</b> can further include the first network <b>302</b> and the second network <b>304</b>, wherein the UE <b>306</b> can communicate data there between. In particular, the home agent <b>200</b> can register and attach the ULE <b>306</b> to the first network and/or the second network <b>304</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In general, the home agent <b>200</b> can track network gateway IP addresses associated with the UE <b>306</b> in order to provide seamless idle mode mobility between two or more networks (e.g., the first network <b>302</b>, the second network <b>304</b>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The UE <b>306</b> can attach to the first network <b>302</b> or the second network <b>304</b> with an attachment procedure in order to receive an IP address based at least in part upon the location of the UE <b>306</b> within particular tracking areas (TAs) or networks. As previously discussed, by registering the network gateway IP addresses within the home agent <b>200</b>, the UE <b>306</b> can idle between the first network <b>302</b> and the second network <b>304</b> unless the tracking area registration has expired or the UE <b>306</b> detects that it has moved to an area where it receives a new &#x201c;non-registered&#x201d; tracking area. The first network <b>302</b> can include a gateway <b>308</b> and a pager and tracker <b>310</b>. Similarly, the second network <b>304</b> can include a gateway <b>312</b> and a pager and tracker <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Regardless of which network the UE <b>306</b> resides, the system <b>300</b> can communicate a portion of data thereto. It is to be appreciated that the portion of data can be, but is not limited to being, a downlink data packet targeted for the UE <b>306</b> or an uplink data packet from the UE <b>306</b>. Upon receipt of a downlink data packet targeted for the UE <b>306</b>, the gateways registered with the home agent <b>200</b> (here, gateway <b>308</b> and gateway <b>312</b>) can trigger a paging and/or tracking technique to the UE <b>306</b> (implemented here by the pager and tracker <b>310</b> within the first network <b>302</b> and the pager and tracker <b>314</b> in the second network <b>304</b>). The UE <b>306</b> can communicate a page response from within the network it resides to the appropriate pager and tracker. Based on the page response from the UE <b>306</b> and/or the source of such page response, the location of which network the UE <b>306</b> resides can be determined. Thus, the gateway within such identified network can communicate a PBU to the home agent <b>200</b>. This further enables the downlink data packet to be communicated to the UE <b>306</b>. Upon receipt of uplink data packet from the UE <b>306</b>, the gateway to which the UE <b>306</b> resides can communicate a PBU to the home agent <b>200</b>, which can inform the location of such UE <b>306</b>. Accordingly, the portion of data can be communicated between the UE <b>306</b> and the home agent <b>200</b> via one of the first network <b>302</b> or the second network <b>304</b>. Furthermore, the UE <b>306</b> can return back to the idle mode upon the completion of the communication of data. For example, the UE <b>306</b> can transmit an idle mode indication to the network or gateway, which can trigger the network or gateway to communicate a PBU to the home agent.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moreover, although not shown, it is to be appreciated that the networks <b>302</b> and/or <b>304</b> can include memory that retains instructions with respect to attaching a user equipment (UE) to a first network with a proxy mobile Internet Protocol (PMIP) registration to a home agent related to the UE, attaching the UE to a second network with a PMIP registration to the home agent without de-registration of the first network, enabling the UE to idle within the first network or the second network without performing an additional attachment, receiving a portion of data, the portion of data is at least one of a downlink data packet targeted for the UE or an uplink data packet from the UE, and transmitting the portion of data to the UE within one of the first network or the second network, the network to which the UE resides is identified by at least one of an active mode indication received from the UE or a page response received from the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an example wireless communications system <b>400</b> that facilitates idling user equipment within a plurality of access systems and/or networks. The system <b>400</b> can include a home agent <b>402</b> that can store network gateway IP addresses for a UE <b>406</b> which enables idle mode mobility between two or more networks <b>404</b>. It is to be appreciated that the UE <b>406</b> can reside on any suitable number of networks, such as network <b>1</b> to network N, where N is a positive integer. Furthermore, it is to be appreciated and understood that each network can include a specific idle mode mobility technique. A first network can include a pager and tracker <b>408</b>, a gateway <b>410</b>, and tracking areas <b>412</b>. A second network can include a pager <b>414</b>, a gateway <b>416</b>, and tracking areas <b>418</b>. The two or more networks <b>404</b> can include the first network and/or the second network.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">During an initial attach in regards to a PMIP situation, the UE <b>406</b> can perform an attach procedure on the first network. The UE <b>406</b> can receive an IP address (IP UE). The gateway <b>410</b> can perform PMIP bootstrapping (e.g., home agent <b>402</b> selection) registration. The home agent <b>402</b> can have an IP_UE&#x2192;GW_first network binding. The UE can be in idle mode, wherein the pager and tracker <b>408</b> knows the tracking area where the UE <b>406</b> is located (e.g., tracking area <b>1</b> within the first network). Mobility can be handled by the tracking system based on the first network specification. When the UE <b>406</b> moves to a disparate tracking area, the UE <b>406</b> can send a tracking area update updating the location in the tracking system). When a downlink packet arrives at the home agent <b>402</b>, the home agent <b>402</b> can send the downlink packet to the GW_first network. The gateway <b>410</b> can trigger the paging procedure to be performed by the pager and tracker <b>408</b>. The UE <b>406</b> can reply with a page response, wherein the data can be transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">During a movement to the second network, the UE <b>406</b> can attach to the second network for the first time with a full attach procedure. Based on a modified attach procedure for the second network, the UE <b>406</b> can be assigned the same IP_UE. The gateway <b>416</b> can register its address at the home agent <b>402</b>. This registration is a multiple care of address (CoA) (e.g., the registration does not replace GW_first network). The home agent <b>402</b> has an IP_UE&#x2192;(GW_first network, GW_second network). It is to be appreciated that the second network can take into account that the same IP address used in the first network can be allocated to the UE <b>406</b>. Moreover, some modification can be done in the attach procedure of the first network and/or the second network in order to activate PMIP for inter-system mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Movement in idle mode can be handled by the respective system or network without additional signaling. Additional signaling happens for a tracking area change but this is not specific of an inter system scenario. If the UE <b>406</b> goes back to the first network, signaling need not occur unless: the tracking area is expired or the UE <b>406</b> detects that it has moved to an area where a new &#x201c;non-registered&#x201d; tracking area of the first network is received. By employing the above, free signaling inter system idle mode mobility is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">During downlink data and paging, the home agent <b>402</b> does not know where the UE <b>406</b> is located. Thus, the home agent <b>402</b> bi-casts data packets to both the first network and the second network (e.g., gateway <b>410</b> and gateway <b>416</b>). Each network can perform paging (e.g., the pager and tracker <b>408</b> in the first network and the pager and tracker <b>414</b> in the second network). The UE <b>406</b> can send a page response in the second network (e.g., the network to which the UE <b>406</b> resides). The gateway <b>416</b> (e.g., GW_second network) can send a PBU to the home agent <b>402</b> deleting (e.g., blocking) the GW_first network to stop bi-casting.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">During uplink data, the UE <b>406</b> can select in which network it turns to active mode (e.g., here the UE is still in the second network). The gateway <b>416</b> can remove or block the GW_first network address at the home agent <b>402</b> by sending a PBU to the home agent <b>402</b>. The UE <b>406</b> can start to communicate via the second network. It is to be appreciated that the first network does not need to now that the UE <b>406</b> is active in the second network and should maintain the UE <b>406</b> in idle mode.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the UE <b>406</b> falls back into an idle mode, the gateway <b>416</b> (e.g., the gateway associated with the network in which the UE <b>406</b> resides) can re-establish the state at the home agent <b>402</b> (e.g., the gateway <b>416</b> can add the GW_first network address). The gateway <b>416</b> can send a PBU with the GW_first network address as CoA. This PBU can be a multiple registration (e.g., the PBU does not delete the GW_second network address).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>, methodologies relating to providing uplink timing control while reducing overhead and power consumption are illustrated.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, illustrated is a methodology <b>500</b> that facilitates attaching and registering user equipment to two or more networks, wherein each network utilizes a particular and separate idle mode mobility technique. At reference numeral <b>502</b>, a user equipment (UE) can be attached to a first network with a proxy mobile Internet Protocol (PMIP) registration to a home agent related to the UE. At reference numeral <b>504</b>, the UE can be attached to a second network with a PMIP registration to the home agent while maintaining registration of the first network. At reference numeral <b>506</b>, a portion of data can be received, wherein the portion of data is at least one of a downlink data packet targeted for the UE or an uplink data packet from the UE. At reference numeral <b>508</b>, the UE can move between the first network and the second network while in an idle mode, wherein an idle mode is a mode in which no signaling is generated. At reference numeral <b>510</b>, the portion of data can be transmitted to the UE within one of the first network or the second network, wherein the network to which the UE resides is identified by at least one of an active mode indication received from the UE or a page response received from the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a methodology <b>600</b> that facilitates registering user equipment with multiple addresses within a home agent to enable seamless and efficient idle mode mobility between multiple networks. At reference numeral <b>602</b>, a first proxy mobile Internet Protocol (PMIP) request can be received from a user equipment (UE) within a first network to attach to the first network. At reference numeral <b>604</b>, the UE can be registered with a first network gateway IP address within a home agent based upon the first PMIP request. At reference numeral <b>606</b>, a second PMIP request can be received from the UE within a second network to attach to the second network. At reference numeral <b>608</b>, the UE can be registered with a second network gateway IP address within the home agent based upon the second PMIP request. At reference numeral <b>610</b>, at least one of the first network gateway IP address or the second network gateway IP address can be utilized to allow the ULE to execute an idle mode between the first network and the second network without performing at least one of a re-registration of the UE during such idle mode or a de-registration of the UE during such idle mode.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The coded data for each data stream can be multiplexed with pilot data using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques.
