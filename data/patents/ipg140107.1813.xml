<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to the transplantation of tissue in bodies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Microlipoinjection is a process in which fat is taken by a cannula from one spot in the body and reinjected in another place in the body. Microlipoinjection has also been known as liposuction with fat transfer or fat transplantation. In general, microlipoinjection is performed to treat divots and scar indentations from trauma to the face or body, such as may occur as a secondary effect of domestic trauma, surgery or infection. Microlipoinjection can also be used to treat the effects of the loss of the subcutaneous layer of fat due to the normal aging process, either alone or in combination with facelift and fat grafting techniques. Microlipoinjection can also be used for providing filler to reapproximate weakened vocal cords, fill sinuses, or partially close incompetent valves.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Up to about 1990, there were few artificial filler substances available to surgeons. Accordingly, surgeons used human bone, collagen and fat as fillers. However, the use of fat was not very successful, because the instruments and techniques were not sufficiently refined. For example, 50% of the fat may not have lived through the transplantation process. As a result, surgeons would need to implant more fat than would be required if all of the fat survived the process, or the transplantation process would have to be repeated multiple times.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More recently, a number of filler substances, such as Restylane Hyaluronic Acid, Collagen, Fibril, ePTFE (Teflon&#xae;), Hylan B Gel, Artecol, BioBlastique and have been used. These substances have proved effective at filling small areas, but the cost for larger areas has become prohibitive. For this reason, as well as interest in the &#x201c;natural substance&#x201d; concept, surgeons and their patients have again looked at using fat as a filler.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the renewed interest in using fat as a filler, techniques have been refined to provide a better fat graft &#x201c;take&#x201d; with revascularization. However, the instruments and devices conventionally available to perform the procedure remain clumsy and ill-suited for the procedure. As a result, the procedure has remained difficult to perform, cumbersome, time consuming, expensive and relatively unsuccessful. For example, the conventional process employed in connection with microlipoinjection comprises about 10 steps, some of which can cause damage to a significant percentage of the fat cells. In addition, it is necessary to maintain strict sterility throughout all of the steps. However, sterility is difficult to maintain in connection with centrifuging, which is performed separately from the sterile operating field, and involves ancillary personnel. The basic steps of the conventional microlipoinjection process can be summarized as follows:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">Step 1&#x2014;Liposuction of fat from the donor area, the fat going into a large syringe or canister. The suction aspirate contains the wanted fat, plus the unwanted blood, serum, anesthetic agent, etc. These later substances must be removed for the best lipocyte survival rates.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">Step 2&#x2014;Fat is transferred into several smaller syringes that will fit into a centrifuge. Every time the fat is transferred to another syringe, there is more destruction of fat cells secondary to pressure of the plunger forcing the fat through the narrow outlet of the syringe into the input luer of the next syringe. Caps are placed on the end of the syringe to prevent loss during centrifuging.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">Step 3&#x2014;Centrifuge for several minutes or until the contents are in three layers: the top layer is triglyceride oils, the middle layer is fat, and the lower layer is the remaining blood cell debris.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">Step 4&#x2014;Decant off the top liquid oil and serum from the centrifuge specimen.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0011">Step 5&#x2014;Place the plunger in the syringe, tip syringe upward and squirt out the red cells and debris, leaving the residual fat in the syringe. Sometimes this has to be repeated, including repeat centrifuging, a number of times for proper separation.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0012">Step 6&#x2014;Treat contents with irrigation solutions, platelet rich plasma (PRP), albumin, growth hormone, or other substances, by aspirating this substance into the syringe. These substances are considered helpful in ensuring the viability of the lipocyte (fat cell). Some of these substances aid in angiogenesis (establishment of blood vessels) or treat in a manner that encourages lipocyte survival.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0013">Step 7&#x2014;Gently mix by circular motion.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0014">Step 8&#x2014;Centrifuge again.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0015">Step 9&#x2014;Decant off liquid additive.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0016">Step 10&#x2014;Put the plunger back into the syringe, place an injection needle on the tip and inject the fat into the divot or wrinkle. This injection is conventionally done manually with a control syringe or special manual mechanical gun.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0017">The washing and/or treatment of tissue, for example to remove broken fat cell walls and contents, to remove chemicals introduced during the tissue removal process, and to treat the removed tissue, is often desirable. However, the washing and/or treatment of tissue comprising fat using irrigation solutions is particularly problematic, because conventional techniques for treating or washing the tissue often result in traumatic events for the tissue cells and increase the chance of microbe contamination. In particular, conventional washing techniques have been time-consuming and expose the tissue to the hands of the surgical staff, exposes the tissue to the ambient air, and passes the tissue through different devices. This is because of the techniques involved: first removing the tissue from the body; placing the removed tissue into a wash container; manually mixing sterile solution with the tissue; stirring the mixture; filtering it; centrifuging it; and then transferring it to the appropriate syringe for reinjection. Accordingly, it would be desirable to reduce the time required to rid the specimen of unwanted, broken fat cell walls, broken fat cell contents, as well as chemicals that have been introduced for anesthesia and vasoconstriction and/or to otherwise treat the removed tissue. In addition, it would be desirable to reduce the trauma to cells of removed tissue, and to reduce the chance of contamination of such tissue.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0018">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to solving these and other problems and disadvantages of the prior art. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a tissue collection vessel is provided for receiving tissue removed from a donor site. More particularly, the tissue collection vessel may receive tissue removed from a donor site within a human or animal body using a cannula connected to a vacuum source. The collection vessel may be intermediate to the cannula and the vacuum source. In addition, the collection vessel may be placed within a canister, and a vacuum may be created within the canister.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0019">In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the collection vessel may comprise an impermeable vessel disposed within a tissue collection canister. Moreover, the tissue collection vessel can comprise a flexible or semi-rigid bag. The tissue collection vessel may include an inlet in communication with a cannula, for receiving tissue removed from a body. The tissue collection vessel may also include a vacuum outlet. The tissue collection vessel may be placed within a canister in which a vacuum is formed in order to hold the tissue collection vessel open to facilitate the receipt of removed tissue into the interior of the tissue collection vessel. In accordance with still other embodiments of the present invention, a filter may be provided within the tissue collection vessel to promote the separation of desired tissue from additives and other fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0020">In accordance with embodiments of the present invention in which the collection vessel comprises a removable collection bag, desired tissue, such as fat, can be separated from additives or other fluids by turning the bag upside down, such that at least one port of the bag is below the contents of the bag, and opening the port to allow fluids to escape. The remaining tissue can then be removed from the bag, and placed in one or more syringe bodies for reinjection, or in another vessel for storage. The use of a collection bag also allows collected tissue to be washed and/or instilled with an additive by placing additional fluid into the collection bag with desired tissue, and then massaging the exterior of the collection bag to mix the additive and collected tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0021">In accordance with still other embodiments of the present invention, a device for collecting tissue comprising a collection bag can be used in combination with a device for collecting tissue comprising one or more syringe bodies. In particular, removed tissue can initially be collected, and if desired treated, in a collection bag. The collected tissue can then be transferred to syringe bodies. Accordingly, tissue can be prepared for reinjection and placed into a syringe body that will be used for reinjection, without requiring manual handling of the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0022">In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the tissue collection vessel comprises a porous inner bag that functions as a filter. The tissue collection vessel or filter in such embodiments may be disposed within a tissue collection canister. In addition, a vacuum outlet may be interconnected to a waste tube that extends to the bottom or end of the tissue collection canister that is generally opposite the inlet to the tissue collection vessel. The tissue collection vessel can feature a tapered end proximate to the inlet to the tissue collection vessel. By providing a tapered end, the removal of tissue from the bag, for example for placement into a syringe for reinjection, can be facilitated. A tapered end may be provided in both permeable and impermeable embodiments of the tissue collection vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0023">In accordance with further embodiments, a tissue collection system with an air inlet is provided. In particular, the air inlet is in addition to a tissue collection inlet of a tissue collection cannula. The air inlet can be provided in tubing interconnecting the tissue collection cannula to the tissue collection vessel, in the tissue collection canister, or in the lid of the tissue collection canister. In accordance with still other embodiments, multiple air inlets may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0024">Additional features and advantages of embodiments of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following discussion, particularly when taken together with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0053">The outer chamber <b>104</b> may additionally feature an open proximal end <b>144</b>. During the aspiration of tissue, the proximal end <b>144</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b> may receive a tapered plug <b>148</b>. The plug <b>148</b> seals the open end <b>144</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b>, and may provide a tube <b>152</b> comprising a nipple, tapered stub or other fitting to which the suction tubing <b>128</b> can be interconnected, thereby permitting the interior volume <b>108</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b> to be interconnected to a vacuum source <b>126</b>. The tube <b>152</b> may optionally comprise or be associated with an end plug filter <b>154</b> to prevent some or all of the material drawn off of collected fat tissue from passing to the suction tube <b>128</b> and the vacuum source <b>126</b>. Alternatively or in addition, filters may also be provided between the end plug <b>148</b> and the vacuum source <b>126</b>. If provided, a filter <b>154</b> or other filter may comprise various filter arrangements and media, including perforated tubes, absorbent foams and gauzes, cartridges containing particulate filtration media, and/or other filtration media and structures. In accordance with further embodiments of the present invention, the tapered plug <b>148</b> may be removable, to permit access to the interior volume <b>108</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b>. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the tapered plug <b>148</b> may comprise a silicone or rubber material, with a tube <b>152</b> formed from metal or a polymer. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the plug <b>148</b> need not be tapered. For example, the plug <b>148</b> can comprise a cap or an insert having threads that can interconnect with mating threads on the outer chamber body <b>132</b>, the plug <b>148</b> can have a constant diameter for fitting in or over a mating surface formed as part of the outer chamber body <b>132</b>, or can be formed in some other way to seal the proximal end <b>144</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0054">The inner chamber <b>112</b> includes a substantially cylindrical body portion <b>156</b> having a substantially cylindrical interior bore <b>160</b>. More particularly, the inner chamber body portion <b>156</b> is substantially cylindrical in that it does not feature projections, so that an inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref>) can be accommodated, as will be described in greater detail elsewhere herein. Furthermore, the body portion <b>156</b> may be substantially rigid. As used herein in connection with at least the inner chamber body portion <b>156</b>, substantially rigid means the cylindrical body portion <b>156</b> maintains its shape while tissue is collected within the interior bore <b>160</b> and while collected tissue is being forced from the interior bore <b>160</b>. Furthermore, because the body portion <b>156</b> is substantially rigid, it can function as the body of a syringe, as described in greater detail elsewhere herein. In addition, a plurality of perforations <b>164</b> are formed in the cylindrical body <b>156</b>. At the distal end <b>116</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b>, an inlet <b>168</b> is provided. The inlet <b>168</b> may provide surfaces for being received by the inlet <b>136</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b> and/or the gasket <b>140</b>, so that a seal is maintained at the interface between the outer chamber inlet <b>136</b> and the distal end of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. In addition, the fitting between the outer chamber inlet <b>136</b> and the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> can secure the inner chamber <b>112</b> with respect to the outer chamber <b>104</b> while tissue is being aspirated from a donor site. Accordingly, the interface between the inlet <b>136</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b> and the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> may comprise a friction fitting, or a mechanical lock, such as may be provided by cooperating threads or other mechanical arrangement. In addition, the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> may provide a fitting for receiving a cannula or needle <b>118</b>, and/or an intermediate conduit <b>124</b>. Accordingly, exemplary embodiments of an inner chamber <b>112</b> may comprise an inlet <b>168</b> that provides the male portion of a luer connector. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, no protrusions or flanges extend from the area of the body portion <b>156</b> and/or the area of the interior bore <b>160</b> in which the perforations <b>164</b> are formed. However, a flange or handle <b>170</b> may be provided, for example to assist in using the inner chamber <b>112</b> as the body of a syringe, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0055">The inner chamber body <b>156</b> may include an open proximal end <b>172</b>. During the aspiration of tissue, the proximal end <b>172</b> may be sealed by a plug <b>176</b>. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the plug <b>176</b> may have a center bore <b>180</b> that can house either an absorbent stick <b>184</b> or a perforated central suction tube <b>188</b>. Where an absorbent stick <b>184</b> is provided, the stick may be formed from a compressed stick of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foam to aid in the absorption of residual oils from collected fat. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the stick is disposed of after use. The absorbent stick <b>184</b> may extend into the interior volume of the inner chamber <b>112</b>, for example to almost the inlet <b>168</b> at the distal end <b>116</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. In connection with embodiments where a perforated central suction tube <b>188</b> is provided, suction created by placing the interior volume <b>108</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b> in communication with a vacuum source can be used to draw material from collected fat from the center of the collected fat specimen. The perforations <b>190</b> in the central suction tube <b>188</b> may be sized and arranged like the perforations <b>164</b> in the inner chamber <b>112</b> body <b>156</b>. The central suction tube <b>188</b> may extend almost to the inlet <b>168</b> at the distal end <b>116</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. An absorbent stick <b>184</b> may also be combined with a suction tube. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the plug <b>176</b> may be formed from a polymer and may be tapered to seal the open end <b>172</b> of the inner syringe <b>112</b>. Alternatively, the plug <b>148</b> may be threaded to interconnect to mating threads provided as part of the inner chamber <b>112</b>, or to interconnect and seal the proximal end of inner chamber <b>112</b> through some other arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0056">Embodiments of the present invention may provide an intermediate conduit <b>124</b> for interconnecting the cannula <b>118</b> to the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. As used herein, the term cannula may include needles. Specifically, a needle is a particular type of cannula, in that it refers to a relatively small cannula. Furthermore, the conduit <b>124</b> may comprise an inlet branch <b>190</b> for selectively interconnecting a fluid reservoir <b>192</b> to the conduit <b>124</b> through a stopcock <b>194</b>. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention may allow a fluid, for example an additive or tissue treatment fluid, to be introduced or instilled in tissue as that tissue is collected and drawn through the conduit <b>124</b> to the inner chamber <b>112</b>. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the fluid reservoir <b>192</b> can comprise a syringe.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0057">As can be appreciated by one of skill in the art from the description provided herein, when operatively assembled and configured for the removal of tissue from a donor site, a device <b>100</b> allows tissue to be aspirated through a cannula <b>118</b> by interconnecting the device <b>100</b> to a vacuum source <b>126</b>. Tissue collected through the cannula <b>118</b> is passed through a conduit <b>124</b>, if provided, and into the interior bore <b>160</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the inner canal of the cannula <b>118</b>, a conduit <b>124</b>, and the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> are substantially uniform and as large as mechanical feasible. Such an arrangement helps to prevent the damage that can be caused by forcing aspirated fat through narrow conduits and changes in conduit size.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0058">The fat drawn into the interior bore <b>160</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> is collected in the inner chamber <b>112</b>, while blood, serum, anesthetic agents and/or other materials are drawn through the perforations <b>164</b>, and into the interior volume <b>108</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b> by the vacuum introduced through the tube <b>152</b>. The materials drawn off of the fat may additionally include additive introduced from a reservoir <b>192</b> to the flow of tissue through the conduit <b>124</b>, or drawn into the inner chamber <b>112</b> from a reservoir <b>192</b> after tissue has been collected in the inner chamber <b>112</b>. The materials drawn off of the collected fat may be collected by filters, for example in-line with the vacuum line <b>128</b> or provided as part of the vacuum source <b>126</b>, to prevent such material from reaching the pump mechanism of the vacuum source <b>126</b>. Accordingly, separation of collected fat from other, unwanted materials, can be effected without removing the collected fat from the inner chamber <b>112</b>. In addition, separation of the collected fat from other materials can be effected without requiring centrifuging.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0059">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a detail of the relationship between the inlet <b>136</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b> and the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> is shown. In particular, it can be seen that the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> may, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, comprise the male portion of a slip type luer connector <b>204</b>. According to other embodiments, the inlet <b>168</b> can comprise a lock type luer connector or other fitting. In addition, it can be seen that the inlet <b>168</b> may include a barrel portion, for example as part of the luer connector <b>204</b>, that is in close fitting contact with the opening of the outer chamber inlet <b>136</b>, when the inner chamber <b>112</b> is inserted into the interior volume <b>108</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b> such that the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> protrudes from the inlet <b>136</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows that the distal end <b>116</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> may include a tapered or dished surface <b>208</b> having an angle that is equal or complementary to a tapered surface <b>212</b> at the distal end <b>114</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b>, and that the tapered surfaces <b>208</b>, <b>212</b> can hold the gasket <b>140</b> between them, to form a seal between the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> and the inlet <b>136</b> of the outer chamber <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0060">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an inner chamber <b>112</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is illustrated. In addition, an inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b> is shown. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the perforations <b>164</b> in the body portion <b>156</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> do not extend along at least a first area or portion <b>308</b> of the inner chamber body <b>156</b>. In addition, the inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b> may include a slit <b>312</b>. Accordingly, the inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b> may be formed so that it has a diameter that is slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the body <b>156</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. Therefore, when the inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b> is slipped over the body <b>156</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b>, it can tightly cover the perforations <b>164</b>, and the slit <b>312</b> can be registered with the portion <b>308</b> along which no perforations <b>164</b> are formed. As can be appreciated by one of skill in the art after appreciation of the disclosure provided herein, the inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b> may be positioned to cover the perforations <b>164</b> in the inner chamber <b>112</b> when the inner chamber <b>112</b> has been removed from the outer chamber interior volume <b>108</b>, in preparation for the reinjection of collected tissue. In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b> may be sized so that it can be received within the interior bore of the inner chamber <b>112</b> to close off the perforations <b>164</b> from the inside of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention do not require that a slit <b>312</b> be formed in the inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b>. For example, the perforations <b>164</b> can be covered using a cylindrical inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b> that does not have a slit and that is dimensioned to fit tightly over the outside of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. Moreover, the inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b> can be formed from a silicone tube having an inner diameter that is smaller than the outer diameter of the inner chamber <b>112</b>, and a length that is sufficient to cover all of the perforations <b>164</b>.</p>

Accordingly, placing an inner chamber sleeve <b>304</b> over the perforations <b>164</b> prevents communication between the interior bore of the inner chamber <b>112</b> and the exterior of the inner chamber through the perforations <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0077">The stopper or plug <b>176</b> in the end of the inner chamber <b>112</b> may then be removed, and a plunger <b>516</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref>) may be inserted into the interior bore <b>160</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> (step <b>632</b>). The inner chamber <b>112</b> thus can form the body of a syringe <b>508</b> and may be interconnected to a reinjection cannula <b>512</b> (step <b>636</b>). The completed syringe <b>504</b> may then be used to reinject the removed tissue into a recipient site (step <b>640</b>). Examples of techniques for reinjecting tissue include manual operation of the syringe <b>504</b>, operation of a syringe using a mechanical ratchet type gun (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>), and injection using a compressed air type injection device (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts a device or system for tissue transplantation <b>1000</b> in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, in cross-section. In general, the system <b>1000</b> is similar to other systems <b>100</b> in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, in that it includes a tissue collection reservoir or filtering apparatus <b>1004</b> that includes an outer chamber <b>104</b> defining an interior volume <b>108</b> sized to accommodate an inner chamber or filter <b>112</b>. In addition to the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b>, the tissue transplantation system <b>1000</b> includes a tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b>. The tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> generally comprises a vessel <b>1006</b> with a lid <b>1010</b>. The lid <b>1010</b> may incorporate an inlet <b>1012</b> and an outlet <b>1024</b>. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the inlet <b>1012</b> is formed in about the center of the lid <b>1010</b>, while the outlet <b>1024</b> is formed towards the edge of the lid <b>1010</b>. In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the inlet <b>1012</b> and the outlet <b>1024</b> are formed in opposite halves of the lid <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0084">The tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> generally receives tissue harvested from a body using a cannula <b>118</b> that is connected to the inlet <b>1012</b> of the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b> by a flexible intermediate conduit or cannula conduit <b>1016</b>. The tissue transplantation system <b>1000</b> also includes a washed material or tissue conduit <b>1020</b> interconnecting the outlet <b>1024</b> of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b> to the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b> of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b>. In addition, the tissue transplantation system <b>1000</b> includes a vacuum source conduit <b>1028</b> interconnecting the outlet tube <b>152</b> of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b> to the vacuum source <b>126</b>. Accordingly, the vacuum source <b>126</b> can create a vacuum in the interior volume <b>108</b> of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b>. Moreover, because of the interconnection to the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> by the washed tissue conduit <b>1020</b>, a vacuum may be created in the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b>. The vacuum in the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> can in turn create a vacuum at the inlet <b>1030</b> to the cannula <b>118</b> via the cannula conduit <b>1016</b> that can be used to aspirate tissue from a body. Accordingly, the system for tissue transplantation permits the aspiration or removal of tissue from a body, washing and collection in a single, uninterrupted process or system. Moreover, injection of removed and washed tissue back into a body can be performed directly from the inner chamber <b>112</b> of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b>, for example as discussed in connection with other embodiments of the present invention. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the various inlets <b>120</b>, <b>1012</b> and outlets <b>152</b>, <b>1024</b> may comprise Luer connectors that mate with the various conduits <b>1016</b>, <b>1020</b>, <b>1028</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0085">Considering the components included in the tissue transplantation system <b>1000</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> now in more detail, the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b> includes a mounting member <b>1032</b> that cooperates with a support <b>1036</b>. Similarly, the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> includes a mounting member <b>1040</b> that cooperates with the support <b>1036</b>. The support <b>1036</b> may in turn be interconnected to or held by a stand <b>1042</b>, such as a Mayo stand. In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b> may be directly interconnected to a stand <b>1042</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the inlets <b>120</b>, <b>1012</b> of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b> and the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b> are at the top of their respective reservoir <b>1004</b>, <b>1008</b>. In the case of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b>, the placement of the inlet <b>120</b> at the top of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b> can facilitate the collection of tissue within the inner chamber <b>112</b>, while helping to avoid clogging of the perforations or holes <b>164</b> in the inner chamber <b>112</b> before the inner chamber <b>112</b> is substantially filled with tissue. In the case of the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b>, the positioning of the inlet <b>1012</b> at the top of the reservoir <b>1008</b> facilitates the deposition of tissue removed using the cannula <b>118</b> in the reservoir <b>1008</b> In addition, the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> is held such that the outlet <b>1024</b> is also at the top of the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b>.

<p id="p-0080" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates aspects of a method for removing tissue from a body and washing the tissue to prepare it for reinjection. Moreover, the method does not require that a practitioner handle tissue directly. Initially, at step <b>1302</b>, the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b> and the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> may be placed in a support <b>1036</b>, such that the inlets <b>120</b>, <b>1012</b> to the respective reservoirs are at or near the top of the reservoirs <b>1004</b>, <b>1008</b>. In addition, a liquid irrigant <b>1044</b> may be placed in the vessel <b>1006</b> of the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b>. At step <b>1304</b>, the vacuum source <b>126</b> is interconnected in series to the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b>, the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b> and the cannula <b>118</b>. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, interconnecting the vacuum source with these components may comprise interconnecting the inlet of the vacuum source <b>126</b> to the outlet <b>152</b> of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b> outer chamber <b>104</b> using a vacuum source conduit <b>1028</b>. Interconnecting the vacuum source <b>126</b> to other components may further include interconnecting the inlet <b>120</b> to the inner chamber <b>112</b> of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b> to the outlet <b>1024</b> of the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> using a washed material or tissue conduit <b>1020</b>. The interconnection of components to the vacuum source <b>126</b> may be completed by interconnecting the inlet <b>1012</b> of the washed tissue reservoir <b>1008</b> to the cannula <b>118</b> using a flexible intermediate conduit or cannula conduit <b>1016</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0090">At step <b>1308</b>, a vacuum is created at the inlet <b>1030</b> to the cannula <b>118</b> by activating the vacuum source <b>126</b>. Accordingly, it can be appreciated that a vacuum is created within the inner volume <b>108</b> of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b>, and within the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b>. Moreover, it can be appreciated that while the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> is at or near the top of the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b>, liquid irrigant <b>1044</b>, washed tissue, or other material in the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b> will not be removed from that reservoir <b>1008</b> by the vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0091">The practitioner then removes tissue from the body, by inserting the cannula <b>118</b> in an area of desired tissue, allowing the tissue to be aspirated. The removed tissue is deposited in the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> (step <b>1312</b>). The removed tissue may then be washed (step <b>1316</b>). Washing of the removed tissue may comprise allowing the removed tissue to collect in the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b> while the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b> is at least partially filled with a liquid irrigant <b>1044</b>. Alternatively or in addition, washing the removed tissue may comprise adding a liquid irrigant <b>1044</b> to tissue that has been collected in the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0092">After washing the removed tissue, the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> is tipped so that the washed tissue and/or liquid irrigant <b>1044</b> contained in the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b> covers the outlet <b>1024</b>, allowing the washed tissue and liquid irrigant to be sucked from the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> (step <b>1320</b>). The washed tissue that has been sucked from the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> is conveyed by the washed material or tissue conduit <b>1020</b> to the interior of the inner chamber <b>112</b> of the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b> and deposited in the inner chamber <b>112</b> (step <b>1324</b>). As described in connection with other embodiments of the present invention, the inner chamber <b>112</b> functions as a filter that collects removed tissue, while allowing other material to be separated from the removed tissue through perforations or holes <b>164</b> in the body of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, deposition of the washed tissue in the inner or filter chamber <b>112</b> is performed while the inlet to the inner chamber <b>112</b> is at or near the top of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. In this orientation, washed tissue tends to collect first at the bottom of the inner chamber <b>112</b>, and then fills towards the inlet <b>120</b>. Accordingly, gravity can assist in keeping the inlet <b>120</b> to the inner chamber <b>112</b> clear, such that entry to the inner chamber <b>112</b> by additional washed tissue before the inner chamber <b>112</b> is full or substantially full of washed tissue is not prevented or impeded.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0093">Following the collection of washed tissue in the inner or filter chamber <b>112</b>, the inner or filter chamber <b>112</b> can be removed from the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b>, with the washed tissue contained within the inner chamber <b>112</b> (step <b>1328</b>). The holes or perforations <b>164</b> in the body of the filter chamber <b>112</b> can then be covered, for example using a sleeve <b>304</b>, as described in connection with other embodiments of the present invention (step <b>1332</b>). The filter chamber <b>112</b> can then be connected to an injection cannula or needle <b>512</b>, a plunger <b>524</b> can be inserted into the filter chamber <b>112</b>, and the washed tissue can be injected from the inner chamber <b>112</b> into the body (step <b>1336</b>). As described in connection with other embodiments of the present invention, the plunger <b>524</b>, injection needle <b>512</b>, and sleeve <b>504</b> are added to the inner chamber <b>112</b> after the inner chamber <b>112</b> has been removed from the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b>, to form an injection syringe.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0094">As can be appreciated by one of skill in the art after consideration of the present disclosure, embodiments of the present invention allow for the removal, washing, and reinjection of tissue without requiring that a practitioner manually handle the tissue. Moreover, embodiments of the present invention provide a sealed system, allowing a single vacuum source <b>126</b> to provide suction for use in connection with removing tissue, moving tissue from the washing reservoir <b>1008</b> to the tissue collection reservoir <b>1004</b>, and removing material from washed tissue while the washed tissue is held in a filter chamber <b>112</b>. In addition to removing the need to manually handle and transfer tissue, embodiments of the present invention provide an integrated system with the included components either connected to one another or in convenient proximity to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0095">In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the amount of liquid irrigant <b>1044</b> comprising a bath for washing removed tissue may be selected by the practitioner.

In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, liquid irrigant may be supplied in a proportion of one part liquid irrigant <b>1044</b> to eight parts removed tissue. In accordance with still other embodiments of the present invention, the proportion of liquid irrigant <b>1044</b> to removed tissue can be 5 to 1. As can be appreciated by one of skill in the art, by providing a reservoir, a practitioner can select the proportion of liquid irrigant <b>1044</b> to washed tissue that the practitioner deems appropriate. Examples of liquid irrigant volumes that can be useful in connection with procedures involving the removal, washing and reinjection of tissue range from 1 cc to about 500 cc's, with 150 cc's being a useful amount for many procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0096">Although certain embodiments of the present invention have been discussed in connection with a tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b> that can be lifted or otherwise removed from a support member <b>1036</b> to tip the washing reservoir <b>1008</b> and thereby cover the outlet <b>1024</b> to remove washed tissue, other configurations are possible. For example, the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b> may be integral to a support member <b>1036</b>, which is in turn removable from the stand <b>1042</b> to allow tipping of the tissue washing reservoir <b>1008</b>. In accordance with still other embodiments of the present invention, the tissue-washing reservoir <b>1008</b> may be hinged or otherwise connected to a stand <b>1042</b> in such a way as to allow the outlet <b>1024</b> to be selectively covered for removal of washed tissue.</p>

In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the whole percentage may range from 5% towards the distal end <b>116</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b>, and gradually increase to 8% towards the inlet <b>168</b>. A configuration such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> of perforations or slits <b>164</b> that provide a greater whole percentage towards the inlet <b>168</b> than towards the distal end <b>116</b> can prevent premature clogging of the inner chamber <b>112</b>. For example, where the inner chamber <b>112</b> is oriented as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, with the inlet <b>168</b> generally above the distal end <b>116</b>, gravity pulls most of the collected fat down towards the distal end <b>116</b>. At the same time, the vacuum created by the vacuum source or pump <b>126</b> that pulls the fat and its accompanying liquid waste into the inner chamber <b>112</b> through the inlet <b>168</b> also pulls some of the small particles of cell walls through the holes <b>164</b>, which can result in blocking or plugging of the perforations <b>164</b>. Moreover, when a relatively large number of holes <b>164</b> become plugged, the entire inner chamber <b>112</b> can become plugged prematurely, preventing or inhibiting the continued collection of tissue. By providing a greater percentage of holes towards the inlet <b>168</b> of the inner chamber <b>112</b>, the time of harvest or collection can be extended as compared to an inner chamber <b>112</b> with perforations <b>164</b> that are evenly distributed across the body portion <b>156</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> in accordance with further embodiments of the present invention. In general, the device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> includes a canister <b>1508</b> defining, at least in part, an interior volume <b>1512</b> comprising a vacuum chamber. Located within the vacuum chamber <b>1512</b> is a collection vessel <b>1514</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the collection vessel <b>1514</b> comprises a plurality of syringe bodies <b>1516</b>. Although the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> includes a plurality of syringe bodies <b>1516</b>, other embodiments may include a single syringe body <b>1516</b>. The syringe bodies <b>1516</b> may comprise commonly available devices with an open end <b>1518</b> surrounded by a flat flange or handle <b>1522</b>, and a tip <b>1526</b> opposite the open end <b>1518</b>, that may comprise a luer-type connection capable of receiving a cannula or of being connected to tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0109">A syringe plate <b>1520</b> is interconnected to the canister <b>1508</b> at the top lip or edge <b>1522</b> of the canister <b>1508</b>. The syringe plate <b>1520</b> features a hole or syringe mount <b>1524</b> for receiving a syringe body <b>1516</b>. More particularly, the syringe plate <b>1520</b> includes a syringe mount <b>1524</b> for each syringe body <b>1516</b> that can be accommodated by the device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b>. A syringe or transfer plate lid <b>1528</b> interconnects to the syringe or transfer plate <b>1520</b> to form a vacuum tight seal over the open tops <b>1518</b> of the syringe bodies <b>1516</b>. In addition, the transfer plate <b>1520</b> and transfer plate lid <b>1528</b> cooperate with one another to form a tissue transfer channel <b>1532</b> that is in communication with the open tops <b>1518</b> of the syringe bodies <b>1516</b>. An inlet <b>1536</b>, which serves as an inlet for tissue to be delivered to the collection vessel <b>1514</b> or syringe bodies <b>1516</b>, is formed at a first end or the tissue transfer channel <b>1532</b>. A first vacuum outlet <b>1540</b>, in communication with the interiors of the syringe bodies <b>1516</b>, is formed at a second end of the tissue transfer channel <b>1532</b>. A second vacuum outlet <b>1544</b>, in communication with the interior <b>1512</b> of the canister <b>1508</b> is also provided. Both the first <b>1540</b> and second <b>1544</b> vacuum outlets may be connected to a common vacuum source <b>1548</b>. A bracket <b>1552</b> may also be provided to facilitate mounting the device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> to a support structure, such as a stand. In general, the inlet <b>1536</b> is interconnected to a cannula <b>118</b> by a length of tubing <b>1016</b>. Accordingly, the device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> can be used to receive tissue removed from a body through the cannula <b>118</b> and that is delivered by the tubing <b>1016</b> to the transfer channel <b>1532</b>. The removed tissue then drops into the syringe bodies <b>1516</b> in sequence until all of the syringe bodies <b>1516</b> are filled. Caps <b>1556</b> on the ends of the syringe bodies <b>1516</b> prevent collected tissue from flowing out of the tips <b>1526</b> of the syringe bodies <b>1516</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates the device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> in plan view. As shown, the syringe bodies <b>1516</b> can be arranged in a circular pattern. Accordingly, the tissue transfer channel <b>1532</b> describes almost a complete circle. As tissue is received through the inlet <b>1536</b>, it is deposited in the first syringe body <b>1516</b><i>a</i>. Once the first syringe body <b>1516</b><i>a </i>is filled with tissue, additional tissue received at the inlet <b>1536</b> is delivered by the tissue transfer channel <b>1532</b> to the second syringe body <b>1516</b><i>b</i>. This process can continue along the tissue transfer channel <b>1532</b> until the last syringe body <b>1516</b><i>f </i>is filled. Accordingly, the device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> allows a practitioner to fill a plurality of syringe bodies <b>1516</b> with collected tissue, without requiring that the practitioner manually handle the tissue. In addition, the device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> operates to automatically fill the plurality of syringe bodies <b>1516</b>. Accordingly, a plurality of syringe bodies <b>1516</b> can be filled with collected tissue in a way that is convenient for the practitioner, and in a way that reduces the opportunity for collected tissue to become contaminated or damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a flow chart illustrating aspects of the operation of a device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Initially, tissue is removed from a donor site in a body using a vacuum from a vacuum source <b>1548</b>, applied through a cannula <b>118</b> (step <b>1704</b>). The removed tissue is transferred to a tissue transfer or distribution channel <b>1532</b>, for example by a length of tubing <b>1016</b> interconnecting the cannula <b>118</b> to the inlet <b>1536</b> of the collection vessel <b>1516</b> (step <b>1708</b>). The tissue is then collected in a syringe body <b>1516</b> (step <b>1712</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0112">At step <b>1716</b>, a determination and/or decision is made as to whether to continue to collect tissue from the donor site. If tissue is no longer to be collected, the process may end. If tissue remains to be collected from the donor site, for example more tissue is needed for an implantation procedure, a determination may then be made as to whether the tissue collection syringe body <b>1516</b> that had been receiving collected tissue has filled (step <b>1720</b>). If that tissue collection syringe body <b>1516</b> has not filled, the process may return to step <b>1704</b>, and the deposition of collected tissue into that syringe body <b>1516</b> can continue. If the tissue collection syringe body <b>1516</b> has filled with tissue, a determination is made as to whether an additional tissue collection syringe body <b>1516</b> is available (step <b>1724</b>). If an additional tissue collection syringe body <b>1516</b> is not available the process may end. If an additional tissue collection syringe body <b>1516</b> is available, the process proceeds to step <b>1728</b>, with the selection of the next tissue collection syringe <b>1516</b>. The process may then return to step <b>1704</b>, and removed tissue can be collected in the next tissue collection syringe body <b>1516</b>. Accordingly, the tissue collection syringe bodies <b>1516</b> are filled in sequence. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the syringe bodies will be filled in a sequence beginning with the first syringe body <b>1516</b><i>a</i>, proceeding to the second syringe body <b>1516</b><i>b</i>, then to the third syringe body <b>1516</b><i>c</i>, and so on through the fourth <b>1615</b><i>d </i>and fifth <b>1516</b><i>e </i>syringe bodies until the sixth syringe body <b>1516</b><i>f </i>is filled. Although certain examples of a device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention have included six syringe bodies <b>1516</b>, it should be appreciated that other numbers of syringe bodies <b>1516</b> can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0113">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, additional aspects of the operation of a device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention are illustrated. More particularly, the use of a device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> in connection with injecting collected tissue into a body are illustrated. Initially, a tissue collection syringe body <b>1516</b> that is at least partially filled with collected tissue is removed from the device <b>1504</b> (step <b>1804</b>). Removing a syringe body <b>1516</b> can include removing the tissue transfer plate lid <b>1528</b> from the transfer plate <b>1520</b>, in order to access the syringe bodies <b>1516</b>. In particular, a practitioner, by removing the transfer plate lid <b>1528</b> can lift any of the syringe bodies <b>1516</b> from the transfer plate <b>1520</b>, and remove a syringe body <b>1516</b> from the syringe mount <b>1524</b> that held the syringe body <b>1516</b>. After removing a syringe body <b>1516</b>, the syringe body stopper <b>1556</b> can be replaced with a cannula <b>118</b>, and a plunger <b>524</b> can be inserted into the syringe body <b>1516</b> (step <b>1808</b>). At step <b>1812</b>, unwanted fluids, such as additives or anesthetics, can be ejected from the syringe body <b>1516</b>. For example, because fat that has been collected in a syringe body <b>1516</b> will tend to float above additives and other fluids, a practitioner can eject unwanted fluids by operating the plunger <b>1524</b> to force fluids at the bottom of the syringe body <b>1516</b> out of the syringe body <b>1516</b> (i.e. towards and through the tip <b>1526</b> and the cannula <b>118</b> (if fitted) while the syringe body <b>1516</b> is pointing downwardly). The syringe body stopper <b>1556</b> and cannula <b>118</b> may be provided with luer lock connectors and thus can be selectively interconnected to a cooperating luer lock connector at the distal end of the syringe body <b>1516</b>. The collected tissue can then be injected into a receiving site in a body (step <b>1816</b>). If desired, prior to injecting the collected tissue into a body, that tissue can be treated, for example by instilling additives or washing, while the collected tissue is in the syringe body <b>1516</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0114">At step <b>1820</b>, a determination can be made as to whether additional tissue is required for injection into a body, as part of the injection process. If additional tissue is required, the process may return to step <b>1804</b>, and the practitioner can remove a second syringe body <b>1516</b> from the device <b>1504</b>. If additional tissue is not required for injection, the process may end. As can be appreciated by one of skill in the art from the description provided herein, embodiments of the present invention provide a convenient way for a plurality of syringe bodies <b>1516</b> to be filled with collected tissue. Moreover, this can be accomplished without requiring that the practitioner manually transfer tissue from a larger collection chamber into individual syringes. Instead, the loading of multiple syringe bodies <b>1516</b> is accomplished automatically and without manual handling, using a closed system that is resistant to contamination and that avoids contacting harvested tissue with ambient air. In addition, the placement of collected tissue into syringe bodies <b>1516</b> of a size that is convenient for handling by the practitioner is facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0115">The transfer plate <b>1520</b> and transfer plate lid <b>1528</b> are generally formed from an FDA approved resin, because these components <b>1520</b>, <b>1528</b> can provide the transfer channel <b>1532</b> that guides collected tissue to syringe bodies <b>1516</b>. In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the tissue transfer channel <b>1532</b> may have a width of between &#xbd; an inch to 2 inches, a height of between &#xbd; an inch and 2 inches, and may be from 4-16 inches in length. In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the transfer channel may have a width of 1 inch, a height of 1 inch, and a length of 8 inches. In addition, the shape of the transfer channel <b>1532</b> can be linear, circular, or any other shape along which syringe bodies <b>1516</b> can be conveniently placed. However, the tissue transfer channel <b>1532</b> should have a first end, at which tissue is introduced, and a second end, opposite the first end, at which a vacuum outlet is formed, so that collected tissue can be introduced to syringe bodies located along the length of the tissue transfer channel <b>1532</b> in sequence. In operation, the components of the device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> may be drawn together by the vacuum that is applied. Moreover, because of the use of a vacuum, at least the tissue transfer plate <b>1520</b> and tissue transfer lid <b>1528</b> must be sufficiently strong to maintain the desired dimensions of the tissue transfer channel <b>1532</b>. Because the interior of the container <b>1508</b> is connected to the vacuum source, it should also be capable of maintaining its volume while a vacuum is introduced to the interior of the canister <b>1508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref> illustrate devices for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention. In particular, devices for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> that includes a collection vessel <b>1514</b> comprising an impermeable outer tissue collection bag <b>1904</b> are illustrated in cross-section. The outer bag <b>1904</b> includes an inlet <b>1908</b>, through which tissue collected using a cannula <b>118</b> can be admitted into the interior of the collection bag <b>1904</b>. In addition, a first vacuum outlet <b>1912</b> is provided in communication with the interior of the collection bag <b>1904</b>. The first vacuum outlet <b>1912</b> is also in communication with a vacuum source <b>1548</b>. Accordingly, the vacuum from the vacuum source <b>1548</b> can be provided via the first vacuum outlet <b>1912</b> at the inlet to a cannula <b>118</b> for removing tissue from a body. In addition, the device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> may include an inner tissue collection bag or filter <b>1916</b> that can be used to separate fat introduced into the interior of the outer collection bag <b>1904</b> via the intake <b>1908</b> from liquids or individual fat cells. In particular, the filter <b>1916</b> may be positioned within the outer collection bag <b>1904</b> so that fat is collected within the filter bag while liquids or small particles pass through the filter <b>1916</b> to the bottom of the outer collection bag <b>1904</b>. The outer collection bag <b>1904</b> and filter <b>1916</b> (if provided) are held within a canister <b>1508</b>. The canister <b>1508</b> may include a second vacuum outlet <b>1920</b> that is connected to the vacuum source <b>1548</b>. By creating a vacuum within the interior of the canister <b>1508</b>, the walls of the outer collection bag <b>1904</b> tend to be held apart from one another, promoting the deposition of tissue inside of the collection bag <b>1904</b>. That is, the vacuum created within the canister <b>1508</b> and around the outside of the collection bag <b>1904</b> counter-acts the tendency of the collection bag <b>1904</b> to collapse due to the vacuum at the vacuum outlet <b>1912</b> in communication with the interior of the collection bag <b>1904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0117">The canister <b>1908</b> may be sealed at one end by a lid or seal assembly <b>1924</b>. The seal assembly <b>1924</b> can include an inlet pathway <b>1928</b>, providing communication between the tubing <b>1016</b> connected to the cannula <b>118</b>, and the inlet <b>1908</b> to the inner bag <b>1916</b> and the outer collection bag <b>1904</b>. The seal assembly <b>1924</b> can also provide a vacuum outlet pathway <b>1932</b> providing communication between the vacuum hose connected to the vacuum source <b>1548</b> and the first vacuum outlet <b>1912</b> in communication with the interior of the collection bag <b>1904</b>. In addition, the canister <b>1508</b> may provide a support structure <b>1936</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>), to support the bottom of the collection bag <b>1904</b>. The canister <b>1508</b> may additionally include a bracket <b>1552</b> to facilitate interconnecting the device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> to a support. As shown in the figures, a vacuum pathway tee <b>1940</b> may be formed in the bracket <b>1552</b> that connects the first <b>1912</b> and second <b>1920</b> vacuum outlets to the vacuum source <b>1548</b>. Also, as shown, the second vacuum outlet may be formed in the bracket <b>1552</b>, or may alternatively be separately formed in the wall of the canister <b>1508</b> and connected to the vacuum source <b>1548</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0118">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, the first vacuum outlet <b>1912</b> is formed at the end of a waste tube <b>1926</b> that extends from the seal assembly or lid <b>1924</b> generally at the top of the canister <b>1508</b> to the bottom of the outer collection bag <b>1904</b>. Accordingly, the first vacuum outlet <b>1912</b> is located outside of the filter bag <b>1916</b> and at or towards the bottom of the outer collection bag <b>1904</b>. In this location, the first vacuum outlet <b>1912</b> can pull liquid and other material that has passed through the filter bag <b>1916</b> and collected in the bottom of the outer collection bag <b>1904</b> out of the outer collection bag <b>1904</b>. In this way, waste or otherwise unwanted materials can be separated from fat collected within the filter bag <b>1916</b>, without requiring manual handling of the tissue collection bags <b>1904</b> and <b>1916</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0119">In accordance with still other embodiments of the present invention, the waste tube <b>1926</b> can be formed at or along a seam of the outer tissue collection bag <b>1904</b>. Accordingly, the waste tube <b>1926</b> can be integral to the outer tissue collection bag <b>1904</b>. Moreover, in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the waste tube <b>1926</b> can also be integral or interconnected to the filter bag <b>1916</b>. As with other embodiments of the present invention, by providing a second vacuum outlet <b>1920</b> in communication with an interior of the canister <b>1508</b>, the tendency of the walls of the outer tissue collection bag <b>1904</b> to collapse the volume of the tissue collection bag <b>1904</b> is counteracted, to promote the deposition of tissue and other materials collected by a cannula <b>118</b> in the tissue collection bags <b>1904</b> and <b>1916</b> through the inlet <b>1908</b> to those bags <b>1904</b> and <b>1916</b>. Thus, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the outer tissue collection bag <b>1904</b> is held open, with the opposing walls of the bag <b>1904</b> apart from one another, to form or increase the size of a tissue collection volume within the outer collection tissue bag <b>1904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a flowchart illustrating aspects of the operation of a device for collecting tissue <b>1504</b> that utilizes a collection bag <b>1904</b>. Initially, at step <b>2004</b>, tissue is removed from a donor site using a vacuum applied through the cannula <b>118</b> and the intermediate tubing <b>1016</b>, and the removed tissue is deposited into the collection bag <b>1904</b>. At step <b>2008</b>, unwanted fluids are decanted or removed from the collection bag <b>1904</b>. This can include removing the collection bag <b>1904</b> from the canister <b>1508</b>, disconnecting the bag from the seal assembly <b>1924</b> (and then disconnecting the bag <b>1904</b> from the cannula <b>118</b> and the vacuum source <b>1548</b>), and turning the bag such that the ports <b>1908</b>, and <b>1912</b> are lower than the material collected in the bag <b>1904</b>. One of the ports <b>1908</b>, <b>1912</b> can then be opened, to allow fluid collected at the bottom of the collection bag <b>1904</b> to drain out of the bag, separating that fluid from tissue comprising collected fat cells.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0121">At step <b>2012</b>, a determination is made as to whether the remaining collected tissue should be washed or treated. If the collected tissue is to be washed or treated, an additive can be introduced to the interior of the collection vessel <b>1904</b> though one of the ports <b>1904</b>, <b>1912</b> (step <b>2016</b>). The additive and collected tissue may then be mixed together (step <b>2020</b>). Mixing the additive and the collected tissue can comprise massaging the exterior of the collection bag <b>1904</b>, to ensure complete mixing of the additive and collected tissue. At step <b>2024</b>, the additive can be decanted from the bag. After decanting the additive, or after determining that washing or treatment of collected tissue will not be performed, the collected tissue is transferred into one or more syringe bodies <b>1516</b> (step <b>2028</b>). In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, transferring collected tissue into a syringe body <b>1516</b> can include removing or forcing tissue through a port <b>1904</b>, <b>1912</b> and into the body <b>1516</b> of a syringe, either directly or through a piece of intermediate tubing. In accordance with still other embodiments of the present invention, transferring collected tissue into syringes can include removing the collected tissue from the tissue collection bag <b>1904</b>, and passing that tissue to a tissue collection device <b>1504</b> comprising a plurality of syringe bodies <b>1516</b>. Accordingly, a tissue collection device <b>1504</b> may comprise multiple stages, with a first stage comprising a tissue collection bag <b>1904</b>, as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> or B, and a second stage comprising a plurality of syringe bodies <b>1516</b>, as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, to facilitate the loading of tissue in the syringe bodies <b>1516</b> for reinjection. The collected tissue can then be injected into an injection site (step <b>2032</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0122">In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a canister <b>1508</b> may comprise a polycarbonate canister with an integrated bracket <b>1552</b> and vacuum outlet <b>1544</b>. The size of the canister may vary. For example, the canister <b>1508</b> may have a capacity of from 100 to 5,000 cc's. In accordance with other embodiments, the canister <b>1508</b> may have a capacity of 3,000 cc's. As an alternative to polycarbonate, the canister <b>1508</b> may be formed from any polymer, metal or glass. Moreover, because the canister <b>1508</b> is not typically in contact with harvested fat, it does not need to be made from an FDA approved resin. However, it is desirable to provide a canister <b>1508</b> that is autoclavible, so that syringe bodies <b>1516</b>, collection bags <b>1904</b>, or other components can be changed under sterile conditions. The syringe bodies <b>1516</b> may be any syringe body suitable for use in connection with the injection of tissue or compounds into a body. The syringe bodies <b>1516</b> may have any capacity. For example, the syringe bodies <b>1516</b> may have capacities of from about 1 cc to about 100 cc. In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the syringe bodies <b>1516</b> may have a capacity of 60 cc's. In accordance with still other embodiments of the present invention, the syringe bodies <b>1516</b> can have holes or perforations in order to function as a filter. Accordingly, the syringe bodies <b>1516</b> may comprise an inner chamber <b>112</b> as described elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0123">A collection bag <b>1904</b> may comprise a bag that is FDA approved for containing blood or other fluids intended for injection into a human or animal body. The capacity of a collection bag <b>1904</b> may vary. For example, the collection bag <b>1904</b> may have a capacity of from 100 to 2,000 cc's. Commonly available bags have three ports. If such a bag is used as a collection bag <b>1904</b>, a first port may be used as the intake port <b>1908</b>, the second port may be used as the vacuum outlet port <b>1912</b>, and the third port may be capped or plugged. If desired, any one of the ports may be provided with a valve, for example to assist in decanting or removing unwanted fluids or introducing additives. As an alternative to a collection bag <b>1904</b>, a collection vessel <b>1514</b> may comprise a rigid container. Because of the vacuum produced in the interior of the canister <b>1508</b>, the walls of the collection vessel can be less resistant to collapse than if the collection vessel was used in atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0124">If provided, a filter or filter bag <b>1916</b> is generally used to separate desired tissue from undesired fluids or cells. For example, where the desired tissue comprises tissue that will be used for reinjection, the pores of the filter or filter bag <b>1916</b> may be about 500 microns, plus or minus 200 microns, to retain parcels of fat cells, and to allow fluids and undesirable fat cells to pass through the filter.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a tissue collection system <b>2100</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The tissue collection system <b>2100</b> generally includes a tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> with a canister lid <b>2108</b>. When the lid <b>2108</b> is fitted to the canister <b>2104</b>, the interior volume of the canister <b>2104</b> is sealed, except for various inlets and ports as will be described in detail herein. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the canister <b>2104</b> is rigid, to define an essentially constant interior volume.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0126">Within the interior volume of the canister <b>2104</b> is a tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>. The tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b> may comprise an impermeable bag formed from a flexible material. Alternatively, the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b> may comprise a rigid or semi-rigid container. The tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b> generally includes an inlet <b>2116</b> and an outlet <b>2120</b>. In addition, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the width of a collection volume <b>2124</b> defined by the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b> is less along a first edge <b>2128</b> that includes at least one of the inlet <b>2116</b> and the outlet <b>2120</b> then along a second edge <b>2132</b> opposite the first edge <b>2128</b>. For example, the sides <b>2136</b> of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b> may be tapered at or towards the first edge <b>2128</b>. In accordance with still other embodiments, the tissue collection volume <b>2112</b> may feature a conical section that narrows towards the first edge <b>2128</b>. In accordance with further embodiments of the present invention, the first edge <b>2128</b> may have a length that is less than one half the length of the second edge <b>2132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0127">The lid <b>2108</b> of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> may feature a plurality of ports. For example, a first port <b>2140</b> may be provided to place the inlet <b>2116</b> of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b> in communication with a length of harvest tubing <b>2144</b> that is in turn interconnected to a tissue collection cannula <b>118</b>. A second port <b>2148</b> may be provided that places the interior volume <b>2102</b> of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> in communication with a vacuum source <b>1548</b> via a length of vacuum tubing <b>2152</b>. A third port <b>2156</b> may be provided to place the interior volume <b>2124</b> of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b> in communication with the vacuum source <b>1548</b> via the length of vacuum tubing <b>2152</b> at the outlet port <b>2120</b> of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0128">In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the volume of tubing, including the vacuum tubing <b>2152</b> interconnecting the vacuum source <b>1548</b> to the third port <b>2156</b> is greater than the volume of tubing including the vacuum tubing <b>2152</b> interconnecting the vacuum source <b>1548</b> to the second port <b>2148</b>. For example, an additional section of vacuum tubing or an extension section <b>2160</b> that extends from a T-fitting <b>2164</b> proximate to the second port <b>2148</b> is provided to place the third port <b>2156</b> in communication with the vacuum source <b>1548</b>. As a result, the vacuum potential at the second port <b>2148</b> is greater than at the third port <b>2156</b>. Therefore, a vacuum may be introduced in the interior volume <b>2124</b> of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, and a greater vacuum can be introduced in the interior volume <b>2102</b> of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> about an exterior of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, to maintain the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b> in an open or inflated configuration, to facilitate the deposition of collected tissue into the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0129">The inlet <b>2116</b> to the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b> is preferably located at some distance from the outlet <b>2120</b> of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>. For example, the distance between the inlet <b>2116</b> and the outlet <b>2120</b> may be at least 1.5 inches. This spacing can reduce or eliminate the tendency for collected tissue to be sucked into the outlet <b>2120</b>, instead of being deposited into and held by the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0130">An air inlet hole <b>2168</b> may be formed in the harvest tubing <b>2144</b>. The provision of an air inlet <b>2168</b> allows ambient air to be admitted into the harvest tubing <b>2144</b>, to provide a cushion for fat cells being transported from the cannula <b>118</b> to the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>. This is believed to protect the fat cells from damage and to facilitate the flow of harvested tissue, including harvested fat cells, along the harvest tubing <b>2144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0131">Alternatively or in addition, an air inlet <b>2172</b> may be provided in one or more of the walls defining the interior volume of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b>. For example, an air inlet <b>2172</b> may be provided in the tissue collection canister lid <b>2108</b>. The inclusion of an air inlet <b>2172</b> in the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> can reduce the vacuum within the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> relative to the ambient environment. By thus limiting the vacuum formed within the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b>, the risk of implosion of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0132">In accordance with further embodiments of the present invention, various surfaces of the system <b>2100</b> are coated in silicone. For example, by coating surfaces such as the interior of the harvest tubing <b>2144</b> or the interior of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, materials that are not approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for transporting or holding collected tissue prior to reinjection can be used for the harvest tubing <b>2144</b> and/or the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>. Coating such surfaces in silicone can also reduce surface imperfections, so that a smoother surface is presented to collected tissue. By providing a smoother surface, damage to collected fat cells can be reduced, and the transport of tissue can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates a tissue collection system <b>2200</b> in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention. The tissue collection system <b>2200</b> includes a tissue collection vessel <b>2212</b> having a permeable section or sections. More particularly, the tissue collection vessel <b>2212</b> may comprise a material with holes sized such that liquids can pass through the walls of the tissue collection vessel <b>2212</b>, while fat cells are retained within the interior volume of the tissue collection vessel <b>2212</b>. For example, the tissue collection vessel <b>2212</b> walls have holes that are less than or equal to 800 &#x3bc;m. As with other embodiments, the tissue collection vessel <b>2212</b> may feature side walls <b>2236</b> that taper towards a first end <b>2228</b>. An inlet <b>2216</b> in the tissue collection vessel <b>2212</b> admits tissue collected by the cannula <b>118</b>. Because the walls of the tissue collection vessel <b>2212</b> are permeable, a separate outlet is not required. The inlet <b>2216</b> may be interconnected to harvest tubing <b>2144</b> via a first port <b>2140</b> in the lid <b>2108</b> of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0134">A length of waste tubing <b>2238</b> may be connected to vacuum tubing <b>2152</b> and in turn to a vacuum source <b>1548</b> via a second port <b>2148</b> in the collection canister lid <b>2108</b>. The inlet <b>2248</b> to the waste tubing <b>2238</b> may be placed at or proximate to the bottom of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> when the system <b>2200</b> is in use. Accordingly, the waste tubing <b>2238</b> may introduce a vacuum into the interior volume of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b>, and may also remove fluids that have passed through the walls of the tissue collection vessel <b>2212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0135">The system <b>2200</b> may include an air inlet <b>2168</b> in the harvest tubing to cushion the transport of fat cells along the harvest tubing <b>2168</b> and to improve this transport of fat along the harvest tubing <b>2144</b>. Alternatively or in addition, an air inlet <b>2172</b> may be formed in the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b>, for example in the tissue collection canister lid <b>2108</b>, to reduce the relative vacuum formed within the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0136">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the removal of collected tissue <b>2304</b> from a tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, <b>2212</b> is illustrated. In general, the removal includes capping or otherwise closing all but one of the ports in the canister lid <b>2108</b> (e.g., by capping the second <b>2148</b> port and (if provided) the third port <b>2156</b>) and inverting the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> so that collected tissue <b>2304</b> is displaced towards the first edge <b>2128</b>, <b>2228</b> of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, <b>2212</b>. In addition, where the sides <b>2136</b>, <b>2236</b> of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, <b>2212</b> are tapered towards the first edge <b>2128</b>, <b>2228</b>, the collected tissue <b>2304</b> is concentrated towards the inlet <b>2116</b>, <b>2216</b>. The first port <b>2140</b> of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> is interconnected to a syringe <b>2308</b> by a length of tubing <b>2312</b>. Collected tissue <b>2304</b> can be drawn into the body of the syringe <b>2308</b> by pulling back the plunger <b>2316</b> of the syringe <b>2308</b> after the tissue <b>2304</b> has been displaced towards the inlet <b>2116</b>, <b>2216</b> of the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, <b>2212</b>. Accordingly, it can be appreciated that the tapered sides <b>2136</b>, <b>2236</b> facilitates the removal of collected tissue <b>2304</b> from the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, <b>2212</b> to a syringe <b>2308</b> for reinjection.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates aspects of a method for tissue transfer in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Initially, at step <b>2400</b>, a vacuum is formed in a tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> and in a cannula <b>118</b> interconnected to the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b>. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, air is admitted into the interior of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> through an air inlet <b>2172</b>. At step <b>2404</b>, tissue is removed from a donor site using a vacuum applied at an inlet to a cannula <b>118</b>. At step <b>2408</b>, ambient air is injected into the flow of tissue through an air inlet <b>2168</b> formed in harvest tubing <b>2144</b>. At step <b>2410</b>, tissue is deposited into the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, <b>2212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0138">At step <b>2412</b>, a determination is made as to whether a desired amount of tissue has been collected, or whether the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, <b>2212</b> is at capacity. If additional tissue is to be collected, the process may return to step <b>2400</b>. If a desired amount of tissue has been collected, the harvest tubing <b>2144</b> can be disconnected from the first port <b>2140</b> of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> (step <b>2414</b>). Next, a syringe <b>2308</b> can be connected to the first port <b>2140</b> by a length of tubing <b>2312</b> (step <b>2416</b>). Alternatively, the port or tip of the syringe can be connected to the first port <b>2140</b>. At step <b>2418</b>, the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> can be tilted or inverted so that collected tissue <b>2304</b> is displaced towards the first port <b>2140</b> of the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b>. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, tapered side walls <b>2136</b>, <b>2236</b> concentrate the collected tissue <b>2304</b> around the first port <b>2120</b> when the tissue collection canister <b>2104</b> and the tissue collection vessel <b>2112</b>, <b>2212</b> within a canister <b>2104</b> are inverted. At step <b>2420</b>, the collected tissue <b>2304</b> is drawn into the syringe <b>2308</b> by pulling back the plunger <b>2316</b> of the syringe <b>2308</b>. At step <b>2422</b>, the syringe <b>2308</b> can be interconnected to a reinjection needle, and the collected tissue <b>2304</b> can be reinjected into a body. The process may then end.</p>
