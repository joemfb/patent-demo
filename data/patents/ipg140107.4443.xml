No. 11/766,888 and entitled &#x201c;TECHNIQUES FOR RESOURCE BLOCK MAPPING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM&#x201d;, filed Jun. 22, 2007 and issuing as U.S. Pat. No. 8,204,008, the foregoing incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates generally to mapping and, more specifically, to techniques for resource block mapping in a wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems support high data rate wireless transmission using orthogonal channels; which offer immunity against fading and inter-symbol interference (ISI) without requiring implementation of elaborate equalization techniques. Typically, OFDM systems split data into N streams, which are independently modulated on parallel spaced subcarrier frequencies or tones. The frequency separation between subcarriers is 1/T, where T is the OFDM symbol time duration. Each symbol may include a guard interval (or cyclic prefix) to maintain the orthogonality of the symbols. In general, OFDM systems have utilized an inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) to generate a sampled (or discrete) composite time-domain signal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various wireless networks, such as third-generation partnership project-long term evolution (3GPP-LTE) compliant architectures, may be designed to employ uplink reference signals (RSs) for uplink carrier-to-interference and noise (CINR) estimation, which is used by a scheduler, e.g., a network scheduler, to schedule uplink transmission for user equipment (subscriber stations (SSs)). Respective sequences of the RSs are used to uniquely identify an SS and, when transmitted from the SS to a serving base station (BS), may be used by the serving BS in channel characterization. In general, a scheduler associated with one or more serving BSs utilizes information derived from channel characterization to determine channel allocation for the SSs. The channel allocation, e.g., uplink and downlink assignments, have then been provided to the SSs over a downlink shared control channel (physical downlink control channel (PDCCH)), which typically includes one or more control channel symbols. The one or more control channel symbols are usually transmitted by the serving BS at a beginning of a downlink frame (or subframe). Typically, upon receiving the one or more control channels symbols, each of the SSs searches (using, for example, a blind search procedure) the one or more control channel symbols to locate an associated downlink and uplink control channel to determine respective uplink and downlink assignments.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A known control channel downlink scheduling approach has proposed employing a resource block (RB) map in an associated downlink control channel of each SS. According to this approach, a bit is provided in the RB map for each RB that is to be scheduled. An RB may have various lengths, e.g., seven symbols, and correspond to a group of subcarriers, e.g., twelve subcarriers. As one example, in a conventional wireless communication system having a 20 MHz bandwidth, an RB map may employ one-hundred bits to support discontinuous RB assignment. In this case, a given SS searches an associated 100-bit RB map in an associated downlink control channel to determine a location of the RBs assigned to the given SS for downlink communication. For example, a digital one, e.g., a &#x2018;1&#x2019;, in a bit of the RB map may be used to indicate to an SS that an associated RB is assigned to the SS and a digital zero, e.g., a &#x2018;0&#x2019;, in a bit of the RB map may be used to indicate to the SS that an associated RB is assigned to another SS (or is unassigned).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an example diagram <b>100</b> of a relevant portion of a downlink shared control channel that employs a conventional resource block (RB) mapping scheme is illustrated for five SSs (i.e., the SSs denoted as SS1, SS2, SS3, SS4, and SS5). As is shown, each associated downlink control channel (CCH) of the SSs includes an individual RB map that maps all of the RBs in a related wireless communication system. In this case, five-hundred RB mapping bits (i.e., one-hundred RB mapping bits per each of the five SSs) are required to be transmitted (from the serving BS to the five SSs) on a downlink shared control channel. While the number of conventional RB mapping bits may be limited to reduce overhead, reducing the number of RB mapping bits also results in a loss of scheduling gain. That is, reducing the number of conventional RB mapping bits reduces a size of a frequency spectrum that may be utilized for communication which may reduce frequency selectivity (i.e., an ability of a serving BS to choose a best RB or group of RBs for a given SS).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed are techniques for reducing overhead associated with resource block mapping in a downlink shared control channel (of a wireless communication system) that do not adversely affect frequency selectivity.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, architectural, programmatic, mechanical, electrical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims and their equivalents. In particular, although the preferred embodiment is described below in conjunction with a subscriber station, such as a cellular handset, it will be appreciated that the present invention is not so limited and may be embodied in various devices, e.g., personal digital assistants (PDAs), digital cameras, portable storage devices, audio players, computer systems, and portable gaming devices, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As is used herein, the term &#x201c;user equipment&#x201d; is synonymous with the term &#x201c;subscriber station,&#x201d; which is used to broadly denote a wireless device associated with a wireless communication system. As is also used herein, the term &#x201c;control channel symbol&#x201d; includes a symbol that occupies a channel, which may occupy an entire system bandwidth or a portion of the entire system bandwidth. The term &#x201c;channel,&#x201d; as used herein, includes one or more subcarriers, which may or may not be adjacent. As may be used herein, the term &#x201c;slot&#x201d; refers to a symbol location in a multiple access signal. The term &#x201c;blind search procedure&#x201d; is used herein to refer to a search procedure in which a searcher, e.g., an SS, has no prior knowledge of a location of an item searched for in a sequence of items. For example, when an SS is searching one or more control channel symbols (of a downlink shared control channel) for an associated control channel, the SS does not have prior knowledge of the location of the associated control channel in the one or more control channel symbols when a blind search procedure is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to various aspects of the present disclosure, a control channel scheduling technique is employed that generally reduces overhead associated with transmitting a resource block (RB) map (from a serving base station (BS) to subscriber stations (SSs) in a wireless communication system), while maintaining frequency selectivity. The various techniques reduce overhead by reducing the number of associated RB mapping bits that are used for an RB map in a downlink shared control channel. Reducing the number of associated RB mapping bits also generally reduces decoding complexity of the downlink shared control channel at the SSs, as there are less associated RB mapping bits to decode. As such, a search routine, e.g., a blind search procedure, employed at an SS has less bits to search. In general, the disclosed techniques employ a unique SS identification (ID) or index for each SS. A bit size of the SS ID may be chosen based on the number of active SSs, e.g., for sixteen active SSs an SS ID having a bit size of 4-bits may be employed. As another example, in a cell having twenty active SSs, a serving BS may select an SS ID having 5-bits. In general, a bit size of an SS ID may be chosen as a rounded-up integer of log<sub>2</sub>(# of active SSs). Alternatively, a size of an SS ID may be statically selected based on a maximum number of active SSs that a serving BS may service in a cell. For example, in a cell having forty maximum active SSs, a 6-bit SS ID may be employed. In various disclosed techniques, SS IDs are mapped to RBs with (N+M)* rounded-up integer(log 2(M)) bits, where N is the number of RBs and M is the number of SSs.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a typical wireless communication system configured according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, a scheduler associated with a serving BS (e.g., a network scheduler (included in base station controller (BSC) <b>512</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) or a scheduler located at a base transceiver station (BTS) <b>514</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is configured to schedule a control channel format indicator (CCFI) in a downlink shared control channel (physical downlink control channel (PDCCH)) to indicate a size, e.g., in symbols, of the downlink shared control channel. For example, in a wireless communication system that may transmit up to three symbols in a downlink shared control channel, the CCFI may include two bits that are repeated twelve times in a first symbol of the downlink shared control channel in a protocol dependent location. The control channel symbols may be, for example, orthogonal frequency multiplexing (OFDM) signals. An associated control channel of an SS (included in the downlink shared control channel) may include one or more control channel elements (CEs) that provide various control information to the SS.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The associated control channel may be a downlink control channel, an uplink control channel, or a combined control channel that includes both uplink and downlink assignment information. The scheduler is also configured to schedule the associated downlink control channels for each of the SSs that the scheduler is attempting to serve. In this case, each of the associated downlink control channels includes an explicit SS ID (SS index) that is used in RB mapping, but does not include an RB map. The scheduler is also configured to schedule a shared RB mapping channel in the downlink shared control channel. The shared RB mapping channel is sized based on a system bandwidth and includes a single RB map that is utilized by all of the served SSs to determine associated downlink RBs (i.e., where a given one of the SSs is to receive downlink information). In this embodiment, each of the SSs receives the shared downlink control channel and decodes the CCFI to determine a candidate set (i.e., the number of symbols that are required to be searched) for a search procedure (e.g., a blind search procedure) of the shared downlink control channel. Each of the SSs is configured to detect an associated control channel (indicated by a unique identifier associated with an SS) in the candidate set and is configured to detect an associated SS ID from the associated control channel. Each of the SSs is also configured to use the associated SS ID in conjunction with the RB map (included in the RB mapping channel) to detect one or more associated RBs.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, a technique for operating a wireless communication device includes creating a resource block (RB) map by associating respective subscriber station identifications (SS IDs), corresponding to respective subscriber stations (SSs), with one or more RBs (which each include one or more respective subcarriers). The respective SS IDs and the RB map are transmitted, from a serving base station (BS), in one or more control channel symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a technique for operating a wireless communication device includes receiving, at a first subscriber station (SS), one or more control channel symbols, which include respective subscriber station identifications (SS IDs) and a resource block (RB) map. The RB map associates the respective SS IDs with one or more RBs. The respective SS IDs each correspond to respective SSs, which include the first SS. The technique also includes searching, at the first SS, the one or more control channel symbols to detect an associated downlink control channel for the first SS. In this case, the associated downlink control channel for the first SS includes a first SS ID (included within the respective SS IDs).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a wireless communication system includes a scheduler coupled to a serving base station (BS). The scheduler is configured to create a resource block (RB) map by associating respective subscriber station identifications (SS IDs), corresponding to respective subscriber stations (SSs), with one or more RBs, which each include one or more respective subcarriers. The BS is configured to transmit the respective SS IDs and the RB map in one or more control channel symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a virtual representation of a relevant portion of a downlink shared control channel <b>200</b> is illustrated. In a typical wireless communication system, the downlink shared control channel <b>200</b> is located at a beginning of a downlink (DL) subframe that includes multiple downlink shared control channel symbols (e.g., one, two, or three control channel symbols) and multiple data symbols. The control channel symbols (not separately shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) typically include a number of control channel elements (CEs), each of which include a number of subcarriers, e.g., six subcarriers. Similarly, the data symbols each include a number of resource blocks (RBs) <b>220</b> with, for example, twelve subcarriers per RB. It should be appreciated that the CEs and the RBs may have the same size or a different size.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should also be appreciated that the techniques disclosed herein are broadly applicable to DL subframes of varying sizes and that a control channel may assume an integer value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc. symbols) or a fractional value (e.g., 1.5, 2.5, etc. symbols). Transmitters implemented within a wireless communication system, configured according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, may transmit information using a phase shift keying (PSK), a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), or other data modulation scheme, depending upon which modulation scheme is scheduled. For example, any of the various PSK (such as pi/2 BPSK, QPSK, and 8-PSK), or QAM (such as 16-QAM and 64-QAM) modulation techniques may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to various aspects of the present disclosure, an associated downlink control channel <b>212</b> of each SS does not include an RB map for the entire wireless communication system. That is, in at least one embodiment, the associated downlink control channels <b>212</b> of each SS include an associated SS ID <b>202</b> that is utilized in conjunction with SS IDs <b>204</b>, provided via a shared RB mapping channel <b>210</b>, to assign RBs <b>220</b> to each of the SSs. In this embodiment, the shared RB mapping channel <b>210</b> provides SS IDs <b>204</b> that are each associated with different RBs <b>220</b>. The SS ID assigned to a given one of the SSs (by a scheduler) may take on virtually any value. More specifically, each of the SSs decodes an associated downlink control channel <b>212</b> to determine an assigned SS ID and then use the assigned SS ID to determine which of the RBs <b>220</b> are assigned to the SS by decoding the SS IDs <b>204</b> in the shared RB mapping channel <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this example, the SS labeled &#x2018;SS1&#x2019; is assigned the SS ID &#x2018;001&#x2019;, which is assigned one of the RBs <b>220</b> (i.e., the RB associated with a top entry of the RB map in the RB mapping channel <b>210</b>), e.g., twelve subcarrier for an assigned time slot, in the RB map. It should be appreciated that the SS labeled &#x2018;SS1&#x2019; may be assigned a different SS ID and a label for an SS does not necessarily correspond to an SS ID. The RB <b>220</b> assigned to the SS1 may correspond to, for example, a voice channel.

In this example, each associated downlink control channel <b>212</b> of an SS includes a 3-bit SS ID, which may be located in a protocol dependent location in the associated downlink control channel <b>212</b>. In this embodiment, assuming one-hundred RBs (only a portion of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are to be mapped (e.g., a 20 MHz bandwidth is selected), an RB map is constructed using a total of three-hundred bits (i.e., 100-entries with 3-bits per entry). In this case, three-hundred twenty-one total bits are utilized to perform RB mapping (three bits are transmitted in each of the seven associated downlink control channels <b>212</b> and three hundred bits are transmitted in a shared RB mapping channel <b>210</b>). In contrast, to map seven SSs to one-hundred RBs according to the conventional RB mapping approach described above has required the transmission (from the serving BS to the seven SSs) of seven-hundred RB mapping bits (one-hundred RB mapping bits per SS) in a downlink shared control channel. In this example, the number of RB mapping bits has been reduced by over one-half, which facilitates maintaining frequency selectivity, while generally reducing overhead associated with a downlink shared control channel and generally reducing decoding complexity of the downlink shared control channel.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be appreciated that each of the associated downlink control channels <b>212</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> include additional information, e.g., in protocol dependent fields.

As noted above, in a typical wireless communication system, a downlink shared control channel is located at a beginning of a DL subframe that may include multiple downlink shared control channel symbols (e.g., one, two, or three control channel symbols) and multiple data symbols. The control channel symbols typically include a number of control channel elements (CEs), each of which include a number of subcarriers, e.g., six subcarriers.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to this aspect of the present disclosure, each associated downlink control channel <b>312</b> of an individual SS does not include an individual RB map for the entire wireless communication system. In lieu of the individual RB map, each associated downlink control channel <b>312</b> includes an SS ID <b>302</b> (assigned to an SS by a scheduler) that is utilized in conjunction with information provided in a shared RB mapping channel <b>310</b> to assign RBs <b>320</b> to an SS. More specifically, each of the SSs decodes an associated downlink control channel <b>312</b> to determine an associated SS ID. The associated downlink control channel <b>312</b> may be identified by an SS when, for example, a unique identifier (e.g., a unique 16-bit identifier) included in a protocol dependent field within the associated downlink control channel <b>312</b> corresponds to the unique identifier assigned (by, for example, a network administrator) to the SS. The SS then uses the SS ID to determine which of the RBs <b>320</b> are assigned to the SS using the information in the shared RB mapping channel <b>310</b>. For example, the SS labeled &#x2018;SS1&#x2019; is assigned the SS ID &#x2018;001&#x2019;, which is assigned four of the RBs <b>320</b> (i.e., an RB associated with a top entry in the shared RB mapping channel <b>310</b>, an RB associated with a thirteenth entry from the top entry in the shared RB mapping channel <b>310</b>, an RB associated with an eighteenth entry from the top in the shared RB mapping channel <b>310</b>, and an RB associated with a twenty-first entry from the top in the RB mapping channel <b>310</b>), e.g., twelve subcarriers for each RB in an assigned time slot, in the shared RB mapping channel <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The RB map provided in the shared RB mapping channel <b>310</b> differs from the RB map provided in the shared RB mapping channel <b>210</b> in that the shared RB mapping channel <b>310</b> includes a first bit field (B<b>0</b>) <b>304</b>, may include a second bit field (B<b>1</b>) <b>306</b>, and includes one or more SS IDs <b>308</b> that indicate what SS is assigned to an associated RB for each entry in the RB map. The B<b>0</b> field <b>304</b> provides a first indicator as to the number of SSs assigned to a given one of the RBs <b>320</b>. For example, in one embodiment, if the B<b>0</b> field <b>304</b> includes a digital zero, i.e., &#x2018;0&#x2019;, either the RB is assigned to one SS or is unassigned (as indicated by the SS ID). For example, the SS ID of &#x2018;000&#x2019; may be used to indicate that an RB <b>320</b> is unassigned. In this embodiment, if the B<b>0</b> field includes a digital one, i.e., &#x2018;1&#x2019;, the RB <b>320</b> is assigned to two or more SSs, as indicated by the B<b>1</b> field <b>306</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Moving to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an example process <b>400</b> (which corresponds to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that is employed by SSs in a wireless communication system, configured according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, is illustrated. The process <b>400</b> is initiated in block <b>402</b>, where a variable &#x2018;i&#x2019; is initialized, e.g., set equal to zero. In the process <b>400</b>, the variable &#x2018;i&#x2019; corresponds to a number of RBs <b>320</b> employed in an associated wireless communication system. For example, in a wireless communication system that has a 20 MHz bandwidth, one-hundred RBs (corresponds to twelve-hundred subcarriers in a system that defines an RB as including twelve subcarriers) may be utilized. As another example, in a wireless communication system that has a 10 MHz bandwidth, fifty RBs may be utilized. As yet another example, in a wireless communication system that has a 5 MHz bandwidth, twenty-five RBs may be utilized. Next, in decision block <b>404</b>, the SS determines whether the B<b>0</b> field <b>304</b> in an associated entry of the RB mapping channel <b>310</b> is equal to a digital one. If the B<b>0</b> field <b>304</b> stores a digital one, the SS is configured to check at least two SS IDs in the entry of the RB map to determine whether the SS is to receive downlink information in the associated RB <b>320</b> (i.e., to determine whether the SS ID of the SS matches the SS IDs in the entry of the RB map). When the B<b>0</b> field <b>304</b> stores a digital one, control transfers to decision block <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If the B<b>0</b> field <b>304</b> stores a digital zero in block <b>406</b>, the SS is configured to check one SS ID in the entry of the RB map to determine whether the SS is to receive downlink information in the associated RB <b>320</b>. From block <b>406</b>, control transfers to block <b>410</b>, where the SS reads one SS ID to determine whether the SS is to receive downlink information in the associated RB <b>320</b>. When the B<b>0</b> field <b>304</b> stores a digital one in block <b>406</b>, control transfers to decision block <b>408</b>.

When the B<b>1</b> field <b>306</b> stores a digital zero in block <b>408</b>, control transfers to block <b>414</b>, where the SS reads two SS IDs in the entry of the RB map to determine whether the SS is to receive downlink information in the associated RB.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Following blocks <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, and <b>414</b>, control transfers to block <b>416</b>, where the variable &#x2018;i&#x2019; is incremented by one.

Then, in block <b>616</b>, the serving BS transmits the respective SS IDs and the RB map in one or more control channel symbols. In one or more embodiments, the SS IDs <b>302</b> are transmitted in respective downlink control channels <b>312</b> of the respective SSs and the RB map is transmitted in the shared RB mapping channel <b>310</b>. The one or more control channel symbols may include an assigned uplink, an assigned downlink, or both the assigned uplink and downlink for the respective SSs. The one or more control channel symbols may be, for example, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a process <b>700</b> is illustrated that is employed by an SS to determine assigned RBs. To aid in understanding, the process <b>700</b> is described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>. In block <b>702</b> the process <b>700</b> is initiated, at which point control transfers to block <b>704</b>. In block <b>704</b>, one or more control channel symbols (including the downlink shared control channel <b>300</b>) are received at an SS.

The respective SS IDs <b>302</b> each corresponds to respective SSs and each of the one or more RBs <b>320</b> includes one or more respective subcarriers. The SS decodes the CCFI (which is located in a protocol dependent field (not shown) of the downlink shared control channel <b>300</b>) to determine a candidate set for a search procedure of the one or more control channel symbols (i.e., to determine how many symbols are in the downlink shared control channel <b>300</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, in block <b>708</b>, the one or more control channel symbols are searched (using, for example, a blind search procedure of the downlink shared control channel <b>300</b>) to detect an associated downlink control channel <b>312</b> for the SS (identified by a unique identifier assigned to the SS). The associated downlink control channel <b>312</b> for the SS includes an SS ID <b>302</b> for the SS.

Entries of the RB map are then searched for the SS ID <b>302</b> based on the respective indicators <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>. Finally, in block <b>712</b>, assigned ones of the RBs <b>320</b> for the SS are identified by the SS based on the RB map and the SS ID <b>302</b>, such that the SS may receive downlink information in the assigned ones of the RBs <b>320</b>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a shared multiple input multiple output (MIMO) control channel is employed to further reduce scheduling overhead (at a scheduler) and search time (at an SS). In one embodiment, entries in a shared MIMO control channel are associated with respective resource blocks of the transmission channel, which may be arranged in a predefined index sequence. In another embodiment, entries in a shared MIMO control channel are associated with entries in a shared resource block (RB) mapping channel. According to one embodiment, a subscriber station (SS) first decodes an associated control channel to determine an RB assignment and non-MIMO related control information. The SS then utilizes the RB assignment to decode RB specific MIMO control information for each assigned RB. According to at least one embodiment, the MIMO control information (e.g., a precoding matrix index, assigned layer information, transmission rank information) for each RB is encoded in a shared MIMO control channel, whose sequence corresponds to a predefined index sequence or a sequence utilized in an RB map provided in a shared RB mapping channel. As the MIMO control information is mapped according to a predefined index sequence or the RB map sequence, the number of bits required to provide MIMO control information to an SS is generally reduced. For RBs that do not utilize a MIMO mode (e.g., RBs that utilized SIMO mode), an indicator may be transmitted in the RB map that indicates an associated RB is not a MIMO RB.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an example process <b>800</b> for resource block (RB) mapping and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) control information scheduling is depicted. The scheduler may be a network scheduler (e.g., the BSC <b>512</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) or may be incorporated within a serving base station (BS), e.g., the BTS <b>514</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In block <b>802</b>, the process <b>800</b> is initiated, at which point control transfers to block <b>804</b>, where a scheduler assigns the subscriber station identifications (SS IDs) <b>302</b> to respective SSs.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, in block <b>806</b> respective indicators (e.g., the indicators <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are scheduled based on the number of SSs assigned to each of the RBs <b>320</b>. For example, if three SSs are assigned to each of the RBs <b>320</b> in a MU-MIMO mode, the respective indicators may include two bits for at least some of the RBs <b>320</b> (e.g., RBs that have more than one assigned SS). In one embodiment, at least one of the respective indicators includes one bit and remaining ones of the respective indicators includes multiple bits. In another embodiment, the respective indicators include one bit when none or one of the SSs are assigned to an associated one of the one or more RBs <b>320</b> and two or more bits when two or more of the SSs are assigned to an associated one of the one or more RBs <b>320</b>. In another embodiment, the respective indicators each include multiple bits.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Then, in block <b>808</b>, a control channel format indicator (CCFI) is scheduled in a first one of the one or more control channel symbols. The CCFI (not shown) provides an indication of a number of symbols in the shared downlink control channel <b>300</b>, which an SS decodes to determine the number of symbols that is to be searched (using, for example, a blind search procedure) for an associated downlink control channel <b>312</b>. Next, in block <b>810</b>, an RB map is created by associating respective SS IDs <b>302</b>, corresponding to respective SSs, with one or more of the RBs <b>320</b>. In a typical case each of the RBs <b>320</b> includes one or more respective subcarriers, e.g., twelve subcarriers. Following block <b>810</b>, in block <b>812</b>, a MIMO control packet is created by associating MIMO control information with related information in the RB map or to a predefined index sequence. That is, in one embodiment, the MIMO control information is sequenced according to the RBs <b>320</b> in the RB map and in another embodiment the MIMO control information is sequenced according to a predefined index sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Then, in block <b>814</b>, the serving BS transmits the respective SS IDs <b>302</b>, the RB map, and the MIMO control information in one or more control channel symbols. In one or more embodiments, the SS IDs <b>302</b> are transmitted in respective downlink control channels <b>312</b> of the respective SSs, the RB map is transmitted in a shared RB mapping channel <b>310</b>, and the MIMO control packet is transmitted in a shared MIMO control channel. The one or more control channel symbols may include an assigned uplink, an assigned downlink, or both the assigned uplink and downlink for the respective SSs. The one or more control channel symbols may be, for example, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a process <b>900</b> is illustrated that is employed by an SS to determine assigned RBs and related MIMO control information. The process <b>900</b> is similar to the process <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In block <b>902</b> the process <b>900</b> is initiated, at which point control transfers to block <b>904</b>. In block <b>904</b>, one or more control channel symbols are received at an SS. The one or more control channel symbols include respective SS IDs (located in associated downlink control channels <b>312</b>), a control channel format indicator (CCFI), a shared RB map (which associates the respective SS IDs <b>302</b> with one or more RBs <b>320</b>) and a MIMO control packet, among other information. The respective SS IDs <b>302</b> each corresponds to respective SSs and each of the one or more RBs <b>320</b> includes one or more respective subcarriers. The SS decodes the CCFI to determine a candidate set for a search procedure of the one or more control channel symbols (i.e., to determine how many symbols are in the downlink shared control channel <b>300</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, in block <b>908</b>, the one or more control channel symbols are searched (using, for example, a blind search procedure) to detect an associated one of the downlink control channels <b>312</b> for the SS.

Then, in block <b>910</b>, respective indicators (e.g., the indicators <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>) associated with the one or more RBs <b>320</b> in the RB map are decoded to determine a total number of the respective SSs assigned to an associated one of the one or more RBs <b>320</b>. Entries of the RB map are then searched for the SS ID <b>302</b> based on the respective indicators. Next, in block <b>912</b>, assigned RBs of the SS are identified by the SS based on the RB map and the SS ID <b>302</b>, such that the SS may receive downlink information in assigned ones of the RBs <b>320</b>. Then, in block <b>914</b>, associated MIMO control information is identified based on the RB map (as the MIMO control information is sequenced according to the RBs <b>320</b> in the RB map). In another embodiment, in block <b>914</b>, associated MIMO control information is identified by the subscriber station for its assigned resource block, where the RB assignment is done by some other mechanism instead of the RB map. Following block <b>914</b>, the process <b>900</b> terminates in block <b>916</b>.</p>
