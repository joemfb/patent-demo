<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/931,660, filed Feb. 7, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61/337,769, filed Feb. 8, 2010 and 61/403,916, filed Sep. 23, 2010, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT OF RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS MADE UNDER FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure is in the fields of polypeptide and genome engineering and homologous recombination.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Artificial nucleases, such as zinc finger nucleases (fusions of zinc finger domains and cleavage domains) for targeted cleavage of genomic DNA have been described. Such targeted cleavage events can be used, for example, to induce targeted mutagenesis, induce targeted deletions of cellular DNA sequences, and facilitate targeted recombination at a predetermined chromosomal locus. See, for example, United States Patent Publications 20030232410; 20050208489; 20050026157; 20050064474; 20060188987; 20060063231; and International Publication WO 07/014,275, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To increase specificity, a pair of fusion proteins, each comprising a zinc finger binding domain and cleavage half-domain can be used to cleave the target genomic DNA. Because cleavage does not occur unless the cleavage half-domains associate to form a functional dimer, this arrangement increases specificity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To further decrease off-target cleavage events, engineered cleavage half-domains, for example domains that form obligate heterodimers, have also been developed. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0131963. However, there remains a need for additional engineered cleavage half-domains with increased activity and decreased off-target cleavage activity.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides engineered cleavage half-domains that exhibit enhanced activity and specificity as compared to wild-type cleavage domains and/or previously described engineered cleavage half-domains. Also described are complexes (e.g., heterodimers) and fusion proteins comprising these engineered cleavage half-domains. The disclosure also provides methods of using these compositions for targeted cleavage of cellular chromatin in a region of interest and/or homologous recombination at a predetermined region of interest in cells.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, in one aspect, described herein is an engineered cleavage half-domain comprising two or more mutations as compared to the parental wild-type cleavage domain from which they are derived. In certain embodiments, the engineered cleavage half-domains are derived from FokI and comprise a mutation in two or more of amino acid residues 418, 432, 441, 481, 483, 486, 487, 490, 496, 499, 523, 527, 537, 538 and/or 559, numbered relative to a wild-type FokI cleavage half-domain. In one embodiment, the engineered cleavage half-domain is derived from a wild-type FokI cleavage domain and comprises mutations in amino acid residues 486, 499 and 496, numbered relative to wild-type FokI. In another embodiment, the engineered cleavage half-domain comprises mutations in amino acid residues 490, 538 and 537, numbered relative to wild-type FokI. In another embodiment, the engineered cleavage half domains are derived from a wild-type FokI cleavage domain and comprise mutations in the amino acid residues 487, 499 and 496, numbered relative to wild-type FokI. In one embodiment, the engineered cleavage half domains are derived from a wild-type FokI cleavage domain and comprise mutations in the amino acid residues 483, 538 and 537, numbered relative to wild-type FokI. In still further embodiments, the engineered cleavage half-domain comprises mutations in the amino acid residues 490 and 537.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The engineered cleavage half-domains described herein can form heterodimers with wild-type cleavage half-domains and/or with other engineered cleavage half-domains. In certain embodiments, the engineered cleavage half-domain comprises mutations at positions 486, 499 and 496 (numbered relative to wild-type FokI), for instance mutations that replace the wild-type Gln (Q) residue at position 486 with a Glu (E) residue, the wild-type Iso (I) residue at position 499 with a Leu (L) residue and the wild-type Asn (N) residue at position 496 with an Asp (D) or Glu (E) residue (also referred to as a &#x201c;ELD&#x201d; and &#x201c;ELE&#x201d; domains, respectively). In other embodiments, the engineered cleavage half-domain comprises mutations at positions 490, 538 and 537 (numbered relative to wild-type FokI), for instance mutations that replace the wild-type Glu (E) residue at position 490 with a Lys (K) residue, the wild-type Iso (I) residue at position 538 with a Lys (K) residue, and the wild-type His (H) residue at position 537 with a Lys (K) residue or a Arg (R) residue (also referred to as &#x201c;KKK&#x201d; and &#x201c;KKR&#x201d; domains, respectively). In other embodiments, the engineered cleavage half-domain comprises mutations at positions 490 and 537 (numbered relative to wild-type FokI), for instance mutations that replace the wild-type Glu (E) residue at position 490 with a Lys (K) residue and the wild-type His (H) residue at position 537 with a Lys (K) residue or a Arg (R) residue (also referred to as &#x201c;KIK&#x201d; and &#x201c;KIR&#x201d; domains, respectively). In still further embodiments, the engineered cleavage half-domain comprises mutations at positions 487 and 496 (numbered relative to wild-type FokI), for instance mutations that replace the wild-type Arg (R) residue at position 487 with an Asp (D) residue and the wild-type Asn (N) residue at position 496 with an Asp (D) residue (also referred to as &#x201c;DD&#x201d;) and/or mutations at positions 483 and 537 (numbered relative to wild-type FokI), for instance, mutations that replace the wild-type Asp (D) residue at position 483 with an Arg (R) residue and the wild-type His (H) residue at position 537 with an Arg (R) residue (also referred to as &#x201c;RR&#x201d;). In other embodiments, the engineered cleavage half-domain comprises mutations at positions 487, 499 and 496 (numbered relative to wild-type FokI), for instance mutations that replace the wild-type Arg (R) residue at position 487 with an Asp (D) residue and the wild-type Ile (I) residue at position 499 with an Ala (A) and the wild-type Asn (N) residue at position 496 with an Asp (D) residue (also referred to as &#x201c;DAD&#x201d;) and/or mutations at positions 483, 538 and 537 (numbered relative to wild-type FokI), for instance, mutations that replace the wild-type Asp (D) residue at position 483 with an Arg (R) residue and the wild-type Ile (I) residue at position 538 with a Val (V) residue, and the wild-type His (H) residue at position 537 with an Arg (R) residue (also referred to as &#x201c;RVR&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the engineered cleavage half domains may be further engineered to contain mutations in domain of the FokI other than the dimerization domain. For example, mutations at positions 418, 432, 441, 481, 523, 527 and 559 have been shown to increase the catalytic activity of a wild-type FokI domain. In particular, the mutations where Pro (P) replaces the wild-type Ser (S) residue at position 418 and where a Glu (E) residue replaces the wild-type Lys (K) residue at position 441 (known as &#x201c;PE&#x201d;, also known as &#x201c;Sharkey&#x201d;) have been shown to enhance catalytic activity (see Guo et al (2010) <i>J. Mol Biol</i>, doi:10.101b/j.jmb.2010.04.060). In another aspect, the mutations where Pro (P) replaces the wild-type Ser (S) at position 418, where Leu (L) replaces the wild-type Phe (F) at position 432, where Glu (E) replaces the wild-type Lys (K) at position 441, where His (H) replaces the wild-type Gln (Q) at position 481, where Tyr (Y) replaces the wild-type His (H) at position 523, where Asp (D) replaces the wild-type Asn (N) at position 527 and Gln (Q) replaces the wild-type Lys (K) at position 559 (known as &#x201c;Sharkey&#x201d;, see Guo et al, ibid).

In particular, the mutations may include mutation of the wild-type Gln (Q) at position 486 with Glu (E), mutation of the wild-type Ile (I) at position 499 with a Leu (L), mutation of the wild-type Asn (N) at position 496 with an Asp (D), mutation of the wild-type Ser (S) at position 418 with a Pro (P) and mutation of the wild-type Lys (K) at position 441 with a Glu (E) (also known as &#x201c;ELD-S&#x201d; or &#x201c;ELD Sharkey&#x201d;) and/or mutation of the wild-type Glu (E) at position 490 with a Lys (K), mutation of the wild-type Ile (I) at position 538 with a Lys (K), mutation of the wild-type His (H) at position 537 with an Lys (K) or Arg (R), mutation of the wild-type Ser (S) at position 418 with a Pro (P) and mutation of the wild-type Lys (K) at position 441 with a Glu (E) residue (also known as KKK-S or KKR-S, or KKK-Sharkey or KKR-Sharkey). Further embodiments encompass S418P:F432L:K441E:Q481H:Q486E:N496D:I499L:H523Y:N527D:K559Q, also known as ELD-Sharkey', and S418P:F432L:K441E:Q481H:E490K:H523Y:N527D:H537K or R:I538K:K559Q, also known as KKK-Sharkey' or KKR-Sharkey'.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0029">A fusion protein can be expressed in a cell, e.g., by delivering the fusion protein to the cell or by delivering a polynucleotide encoding the fusion protein to a cell, wherein the polynucleotide, if DNA, is transcribed, and an RNA molecule delivered to the cell or a transcript of a DNA molecule delivered to the cell is translated, to generate the fusion protein. Methods for polynucleotide and polypeptide delivery to cells are presented elsewhere in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0030">Accordingly, in another aspect, a method for cleaving cellular chromatin in a region of interest can comprise (a) selecting a first sequence in the region of interest; (b) engineering a first DNA binding domain (e.g., zinc finger or TALE DNA binding domain) to bind to the first sequence; (c) expressing a first fusion protein in the cell, the first fusion protein comprising the first DNA-binding domain and a first engineered cleavage half-domain as described herein; and (d) expressing a second fusion protein in the cell, the second fusion protein comprising a second DNA binding domain and a second cleavage half-domain as described herein, wherein the first fusion protein binds to the first sequence, and the second fusion protein binds to a second sequence located between 2 and 50 nucleotides from the first sequence, thereby positioning the engineered cleavage half-domains such that they form a heterodimer, which heterodimer cleaves cellular chromatin in the region of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0031">In other embodiments, any of the methods described herein may comprise (a) selecting first and second sequences in a region of interest, wherein the first and second sequences are between 2 and 50 nucleotides apart; (b) engineering a first DNA binding domain (e.g., zinc finger or TALE DNA binding domain) to bind to the first sequence; (c) engineering a second zinc finger binding domain to bind to the second sequence; (d) expressing a first fusion protein in the cell, the first fusion protein comprising the first DNA-binding domain and a first cleavage half-domain as described herein; (e) expressing a second fusion protein in the cell, the second fusion protein comprising the second DNA binding domain (e.g., engineered zinc finger or TALE DNA binding domain) and a second cleavage half-domain as described herein; wherein the first fusion protein binds to the first sequence and the second fusion protein binds to the second sequence, thereby positioning the first and second engineered cleavage half-domains such that they form a heterodimer which cleaves the cellular chromatin in the region of interest.

<p id="p-0023" num="0033">Also provided are methods of altering a region of cellular chromatin, for example to introduce targeted mutations. In certain embodiments, methods of altering cellular chromatin comprise introducing into the cell one or more targeted nucleases to create a double-stranded break in cellular chromatin at a predetermined site, and a donor polynucleotide, having homology to the nucleotide sequence of the cellular chromatin in the region of the break. Cellular DNA repair processes are activated by the presence of the double-stranded break and the donor polynucleotide is used as a template for repair of the break, resulting in the introduction of all or part of the nucleotide sequence of the donor into the cellular chromatin. Thus, a sequence in cellular chromatin can be altered and, in certain embodiments, can be converted into a sequence present in a donor polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0034">Targeted alterations include, but are not limited to, point mutations (i.e., conversion of a single base pair to a different base pair), substitutions (i.e., conversion of a plurality of base pairs to a different sequence of identical length), insertions or one or more base pairs, deletions of one or more base pairs and any combination of the aforementioned sequence alterations.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0035">The donor polynucleotide can be DNA or RNA, can be linear or circular, and can be single-stranded or double-stranded. It can be delivered to the cell as naked nucleic acid, as a complex with one or more delivery agents (e.g., liposomes, poloxamers) or contained in a viral delivery vehicle, such as, for example, an adenovirus or an adeno-associated Virus (AAV). Donor sequences can range in length from 10 to 1,000 nucleotides (or any integral value of nucleotides therebetween) or longer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0036">In certain embodiments, the frequency of homologous recombination can be enhanced by arresting the cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and/or by activating the expression of one or more molecules (protein, RNA) involved in homologous recombination and/or by inhibiting the expression or activity of proteins involved in non-homologous end-joining.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0037">In any of the methods described herein, the second zinc finger binding domain may be engineered to bind to the second sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0038">Furthermore, in any of the methods described herein, the fusion proteins may be encoded by a single polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0039">For any of the aforementioned methods, the cellular chromatin can be in a chromosome, episome or organellar genome. Cellular chromatin can be present in any type of cell including, but not limited to, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, fungal cells, plant cells, animal cells, mammalian cells, primate cells and human cells.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0040">In some aspects, the methods provide for organisms comprising fusion proteins with conditional FokI activity comprising the mutations described herein. In some embodiments, these organisms are plants. These methods also relate to the tissues of such plants including seeds.</p>

Following ZFN induction, the activity of the mutants was determined and reported as a fraction of the wild-type ZFN. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows mutant ZFN expression as monitored by western blot using the anti-FLAG antibody. To verify equal protein loading an anti-Histone 3 (anti-H3) antibody western blot was performed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, panels A and B, depict the activity of the ZFN variants ELD:KKK and ELD:KKR in the 53BPI-specific ZFN background. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> depicts the activity of the 53BPI-specific ZFN variant constructs that were nucleofected in K562 cells. The cells were harvested 3 days post-transfection. Two cultures of each combination were assayed (e.g. EL/KK 5 and 6). The Cel-1 assay (Surveyor&#x2122;, Transgenomic) was used to determine the frequency of ZFN-induced insertions and deletions (% indels), shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> at the bottom of each lane. ZFN-induced indels are a consequence of a double strand break (DSB) as a result of ZFN cleavage of the DNA, which is then followed by repair by the cell using the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) process, which can insert or delete small portions of DNA at the break site during repair. Arrows indicate expected sizes of bands following Cel-1 cleavage. An aliquot of the cells was also cultivated for an additional week to determine the stability of the modified cells in extended cultures (Day 10). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> depicts ZFN expression as monitored by western blot using the anti-FLAG antibody.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0065">Disclosed herein are engineered cleavage half-domains and fusion polypeptides comprising these engineered cleavage half-domains useful for targeted cleavage of cellular chromatin and for targeted alteration of a cellular nucleotide sequence, e.g., by targeted cleavage followed by non-homologous end joining or by targeted cleavage followed by homologous recombination between an exogenous polynucleotide (comprising one or more regions of homology with the cellular nucleotide sequence) and a genomic sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0066">Exemplary engineered cleavage half-domains are shown in Table 4. The variants include mutations such that they form heterodimers with each other, but not homodimers. This increases the specificity of DNA cleavage and/or increases the concentration of the intended complex (by reducing or eliminating competition from homodimers). When incorporated into zinc finger nuclease fusion proteins, these variants induce gene modification at the intended target (both at an endogenous locus and when tested using an integrated GFP reporter assay) while significantly reducing genome wide DNA cleavage as compared to wild-type cleavage half-domains.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0067">Thus, the engineered cleavage half-domains described herein significantly impair homodimer function, since forcing two copies of the same variant to interact reduces or abolishes gene modification. Reduced homodimer function provides improved ZFN cleavage specificity in vivo, without any decrease in either ZFN expression or the ability to stimulate modification of the desired target site.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0068">In addition, disclosed herein are engineered cleavage half-domains with conditional activity. These conditional mutants can act either as homodimers or heterodimers, depending on the design. In certain embodiments, conditional activity refers to a change in cleavage activity based on temperature. Thus, these conditional mutants can be used in the development of cell lines or whole organisms such as plants wherein cleavage activity can be induced by the investigator at certain temperatures while being held in abeyance at other temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0069">General</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0070">Practice of the methods, as well as preparation and use of the compositions disclosed herein employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques in molecular biology, biochemistry, chromatin structure and analysis, computational chemistry, cell culture, recombinant DNA and related fields as are within the skill of the art. These techniques are fully explained in the literature. See, for example, Sambrook et al. <smallcaps>MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL</smallcaps>, Second edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989 and Third edition, 2001; Ausubel et al., <smallcaps>CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY</smallcaps>, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, New York, 1987 and periodic updates; the series <smallcaps>METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY</smallcaps>, Academic Press, San Diego; Wolfe, <smallcaps>CHROMATIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION</smallcaps>, Third edition, Academic Press, San Diego, 1998; <smallcaps>METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY</smallcaps>, Vol. 304, &#x201c;Chromatin&#x201d; (P.

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0071">The terms &#x201c;nucleic acid,&#x201d; &#x201c;polynucleotide,&#x201d; and &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to a deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide polymer, in linear or circular conformation, and in either single- or double-stranded form. For the purposes of the present disclosure, these terms are not to be construed as limiting with respect to the length of a polymer. The terms can encompass known analogues of natural nucleotides, as well as nucleotides that are modified in the base, sugar and/or phosphate moieties (e.g., phosphorothioate backbones). In general, an analogue of a particular nucleotide has the same base-pairing specificity; i.e., an analogue of A will base-pair with T.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0072">The terms &#x201c;polypeptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The term also applies to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acids are chemical analogues or modified derivatives of a corresponding naturally-occurring amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0073">&#x201c;Binding&#x201d; refers to a sequence-specific, non-covalent interaction between macromolecules (e.g., between a protein and a nucleic acid). Not all components of a binding interaction need be sequence-specific (e.g., contacts with phosphate residues in a DNA backbone), as long as the interaction as a whole is sequence-specific. Such interactions are generally characterized by a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or lower. &#x201c;Affinity&#x201d; refers to the strength of binding: increased binding affinity being correlated with a lower K<sub>d</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0074">A &#x201c;binding protein&#x201d; is a protein that is able to bind non-covalently to another molecule. A binding protein can bind to, for example, a DNA molecule (a DNA-binding protein), an RNA molecule (an RNA-binding protein) and/or a protein molecule (a protein-binding protein). In the case of a protein-binding protein, it can bind to itself (to form homodimers, homotrimers, etc.) and/or it can bind to one or more molecules of a different protein or proteins. A binding protein can have more than one type of binding activity. For example, zinc finger proteins have DNA-binding, RNA-binding and protein-binding activity.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0075">A &#x201c;zinc finger DNA binding protein&#x201d; (or binding domain) is a protein, or a domain within a larger protein, that binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner through one or more zinc fingers, which are regions of amino acid sequence within the binding domain whose structure is stabilized through coordination of a zinc ion. The term zinc finger DNA binding protein is often abbreviated as zinc finger protein or ZFP.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0076">Zinc finger binding domains can be &#x201c;engineered&#x201d; to bind to a predetermined nucleotide sequence. Non-limiting examples of methods for engineering zinc finger proteins are design and selection. A designed zinc finger protein is a protein not occurring in nature whose design/composition results principally from rational criteria. Rational criteria for design include application of substitution rules and computerized algorithms for processing information in a database storing information of existing ZFP designs and binding data. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,140,081; 6,453,242; and 6,534,261; see also WO 98/53058; WO 98/53059; WO 98/53060; WO 02/016536 and WO 03/016496.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0077">A &#x201c;selected&#x201d; zinc finger protein is a protein not found in nature whose production results primarily from an empirical process such as phage display, interaction trap or hybrid selection. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,538; U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,523; U.S. Pat. No. 6,007,988; U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,453; U.S. Pat. No. 6,200,759; WO 95/19431; WO 96/06166; WO 98/53057; WO 98/54311; WO 00/27878; WO 01/60970 WO 01/88197 and WO 02/099084.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0078">The term &#x201c;sequence&#x201d; refers to a nucleotide sequence of any length, which can be DNA or RNA; can be linear, circular or branched and can be either single-stranded or double stranded. The term &#x201c;donor sequence&#x201d; refers to a nucleotide sequence that is inserted into a genome. A donor sequence can be of any length, for example between 2 and 10,000 nucleotides in length (or any integer value therebetween or thereabove), preferably between about 100 and 1,000 nucleotides in length (or any integer therebetween), more preferably between about 200 and 500 nucleotides in length.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0079">A &#x201c;homologous, non-identical sequence&#x201d; refers to a first sequence which shares a degree of sequence identity with a second sequence, but whose sequence is not identical to that of the second sequence. For example, a polynucleotide comprising the wild-type sequence of a mutant gene is homologous and non-identical to the sequence of the mutant gene. In certain embodiments, the degree of homology between the two sequences is sufficient to allow homologous recombination therebetween, utilizing normal cellular mechanisms. Two homologous non-identical sequences can be any length and their degree of non-homology can be as small as a single nucleotide (e.g., for correction of a genomic point mutation by targeted homologous recombination) or as large as 10 or more kilobases (e.g., for insertion of a gene at a predetermined ectopic site in a chromosome). Two polynucleotides comprising the homologous non-identical sequences need not be the same length. For example, an exogenous polynucleotide (i.e., donor polynucleotide) of between 20 and 10,000 nucleotides or nucleotide pairs can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0080">Techniques for determining nucleic acid and amino acid sequence identity are known in the art. Typically, such techniques include determining the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA for a gene and/or determining the amino acid sequence encoded thereby, and comparing these sequences to a second nucleotide or amino acid sequence. Genomic sequences can also be determined and compared in this fashion. In general, identity refers to an exact nucleotide-to-nucleotide or amino acid-to-amino acid correspondence of two polynucleotides or polypeptide sequences, respectively. Two or more sequences (polynucleotide or amino acid) can be compared by determining their percent identity. The percent identity of two sequences, whether nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, is the number of exact matches between two aligned sequences divided by the length of the shorter sequences and multiplied by 100. Typically the percent identities between sequences are at least 70-75%, preferably 80-82%, more preferably 85-90%, even more preferably 92%, still more preferably 95%, and most preferably 98% sequence identity.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0081">Alternatively, the degree of sequence similarity between polynucleotides can be determined by hybridization of polynucleotides under conditions that allow formation of stable duplexes between homologous regions, followed by digestion with single-stranded-specific nuclease(s), and size determination of the digested fragments. Two nucleic acid, or two polypeptide sequences are substantially homologous to each other when the sequences exhibit at least about 70%-75%, preferably 80%-82%, more preferably 85%-90%, even more preferably 92%, still more preferably 95%, and most preferably 98% sequence identity over a defined length of the molecules, as determined using the methods above. As used herein, substantially homologous also refers to sequences showing complete identity to a specified DNA or polypeptide sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0082">&#x201c;Recombination&#x201d; refers to a process of exchange of genetic information between two polynucleotides. For the purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;homologous recombination (HR)&#x201d; refers to the specialized form of such exchange that takes place, for example, during repair of double-strand breaks in cells. This process requires nucleotide sequence homology, uses a &#x201c;donor&#x201d; molecule to template repair of a &#x201c;target&#x201d; molecule (i.e., the one that experienced the double-strand break), and is variously known as &#x201c;non-crossover gene conversion&#x201d; or &#x201c;short tract gene conversion,&#x201d; because it leads to the transfer of genetic information from the donor to the target. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, such transfer can involve mismatch correction of heteroduplex DNA that forms between the broken target and the donor, and/or &#x201c;synthesis-dependent strand annealing,&#x201d; in which the donor is used to resynthesize genetic information that will become part of the target, and/or related processes. Such specialized HR often results in an alteration of the sequence of the target molecule such that part or all of the sequence of the donor polynucleotide is incorporated into the target polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0083">&#x201c;Cleavage&#x201d; refers to the breakage of the covalent backbone of a DNA molecule. Cleavage can be initiated by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond. Both single-stranded cleavage and double-stranded cleavage are possible, and double-stranded cleavage can occur as a result of two distinct single-stranded cleavage events. DNA cleavage can result in the production of either blunt ends or staggered ends. In certain embodiments, fusion polypeptides are used for targeted double-stranded DNA cleavage.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0084">A &#x201c;cleavage half-domain&#x201d; is a polypeptide sequence which, in conjunction with a second polypeptide (either identical or different) forms a complex having cleavage activity (preferably double-strand cleavage activity). The terms &#x201c;first and second cleavage half-domains;&#x201d; &#x201c;+ and &#x2212; cleavage half-domains&#x201d; and &#x201c;right and left cleavage half-domains&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to pairs of cleavage half-domains that dimerize.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0085">An &#x201c;engineered cleavage half-domain&#x201d; is a cleavage half-domain that has been modified so as to form obligate heterodimers with another cleavage half-domain (e.g., another engineered cleavage half-domain).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0086">A &#x201c;conditional mutation&#x201d; is a mutation that has wild-type cleavage activity under certain permissive environmental conditions and a mutant cleavage, activity under certain restrictive conditions. Conditional mutations may be cold sensitive, where the mutation results in an altered cleavage activity at cooler temperatures, but upon exposure to warmer temperatures, the cleavage activity returns more or less to wild-type. Conversely, conditional mutations may be heat sensitive (often termed &#x201c;thermosensitive&#x201d;) where the wild type cleavage activity is seen at cooler temperatures but becomes altered upon exposure to warmer temperatures. Altered cleavage activity may be manifested as either increased or decreased activity.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0087">&#x201c;Chromatin&#x201d; is the nucleoprotein structure comprising the cellular genome. Cellular chromatin comprises nucleic acid, primarily DNA, and protein, including histones and non-histone chromosomal proteins. The majority of eukaryotic cellular chromatin exists in the form of nucleosomes, wherein a nucleosome core comprises approximately 150 base pairs of DNA associated with an octamer comprising two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4; and linker DNA (of variable length depending on the organism) extends between nucleosome cores. A molecule of histone H1 is generally associated with the linker DNA. For the purposes of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;chromatin&#x201d; is meant to encompass all types of cellular nucleoprotein, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Cellular chromatin includes both chromosomal and episomal chromatin.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0088">A &#x201c;chromosome,&#x201d; is a chromatin complex comprising all or a portion of the genome of a cell. The genome of a cell is often characterized by its karyotype, which is the collection of all the chromosomes that comprise the genome of the cell. The genome of a cell can comprise one or more chromosomes.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0089">An &#x201c;episome&#x201d; is a replicating nucleic acid, nucleoprotein complex or other structure comprising a nucleic acid that is not part of the chromosomal karyotype of a cell. Examples of episomes include plasmids and certain viral genomes.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0090">An &#x201c;accessible region&#x201d; is a site in cellular chromatin in which a target site present in the nucleic acid can be bound by an exogenous molecule which recognizes the target site. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that an accessible region is one that is not packaged into a nucleosomal structure. The distinct structure of an accessible region can often be detected by its sensitivity to chemical and enzymatic probes, for example, nucleases.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0091">A &#x201c;target site&#x201d; or &#x201c;target sequence&#x201d; is a nucleic acid sequence that defines a portion of a nucleic acid to which a binding molecule will bind, provided sufficient conditions for binding exist. For example, the sequence 5&#x2032;-GAATTC-3&#x2032; is a target site for the Eco RI restriction endonuclease.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0092">An &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; molecule is a molecule that is not normally present in a cell, but can be introduced into a cell by one or more genetic, biochemical or other methods. &#x201c;Normal presence in the cell&#x201d; is determined with respect to the particular developmental stage and environmental conditions of the cell. Thus, for example, a molecule that is present only during embryonic development of muscle is an exogenous molecule with respect to an adult muscle cell. Similarly, a molecule induced by heat shock is an exogenous molecule with respect to a non-heat-shocked cell. An exogenous molecule can comprise, for example, a functioning version of a malfunctioning endogenous molecule or a malfunctioning version of a normally-functioning endogenous molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0093">An exogenous molecule can be, among other things, a small molecule, such as is generated by a combinatorial chemistry process, or a macromolecule such as a protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, lipid, glycoprotein, lipoprotein, polysaccharide, any modified derivative of the above molecules, or any complex comprising one or more of the above molecules. Nucleic acids include DNA and RNA, can be single- or double-stranded; can be linear, branched or circular; and can be of any length. Nucleic acids include those capable of forming duplexes, as well as triplex-forming nucleic acids. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,176,996 and 5,422,251. Proteins include, but are not limited to, DNA-binding proteins, transcription factors, chromatin remodeling factors, methylated DNA binding proteins, polymerases, methylases, demethylases, acetylases, deacetylases, kinases, phosphatases, integrases, recombinases, ligases, topoisomerases, gyrases and helicases.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0094">An exogenous molecule can be the same type of molecule as an endogenous molecule, e.g., an exogenous protein or nucleic acid. For example, an exogenous nucleic acid can comprise an infecting viral genome, a plasmid or episome introduced into a cell, or a chromosome that is not normally present in the cell. Methods for the introduction of exogenous molecules into cells are known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, lipid-mediated transfer (i.e., liposomes, including neutral and cationic lipids), electroporation, direct injection, cell fusion, particle bombardment, calcium phosphate co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfer and viral vector-mediated transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0095">By contrast, an &#x201c;endogenous&#x201d; molecule is one that is normally present in a particular cell at a particular developmental stage under particular environmental conditions. For example, an endogenous nucleic acid can comprise a chromosome, the genome of a mitochondrion, chloroplast or other organelle, or a naturally-occurring episomal nucleic acid. Additional endogenous molecules can include proteins, for example, transcription factors and enzymes.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0096">A &#x201c;fusion&#x201d; molecule is a molecule in which two or more subunit molecules are linked, preferably covalently. The subunit molecules can be the same chemical type of molecule, or can be different chemical types of molecules. Examples of the first type of fusion molecule include, but are not limited to, fusion proteins (for example, a fusion between a ZFP DNA-binding domain and a cleavage domain) and fusion nucleic acids (for example, a nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein described supra). Examples of the second type of fusion molecule include, but are not limited to, a fusion between a triplex-forming nucleic acid and a polypeptide, and a fusion between a minor groove binder and a nucleic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0097">Expression of a fusion protein in a cell can result from delivery of the fusion protein to the cell or by delivery of a polynucleotide encoding the fusion protein to a cell, wherein the polynucleotide is transcribed, and the transcript is translated, to generate the fusion protein. Trans-splicing, polypeptide cleavage and polypeptide ligation can also be involved in expression of a protein in a cell. Methods for polynucleotide and polypeptide delivery to cells are presented elsewhere in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0098">A &#x201c;gene,&#x201d; for the purposes of the present disclosure, includes a DNA region encoding a gene product (see infra), as well as all DNA regions which regulate the production of the gene product, whether or not such regulatory sequences are adjacent to coding and/or transcribed sequences. Accordingly, a gene includes, but is not necessarily limited to, promoter sequences, terminators, translational regulatory sequences such as ribosome binding sites and internal ribosome entry sites, enhancers, silencers, insulators, boundary elements, replication origins, matrix attachment sites and locus control regions.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0099">&#x201c;Gene expression&#x201d; refers to the conversion of the information, contained in a gene, into a gene product. A gene product can be the direct transcriptional product of a gene (e.g., mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, antisense RNA, ribozyme, structural RNA or any other type of RNA) or a protein produced by translation of an mRNA. Gene products also include RNAs which are modified, by processes such as capping, polyadenylation, methylation, and editing, and proteins modified by, for example, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, ADP-ribosylation, myristilation, and glycosylation.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0100">&#x201c;Modulation&#x201d; of gene expression refers to a change in the activity of a gene. Modulation of expression can include, but is not limited to, gene activation and gene repression.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0101">&#x201c;Eukaryotic&#x201d; cells include, but are not limited to, fungal cells (such as yeast), plant cells, animal cells, mammalian cells and human cells.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0102">A &#x201c;region of interest&#x201d; is any region of cellular chromatin, such as, for example, a gene or a non-coding sequence within or adjacent to a gene, in which it is desirable to bind an exogenous molecule. Binding can be for the purposes of targeted DNA cleavage and/or targeted recombination. A region of interest can be present in a chromosome, an episome, an organellar genome (e.g., mitochondrial, chloroplast), or an infecting viral genome, for example. A region of interest can be within the coding region of a gene, within transcribed non-coding regions such as, for example, leader sequences, trailer sequences or introns, or within non-transcribed regions, either upstream or downstream of the coding region. A region of interest can be as small as a single nucleotide pair or up to 2,000 nucleotide pairs in length, or any integral value of nucleotide pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0103">The terms &#x201c;operative linkage&#x201d; and &#x201c;operatively linked&#x201d; (or &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d;) are used interchangeably with reference to a juxtaposition of two or more components (such as sequence elements), in which the components are arranged such that both components function normally and allow the possibility that at least one of the components can mediate a function that is exerted upon at least one of the other components. By way of illustration, a transcriptional regulatory sequence, such as a promoter, is operatively linked to a coding sequence if the transcriptional regulatory sequence controls the level of transcription of the coding sequence in response to the presence or absence of one or more transcriptional regulatory factors. A transcriptional regulatory sequence is generally operatively linked in cis with a coding sequence, but need not be directly adjacent to it. For example, an enhancer is a transcriptional regulatory sequence that is operatively linked to a coding sequence, even though they are not contiguous.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0104">With respect to fusion polypeptides, the term &#x201c;operatively linked&#x201d; can refer to the fact that each of the components performs the same function in linkage to the other component as it would if it were not so linked. For example, with respect to a fusion polypeptide in which a ZFP DNA-binding domain is fused to a cleavage domain, the ZFP DNA-binding domain and the cleavage domain are in operative linkage if, in the fusion polypeptide, the ZFP DNA-binding domain portion is able to bind its target site and/or its binding site, while the cleavage domain is able to cleave DNA in the vicinity of the target site.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0105">A &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d; of a protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid is a protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid whose sequence is not identical to the full-length protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid, yet retains the same function as the full-length protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid. A functional fragment can possess more, fewer, or the same number of residues as the corresponding native molecule, and/or can contain one or more amino acid or nucleotide substitutions. Methods for determining the function of a nucleic acid (e.g., coding function, ability to hybridize to another nucleic acid) are well-known in the art. Similarly, methods for determining protein function are well-known. For example, the DNA-binding function of a polypeptide can be determined, for example, by filter-binding, electrophoretic mobility-shift, or immunoprecipitation assays. DNA cleavage can be assayed by gel electrophoresis. See Ausubel et al., supra. The ability of a protein to interact with another protein can be determined, for example, by co-immunoprecipitation, two-hybrid assays or complementation, both genetic and biochemical. See, for example, Fields et al. (1989) <i>Nature </i>340:245-246; U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,245 and PCT WO 98/44350.</p>

In certain embodiments, the cleavage half-domain includes mutations at least three amino acid residues at positions, as compared to wild-type. For example, in certain embodiments, the cleavage half-domain includes mutations at positions 486, 499 and 496.

<p id="p-0114" num="0135">The use of RNA or DNA viral based systems for the delivery of nucleic acids encoding nucleases (e.g., ZFNs or TALENS) comprising engineered cleavage half-domains as described herein take advantage of highly evolved processes for targeting a virus to specific cells in the body and trafficking the viral payload to the nucleus. Viral vectors can be administered directly to patients (in vivo) or they can be used to treat cells in vitro and the modified cells are administered to patients (ex vivo). Conventional viral based systems for the delivery of nucleases as described herein include, but are not limited to, retroviral, lentivirus, adenoviral, adeno-associated, vaccinia and herpes simplex virus vectors for gene transfer. Integration in the host genome is possible with the retrovirus, lentivirus, and adeno-associated virus gene transfer methods, often resulting in long term expression of the inserted transgene. Additionally, high transduction efficiencies have been observed in many different cell types and target tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0136">The tropism of a retrovirus can be altered by incorporating foreign envelope proteins, expanding the potential target population of target cells. Lentiviral vectors are retroviral vectors that are able to transduce or infect non-dividing cells and typically produce high viral titers. Selection of a retroviral gene transfer system depends on the target tissue. Retroviral vectors are comprised of cis-acting long terminal repeats with packaging capacity for up to 6-10 kb of foreign sequence. The minimum cis-acting LTRs are sufficient for replication and packaging of the vectors, which are then used to integrate the therapeutic gene into the target cell to provide permanent transgene expression. Widely used retroviral vectors include those based upon murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV), Simian Immunodeficiency virus (SW), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and combinations thereof (see, e.g., Buchscher et al., <i>J. Virol. </i>66:2731-2739 (1992); Johann et al., <i>J. Virol. </i>66:1635-1640 (1992); Sommerfelt et al., <i>Virol. </i>176:58-59 (1990); Wilson et al., <i>J.

<p id="p-0116" num="0137">In applications in which transient expression of a ZFP fusion protein is preferred, adenoviral based systems can be used. Adenoviral based vectors are capable of very high transduction efficiency in many cell types and do not require cell division. With such vectors, high titer and high levels of expression have been obtained. This vector can be produced in large quantities in a relatively simple system. Adeno-associated virus (&#x201c;AAV&#x201d;) vectors are also used to transduce cells with target nucleic acids, e.g., in the in vitro production of nucleic acids and peptides, and for in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy procedures (see, e.g., West et al., <i>Virology </i>160:38-47 (1987); U.S. Pat.

Also useful are &#x201c;gutless&#x201d; Ad vectors, e.g., an Ad vector in which all adenovirus genes have been removed, to reduce immunogenicity and to increase the size of the DNA payload. This allows, for example, simultaneous delivery of sequences encoding ZFNs and a donor sequence.

(2004) <i>J Gene Med </i>6:631-641; Schroers et al. (2004) <i>Exp Hematol </i>32:536-546; Seshidhar et al. (2003) <i>Virology </i>311:384-393; Shayakhmetov et al. (2000) <i>J Virol </i>74:2567-2583; and Soya et al. (2004), <i>Mol Ther </i>9:496-509.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0147">Packaging cells are used to form virus particles that are capable of infecting a host cell. Such cells include 293 cells, which package adenovirus, and &#x3c8;2 cells or PA317 cells, which package retrovirus. Viral vectors used in gene therapy are usually generated by a producer cell line that packages a nucleic acid vector into a viral particle. The vectors typically contain the minimal viral sequences required for packaging and subsequent integration into a host (if applicable), other viral sequences being replaced by an expression cassette encoding the protein to be expressed. The missing viral functions are supplied in trans by the packaging cell line. For example, AAV vectors used in gene therapy typically only possess inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences from the AAV genome which are required for packaging and integration into the host genome. Viral DNA is packaged in a cell line, which contains a helper plasmid encoding the other AAV genes, namely rep and cap, but lacking ITR sequences. The cell line is also infected with adenovirus as a helper. The helper virus promotes replication of the AAV vector and expression of AAV genes from the helper plasmid. The helper plasmid is not packaged in significant amounts due to a lack of ITR sequences. Contamination with adenovirus can be reduced by, e.g., heat treatment to which adenovirus is more sensitive than AAV.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0148">In many gene therapy applications, it is desirable that the gene therapy vector be delivered with a high degree of specificity to a particular tissue type. Accordingly, a viral vector can be modified to have specificity for a given cell type by expressing a ligand as a fusion protein with a viral coat protein on the outer surface of the virus. The ligand is chosen to have affinity for a receptor known to be present on the cell type of interest. For example, Han et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>92:9747-9751 (1995), reported that Moloney murine leukemia virus can be modified to express human heregulin fused to gp70, and the recombinant virus infects certain human breast cancer cells expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor. This principle can be extended to other virus-target cell pairs, in which the target cell expresses a receptor and the virus expresses a fusion protein comprising a ligand for the cell-surface receptor. For example, filamentous phage can be engineered to display antibody fragments (e.g., FAB or Fv) having specific binding affinity for virtually any chosen cellular receptor. Although the above description applies primarily to viral vectors, the same principles can be applied to nonviral vectors. Such vectors can be engineered to contain specific uptake sequences which favor uptake by specific target cells.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0149">Gene therapy vectors can be delivered in vivo by administration to an individual patient, typically by systemic administration (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subdermal, or intracranial infusion) or topical application, as described below. Alternatively, vectors can be delivered to cells ex vivo, such as cells explanted from an individual patient (e.g., lymphocytes, bone marrow aspirates, tissue biopsy) or universal donor hematopoietic stem cells, followed by reimplantation of the cells into a patient, usually after selection for cells which have incorporated the vector.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0150">Ex vivo cell transfection for diagnostics, research, or for gene therapy (e.g., via re-infusion of the transfected cells into the host organism) is well known to those of skill in the art. In a preferred embodiment, cells are isolated from the subject organism, transfected with a ZFN or TALEN nucleic acid (gene or cDNA), and re-infused back into the subject organism (e.g., patient). Various cell types suitable for ex vivo transfection are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Freshney et al., <i>Culture of Animal Cells, A Manual of Basic Technique </i>(3rd ed. 1994)) and the references cited therein for a discussion of how to isolate and culture cells from patients).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0151">In one embodiment, stem cells are used in ex vivo procedures for cell transfection and gene therapy. The advantage to using stem cells is that they can be differentiated into other cell types in vitro, or can be introduced into a mammal (such as the donor of the cells) where they will engraft in the bone marrow. Methods for differentiating CD34+ cells in vitro into clinically important immune cell types using cytokines such a GM-CSF, IFN-&#x3b3; and TNF-&#x3b1; are known (see Inaba et al., <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>176:1693-1702 (1992)).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0152">Stem cells are isolated for transduction and differentiation using known methods. For example, stem cells are isolated from bone marrow cells by panning the bone marrow cells with antibodies which bind unwanted cells, such as CD4+ and CD8+ (T cells), CD45+ (panB cells), GR-1 (granulocytes), and Iad (differentiated antigen presenting cells) (see Inaba et al., <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>176:1693-1702 (1992)). In some instances, the stem cells are induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0153">Vectors (e.g., retroviruses, adenoviruses, liposomes, etc.) containing therapeutic ZFP or TALE nucleic acids can also be administered directly to an organism for transduction of cells in vivo. Alternatively, naked DNA can be administered. Administration is by any of the routes normally used for introducing a molecule into ultimate contact with blood or tissue cells including, but not limited to, injection, infusion, topical application and electroporation. Suitable methods of administering such nucleic acids are available and well known to those of skill in the art, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular composition, a particular route can often provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0154">Methods for introduction of DNA into hematopoietic stem cells are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,638. Vectors useful for introduction of transgenes into hematopoietic stem cells, e.g., CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, include adenovirus Type 35.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0155">Vectors suitable for introduction of transgenes into immune cells (e.g., T-cells) include non-integrating lentivirus vectors. See, for example, Ory et al. (1996) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>93:11382-11388; Dull et al. (1998) <i>J. Virol. </i>72:8463-8471; Zuffery et al. (1998) <i>J. Virol. </i>72:9873-9880; Follenzi et al. (2000) <i>Nature Genetics </i>25:217-222.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0156">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions available, as described below (see, e.g., <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, </i>17th ed., 1989).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0157">As noted above, the disclosed methods and compositions can be used in any type of cell including, but not limited to, prokaryotic cells, fungal cells, Archaeal cells, plant cells, insect cells, animal cells, vertebrate cells, mammalian cells and human cells. Suitable cell lines for protein expression are known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to COS, CHO (e.g., CHO-S, CHO-K1, CHO-DG44, CHO-DUXB11), VERO, MDCK, WI38, V79, B14AF28-G3, BHK, HaK, NS0, SP2/0-Ag14, HeLa, HEK293 (e.g., HEK293-F, HEK293-H, HEK293-T), perC6, insect cells such as <i>Spodoptera fugiperda </i>(Sf), and fungal cells such as <i>Saccharomyces, Pischia </i>and <i>Schizosaccharomyces</i>. Progeny, variants and derivatives of these cell lines can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0158">Applications</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0159">The disclosed cleavage domains are advantageously used in combination with DNA-binding domains such as zinc finger proteins or TAL binding domains (resulting in ZFNs or TALENs respectively) to cleave DNA and minimize off-target site cleavage (as compared to DNA-binding domains comprising wild-type or homodimerizing cleavage domains). Cleavage can be at one or more region(s) of interest in cellular chromatin (e.g., at a desired or predetermined site in a genome, for example, in a gene, either mutant or wild-type); to replace a genomic sequence (e.g., a region of interest in cellular chromatin) with a homologous non-identical sequence (i.e., targeted recombination); to delete a genomic sequence by cleaving DNA at one or more sites in the genome, which cleavage sites are then joined by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ); to screen for cellular factors that facilitate homologous recombination; and/or to replace a wild-type sequence with a mutant sequence, or to convert one allele to a different allele. Such methods are described in detail, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050064474; International Patent Publication WO 07/014,275, incorporated by reference in their entireties herein.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0160">Accordingly, the disclosed engineered cleavage half domains can be used in any ZFN or TALEN for any method in which specifically targeted cleavage is desirable and/or to replace any genomic sequence with a homologous, non-identical sequence. For example, a mutant genomic sequence can be replaced by its wild-type counterpart, thereby providing methods for treatment of e.g., genetic disease, inherited disorders, cancer, and autoimmune disease. In like fashion, one allele of a gene can be replaced by a different allele using the methods of targeted recombination disclosed herein. Indeed, any pathology dependent upon a particular genomic sequence, in any fashion, can be corrected or alleviated using the methods and compositions disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0161">Exemplary genetic diseases include, but are not limited to, achondroplasia, achromatopsia, acid maltase deficiency, adenosine deaminase deficiency (OMIM No. 102700), adrenoleukodystrophy, aicardi syndrome, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, alpha-thalassemia, androgen insensitivity syndrome, apert syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, dysplasia, ataxia telangictasia, barth syndrome, beta-thalassemia, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, canavan disease, chronic granulomatous diseases (CGD), cri du chat syndrome, cystic fibrosis, dercum's disease, ectodermal dysplasia, fanconi anemia, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive, fragile X syndrome, galactosemis, Gaucher's disease, generalized gangliosidoses (e.g., GM1), hemochromatosis, the hemoglobin C mutation in the 6<sup>th </sup>codon of beta-globin (HbC), hemophilia, Huntington's disease, Hurler Syndrome, hypophosphatasia, Klinefleter syndrome, Krabbes Disease, Langer-Giedion Syndrome, leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD, OMIM No. 116920), leukodystrophy, long QT syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Moebius syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), nail patella syndrome, nephrogenic diabetes insipdius, neurofibromatosis, Neimann-Pick disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, porphyria, Prader-Willi syndrome, progeria, Proteus syndrome, retinoblastoma, Rett syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Sanfilippo syndrome, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Shwachman syndrome, sickle cell disease (sickle cell anemia), Smith-Magenis syndrome, Stickler syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease, Thrombocytopenia Absent Radius (TAR) syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, trisomy, tuberous sclerosis, Turner's syndrome, urea cycle disorder, von Hippel-Landau disease, Waardenburg syndrome, Williams syndrome, Wilson's disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP, OMIM No. 308240).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0162">Additional exemplary diseases that can be treated by targeted DNA cleavage and/or homologous recombination include acquired immunodeficiencies, lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher's disease, GM1, Fabry disease and Tay-Sachs disease), mucopolysaccahidosis (e.g. Hunter's disease, Hurler's disease), hemoglobinopathies (e.g., sickle cell diseases, HbC, &#x3b1;-thalassemia, &#x3b2;-thalassemia) and hemophilias.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0163">Such methods also allow for treatment of infections (viral or bacterial) in a host (e.g., by blocking expression of viral or bacterial receptors, thereby preventing infection and/or spread in a host organism) to treat genetic diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0164">Targeted cleavage of infecting or integrated viral genomes can be used to treat viral infections in a host. Additionally, targeted cleavage of genes encoding receptors for viruses can be used to block expression of such receptors, thereby preventing viral infection and/or viral spread in a host organism. Targeted mutagenesis of genes encoding viral receptors (e.g., the CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors for HIV) can be used to render the receptors unable to bind to virus, thereby preventing new infection and blocking the spread of existing infections. See, U.S. Patent Application No. 2008/015996. Non-limiting examples of viruses or viral receptors that may be targeted include herpes simplex virus (HSV), such as HSV-1 and HSV-2, varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), HHV6 and HHV7. The hepatitis family of viruses includes hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), the delta hepatitis virus (HDV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and hepatitis G virus (HGV). Other viruses or their receptors may be targeted, including, but not limited to, Picornaviridae (e.g., polioviruses, etc.); Caliciviridae; Togaviridae (e.g., rubella virus, dengue virus, etc.); Flaviviridae; Coronaviridae; Reoviridae; Birnaviridae; Rhabodoviridae (e.g., rabies virus, etc.); Filoviridae; Paramyxoviridae (e.g., mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, etc.); Orthomyxoviridae (e.g., influenza virus types A, B and C, etc.); Bunyaviridae; Arenaviridae; Retroviradae; lentiviruses (e.g., HTLV-I; HTLV-II; HIV-1 (also known as HTLV-III, LAV, ARV, hTLR, etc.) HIV-II); simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), influenza virus and the tick-borne encephalitis viruses. See, e.g. Virology, 3rd Edition (W. K. Joklik ed. 1988); Fundamental Virology, 2nd Edition (B. N. Fields and D. M. Knipe, eds. 1991), for a description of these and other viruses. Receptors for HIV, for example, include CCR-5 and CXCR-4.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0165">Thus, heterodimeric cleavage domain variants as described herein provide broad utility for improving ZFN specificity in gene modification applications. These variant cleavage domains may be readily incorporated into any existing ZFN by either site directed mutagenesis or subcloning to improve the in vivo specificity of any ZFN dimers.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0166">As noted above, the compositions and methods described herein can be used for gene modification, gene correction, and gene disruption. Non-limiting examples of gene modification includes homology directed repair (HDR)-based targeted integration; HDR-based gene correction; HDR-based gene modification; HDR-based gene disruption; NHEJ-based gene disruption and/or combinations of HDR, NHEJ, and/or single strand annealing (SSA). Single-Strand Annealing (SSA) refers to the repair of a double strand break between two repeated sequences that occur in the same orientation by resection of the DSB by 5&#x2032;-3&#x2032; exonucleases to expose the 2 complementary regions. The single-strands encoding the 2 direct repeats then anneal to each other, and the annealed intermediate can be processed such that the single-stranded tails (the portion of the single-stranded DNA that is not annealed to any sequence) are be digested away, the gaps filled in by DNA Polymerase, and the DNA ends rejoined. This results in the deletion of sequences located between the direct repeats.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0167">Compositions comprising cleavage domains (e.g., ZFNs) and methods described herein can also be used in the treatment of various genetic diseases and/or infectious diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0168">The compositions and methods can also be applied to stem cell based therapies, including but not limited to: correction of somatic cell mutations by short patch gene conversion or targeted integration for monogenic gene therapy; disruption of dominant negative alleles; disruption of genes required for the entry or productive infection of pathogens into cells; enhanced tissue engineering, for example, by modifying gene activity to promote the differentiation or formation of functional tissues; and/or disrupting gene activity to promote the differentiation or formation of functional tissues; blocking or inducing differentiation, for example, by disrupting genes that block differentiation to promote stem cells to differentiate down a specific lineage pathway, targeted insertion of a gene or siRNA expression cassette that can stimulate stem cell differentiation, targeted insertion of a gene or siRNA expression cassette that can block stem cell differentiation and allow better expansion and maintenance of pluripotency, and/or targeted insertion of a reporter gene in frame with an endogenous gene that is a marker of pluripotency or differentiation state that would allow an easy marker to score differentiation state of stem cells and how changes in media, cytokines, growth conditions, expression of genes, expression of siRNA, shRNA or miRNA molecules, exposure to antibodies to cell surface markers, or drugs alter this state; somatic cell nuclear transfer, for example, a patient's own somatic cells can be isolated, the intended target gene modified in the appropriate manner, cell clones generated (and quality controlled to ensure genome safety), and the nuclei from these cells isolated and transferred into unfertilized eggs to generate patient-specific hES cells that could be directly injected or differentiated before engrafting into the patient, thereby reducing or eliminating tissue rejection; universal stem cells by knocking out MHC receptors (e.g., to generate cells of diminished or altogether abolished immunological identity). Cell types for this procedure include but are not limited to, T-cells, B cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and embryonic stem cells. Additionally, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) may be used which would also be generated from a patient's own somatic cells. Therefore, these stem cells or their derivatives (differentiated cell types or tissues) could be potentially engrafted into any person regardless of their origin or histocompatibility.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0169">The compositions and methods can also be used for somatic cell therapy (e.g., autologous cell therapy and/or universal T-cell by knocking out MHC or viral receptors, see above), thereby allowing production of stocks of T-cells that have been modified to enhance their biological properties. Such cells can be infused into a variety of patients independent of the donor source of the T-cells and their histocompatibility to the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0170">In addition to therapeutic applications, the increased specificity provided by the variants described herein when used in ZFNs can be used for crop engineering, cell line engineering and the construction of disease models. The obligate heterodimer cleavage half-domains provide a straightforward means for improving ZFN properties, especially when homodimer activity limits efficacy.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0171">The engineered cleavage half domains described can also be used in gene modification protocols requiring simultaneous cleavage at multiple targets either to delete the intervening region or to alter two specific loci at once. Cleavage at two targets would require cellular expression of four ZFNs, which could yield potentially ten different active ZFN combinations. For such applications, substitution of these novel variants for the wild-type nuclease domain would eliminate the activity of the undesired combinations and reduce chances of off-target cleavage. If cleavage at a certain desired DNA target requires the activity of the ZFN pair A+B, and simultaneous cleavage at a second desired DNA target requires the activity of the ZFN pair X+Y, then use of the mutations described herein can prevent the pairings of A with A, A with X, A with Y and so on. Thus, these FokI mutations decrease non-specific cleavage activity as a result of &#x201c;illegitimate&#x201d; pair formation and allow the generation of more efficient orthogonal mutant pairs of ZFNs (see co-owned U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20080131962 and 20090305346).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0172">In addition to the applications described for the engineered cleavage half domains, there are also numerous applications for the conditional mutations described herein. The identified cold-sensitive mutations can be used to create transgenic organisms carrying an integrated copy of the nucleic acid encoding the mutations. Plants carrying such mutations would display the mutant phenotype such that the cleavage activity would be quiescent at cooler temperatures. Upon a shift to higher temperatures, the fusion would display active cleavage activity. These mutant organisms could be used to create lines for breeding purposes where lines containing the cold sensitive mutation could be crossed to lines carrying a certain target such that when the progeny of the cross were shifted to higher temperatures, cleavage of the target would occur. This would increase the efficiency of such processes because it would reduce the number of plant transformations with either donor or fusion protein that would be required to achieve a desired result. The same type of scenario can also be envisioned for thermo sensitive conditional mutants.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Genetic Screening for Mutant Fok I ZFNs</heading>
<p id="p-0158" num="0179">Using <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>as a model system, we isolated ZFN mutants displaying a cold-sensitive phenotype with cleavage activity that is severely diminished at lower temperature but adequate at higher ones. Cold-sensitive mutations are particularly interesting because historically they have been shown to occur in genes encoding subunits of multimeric protein complexes. These mutations affect protein-protein interactions predominantly at low temperature. Thus, isolating this class of mutants revealed non-null mutations that identify important residues within the dimerization interface.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0180">Single-stranded annealing (SSA)-reporter strain and mutant library construction was performed as follows. Random mutagenesis of the FokI nuclease domain was done using error-prone PCR and the library of mutants was constructed by gap repair in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Briefly, the reporter strain was co-transformed with the mutagenized PCR fragment (FokI domain) and a linearized plasmid vector prepared such that the ends of the vector shared DNA sequence with the ends of the PCR fragment. Homologous recombination between the vector and the PCR fragment occurred at a high frequency and resulted in a collection of yeast transformants, containing a mutated ZFN expression vector. The zinc finger domain of the nuclease binds to the human CCR-5 gene (designated 8266) and is described in detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0159996.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0181">The library was then screened or selected for phenotypes of interest in budding yeast, essentially as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009/0111119. Briefly, two independent SSA reporter constructs were integrated in the genome of budding yeast. Both reporters contain a binding site for a homodimer of the 8266 ZFN. The MEL1 SSA reporter contains both positive and negative selection markers. The URA3 gene is used for positive selection in ura-media and for negative selection using 5-Fluoroorotic Acid (5-FOA). The KanMX cassette confers dominant resistance to geneticin (G418). Reconstitution of the MEL1 gene following SSA was detected using chromogenic substrates [p-Nitrophenyl &#x3b1;-D-galactopyranoside (PNPG) or 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (X-a-Gal)]. The PHO5 SSA reporter contains the positive selection cassette NatMX conferring dominant resistance to nourseothricin (NAT) and reconstitution of the PHO5 gene was detected using chromogenic substrates [p-Nitrophenyl phosphate disodium (PNPP) or x-phosphate p-toluidine salt (X-Phos)]. Therefore, a DNA double-stranded break (DSB) induced by a functional 8266 ZFN induced SSA resulted in reconstitution of the reporter genes and elimination of positive and negative selection markers.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0182">The genetic screen for FokI mutants was conducted as follows. First, galactose-inducible expression of the ZFNs was performed at the non-permissive temperature of 22&#xb0; C. Following recovery, the cells were incubated in Kan (G418), NAT and ura-media to eliminate all active ZFNs. This step selected for potential cold-sensitive mutants as well as for inactive ZFN.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0183">Second, the cells were shifted to 37&#xb0; C. (permissive temperature) and plated on media containing 5-FOA and X-Phos. Only cells containing a cold-sensitive ZFN formed blue colonies. The plasmids from these cells were then isolated and retransformed into the reporter strain to confirm the cold-sensitive phenotype. The resulting mutations were identified by direct sequencing of the FokI domain.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0184">Table 3 shows various mutants identified by the screen. Mutations predicted to confer cold sensitivity are indicated in the first column (based on proximity to the dimer interface in ZFNs).</p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0186">Activity (relative to wild-type) of the cold sensitive cleavage activities of the isolated mutants is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The reporter strain was transformed with the isolated mutant vectors, divided into three cultures, and incubated at 22&#xb0; C., 30&#xb0; C., and 37&#xb0; C. Following expression, the activity of the mutants was determined and reported as a fraction of the activity of the wild-type ZFN. The increase in ZFN cleavage activity correlated with elevated temperature of incubation indicates that the isolated mutants are cold-sensitive.</p>

<p id="p-0166" num="0187">Using the ZFN structure model described in Miller et al. (2007) <i>Nat. Biotech. </i>25(7):778-85, we mapped the position of the mutations tested in Example 2 and found out that two of the mutated residues (N496 and H537) face each other on the dimer interface and are found in close proximity. Modelization of those mutations also showed that H537R and N496D mutations would likely form salt-bridges and strengthen the dimerization interface. Table 4 shows the nomenclature of various mutants tested.</p>

<p id="p-0168" num="0189">Various pairwise combinations of the triple mutants (e.g., ELD:KKK, ELD:KKR, ELE:KKK and ELE:KKR) were compared for cleavage activity against EL:KK pairs (EL:KK mutants are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0131962) in a variety of ZFN backgrounds. The ZFN-containing plasmids were then nucleofected into K562 or PMBC cells. To determine the ZFN activity at the appropriate locus, Cel-1 mismatch assays were performed essentially as per the manufacturer's instructions (Trangenomic SURVEYOR&#x2122;). Cells were harvested and chromosomal DNA prepared using a Quickextract&#x2122; Kit according to manufacturer's directions (Epicentre&#xae;). The appropriate region of the targeted locus was PCR amplified using Accuprime&#x2122; High-fidelity DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were heated to 94&#xb0; C., and gradually cooled to room temperature. Approximately 200 ng of the annealed DNA was mixed with 0.33 &#x3bc;L Cel-1 enzyme and incubated for 20 minutes at 42&#xb0; C. Reaction products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1&#xd7; Tris-borate-EDTA buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0190">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, the various combinations of the triple mutants are more active than the original obligate heterodimeric ZFN (EL:KK). In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows Cel-1 assay results of ZFN variants ELD:KKK, ELD:KKR, ELE:KKK, ELE:KKR, ELD:KIK, ELD:KIR, ELE:KIK and ELE:KIR in ZFNs targeted to 53BP1 3 and 10 days post-transfection of the ZFNs into K562 cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows Cel-1 assay results of ZFN variants ELD:KKK and ELD:KKR in ZFNs targeted to KDR and 20 days post-transfection of the ZFNs into K562 cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows Cel-1 assay results of the ELD; KKR and ELD:KKK FokI engineered cleavage domains in the context of GR-specific ZFNs in K562 cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also shows the cleavage activities using decreasing amounts of expression plasmid for transfection (from 400 ng to 16 ng), with two different sets of samples (lanes 1-14 and lanes 15-26). These results show that at 80 ng of input expression plasmid, the ELD:KKR and ELF:KKK mutants were both more active that the EL:KK mutants (compare lane 8 with lanes 9 and 10 and lane 20 with lanes 21 and 22).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the cleavage activities of the ELD:KKR and ELD:KKK mutants in three different RIPK1-specific ZFN backgrounds. The new mutants were both more active that the EL:KK mutant in RIPK1 pair A and RIPK1 pair B. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the new mutants in the pair C background were tested at both 37&#xb0; C. and 30&#xb0; C. where activity of all ZFP pairs was found to be increased at 30&#xb0; C. (see United States Patent Publication No: 2009/0111119).</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 4</heading>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Activity of Engineered Cleavage Domains as Homodimers</heading>
<p id="p-0171" num="0192">The new mutants were also tested for their ability to actively cleave DNA as forced homodimers. In these assays, the zinc finger binding domains are fused to a FokI cleavage domain that is the same in both members of the pair. Thus, in order to observe any activity, the FokI domain must homodimerize with itself (&#x201c;forced homodimerization&#x201d;). Forced homodimerization of CCR5-targeting ZFNs was assayed by nucleofection of FokI variants in K562 cells (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and the Cel-1 assay was used to determine the frequency of ZFN-induced indels at the CCR5 heterodimer target, a CCR5-L ZFN homodimer (ABLIM2), and a CCR5-R homodimer (PGC) off-target sites. For these experiments, the mutations were made in the CCR5-specific 8266 and 8196z pair and then tested. Thus, in the lanes labeled &#x201c;WT&#x201d;, the 8266/8196z pair was used. Then for each mutant pair tested, a similar pair was made with the indicated mutations, so the EL:EL lanes indicate a pair containing 8266-EL and 8196z-EL and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0193">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, whereas the KK, KKK, and KKR homodimers show no detectable cleavage activity at the CCR5 heterodimer target site, there is limited cutting by the EL:EL and ELD:ELD homodimers. The ELD:ELD variants have an approximately 1.5 fold lower activity as compared to EL:EL indicating increased specificity. Importantly, examination of the known off-target sites ABLIM2 and PGC show no detectable cleavage activity by any of the mutants.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0194">In order to further confirm the improvement in specificity of the ELD cleavage domain, these same forced homodimers were tested in decreasing concentrations in K562 cells. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, at all DNA concentration tested, ELD:ELD displays a lower homodimer activity as compared to EL:EL. Forced GR-specific ZFN homodimers were also tested (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and there was no cleavage activity detectable. In some embodiments, the I499A mutant was used to replace the I449L mutation to further decrease any potential ELD homodimerization. In this case, forced homodimerization of the EAD CCR5 specific ZFN gave no detectable cleavage activity.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0195">In addition, these cells were also tested for DSBs using an antibody specific for &#x3b3;-H2AX which accumulates at DSB sites in the genome. The stained cells were sorted by flow cytometry, and the results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As can be seen from the figure, there is very little staining except for the WT pair, indicating a low level of DSBs in the genome in the presence of the ZFN pairs containing the mutated FokI domains.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Activity of the Engineered Half Domains in Primary Cells</heading>
<p id="p-0175" num="0196">The constructs were also tested in primary cells. Decreasing amounts of CCR5-targeting ZFN constructs containing the indicated mutations were nucleofected in PBMCs, as described in Perez et al., ibid. The cells were harvested three days post-transfection and the Cel-1 assay was used to determine the frequency of ZFN-induced indels. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, the ELD:KKK and ELD:KKR mutants were quite active in these cells even at lower concentrations. Similar studies were done with ZFNs targeted to PD-1 and are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. Engineered half domain constructs were made in three pairs of PD-1-specific ZFNs where pair A comprised pair 12942 and 12974, pair B comprised pair 12942 and 25016, while pair C comprised pair 12942 and 25029 (see U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/281,432). The results are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> B in a graphical format and demonstrate that the ELD:KKR and ELD:KKK mutants had superior activity as compared to both the WT pairs and the EL:KK pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0197">Mutants made in the GR-specific ZFN background were also tested in PBMCs for activity as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. In this example, decreasing amounts of the mutants were tested at days 3 and 10 post-transfection. The new mutants were found to have increased activity as compared to the EL:KK pair. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the mean values of experiments that were repeated in six independent transfections in PBMC are presented. The values are mean+/&#x2212; standard error of the mean of the relative activities as compared to the EL-KK pair. P-values use the two-sample T-test and demonstrate the reproducibility of these results.</p>

<p id="p-0179" num="0200">In this sequence, the ZFN binding sites are shown in capital letters, and the introduced BamHI restriction site is underlined. For these experiments, the FokI mutants were tested in the GR-specific ZFN background, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, were done using two different ZFN-encoding plasmid concentrations during the nucleofection step. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, the ELD/KKR pair was more efficient at resulting in the introduction of the donor than the EL/KK pair, at both concentrations tested.</p>
<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 7</heading>
<heading id="h-0024" level="1">Comparison of the Activity of DA:RV FokI Mutants Versus ELD:KKR or ELD:KKK</heading>
<p id="p-0180" num="0201">ZFN pairs were constructed containing the FokI mutations in both the GR-specific and CCR5-specific ZFN backgrounds. These were then tested against their endogenous targets in K562 cells as described above, and assayed for cleavage activity using the Cel-I mismatch assay as described above. In each set of experiments, 80 ng of DNA encoding the ZFNs was used in the nucleofection step. At day 3 following transduction, the Cel-I assays were performed and the results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, which shows the results for the GR-specific and CCR5-specific cleavage. The data demonstrates that the DA:RV FokI pair displayed much less activity than the EL:KK, ELD:KKK and ELD:KKR pairs. The EA:KV pair however showed activity in this assay.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0202">Next, the various ZFNs were tested for their ability to homodimerize by forced homodimerization (see Example 4). Typically, it is undesirable for two FokI mutant domains to have the ability to homodimerize because this may increase the potential for unwanted off target cleavage. The experiments were carried out as above except that 400 ng of ZFN containing plasmid were used for each nucleofection. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and demonstrate that the KV FokI mutant has the ability to homodimerize to a significant extent. Thus, although the EA:KV pair was found to have activity comparable to the ELD:KKR pair in this Cel-I assay (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), the fact that the KV FokI mutant was able to homodimerize and display cleavage activity makes it less desirable because of the increased risk of off-site cleavage.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 8</heading>
<heading id="h-0026" level="1">Enhancement of the Activity of the DA:RV FokI Mutants</heading>
<p id="p-0182" num="0203">The DA:RV FokI mutants were then examined to see if it would be possible to increase their activity by combining them with other FokI mutations. Thus, the DA:RV pairs were made to include the N496D and H537R mutations resulting in a DAD:RVR pair. The Cel-I activity assay results for the CCR5-specific and CXCR4-specific pairs including these mutants are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Experiments were carried out as previously described using 80 ng of plasmid per transduction. As can be seen from the Figure, the addition of the N496D and H537R mutations increased cleavage activity. Similar results were also found using these mutations in the GR-specific ZFN background (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0204">The DA:RV+N496D and H537R combination was also tested in a less active ZFN pair background. In this experiment, KDR-specific ZFNs were chosen and the results of the Cel-I assay are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In this figure, the activity of both the DA:RV and DAD:RVR mutants were not detectable. Thus, the addition of the N496D and H537R mutations is helpful in some ZFNs but is not able to rescue ZFN pairs that have weak or undetectable activity.</p>
<heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 9</heading>
<heading id="h-0028" level="1">Testing of Orthogonal Pairs for Simultaneous Specific Dual Cleavage</heading>
<p id="p-0184" num="0205">It may be desirable to perform simultaneous cleavage at two target sites within a genome. For added specificity, it would be best if only the ZFN pairs that cleave at the desired locus are able to productively dimerize such that an active pair has the specificity desired. To achieve this goal, pairs must not be able to homodimerize or transheterodimerize to create an active pair. In other words, if target 1 is cleaved by ZFN pair A+B, and target 2 is cleaved by ZFN pair X+Y, pairings of A+A (homodimers), A+X and A+Y (transheterodimers), for example, would be undesirable. Thus, the ELD/KKR+DAD/RVR pairs specific for CCR5 and CXCR4 were tested together with the hopes that the CCR5-specific ELD half cleavage domain would not be able to transheterodimerize with either the CXCR5-specific DAD or CXCR4-specific RVR half domains. In addition, variants of the ELD/KKR pair were made such that the D mutation at position 496 in the ELD mutant and the R mutation at position 537 in KKR were exchanged to form a REL/DKK pair (H537R+Q486E+I499L/N496D+E490K+I538K). In addition, the ELD/KKR+DD/RR pairs specific for CCR5 and CXCR4 were also tested together.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0206">The Cel-I activity assay results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 22</figref>. In this experiment, the conditions tested were both a standard 37&#xb0; C. incubation as well as a 30&#xb0; C. incubation (see co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/800,599). Briefly, following transduction, the cells were held at 37&#xb0; C. for 3 days or at 30&#xb0; C. for 3 days. Following incubation for 3 days, Cel-I assays were performed to see if both targets were cleaved, where the CCR5-specific Cel-I assay is shown on the top in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, and the CXCR4-specific Cel-I assay is shown below.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0207">These results indicate that cleavage at both the CCR5 and CXCR4 targets was achievable in a single step using these pairs of orthogonal mutants.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0208">The mutants were further tested to examine potential off target cleavage. An in silico analysis was done to identify potential off target sites that might resemble a target that could be recognized by an illegitimate CCR5-CXCR4 transheterodimer ZFN pair. In these experiments, the four top candidates for off target cleavage were examined by the Cel-I assay, where the sequences for the off-target sites are listed below in Table 5.</p>

However, the ELD/KKR CCR5 pair, combined with the DAD/RVR CXCR4 pair gave no detectable cleavage at these off target sites. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the ELD/KKR CCR5 pair, combined with the DD/RR CXCR4 pair gave no detectable cleavage at these off target sites.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0211">These results demonstrate that these FokI mutants may be used in sets to allow for simultaneous cleavage of more than one target site at a time, while decreasing undesirable off target cleavage.</p>

<heading id="h-0030" level="1">Evaluation of FokI Mutants Paired with the Sharkey Mutant</heading>
<p id="p-0191" num="0212">A set of FokI mutants have been described which are thought to enhance efficiency of DNA cleavage (see Guo et al, ibid), which are known as the Sharkey (S418P+K441E) and Sharkey' (S418P+F432L+K441E+Q481H+H523Y+N527D+K559Q) FokI mutants. Thus, the Sharkey mutant was tested in combination with the various FokI mutants described herein to see if cleavage activity could be further enhanced by the presence of the Sharkey mutations. The mutant combinations were made in the GR-specific and the KDR-specific ZFN backgrounds and tested for cleavage activity using the Cel-I assay as described above. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, and demonstrate that the activities of the mutations appear to be additive. For example, comparison of lanes 10 and 11 with lanes 12 and 13 on the day 3 panel shows that the detected NHEJ activity (indels) went from 11-12 for the ELD/KKR GR-specific pair to 20% indels for the ELD-S/KKR-S pair. Similarly, comparison of lanes 10 and 11 with lanes 12 and 13 for the KDR specific ZFNs at day 3 went from approximately 26-28% indels detectable to 48-50% indels detectable.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0213">In addition, Sharkey FokI mutants were also combined with the DA/RV and DAD/RVR FokI mutants in the GR-specific ZFN background, and tested for activity using the Cel-I activity assay. The results are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> and show that the FokI mutations are additive in terms of activity. (Compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 6 and 7).</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0214">The mutant combinations were also tested to see if the presence of the Sharkey mutation increased the amount of homodimerization cleavage in a forced homodimerization assay as described above in Example 4. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows the results of the GR-specific mutants, with or without the added Sharkey mutation. As can be seen from the figure, the mutants were not detectably altered in the homodimerization capability. Similarly, the DA-S/RV-S and DAD-S/RVR-S mutants were also tested to see if there was an increase in homodimerization in the GR-specific ZFN background. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, and demonstrate that there was not an increase in productive homodimerization. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref> demonstrates an equal loading of all lanes.</p>
<heading id="h-0031" level="1">Example 11</heading>
<heading id="h-0032" level="1">Enhancement of the Activity of the D:R FokI Mutants</heading>
<p id="p-0194" num="0215">The D:R FokI mutants (R487D:D483R) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2008/0131962 and 2009/0305346) were examined to see if it would be possible to increase their activity by combining them with other FokI mutations. Briefly, the D:R pairs were made to include the N496D and H537R mutations resulting in a DD:RR pair and Cel-I assays performed as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0216">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the addition of the N496D and H537R mutations increased cleavage activity.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0217">In sum, these results demonstrate that FokI mutants described herein are the data presented here demonstrate that the novel mutants are more active and display less off-site cleavage activity than the previously described FokI mutants.</p>
