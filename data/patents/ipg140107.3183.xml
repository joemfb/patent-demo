<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a display panel and, more particularly, the present invention relates to a display panel that executes an array test.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">(2) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Liquid crystal displays (&#x201c;LCDs&#x201d;) are a type of flat panel display that is frequently used as a display device. A liquid crystal display typically includes two display panels on which field generating electrodes, such as pixel electrodes and a common electrode, are disposed, and a liquid crystal layer interposed between the two display panels. The liquid crystal display applies voltages to the field generating electrodes to generate an electric field in the liquid crystal layer. As a result, the alignment of liquid crystal molecules of the liquid crystal layer, and thus the polarization of light incident to the liquid crystal layer, is controlled to display an image on the liquid crystal display.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">After manufacturing the liquid crystal display, an array test is performed to determine whether pixels in the liquid crystal display operate normally or if there is a defect, such as a disconnection. After the array test, test lines used for the array test are electrically separated from signal lines of the liquid crystal display.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the separated test lines are exposed outside the liquid crystal display, and the separated test lines are thereby often damaged, such as from corrosion due to heat or moisture from outside the liquid crystal display, for example. Moreover, this damage can be transmitted to the signal lines of the liquid crystal display.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a display panel in which damage from test lines that are corroded by heat or moisture is effectively prevented from being transmitted to the display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A display panel according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes an insulation substrate having a display area and a peripheral area, wires disposed on the insulation substrate in the display area, first and second testing lines disposed on the insulation substrate and aligned substantially parallel to each other, and a diode unit disposed between the wires and the first testing line or the second testing line. The wires extend from the display area into the peripheral area and through diodes included in the diode unit, and the wires are electrically connected to the first testing line or the second testing line.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An input terminal and an output terminal of each of the diodes are formed with different wiring layers on the insulation substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The diodes may be diode connected thin film transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The thin film transistors may include a gate electrode formed with a same layer as a gate line, as well as a source electrode and a drain electrode formed with a same layer as a data line.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A gate insulating layer and a semiconductor layer may be disposed between the gate electrode and the drain electrode of each of the thin film transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A portion of the semiconductor layer may be disposed under the drain electrode to have a same boundary as a boundary of the drain electrode on the insulation substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An ohmic contact layer may be disposed between the semiconductor layer and the drain electrode on the insulation substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A cutting line may be disposed between the first testing line or the second testing line and the diode to electrically disconnect the first testing line or the second testing line from the diodes of the diode unit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The distance between the cutting line and the diodes may be about 200 micrometers (&#x3bc;m).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A shorting bar may be disposed substantially parallel to the one of the first testing line and the second testing line on the insulating substrate, wherein the shorting bar connects two or more of the wires to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A static electricity protection circuit may be disposed on the insulating substrate between the diode unit and the wires to dissipate static electricity between the wires and the diode unit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A pad may be disposed on the insulating substrate between the wires and the diode, and may supply a signal to the wires from an external source.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A pad may be on a side of the insulating substrate opposite to a side thereof on which the diode unit is disposed, wherein the pad supplies a signal to the wires from an external source.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The wires may be data lines or gate lines.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A display panel according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes an insulation substrate including a display area and a peripheral area, wires disposed in the display area and a diode unit connected to portions of the wires which extend into the peripheral area from the display area. The wires pass through diodes in the diode unit and extend such that one end of the wires corresponds to an edge of the insulation substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An input terminal and an output terminal of each of the diodes may be formed with different wiring layers on the insulation substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The diodes may be a diode connected thin film transistors, and the thin film transistors may each include a gate electrode formed with a same layer as a gate line and a source electrode and a drain electrode formed with a same layer as a data line. A gate insulating layer and a semiconductor layer may be disposed between the gate electrode and the drain electrode of each of the thin film transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A portion of the semiconductor layer may be disposed under the drain electrode to have a same boundary as a boundary of the drain electrode on the insulation substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A distance from a cutting line to the diodes may be about 200 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The display panel may further include a pad which supplies a signal to the wires from an external source. The pad may be disposed between the diode and the wires or at a side of the insulating substrate opposite to a side thereof on which the diode unit is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention as described herein, a diode is connected between a testing line and wires, and an insulating layer and semiconductor layer are disposed between the testing line and the wires, such that corrosion that results from the testing line being exposed and corroded by heat or moisture is not transmitted to the wires.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which various embodiments are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms, and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; or &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, relative terms, such as &#x201c;lower&#x201d; or &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper&#x201d; or &#x201c;top,&#x201d; may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to another element as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the &#x201c;lower&#x201d; side of other elements would then be oriented on &#x201c;upper&#x201d; sides of the other elements. The exemplary term &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of &#x201c;lower&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; depending on the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements. The exemplary terms &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure, and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Exemplary embodiments are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments described herein should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions as illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or described as flat may, typically, have rough and/or nonlinear features. Moreover, sharp angles that are illustrated may be rounded. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region and are not intended to limit the scope of the present claims.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. It will be noted that, while exemplary embodiments described herein make particular reference to a liquid crystal panel as a representative example of a display panel, alternative exemplary embodiments are not limited thereto.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the data lines <b>171</b> are connected to the first static electricity protection circuit unit <b>270</b>, and each data line <b>171</b> is electrically connected to one end of one static electricity protection circuit (not shown) in the first static electricity protection circuit unit <b>270</b>. The other end of the static electricity protection circuit is connected to the first diode unit <b>210</b> through a connection line <b>172</b> aligned substantially parallel to the data line <b>171</b>. Each connection line <b>172</b> is connected to one end of each diode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) in the first diode unit <b>210</b>. The other end of the diode is electrically connected to one of the first and second testing lines <b>250</b> and <b>251</b>, respectively, through another connection line <b>125</b>, which is also disposed substantially parallel to the data line <b>171</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one or more exemplary embodiments, at least one of the first and second testing lines <b>250</b> and <b>251</b> and the connection line <b>125</b> are connected to each other. Additionally, the connection line <b>125</b>, disposed along the transverse direction (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and the first and second testing lines <b>250</b> and <b>251</b>, disposed along the longitudinal direction thereby, form an intersecting point, and a connecting member <b>197</b>, which may be made of the same material as the pixel electrode (not shown), is disposed on the intersecting point, thereby electrically connecting the lines to each other. Thus, a contact hole <b>187</b>, which exposes the testing lines, is disposed in a region where the connecting member <b>197</b> and one of the testing lines <b>250</b> and <b>251</b> overlap with each other, and another contact hole <b>187</b>, which exposes the connection line <b>125</b>, is disposed in a region where the connecting member <b>197</b> and the connection line <b>125</b> overlap each other, such that the testing lines and the connection line <b>125</b> are electrically connected to each other through the connecting member <b>197</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In an exemplary embodiment, the first and second testing lines <b>250</b> and <b>251</b> may be formed of the same material as is the data line <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A portion of the connection line <b>125</b> is further extended and may be connected to the first shorting bar <b>200</b> and, more particularly, the connection line <b>125</b> extended from only even-numbered (or, alternatively, odd-numbered) data lines <b>171</b> is connected to the first shorting bar <b>200</b>, but alternative exemplary embodiments are not limited thereto.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The structure of each diode will now be described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an exemplary embodiment, each diode is a diode connected thin film transistor (&#x201c;TFT&#x201d;), in which a control terminal and a input terminal of the TFT, which is a three terminal switching element, are connected to each other, as shown in the schematic circuit diagram of the diode connected TFT shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In an exemplary embodiment, the diode connected TFT (hereinafter referred to as the &#x201c;transistor&#x201d;) is formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as will now be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The connection line <b>125</b>, connected to one of the first and second testing lines <b>250</b> and <b>251</b> and substantially parallel to the data line <b>171</b> is extended to have a wide width (relative to other portions thereof), thereby forming a gate electrode <b>126</b>. The connection line <b>125</b> and the gate electrode <b>126</b> are disposed on an insulating substrate <b>110</b>, e.g., the insulation substrate <b>110</b> described above. In an exemplary embodiment, the gate electrode <b>126</b> forms a control terminal of the transistor, and the connection line <b>125</b> and the gate electrode <b>126</b> are formed with the same material as the gate line <b>121</b> of the display area <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A gate insulating layer <b>140</b> is disposed on the connection line <b>125</b> and the gate electrode <b>126</b>. The gate insulating layer <b>140</b> covers almost all of the region of the lower substrate <b>100</b>, including the display area <b>300</b>, and may include a contact hole <b>185</b> for exposing a portion of the gate pad <b>129</b> and the connection line <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A semiconductor layer <b>150</b> is disposed on the gate insulating layer <b>140</b>. The semiconductor layer <b>150</b> covers at least a portion of the upper portion of the gate electrode <b>126</b>, and includes a channel region. In an exemplary embodiment, the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> is formed with the same material as a semiconductor layer (not shown) of the display area <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A source electrode <b>173</b> and a drain electrode <b>175</b>, which in an exemplary embodiment are the input terminal and the output terminal, respectively, of the transistor, are disposed on the semiconductor layer <b>150</b>. The source electrode <b>173</b> is electrically connected to the connection line <b>125</b>, and receives an input signal from the connection line <b>125</b>. The drain electrode <b>175</b> is extended, thereby having a same function as the connection line <b>172</b>, connecting the diode and the first static electricity protection circuit unit <b>270</b>. A floating electrode <b>174</b> is disposed between the drain electrode <b>175</b> and the source electrode <b>173</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the floating electrode <b>174</b> has a function of ensuring the channel region of the semiconductor layer <b>150</b>. Ohmic contact layers <b>163</b>, <b>164</b> and <b>165</b> are respectively disposed between the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> and the source electrode <b>173</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> and the floating electrode <b>174</b>, and the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> and the drain electrode <b>175</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The source electrode <b>173</b>, the drain electrode <b>175</b> and the floating electrode <b>174</b> may be formed together with the same material as the data line <b>171</b> of the display area <b>300</b>. Also, in an exemplary embodiment, the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> may be etched such that the ohmic contact layers <b>163</b>, <b>164</b> and <b>165</b>, which are etched with the source electrode <b>173</b>, the floating electrode <b>174</b> and the drain electrode <b>175</b>, respectively, have common, e.g., the same, boundaries with the semiconductor layer <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A passivation layer <b>180</b> is disposed on the gate insulating layer <b>140</b>, the source electrode <b>173</b>, the drain electrode <b>175</b> and the floating electrode <b>174</b>. The passivation layer <b>180</b> has a contact hole <b>186</b> for exposing a portion of the source electrode <b>173</b> and a contact hole <b>185</b> for exposing a portion of the connection line <b>125</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the passivation layer <b>180</b> covers all the diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A connecting electrode <b>192</b> for connecting the connection line <b>125</b> and the source electrode <b>173</b> is disposed on the passivation layer <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thus, in an exemplary embodiment, the diodes of the first diode unit <b>210</b> are formed as diode connected transistors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). When forming the diode, a width of the channel of the diode is sufficiently to effectively prevent problems when applying an array test signal.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an exemplary embodiment, the array test for checking for problems such as a disconnection of the data line <b>171</b> is performed using the above-described structure of the exemplary embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. The array test may be executed in a state in which the upper substrate (not shown) and the liquid crystal layer (not shown) are formed. For the array test, the first and second testing lines <b>250</b> and <b>251</b> are supplied with different voltages. Specifically, for example, one testing line is supplied with a high voltage and the other testing line is supplied with a (relatively) low voltage, and opposite voltages may be applied after a predetermined period. As a result, any defects of a corresponding pixel may be confirmed by observing display deterioration in the pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The connection line <b>125</b> is disconnected with respect to a line C (e.g., a cutting line C) of shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or the upper portion of the line C (the cutting line C) of the lower substrate <b>100</b> may be cut, as will be described in further detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. Also, the first diode unit <b>210</b> is positioned at a distance from the line C (the cutting line C), which, in an exemplary embodiment, is a distance of about 200 micrometers (&#x3bc;m), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It will be noted that, in additional exemplary embodiments, the distance may be changed and, this distances of more or less than 200 &#x3bc;m are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the connection line <b>125</b> is disconnected or cut such that it is exposed to the outside, the connection line may be corroded by heat and/or moisture. This corrosion is extended, and then may adversely affect the display area <b>300</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, however, the diode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, is disposed between the display area <b>300</b> and the line C (cutting line), such that any corrosion does not spread into the display area <b>300</b>. Specifically, for the corrosion to progress into the display area <b>300</b>, the corrosion must pass through the gate insulating layer <b>140</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> after it progresses to the end of the connection line <b>125</b>, and then must progress to the connection line <b>172</b> through the drain electrode <b>175</b>. However, in an exemplary embodiment, the gate insulating layer <b>140</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> block the corrosion such that it does not progress further, e.g., such that it does not progress into the display area <b>300</b>. Therefore, in an exemplary embodiment, the gate insulating layer <b>140</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> are a double blocking film. As a result, the corrosion does not progress into the drain electrode <b>175</b>, and the display area <b>300</b> remains free of corrosion. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the distance between the line C (the cutting line C) and the first diode unit <b>210</b> in an exemplary embodiment is about 200 &#x3bc;m, and it therefore takes a sufficiently long time for the corrosion to progress this distance, such that the corrosion progression is further prevented. However, although the distance between the line C (cutting line) and the first diode unit <b>210</b> may also be small, the diode in the first diode unit <b>210</b> includes the double blocking film of the gate insulating layer <b>140</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> such that the corrosion still does not progress into the display area <b>300</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Thus, in an exemplary embodiment, the diodes of the second diode unit <b>211</b> are formed to be the diode connected transistors.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The array test for checking for problems, such as disconnection of the gate line <b>121</b>, is performed using the exemplary embodiments as described above with reference to structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>. The array test may be performed in a state in which the upper substrate (not shown) and the liquid crystal layer (not shown) are formed. For the array test, the third and fourth testing lines <b>252</b> and <b>253</b>, respectively, are supplied with different voltages. Specifically, for example, one testing line is supplied with a high voltage and the other testing line is supplied with a (relatively) low voltage, and opposite voltages may be applied after a predetermined period. As a result, any defects of a corresponding pixel may be confirmed by observing display deterioration in the pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In an exemplary embodiment, the connection line <b>125</b>-<b>1</b> is disconnected at a line C (e.g., a cutting line C) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, or, alternatively, a right portion of the line C (the cutting line C) of the lower substrate <b>100</b> may be cut and/or removed, as will be described in further detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Accordingly, when the connection line <b>125</b>-<b>1</b> is disconnected or cut such that it is exposed to the outside, the connection line may be corroded by heat and/or moisture.

Specifically, for the corrosion to progress into the display area <b>300</b>, the corrosion must pass through the gate insulating layer <b>140</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> after it progresses to the end of the connection line <b>125</b>, and then must progress to the connection lines <b>172</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b> through the drain electrode <b>175</b>-<b>1</b>. However, in an exemplary embodiment, the gate insulating layer <b>140</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> blocking the corrosion (as they are a double blocking film) such that the corrosion does not progress further. As a result, the corrosion does not progress into the drain electrode <b>175</b>, and the display area <b>300</b> is thereby maintained to be free of corrosion. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the distance between the line C (the cutting line C) and the second diode unit <b>211</b> is about 200 &#x3bc;m, and thus it takes a (relatively) long time for the corrosion to progress along this distance from the line C (the cutting line C) to the connection line <b>125</b> and, accordingly, the transition of the corrosion is further prevented. However, although the distance between the line C (the cutting line C) and the second diode unit <b>211</b> may be reduced, the diode in the second diode unit <b>211</b> includes the double blocking film (e.g., the gate insulating layer <b>140</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>150</b>-<b>1</b>) such that the corrosion still does not progress into the display area <b>300</b>.</p>

Specifically, for example, in an exemplary embodiment the gate pads <b>129</b> are arranged in one line substantially parallel to the data line <b>171</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). However according to additional exemplary embodiments, the gate pads connected to the even-numbered gate lines are further moved and disposed in the left side, and the gate pads connected to the odd-numbered gate lines are further moved and disposed in the right side thereby, forming the zigzag structure.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a number of the testing lines is uniform, however this may be changed in additional exemplary embodiments. For example, three wires may be used as the testing lines and may be formed substantially parallel to each other on one side of the peripheral area, or, alternatively, one wire may be disposed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the exemplary embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the shorting bar is illustrated; however the shorting bar may be omitted in an alternative exemplary embodiment. Alternatively, two or more shorting bars may be formed on one side of the peripheral area, and the shorting bar for the gate line and the shorting bar for the data line may be electrically connected to each other.</p>
