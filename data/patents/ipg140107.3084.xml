<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to devices for controlling electrical loads. In particular, the present disclosure relates to an electrical device for controlling electrical loads having a switch actuator for on/off control of a load and a thumbwheel dimmer actuator for adjusting power delivered to a load.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Prior art devices may include a single actuator providing both a switch and a dimmer function. One example is a spring mounted thumbwheel actuator that acts as a dimmer when turned and acts as a switch when pushed. Another example is a thumbwheel actuator or a slide actuator that has an on-off function at the beginning or end of the sliding or rotating action associated with the dimming function.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prior art devices may also include two side-by-side actuators, one switch actuator and one dimming actuator. However, one limitation of the prior art devices is that they require different apertures in the faceplate for each actuator. Another limitation is that at least one of the hand operable portions of the two actuators are stationary, or that movement of the hand operable portion of one of the actuators causes the other actuator to move.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure is directed to an electrical device controller for controlling power to a load. The controller includes a housing having at least one open face and a plate secured to the housing and disposed over the open face of the housing. The plate has a unitary aperture.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the drawing figures, in which like references numerals identify identical or corresponding elements, the electrical device controller in accordance with the present disclosure will now be described in detail. With initial reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary electrical device controller accordance with the present disclosure is illustrated and is designated generally as electrical device controller <b>100</b>. The electrical device controller <b>100</b> is mounted, such as on a wall of a room, and electrically coupled to at least one electrical device, such as a lighting device or a ceiling fan, where the controlled electrical device(s) may be remote from the electrical device controller <b>100</b>, e.g., positioned on the ceiling of the room.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Electrical device controller <b>100</b> includes a housing having a cup-shaped back body <b>102</b> and a front plate <b>104</b> which is positioned on top of the back body <b>102</b> when assembled, describing a cavity. The front plate <b>104</b> has an upper surface <b>103</b>, a bottom surface <b>105</b> and a first aperture <b>106</b> surrounded by a frame <b>108</b> which communicates between the upper surface <b>103</b> and bottom surface <b>105</b>. The back body <b>102</b> and front plate <b>104</b> are made of a nonconductive material, such as plastic and are attached to one another, such as by a fastener, e.g., a screw or mating structures for a snap fit. The first aperture <b>106</b> is a single, continuous aperture that is not partitioned into more than one aperture. Positioned within the first aperture <b>106</b> are user operable portions of a switch assembly <b>110</b> including a toggle switch <b>112</b> and a rotary wheel <b>114</b>, both of which are formed of a nonconductive material, such as plastic. The toggle switch <b>112</b> and the rotary wheel <b>114</b> are both actuators which each include an upper user operable portion that is accessible from the front plate <b>104</b> for actuating the actuator, and a lower portion that extends downward and lies below the front plate <b>104</b> and interacts with other components of the electrical device controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The user operable portions of the toggle switch <b>112</b> and the rotary wheel <b>114</b> are adjacent to one another. The respective user operable portions are user accessible via the first aperture <b>116</b>. There is no intervening material in between the first and second actuators that is visible when the electrical device controller is assembled. Accordingly, there is no webbing or partitioning in between the user operable portions of the toggle switch <b>112</b> and rotary wheel <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The switch assembly <b>110</b> provides user control of the at least one electrical device controlled by the electrical device controller <b>100</b>, with the toggle switch <b>112</b> providing on-off control and the rotary wheel <b>114</b> providing dimmer control. Dimmer as used here is not limited to operating a lighting device, but may be used for controlling a variety of electrical devices by providing a variable magnitude of power to the electrical device in a graduated or incremental fashion. For example, the dimmer control may control the speed of fan or a characteristic of an appliance, such as the volume of a radio or television.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The front plate <b>104</b> is further provided with second and third apertures <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, respectively. Positioned with the second aperture <b>116</b> is an indicator switch <b>120</b> for operating an indicator, such as a neon bulb in this embodiment, which is provided within the housing and is discussed further below. The indicator switch <b>120</b> switches the neon light on and off. The light produced by the neon light provides a backlighting effect and is visible to a user, either via the first aperture <b>106</b> or a translucent portion of the front plate, such as window (not shown). When the neon light is on it provides a gentle glow that can help a user locate the electrical device controller <b>100</b> in a dark room.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Positioned within the third aperture <b>118</b> is a potentiometer setting control (PSC) <b>122</b> which allows a user to set the minimum or maximum setting controlled by the rotary wheel <b>114</b>. As described further below, the rotary wheel <b>114</b> operates a potentiometer which varies the power supplied to the electrical device to which it is electrically connected. In the current example, the PSC <b>122</b> sets the minimum setting for the potentiometer, but it is envisioned that the electrical device controller <b>100</b> may be configured for the PSC <b>122</b> to set a minimum or maximum power level that the potentiometer can output. The PSC <b>122</b> may have a user accessible portion which is raised relative to the front plate <b>104</b> so that it is hand accessible to the user, or it may be recessed below the plane of the front plate <b>104</b> so that it is accessible to a user by using a tool, e.g., a screwdriver.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A user operates the user accessible portion to actuate the PSC <b>122</b> for adjusting the minimum or maximum of a range of the amount of power that can be delivered to the load. Since the PSC <b>122</b> is user accessible via the third aperture <b>118</b> of the front plate <b>104</b>, the minimum or maximum of the range of power that can be delivered to the load is user adjustable while the electrical device controller <b>100</b> is mounted, e.g., to a wall. It should be noted that while the embodiment described includes a PSC <b>122</b> for setting a minimum or maximum power level, any suitable adjustable element can be used to set any suitable characteristic desired to be set.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The electrical device controller <b>100</b> is further provided with a U-shaped strap <b>124</b> which is sandwiched between the back body <b>102</b> and the front plate <b>104</b> where the fit may be tight in order that it is not necessary to screw the strap <b>124</b> to the back body <b>102</b> or the front plate <b>104</b> in order to hold it in place. The cup-shaped back body <b>102</b> has end walls <b>126</b>, side walls <b>128</b> and bottom wall <b>132</b>. The strap <b>124</b> fits snugly inside the back body <b>102</b> by laying against an interior surface of the end walls <b>126</b> and the bottom wall <b>132</b>. Electrical components of the electrical device controller <b>100</b> are disposed within the cavity described by the back body <b>102</b>, the strap <b>124</b> and the front plate <b>104</b> when the front plate <b>104</b> and back plate <b>102</b> are assembled. An upper surface of a portion of the strap <b>124</b> which is exposed when the front plate <b>104</b> is assembled to the back body <b>102</b> is flush with an upper surface of the front plate <b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), providing for a simple installation when the electrical device controller <b>100</b> is mounted, e.g., in a wall.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped configuration of the strap <b>124</b> allows for access from the front of the electrical device controller <b>100</b> during manufacture before the front face <b>104</b> is secured in position, e.g., for assembling the electrical components. The strap <b>124</b> is formed of a thermally conductive material, such as metal, e.g., aluminum, and conducts heat and electricity well. The &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape configuration of the strap <b>124</b> provides greater flexibility in terms of where to place components at the design stage, particularly heat generating components, such as a triac component described in greater detail further below, which generates the most significant amount of heat in the electrical device controller <b>100</b> and therefore is fixed to the strap <b>124</b> to allow for heat dissipation. The strap <b>124</b> becomes slightly warm during operation and the back body <b>102</b> provides heat and electrical insulation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that the back body <b>102</b> includes cutouts <b>134</b> to accommodate screws <b>136</b>, which may include, for example, a terminal screw and a ground screw. However, it is to be understood that the use of screw terminals or electrical leads are within the scope of the present disclosure. Mounting screws <b>138</b> are provided for mounting the electrical connector device <b>100</b>, e.g., to a wall and/or an electrical box in the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a printed circuit board (PCB) assembly is shown having a horizontal PCB <b>202</b> which is oriented parallel to the front plate <b>104</b> and a vertical PCB <b>204</b> which is oriented at a right angle to the front plate <b>104</b>. The horizontal and vertical PCBs <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> may include circuit boards other than PCBs, and are not limited to PCBs. The horizontal PCB <b>202</b> and the vertical PCB <b>204</b> are electrically coupled by right angle PCB connectors <b>206</b>. The electronic components of the device are coupled to at least one of the horizontal PCB <b>202</b> and the vertical PCB <b>204</b>. The vertical PCB <b>204</b> is shaped to accommodate components, such as for providing access to the potentiometer <b>208</b> for adjusting the power delivered to the load. The configuration of the horizontal PCB <b>202</b>, vertical PCB <b>204</b> and electrical components coupled thereto is exemplary and other configurations are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The U-shape of the strap <b>124</b> provides additional surface area for dissipating heat.

The triac <b>232</b> is a bidirectional electrical switch that conducts alternating current during positive and negative phases of each cycle. The triac <b>232</b> generates some heat. Heat generated by the triac is transferred to the heat spreader and then to the strap <b>124</b> for dissipation thereof. Additional electrical components which are included in the circuitry for providing the switching and dimming functionality, such as capacitors, resistors (not shown), neon bulb <b>220</b>, and toroid <b>236</b>, are coupled to at least one of the horizontal PCB <b>202</b> and vertical PCB <b>204</b>. In the current example, these components are all coupled to the horizontal PCB <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Potentiometer <b>208</b> is coupled to the vertical PCB <b>204</b> for controlling the amount of power delivered to an electrical device being controlled, which is also referred to as a load. The potentiometer <b>208</b> is provided with a sliding tab <b>210</b>, which slides back and forth along a linear sliding track <b>212</b>, wherein movement of the tab <b>210</b> varies the power delivered. When the sliding tab <b>210</b> is positioned at one end of the sliding track <b>212</b>, the power delivered to an electrical device being controlled by the electrical device controller <b>100</b> is at a minimum setting and when the sliding tab <b>210</b> is positioned at the other end of the sliding track <b>212</b>, the power delivered to the electrical device being controlled by the electrical device controller <b>100</b> is at a maximum setting. The minimum and maximum settings can be adjusted, as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The potentiometer <b>208</b> has a connector face <b>214</b> that lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the front face <b>104</b>, where the connector face <b>214</b> includes electrical connectors, such as pins, for connecting to the vertical PCB <b>204</b>. The sliding track <b>212</b> lies on an opposing face <b>216</b> of the potentiometer <b>208</b> relative to the connector face <b>214</b>. The opposing face <b>216</b> also lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the front face <b>104</b>. The sliding tab <b>210</b> further lies in a single plane which also lies in a plane parallel to the plane of the front face <b>104</b>. As described further below, the sliding tab <b>210</b> is operated by the rotary wheel <b>114</b>, where rotary movement of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> causes the sliding tab <b>210</b> to move in a linear path A along the linear sliding track <b>212</b> which is parallel to the plane of the front face <b>104</b>. When the sliding tab <b>210</b> is moved along the sliding track <b>212</b> the power delivered to the electrical device being controlled is gradually increased or decreased, depending on the direction that the sliding tab <b>210</b> is moved in.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Indicator switch <b>120</b> is mounted on the vertical PCB <b>204</b>. The indicator switch <b>120</b> includes a movable user operable portion and an electrical switch component. The electrical switch component is electrically coupled at least via the vertical PCB <b>204</b> to the neon bulb <b>220</b> and opens and closes an electrical circuit formed between the neon bulb <b>220</b> and a current source providing current to the neon bulb <b>220</b>. The electrical switch component may be further electrically coupled to the neon bulb <b>220</b> via the horizontal PCB <b>202</b> and the connectors <b>206</b>. The user operable portion is formed of nonconductive material, such as a plastic, wherein user operation of the user operable portion causes the electrical switch to open and close the electrical circuit. The user operable portion is user accessible and/or extends through the second aperture <b>116</b>. Operation of the user operable portion causes the neon bulb <b>220</b> to be switched on or off. The effect of switching on the neon bulb <b>220</b> is to provide backlighting, such as to aid a user to locate the electrical device controller <b>100</b> in a dark room.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">PSC <b>122</b> is supported by PSC holder <b>150</b>, and is further electrically coupled to the vertical PCB <b>204</b>. Via the vertical PCB <b>204</b> the PSC <b>122</b> is electrically coupled to the potentiometer <b>208</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The user operable portion of PSC <b>122</b> is user accessible through third aperture <b>118</b>. The PSC <b>122</b> adjusts control circuitry in the potentiometer <b>208</b> which controls the amount of power delivered to the load based on the position of the tab <b>210</b>. Adjustment of the PSC <b>122</b> adjusts the minimum or maximum of the range of power controlled by the potentiometer <b>208</b> for delivery to the load. Adjustment of the PSC <b>122</b> may further adjust the amount of power delivered to the load when the tab <b>210</b> is in a particular position. In the current example, operation of the PSC <b>122</b> sets the minimum setting that determines the minimum amount of power that the potentiometer <b>208</b> can control for delivery to the load. The circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be modified so that PSC <b>122</b> sets the maximum setting of the potentiometer <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The PSC <b>122</b> in the current example is a potentiometer, and in particular a screw potentiometer in which the user operable portion of the PSC <b>122</b> is rotatable and is configured with a groove for receiving a screwdriver. The user operable portion may be rotated by twisting the screwdriver while it is inserted in the groove. This operates the potentiometer of the PSC <b>122</b> to adjust the potentiometer <b>208</b> for adjusting a maximum or minimum of a range of the amount of power controlled by the potentiometer <b>208</b> for delivery to the load.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">By mounting of the PSC <b>122</b> and the indicator switch <b>120</b> to the vertical PCB <b>204</b>, they are accessible to the user via the front plate <b>104</b> of the electrical device controller <b>100</b>.

The PSC <b>122</b> and indicator switch <b>120</b> may each be equipped with one or more notches for receiving a tool, such as a screw driver, to operate the control. Accordingly, the potentiometer <b>208</b> may be adjusted by a user via the PSC <b>122</b> while the electrical device controller <b>100</b> is mounted, e.g., to a wall without the need to remove the controller <b>100</b> from its mounted position.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The toggle switch <b>112</b> is a monolithic component formed of a single piece of nonconductive material, such as plastic. The present disclosure is not limited thereto, and the toggle switch <b>112</b> could be formed of two or more parts that are attached to one another. The toggle switch <b>112</b> includes a handle <b>540</b> that extends above the upper surface <b>103</b> of the front plate <b>104</b> which can be grasped by a user and moved between a first position for turning on the load and a second position for turning off the load. The handle <b>540</b> extends from a base <b>542</b> having a generally semicircular shape which is seated in the toggle structure <b>510</b> and received within the frame <b>108</b>. An arm <b>544</b> extends from the base <b>542</b> on an exterior face <b>545</b> of the toggle switch <b>112</b>. The arm <b>544</b> is attached at a first end <b>546</b> to the base <b>542</b> by a shaft <b>548</b> which is received and engaged within cutout <b>526</b> of the toggle structure <b>510</b>. The atm <b>544</b> includes an L portion having a first leg <b>550</b> which extends from the shaft <b>548</b> and a second leg <b>552</b> which extends substantially at a right angle to the first leg <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A generally circular knob <b>554</b> having substantially the same diameter as the shaft <b>548</b> is provided opposite the arm <b>544</b> on an interior face <b>547</b> of the toggle switch <b>112</b>. The knob <b>554</b> is received within indentation <b>530</b> of the partition <b>524</b>. Knob <b>554</b> may snap fit within indention <b>530</b> to facilitate assembly. The centers of the shaft <b>548</b> and the knob <b>554</b> are aligned such that a line passing through the two centers is an axis of rotation of the toggle switch <b>112</b> when the toggle switch <b>112</b> is activated by user (with aid from the flat spring <b>555</b>) by moving the handle <b>540</b> between the first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present example, the shaft <b>548</b> fits within cutout <b>526</b> which rotatably engages the toggle switch <b>112</b> in the toggle structure <b>510</b>.

When the toggle structure <b>510</b> is mounted to the front plate <b>104</b>, cutout <b>526</b> of the toggle structure <b>510</b> mates with cutout <b>511</b> of the front plate <b>104</b> for receiving and securely holding shaft <b>548</b> while facilitating rotation of the arm <b>544</b> as the handle <b>540</b> is moved between positions. In one embodiment the arm <b>544</b> is at least partially stabilized by the cutout <b>526</b> and the cutout <b>511</b> when the toggle structure <b>510</b> is mounted to the front plate <b>104</b>. Since the cutouts <b>511</b> and <b>526</b> hold the shaft <b>548</b> in its place it is the location of the cutouts <b>511</b> and <b>526</b> which determine the position of the axis of rotation of the toggle switch <b>112</b> as the handle <b>540</b> is moved between positions. This is because the axis of rotation of the toggle switch <b>112</b> is the center of the shaft <b>548</b> whose position is decided by the position of the cutouts <b>511</b> and <b>526</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second leg <b>552</b> acts as a lever which moves up and down as the handle <b>540</b> is moved between positions. When the second leg <b>552</b> (also referred to as lever <b>552</b>) is in a down position it contacts an electrical component that causes power to flow through circuitry of the electrical device controller <b>100</b> so that power is provided to the load. When the lever <b>552</b> is in an up position it does not contact the electrical component, which causes a break in the circuitry of the electrical device controller <b>100</b> so that power is not provided to the load. In the present example the electrical component is a switching device that opens and breaks a circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the toggle switch <b>112</b> is assembled a flat spring <b>555</b> is placed inside the compartment <b>516</b> and lies on ribs provided on the floor of the compartment <b>516</b>.

The bottom of the base <b>542</b> is provided with a pointed projection <b>556</b> which impacts upon the flat spring <b>555</b> as the handle <b>540</b> is moved between positions. The flat spring <b>555</b> is formed of a resilient material, (which is metal in the current example, but is not limited thereto), which is biased to apply a force to the pointed projection <b>556</b>, causing the handle <b>540</b> to spring into its first or second position when a mild force is applied to the handle <b>540</b> in a direction that corresponds to the respective position. Rubber feet (not shown) may be mounted to opposing ends <b>558</b> of the base <b>542</b> which cushions the end <b>558</b> of the base <b>542</b> as it lands on the flat spring <b>555</b> due to the spring action of the toggle switch <b>112</b> caused by the flat spring <b>555</b> and cooperating projection <b>556</b>.

The axis of rotation of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> is the center of the knob <b>564</b> whose position is decided by the position of the cutout <b>528</b>. A top surface of the wheel <b>560</b> which is exposed to the user is provided with ribs <b>576</b> for providing aid to the user in actuating the rotary wheel <b>114</b>. A center rib <b>578</b> which is larger than the other ribs <b>576</b> signals to the user, visually and tactilely, a middle location of the wheel <b>560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As stated above, the cutouts <b>511</b> and <b>526</b> which engage the shaft <b>548</b> and thus determine the axis of rotation of the toggle switch <b>112</b>, and the cutout <b>528</b> engages the knob <b>564</b> and thus determines the axis of rotation of the rotary wheel <b>114</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, cutouts <b>526</b> and <b>528</b> are asymmetric, with cutout <b>526</b> positioned lower than cutout <b>528</b>. This causes a center of shaft <b>548</b> when engaged by cutout <b>526</b> to be positioned lower than a center of knob <b>564</b> when engaged by cutout <b>528</b>. Accordingly, the axis of rotation of the toggle switch <b>112</b> is lower than the axis of rotation of the rotary wheel <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The described structures of the toggle structure <b>510</b>, the toggle switch <b>112</b> and the rotary wheel <b>114</b> are exemplary and the disclosure is not limited thereto. Other structures could be used for engaging the toggle switch <b>112</b> and the rotary wheel <b>114</b> within the toggle structure <b>510</b> which allow for rotation of toggle switch <b>112</b> and rotary wheel <b>114</b> about different axes of rotation. For example, the toggle structure <b>510</b> may be provided with a round knob that is received within a rounded recess of the toggle switch <b>112</b> for allowing the toggle switch <b>112</b> to rotate about the round knob. Similar structures could be provided for the rotary wheel <b>114</b> such that the toggle switch <b>112</b> and the rotary wheel <b>114</b> having different axes of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">By providing the rotary wheel <b>114</b> with an axis of rotation that is higher than the axis of rotation of the toggle switch <b>112</b>, the user operable portion of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> is raised higher than it would be if the rotary wheel <b>114</b> had the same axis of rotation as the toggle switch <b>112</b>. Therefore, the diameter of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> may be minimized. This is true, because if the axis of rotation of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> were lower, such as if it were as low as the axis of rotation of the toggle switch <b>112</b>, the diameter of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> would have to be increased in order for a sufficient portion of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> to be exposed above the front plate <b>104</b> in order that the exposed portion be sufficiently raised above the top surface <b>103</b> of the front plate <b>104</b> to be easily hand operable by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Minimization of the diameter of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> enables minimization of the size of the toggle structure <b>510</b>, the aperture <b>106</b>, and the frame <b>108</b>, since all of the above are sized to accommodate the rotary wheel <b>114</b> and the toggle switch <b>112</b>. Minimization of the toggle structure <b>510</b>, the aperture <b>106</b>, and the frame <b>108</b> is beneficial due to the constraints of fitting all of the electrical and mechanical components in the space defined by the back body <b>102</b>. The size of the back body <b>102</b> may be limited to a standardized size or to a space allotted to it in the location where it to be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows that the potentiometer <b>208</b> is mounted on the vertical PCB <b>204</b> so that its tab <b>210</b> is perpendicular to the arms <b>562</b> of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> and so that it is positioned between the arms <b>562</b>. Inner faces <b>580</b> of the arms <b>562</b> engage the tab <b>210</b> by contacting opposing side faces <b>582</b> of tab <b>210</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, as the rotary wheel <b>114</b> is actuated by a user and rotated in a first direction B, arms <b>562</b> swing upwards in an arcuate fashion in the opposite direction C. The movement of arms <b>562</b> moves the tab <b>210</b> horizontally in a linear path along the linear sliding track <b>212</b> in direction D. Accordingly, the rotary motion of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> is translated into linear movement of tab <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> show the arms <b>562</b> and tab <b>210</b> at a first end position, and the dotted lines show the arms <b>562</b> and tab <b>210</b> at a second end position after the rotary wheel <b>114</b> has been rotated in a second direction E. When the rotary wheel is rotated in direction E, the aims <b>562</b> swing in an arcuate fashion in direction F, pushing tab <b>210</b> so that it slides horizontally in a linear path along the sliding track <b>212</b> in direction G. When the arms <b>562</b> are swung to the first end position, the tab <b>210</b> of the potentiometer <b>208</b> is pushed to one end of the sliding track <b>212</b>, and when the arms <b>562</b> are swung to the second end position, the tab <b>210</b> is pushed to the opposite end of the track <b>212</b>. In the example shown, when rotating the arms <b>562</b> from the first end position to the second position the aims <b>562</b> rotate through an angle of 56 degrees, however the disclosure is not limited thereto, and other ranges of motion of the arms <b>562</b> are envisioned.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the present example, the electrical device controller <b>100</b> includes first and second actuators, the toggle switch <b>112</b> and the rotary wheel <b>114</b>, which control a single lighting device, with the toggle switch <b>112</b> controlling on-off of the power delivered to the lighting device, and the rotary wheel <b>114</b> controlling the amount of power delivered to the lighting device when it is on. The present disclosure is not limited to two actuators or controlling one electrical device. For example, the first and second actuators may control two different electrical devices of one electrical appliance, such as where the toggle switch <b>112</b> controls the light portion of a ceiling fan and the rotary wheel <b>114</b> controls the speed of the fan, with the lowest setting of the rotary wheel <b>114</b> controlling the fan to stop. The first and second actuators may control two different electrical appliances, such as two different lighting appliances, with each appliance having independent electrical connections which are separately installed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, the electrical device controller <b>100</b> may include more than two actuators, with each rotary wheel coupled to a different potentiometer, and each toggle switch <b>112</b> coupled to a different electrical switch. For example, the electrical device controller <b>100</b> may include first and second toggle switches <b>112</b> for control on-off of the light and fan, respectively, of a ceiling fan, and first and second rotary wheels <b>114</b> for controlling the amount of power delivered to each of the light and the fan when in activated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although the present disclosure has been described in accordance with the embodiments shown, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that there could be variations to the embodiment and these variations would be within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. Accordingly, many modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
