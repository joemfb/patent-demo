<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIMS OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application claims priority from:</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">(1) U.S. Utility patent application Ser. No. 11/375,911 filed on Mar. 15, 2006.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of software, database, and/or hardware technology and, in one example embodiment, to a method, system, and/or apparatus of automatic meta-data sharing of existing media to create streamable collections.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A user (e.g., a music fan, a movie patron, a computer gaming patron, an e-book reader) may purchase a media content (e.g., musical, theatrical, artistic, cultural, hobby, etc.) through a service (e.g., Apple&#xae; iTunes, Napster&#xae;, Rhapsody&#xae;, etc.). The user may download the media content to a client device (e.g., a home computer, a work computer, a laptop, a portable media player, etc.) after purchase from the service. The user may have multiple client devices from which the user may wish to access (e.g., listen to) the media content.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sometimes, the user may wish to access the media content from client devices of others (e.g., friends, strangers, from a web caf&#xe9;, etc.). The user may copy the media content after downloading it to the client device. However, this may violate a copyright protection (e.g., duplication license, distribution license, reproduction limitation) of an owner of the media content. Furthermore, the media content may fail to operate from client devices not authorized by the owner of the media content. As a result, the user may not have universal access to the media content from any client device.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method, system, and/or apparatus of automatic meta-data sharing of existing media to create streamable collections are disclosed. In one aspect, a method of a server device includes analyzing a media data of a client device to determine at least one meta-data identifier associated with the media data, automatically populating a new mark-up language file using a existing media-collection data associated with certain items of the media data, and creating a streamable media content of the existing media-collection data on the server device based on a reference of the at least one meta-data identifier associated with each of the existing media collection data with a content database of a central server.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The method may include communicating the streamable media content from the central server to the user on any client device without requiring consideration of the user to access the media content. The content database may include content of artists and/or media labels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The meta-data identifier may be generated by a client application that is agnostic of a type of media player application compatible with the media data. The new mark-up language file may include an arrangement (e.g., a collection, a hierarchy, etc.) of the existing media-collection data of the certain items associated with the media data of the client device. The existing media-collection data may be executable by interested parties as a radio station.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The new mark-up language file and the arrangement may be associated with a particular user. In addition, the particular user may be associated with other mark-up language files associated with other users based on similar attributes in the arrangement of the particular user and other arrangements associated with the other users. A compatibility rating may be determined between the user and the other users based on the similar attributes between the arrangement and the other arrangements and each user of the server device may be enabled to view mark-up language files of the other users. A particular one of the other users may be registered when the particular one of the other users responds to a hook data in a communication between the user and the other users. A group may be formed between the user and at least one of the other users based on a threshold parameter of the compatibility rating. The other users may include an admired user whose contribution is shared with the group.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The new mark-up language file may include a 30 second media segment of certain items of the media data that is associated with the existing media-collection. The media data may be a multimedia data and the meta-data identifier may be determined primarily based on an audio data embedded in the multimedia data. The existing media-collection data may be generated by analyzing a usage pattern of at least one of the client device and a peripheral device. The peripheral device may be a portable media player and the client device may be a two-way mobile communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A widget chosen from a group including a party widget, a personal details widget, a tag widget, a guestbook widget, an internal messaging widget, a share widget, a photo widget, a tuned-in now widget, a post widget, a reviews widget, and/or a live event widget may be applied to the new mark-up language file. The widget may be a drag and drop widget and the content data created using the post widget may be automatically displayed on the new mark-up language file and an artist mark-up language file, an album mark-up language file, a particular item mark-up language file, and/or a fan club mark-up language file. The content data may be displayed before other content data when a peer client device affiliated with the client device reaches the artist mark-up language file, the album mark-up language file, the particular item mark-up language file, and/or the fan club mark-up language file through the new mark-up language file.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A payment may be processed from an interested party when the new mark-up language file develops a patron base above a threshold value and an advertisement of the interested party may be displayed on the new mark-up language file. The new mark-up language file may be localized in any number of languages including English, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, German, French, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese and/or Italian.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, a method of a client device includes communicating a media data to a server device to determine at least one meta-data identifier associated with the media data and automatically refreshing a new mark-up language file using a existing media-collection data associated with the certain items of the media data. The new mark-up language file includes a streamable version of the media data based on the meta-data identifier being referenced with a content database of a central server.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The media data may not be transferred from the client device to the central server. The streamable version of the media data may be accessable across different client devices associated with a user. The method may include applying the meta-data identifier may be applied (e.g., such that it may be agnostic of a type of media player application compatible with the media data).

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another embodiment a method of a client device <b>104</b> includes communicate a media data <b>116</b> to a server device <b>100</b> to determine at least one meta-data identifier associated with the media data <b>116</b> and to automatically refresh a new mark-up language (e.g., the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) using a existing media-collection data associated with certain items of the media data <b>116</b>. The new mark-up language file <b>214</b> includes a streamable version of the media data based on the meta-data identifier being referenced with a content database of a central server (e.g., the central server <b>118</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In yet another embodiment a network <b>102</b> includes a client device <b>104</b> to apply at least one meta-data identifier such that it is agnostic of a type of media player application compatible with the media data <b>116</b> and a server device <b>100</b> to automatically populate a new mark-up language file (e.g., the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) using a existing media-collection data associated with at least some content identified by the at least one meta-data identifier and to create a streamable media content of the existing media-collection data on the server device based on a reference of the at least one meta-data identifier associated with each of the existing media collection data with a content database of a central server (e.g., the central server <b>118</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It will be appreciated that the various embodiments discussed herein may/may not be the same embodiment, and may be grouped into various other embodiments not explicitly disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a network diagram of a server device <b>100</b>, a client device <b>104</b>, a peer client device <b>106</b>, the central server <b>118</b>, and an admired client device <b>108</b> communicating a media data <b>116</b> through a network <b>102</b> (e.g., an Internet network, a local area network, a wide area network, etc.) according to one embodiment. In one embodiment the client device <b>104</b> may apply at least one meta-data identifier such that it is agnostic of a type of media player application (e.g., unknown of the type of media player application) compatible with the media data <b>116</b>. The client device <b>104</b> may include a client application module <b>110</b> and a peripheral device <b>112</b> according to one embodiment. The client application module <b>110</b> may be best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as will later be described. The central server <b>118</b> may be a set of computers that may store applications and/or data files shared by many different people on the network <b>102</b> (e.g., over an internet, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment the server device <b>100</b> automatically populates a new mark-up language file (e.g., the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) using a existing media-collection data associated with at least some content (e.g., media content) identified by the at least one meta-data identifier. The server device may create a streamable media content of the existing media-collection data on the server device based on a reference of the at least one meta-data identifier associated with each of the existing media collection data with a content database of the central server <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The peer client device <b>106</b> may be assigned a kin status with the client device <b>104</b> (e.g., related to the client device <b>104</b>) based on similarity between the existing media-collection data of the client device <b>104</b> and another media-collection data (e.g., existing and/or new) of the peer client device <b>106</b> according to one embodiment. In one embodiment the admired client device <b>108</b> may share an admired media-collection data (e.g., a history data admired by the client device <b>104</b> and/or the peer client device <b>106</b>) with the client device <b>104</b> and the peer client device <b>106</b>. The client device <b>104</b>, the peer client device <b>106</b> and the admired client device <b>108</b> may together form a client group <b>114</b> (e.g., shown on the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> by the client group display <b>808</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) based on similarities in the existing media-collection data. Additional details of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is block diagram of the server device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> having a media requestor module <b>200</b>, a media processing module <b>202</b>, a profile generator module <b>204</b>, a user profile database <b>206</b>, a media database <b>208</b>, a relationship module <b>210</b>, an override module <b>212</b>, a transaction module <b>216</b>, and a new mark-up language file <b>214</b> according to one embodiment. The media requestor module <b>200</b> may create a media data request (e.g., request for media data <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the server device <b>100</b> may communicate the media data request to the client device <b>104</b> through the network <b>102</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, according to one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment the server device <b>100</b> may analyze the media data <b>116</b> of the client device <b>104</b> to determine at least one meta-data identifier associated with the media data <b>116</b> and may automatically populate a new mark-up language file (e.g., the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) using a play-list history data (e.g., an existing media-collection data) associated with certain items of the media data <b>116</b>. The server device <b>100</b> communicating the streamable media content from the central server <b>118</b> to the user on any client device without requiring consideration of the user to access the media content, wherein the content database includes content of a plurality of artists and media labels.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Specifically the media processing module <b>202</b> may process the media data <b>116</b> received from the client device <b>104</b>. The media processing module <b>202</b> may include a data analyzer <b>218</b> and media algorithms <b>220</b>. The data analyzer <b>218</b> may be used to analyze the media data <b>116</b> using a processor (e.g., such as a processor <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to determine at least one meta-data identifier associated with the media data. The data analyzer <b>218</b> may also reference the media algorithms <b>220</b> and/or a media database <b>208</b> to analyze and/or process the media data <b>116</b> communicated by the client device <b>104</b>. The media data <b>116</b> received by the data analyzer <b>218</b> may be multimedia data according to one embodiment. Particularly, the at least one meta-data identifier may be determined by the data analyzer <b>218</b> by referencing media algorithms <b>220</b> and/or media database <b>208</b> and carrying out comparative analysis of the media data (e.g., comparison of audio data embedded in the multimedia data with a known value in the media database <b>208</b>) to identify content (e.g., media content) associated to the at least one meta-data identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The profile generator module <b>204</b> may be used to generate a user profile (e.g., a user media profile) based on analyzing a user's media data (e.g., analysis of a play-list history data associated with certain items of the media data, meta-data identifier, etc.) communicated by the client device <b>104</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and associating an arrangement (e.g., any hierarchy, arrangement and/or collection such as a music collection on a hard drive) of the play-list history data (e.g., e.g., existing media-collection data) and a new mark-up language file (e.g., the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which may include the arrangement of the play-list history data to the user. The profile generator module <b>204</b> is best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as will later be described.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The relationship module <b>210</b> may establish relationships between a particular user profile and other user profiles by associating a particular user with other mark-up language files associated with other users based on similar attributes (e.g., songs, artists, albums, movies, genre, authors, etc.) in the arrangement (e.g., hierarchy of the play-list history data) of the particular user and other arrangements associated with other users, according to one embodiment. In one embodiment the relationship module <b>210</b> may include a profile analyzer <b>222</b> and compatibility algorithms <b>224</b>. The profile analyzer <b>222</b> may reference the user profile database <b>206</b> and/or the compatibility algorithms <b>224</b> to analyze and establish relationships between a particular user profile and other user profiles. Specifically, the profile analyzer <b>222</b> may determine a compatibility rating between the user and the other users based on similar attributes (e.g., songs, artists, albums, movies, genre, authors, etc.) between the arrangement (e.g., hierarchy of the play-list history data of the user) and the other arrangements (e.g., hierarchy of the play-list history data of the other user) and enable each user of the server device <b>100</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to view mark-up language files (e.g., web pages) of the other users.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment the relationship module <b>210</b> may register (e.g., relate and/or connect) a particular one of the other users when the particular one of the other users responds to a hook data (e.g., an invitation to connect, invitation to join a group, etc.) in a communication between the user and the other users. The relationship module <b>210</b> may also form a group (e.g., the client group <b>114</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) between the user (e.g., the client device <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and at least one of the other users (e.g., the peer client device <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) based on a threshold parameter (e.g., a certain value) of the compatibility rating.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The group (e.g., the client group <b>114</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may also include an admired user (e.g., the admired client device <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) whose contribution (e.g., play-list history data of the admired user, suggestions, media discovery, etc.) may be shared with the group. The relationship module may automatically populate details of a group (e.g., client group display <b>808</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to the user's mark-up language file (e.g., the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The override module <b>212</b> may be used to facilitate a user override (e.g., manually override automatic system settings) to modify the arrangement of the play-list history data associated with the media data <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment the server device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may generate a modified arrangement based on applying an addition (e.g., adding media content), deletion (e.g., deleting media content) and/or an adjust (e.g., changing and/or replacing media content) operation of the user override on the arrangement (e.g., hierarchy) and automatically populating a new mark-up language file (e.g., the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) based on the modified arrangement. Specifically the arrangement of the play-list history data associated with media data <b>116</b> communicated by the profile generator module <b>204</b> may be modified with the help of a user interface (e.g., the user interface view of the override module <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) to generate a modified arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">This modified arrangement may then be populated on the new mark-up language file <b>214</b>. For example, based on a particular user's usage pattern the system may decide a user's media history (e.g., &#x201c;Summer of 69&#x201d; as the last song played, etc.) or a user's media rating (e.g., Bryan Adams as the top artist this month, etc.). But the user may have consumed other media (e.g., listened to Aerosmith on a friend's computer and/or a radio station, etc.) which may not have been addressed by the system. User override may allow the user to manually override the system settings and replace media content with more accurate description of the user's media consumption (e.g., replace Bryan Adams in the earlier example with Aerosmith). The user interface view of override module <b>212</b> is best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, as will later be described.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The profile generator module <b>204</b> may then be used to generate a new user profile (e.g., modified user profile) based on the modified arrangement. The relationship module <b>210</b> may also be used to develop new groups (e.g., like the client group display <b>808</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and relationships based on the modified arrangement generated by the override module <b>212</b> between the user (e.g., client device <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and at least one of the other users (e.g., peer client device <b>106</b> and/or admired client device <b>108</b>) based on a threshold parameter of the new compatibility rating. Specifically a new profile (e.g., modified user profile) for a user may be generated by associating the particular user with the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> and the modified arrangement. The particular user may also be associated with other mark-up language files associated with other users based on similar attributes (e.g., songs, artists, albums, movies, genre, authors, etc.) in the modified arrangement (e.g., hierarchy) of the particular user and other arrangements (e.g., hierarchies) associated with other users. A new compatibility rating may be determined between the user and the other users based on similar attributes between the modified arrangement and the other arrangements by a procedure similar to the one described for the relationship module <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, the modifying operation may be performed on a widget from a group comprising of a party widget, a personal detail widget (e.g., the personal detail widget <b>816</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), a tag widget (e.g., the tag widget <b>906</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), a guestbook widget, an internal messaging widget (e.g., the internal messaging widget <b>904</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), a share widget (e.g., the share widget <b>814</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), a photo widget (e.g., the photo widget <b>812</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), a tuned-in now widget (e.g., the tuned-in now widget <b>908</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), a post widget (e.g., the post widget <b>902</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), a reviews widget, and/or a live event widget. Especially when a delete operation is performed on the post widget (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), content data created using the post widget <b>902</b> may be automatically deleted from the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> and from an artist mark-up language file, an album mark-up language file, a particular item mark-up language file, and/or a fan club mark-up language file simultaneously. For example by deleting a particular post widget (e.g., post on Bob Dylan) from the new mark-up language file (e.g., the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) the post not only gets deleted from the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> but also gets deleted from the artist mark-up language file (e.g., the artist mark-up language file <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> belonging to Bob Dylan) simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The transaction module <b>216</b> may process a payment from an interested party (e.g., vendor, service provider, etc.) when the new mark-up language file (e.g., the new mark-up language file <b>214</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) develops a patron base (e.g., a fan following, popularity, etc.) above a threshold value (e.g., number of hits that the new mark-up language file may receive) and may display an advertisement (e.g., the advertisement <b>810</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the interested party on the new mark-up language file <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, operations may begin in the server device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> when the media data <b>116</b> requested by the media requester module <b>200</b> from the client device <b>104</b> is received by the media processing module <b>202</b>. Specifically, the media data <b>116</b> may be transmitted to the data analyzer <b>218</b>. The data analyzer <b>218</b> may then reference media algorithms <b>220</b> and/or media database <b>208</b> to determine the meta-data identifier and/or identify the content associated with the meta-data identifier of the media data <b>116</b> based on comparison of the audio data embedded in the multimedia data of media data <b>116</b> with the media database <b>208</b>. The profile generator module <b>204</b> may then generate a user profile based on associating the arrangement of the play-list history data of the media data and the new mark-up language file with the user. The user profile may be stored in the user profile database <b>206</b>. The profile generator module <b>204</b> may further process the media data and automatically populate it on the new mark up language file (e.g., based on the widgets selected by the user though the widget select module <b>310</b> as described later in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
