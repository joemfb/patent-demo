<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A data recording and reproducing configuration in which both of BDMV standard compliant data and BDMV standard non-compliant data can be used is realized. A plurality of directories are set in a recording media, and a recording destination directory is selected according to the types of data. The BDMV standard compliant data is recorded in a BDMV directory, and the BDMV standard non-compliant data, for example, 1080/60<i>p </i>or 3D image data are recorded in a BDAV or BU directory. At the time of data reproducing process, a virtual file system in which the recorded data in the BDMV directory and the recorded data in the BDAV/BU directory are consolidated is constructed to achieve the reproducing process. With this configuration, the recording and reproducing of the BDMV standard compliant data and the BDMV standard non-compliant data are achieved.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus, an information recording medium and an information processing method, and a program. More specifically, the present invention relates to an information processing apparatus, an information recording medium and an information processing method, and a program which are configured to execute a data recording process or a data reproducing process using recording media such as disks, flash memories and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">For example, recording and reproducing apparatuses such as PCs, video cameras, players, recorders, and the like perform data recording and reproducing using various media such as disk-type media including hard disk, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs (Registered Trademark) and the like, and flush memories.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When the data recording and reproducing is performed using these media, the data recording and reproducing apparatus performs a data recording and reproducing process according to a format defined in advance by applying a recording and reproducing application compliant with a predetermined standard. For example, examples of application standards for recording and reproducing a high-definition high-vision video include BDMV and BDAV. These application standards are designed as application standards for data recording and reproducing using mainly a BD (Blu-ray Disc (registered trademark)). The BD standard is described, for example, in Patent Document 1 (JP-A-2007-179671).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the BDMV or the BDAV are application standards for the data recording and reproducing using mainly the BD as described above, the recording media is not limited to the BD, and are data recording and reproducing application standards which are applicable to the data recording and reproducing using not only the BD, but also other media such as flush memories as the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The BDMV is an application standard developed for BD-ROMs in which, for example, movie contents or the like are recorded in advance and, principally, is widely used as BD-ROMs which do not allow rewriting of packaged contents or the like. The BDMV is characterized in that navigation commands or BD-J as programs for controlling reproduction according to a user's operation are stored in a disk to provide an interactive function intended by a content producer. The BDMV is also characterized in that recording and reproducing using a menu screen including graphics and buttons are enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For reference sake, the BDMV has several versions and, for example, BD-RE 3.0 standard, which is one of standards of the BDMV, is an application standard which is applicable also to recordable BD disks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In contrast, the BDAV is an application standard developed for the purpose of being used for BD-RES which are rewritable and BD-Rs which allow recording only once.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The BDAV is, for example, a standard used very often for recording and reproducing videos shot by the users using a video camera or the like or for recording and reproducing TV programs using a video recorder or the like. The BDAV does not have an interactive function or a program for realizing creation of a menu in various designs or a display process like the BDMV and does not have a function such as a button display process. The menu provided by the BDAV standard are simple listed data made up of thumbnail images. If utilization of the menu in various designs or the interactive function provided by the BDMV standard is wanted, a program on the side of the recording and reproducing apparatus is used. In other words, there is no other choice than using, for example, functions integrated on the side of a recorder or a player.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The BDMV standard is a standard designed for the purpose of not hindering reproduction of the packaged contents such as movies recorded in the BD using BD-ROM players which are already diffused widely. In order to ensure reproduction compatibility, specifications are strictly defined by a standards organization being named as BDA (Blu-ray Disc Association).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The BDMV standard also imposes limitations on modes of data of contents to be recorded in media such as a disk and the like. More specifically, for example, data which can be recorded as HD (High Definition) images is defined to be only data of predetermined formats such as 1080/60i and 1080/50i. The expression [1080/60i] indicates that HD (High Definition) images having 1920&#xd7;1080 pixels are recorded and reproduced on the basis of 1080 lines as 60 field images per second using an interlace system. The symbol [i] denotes the interlace system. In this connection, a progressive system is denoted by [p].</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present high-vision data is defined as an image of 1920&#xd7;1080 pixels. However, apparatuses which are capable of recording and reproducing images of approximately 4000&#xd7;2000 pixels (=4K&#xd7;2K) as higher-definition images are developed. In addition, various apparatuses such as [1080/60p] which performs recording and reproducing in the progressive system, which is different from the interlace system described above, or apparatuses which perform recording and reproducing for right eye images and left eye images for 3D images, which are three-dimensional images, have been developed. In particular, the video cameras developed in recent years are capable of recording 1080/60p images described above, 3D images, or 4K&#xd7;2K images, and are considered to be used widely in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, as described above, the current BDMV standard does not allow the 4K&#xd7;2K images or 1080/60p, and 3D image data as recording and reproducing data. Therefore, there is a problem in that even when the super high-definition images of 4 k&#xd7;2 k are generated as the recording data, data recording conforming the existing BDMV standard cannot be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In contrast, the BDAV standard allows recording of AV data in various formats on the precondition of being used in recorders. Therefore, there is no constraint of reproduction compatibility except that part of the AV data formats must be absolutely reproducible. Therefore, the BDAV has flexibility in expansion of standards in comparison with the BDMV. In other words, the 4K&#xd7;2K images or 1080/60p, and 3D image data can be set as the recording and reproducing data. However, there is a problem in that the interactive function and the menu screen made up of graphics and buttons cannot be used as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is also possible to use an apparatus which is capable of executing both of the recording and reproducing process compliant with the BDAV application standard, and the recording and reproducing process compliant with the BDMV application standard. However, in this case, for example, utilization of the user friendly menu having titles and designs created by using the BDMV function is enabled as regards the data set in the BDMV directory. However, the menu described above cannot be used when reproducing the image set in the BDAV directory, and there is no choice but to use a simple listed data including thumbnail images created by the BDAV function.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other words, even with the apparatus which is capable of processing both of the BDMV data and the BDAV data, there is a problem in that data access such as a data reproduction command set in the BDMV directory and the BDAV directory cannot be performed using a consolidated menu.</p>

[1. Outline of BDMV Standard and BDAV Standard]
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0085">First of all, an outline of existing BDMV standard and BDAV standard will be described. As described above, the BDMV standard and the BDAV standard are designed as application standards for data recording and reproduction using mainly a BD (Blu-ray Disc (Registered Trademark)), but is an application standard which can be applied to the data recording and reproduction using other media such as a flash memory without limiting the recording media to the BD.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0086">The BDMV is an application standard developed for BD-ROMs in which, for example, movie contents or the like are recorded in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0087">The BDAV is an application standard developed for the purpose of being used for BD-REs which are rewritable and BD-Rs which allow recording only once.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0088">A BDMV directory as a data recording configuration recorded in the media compliant with the BDMV standard is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The BDMV standard described below complies with BD-RE 3.0 standard, which is one of standards of the BDMV which permits the data recording process to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the BDMV standard, when recording data in the media, for example, the moving image stream is coded into MPEG2-TS stream for recording. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the BDMV directory is placed under a root [Root] directory as directory [BDMV].</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0090">Immediately below the directory [BDMV],</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0091">an index file [index.bdmv], and</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0092">a movie object file [MovieObject.bdmv] are recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0093">In addition, as descendent directories of the BDMV directory [BDMV],</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0094">a playlist directory [PLSYLIST],</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0095">a clip information directory [CLIPINF],</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0096">a stream directory [STREAM],</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0097">a BDJO directory [BDJO], and</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0098">a JAR directory [JAR] are set.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0099">Playlist files [xxxxx.mpls] are set in the playlist directory [PLAYLIST], clip information files [xxxxx.clpi] are set in the clip information directory [CLIPINF], and clip AV stream files [xxxxx.m2ts] are set in the stream directory [STREAM].</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0100">The index file, the movie object file, and the playlist file are management information files applied to reproduction of data stored in the clip AV stream file. These management information files are referred to as data base files, or data base. Detailed description of the respective files will be given below.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0101">The index file [index.bdmv] is a management information file for the recording data of the entire media. For example, indices (information on the relation of correspondence between titles and movie objects) are recorded for the respective titles set as units of the recording data. When the medium (information recording medium) is loaded on a recording and reproducing apparatus, the index file is read first, so that a user can view the titles described in the index file and specify the reproduction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0102">The movie object file [MovieObject.bdmv] is a file in which the management information on the playlists is stored. A plurality of programs for executing a reproducing process using the various playlists are included. A program to be applied to an AV stream reproducing process and, for example, a program to be applied to a menu display process are also included.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0103">The playlist files [xxxxx.mpls] recorded in the playlist directory [PLAYLIST] are provided corresponding to the titles displayed to the user, and are reproduction lists each including at least one play item. Each play item is a reproduction segment specifying information having a reproduction start point (IN-point) and a reproduction end point (OUT-point) for the clip. By arranging a plurality of the play items in the playlist, on a time axis, the order of reproduction of the respective reproduction segments can be specified.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0104">The clip information files [xxxxx.clpi] recorded in the clip information directory [CLIPINF] are set corresponding to the AV stream files [xxxxx.m2ts] recorded in the stream directory [STREAM]. The clip information files are files in which information on a stream required when reproducing the actual stream is written.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0105">The AV stream files [xxxxx.m2ts] recorded in the stream directory [STREAM] are files in which the streams recorded in MPEG2-TS format are stored. The image data is stored in these files.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0106">In the BDJO directory [BDJO] and the JAR directory [JAR], for example, various data processing programs, functions, and so on applied with Java (registered trademark) are stored. For example, a program for setting the virtual file system used in the data reproducing process, a program to be applied to menu creating and menu displaying processes, and a program for realizing an interactive function at the time of data recording and reproduction are included.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0107">For reference sake, in the BDMV directory, for example, directories for recording back up data and AACS related data files such as copyright management information are set in addition to the directories and files shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0108">For reference sake, in the following description, the files in which the data-to-be-reproduced are stored such as the AV stream file are collectively referred to as &#x201c;stream files&#x201d; for brevity. Also, the index file, the movie object file, the playlist file, and the clip information file are collectively referred to as management information or data base.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0109">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the BDAV directory as a data recording configuration recorded in the media compliant with the BDAV standard will be described. The BDAV standard described below complies with BD-RE2.1 standard, which is one of standards of the BDAV. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the BDAV directory is placed under the root [Root] directory as directory [BDAV].</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0110">Immediately below the directory [BDAV],</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0111">an info file [info.bdav],</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0112">menu files [menu.tidx], [menu.tdt1/tdt2], and</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0113">mark files [mark.tidx], [mark.tdt1/tdt2] are recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0114">In addition, as descendent directories of the BDAV directory [BDAV],</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0115">the playlist directory [PLSYLIST]</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0116">the clip information directory [CLIPINF], and</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0117">the stream directory [STREAM] are set.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0118">The playlist files [xxxxx.mpls] are set in the playlist directory [PLAYLIST], the clip information files [xxxxx.clpi] are set in the clip information directory [CLIPINF], and the AV stream files [xxxxx.m2ts] are set in the stream directory [STREAM].</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0119">The info file [info.bdav] is a file in which the management information on the entire BDAV directory is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0120">In the menu files [menu.tidx], [menu.tdt1/tdt2], thumbnail images of representative images of the respective AV stream files are stored. The [menu.tidx] stores thumbnail management information, and the [menu.tdt1/tdt2] stores thumbnail images.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0121">Unlike the BDMV standard, the BDAV standard does not provide a function to create a menu having various information, and is set to provide a simple menu display which displays leading images of videos shot by the user in the form of thumbnails. The menu files [menu.tidx], [menu.tdt1/tdt2] manage and store the thumbnail images therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0122">The mark files [mark.tidx], [mark.tdt1/tdt2] are files in which the thumbnail images corresponding to marked positions which are index information set in an editing process on the images shot by the user (AV stream file) are managed and stored. The [mark.tidx] stores the thumbnail management information and [mark.tdt1/tdt2] stores thumbnail images.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0123">The playlist directory [PLAYLIST], the clip information directory [CLIPINF], and the stream directory [STREAM] are set in substantially similar to the BDMV directory described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> above.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0124">The playlist files [xxxxx.rpls] are recorded in the play dist directory [PLAYLIST].</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0125">The clip information files are recorded in the clip information directory [CLIPINF], and the AV stream files [xxxxx.m2ts] recorded in MPEG2-TS format for example, are recorded in the stream directory [STREAM].</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0126">As described thus far with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and FIG. <b>2</b>, the BDMV directory and the BDAV directory have similar configuration, but the BDMV application standard and the BDAV application standard are different in data format which permits recording and reproducing. Also, there is a significant difference in menu creating functions and interactive functions.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0127">The difference between the BDMV application standard and the BDAV application standard will be described with reference to a table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0128">(<i>a</i>) Recording and Reproducing Permitted Data</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0129">The BDMV application standard is strict in restriction on the data formats which can be recorded and reproduced. For example, in the case of the BDMV application standard, recording and reproduction of the [1080/60p image], which is a HD (High Definition) image having 1920&#xd7;1080 pixels in a progressive system or 3D images as three-dimensional images, or 4K&#xd7;2K images having approximately 4000&#xd7;2000 pixels are not permitted.</p>

<p id="p-0136" num="0140">The BDMV apparatus sets the BDMV directory shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a medium (recording medium) to execute the data recording and reproducing process, and the BDAV apparatus sets the BDAV directory shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as a medium (recording medium) to execute the data recording and reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0141">However, many of the apparatuses which perform the recording and reproducing process compliant with the BDAV application standard are capable of executing a reproducing process function compliant with the BDMV application standard.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0142">These apparatuses are capable of performing processes using the BDAV application for the recording and reproducing process using the recordable media such as BD-REs or BD-Rs, and using the BDMV application when reproducing the BD-ROMs in which the movie or the like is already recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0143">Therefore, the BDAV player, or the BDAV recorder, or the BDAV (recording and reproducing) apparatus will be described as apparatus which are capable of executing both of the recording and reproducing process compliant with the BDAV application standard and the recording and reproducing process compliant with the BDMV application standard.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0144">The BDMV application standard and the BDAV application standard are standards designed by the BDA (Blu-ray Disc Association) as described above. For example, materials are disclosed in [http://www.blu-raydisc.com/].</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0145">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the BDMV apparatus which executes the recording and reproducing process compliant with the BDMV standard is used, recording of 1080/60p images, 3D images, and 4K&#xd7;2K images cannot be achieved. For example, even when the 1080/60p images, the 3D images, the 4K&#xd7;2K images and the like are shot with a video camera compliant with the BDMV standard, these images cannot be recorded. If the BDAV standard is complied with, recording is possible. However, there is a problem in that the high-performance menu or the interactive function cannot be used.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0146">As described above, it is possible to use the apparatus which can execute both of the recording and reproducing process compliant with the BDAV application standard and the recording and reproducing process compliant with the BDMV application standard. However, even when the apparatus described above is used, although utilization of the high-performance menu according to the BDMV function is possible for the data set in the BDMV directory, this menu cannot be used for reproducing the data set in the BDAV directly and hence there is no choice but using the thumbnails created by the BDAV function.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0147">In other words, even with the apparatus which is capable of processing both of the BDMV data and the BDAV data, there is a problem in that data access such as a data reproduction command set in the BDMV directory and the BDAV directory cannot be performed using consolidated menu.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0148">A configuration which solves these problems will be described below. In other words, it is a configuration which allows recording and reproducing of the BDMV standard non-compliant data such as 1080/60p images, 3D images, 4K&#xd7;2K images and the like which are not permitted to be recorded and reproduced in the BDMV standard and, simultaneously, allows access to both of the BDMV standard compliant data and the BDMV standard non-compliant data from one menu.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0149">In the configuration according to the present invention described below, both of the BDMV standard compliant data and the BDMV standard non-compliant data can be accessed and reproduced from one menu in the BDMV apparatus of the related art without causing any problem in reproduction compatibility and, in the apparatuses which are capable of reproducing the BDMV standard non-compliant data, by using the expanded reproduction mechanism of the BDMV. In addition, in Example 1 described below, although the reproduction by expanding the BDMV reproduction mechanism cannot be achieved, the decoding function of the expanded stream, which is the BDMV standard non-compliant data is provided, while in the apparatuses having the BDAV reproducing mechanism, direct reproduction is also possible by using the BDAV reproducing mechanism.</p>

In this example, the medium <b>110</b> is, for example, a data recordable BD (Blu-ray Disc (registered trademark)). For reference sake, the medium <b>110</b> is not limited to the BD, but may be other media such as a flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0156">The information processing apparatus <b>100</b> further includes a local memory <b>120</b> made up of a hard disk or the like, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0157">First of all, a data recording process for the medium <b>110</b> by the information processing apparatus <b>100</b> will be described. The medium <b>110</b> is assumed to be a data recordable medium, for example, a BD-RE, or a BD-R.

Also, when recording data having formats other than the BDMV standard, for example, the BDMV standard non-compliant data such as 1080/60p images, 3D images, and 4K&#xd7;2K images as described above, a process of recording in the BDAV directory <b>112</b> is executed. In the following description, the BDMV standard non-compliant data such as 1080/60p images, 3D images, and 4K&#xd7;2K images is referred to as expanded data.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0166">However, even when the BDMV standard compliant data, it can be recorded in the BDAV directory. Detailed recording process sequence will be described later with reference to a flowchart.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0167">For the reference sake, at the time of data recording process, creation or renewal and recording process are performed not only on the AV stream file, but also on the clip information file and the playlist file.

<p id="p-0164" num="0168">When the data recording process is executed, the management information on the BU directory <b>113</b> is renewed.

<p id="p-0165" num="0169">In this manner, the information processing apparatus <b>100</b> in this example executes the process of recording basically in the BDMV directory <b>111</b> for the BDMV standard compliant data, and executes the process of recording in the BDAV directory <b>112</b> for the expanded data (BDMV standard non-compliant data).</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0170">Subsequently, an outline of the data reproducing process will be described.

<p id="p-0169" num="0173">In the related art, these programs could not be used for the data recorded in the BDAV directory.

<p id="p-0170" num="0174">At the time of reproducing process, as shown in Step S<b>21</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a process of copying the expansion data (BDMV standard non-compliant data) file (AV stream file) recorded in the BDAV directory <b>112</b> and the management information file recorded in the BU directory <b>113</b> or the like in the local memory <b>120</b> is performed as a first step.

<p id="p-0171" num="0175">Subsequently, in Step S<b>22</b> (S<b>22</b><i>a</i>, S<b>22</b><i>b</i>), a binding process is performed on the respective data in the BDMV directory <b>111</b> and following directories recorded in the medium <b>110</b> and the BUDA <b>121</b> in the local memory to construct a virtual file system (VFS) <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0176">In Step S<b>23</b>, the reproducing process using the constructed virtual file system (VFS) <b>130</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0177">The virtual file system (VFS) <b>130</b> is a virtual file system used by a reproduction application executed by the information processing apparatus <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0182" num="0186">The application program <b>150</b> performs a process similar to a process to be performed by using the BDMV directory <b>111</b> of the medium <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0183" num="0187">In order to solve the problem, a file name conversion table (manifest file (BUMF)) <b>151</b> is used.

<p id="p-0223" num="0227">Referring first to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the data recording process sequence in this example will be described.</p>

<p id="p-0225" num="0229">In Step S<b>101</b>, the AV stream to be recorded is whether or not the BDMV standard compliant data is determined.

When recording these data, the determination in Step S<b>101</b> is No.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0230">For example, if the AV stream to be recorded is the BDMV standard compliant data such as [1080/60i image], the determination in Step S<b>101</b> is Yes, and the procedure goes to Step S<b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0231">In Step S<b>102</b>, whether or not it is necessary to make the BDMV standard compliant data reproducible by using the BDMV player of the related art is determined. This determination may be performed by the user, or may be automatically determined by setting in advance to either of those. The determining process in Step S<b>102</b> is a determination step for permitting even the BDMV standard data-to-be-recorded in the BDAV directory. In a case where all the BDMV standard compliant data are set to be recorded in the BDMV directory, the determining process in the Step S<b>102</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0232">If the result of determination in Step S<b>102</b> is Yes, the procedure goes to Step S<b>103</b>, and the AV stream is recorded in the stream directory [STREAM] in the BDMV directory.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0233">In contrast, if the result of determination in Step S<b>101</b> is No, that is, if the data-to-be-recorded is an expanded data which is not the BDMV standard compliant data, and if the result of determination in Step S<b>102</b> is No, that is, the data-to-be-recorded is a BDMV standard compliant data is to be recorded in the BDAV directory, the procedure goes to Step S<b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0234">In Step S<b>104</b>, the AV stream is recorded in the stream directory [STREAM] in the BDAV directory.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0235">In this manner, the information processing apparatus in this example determines whether or not the data-to-be-recorded in the recording media is the standard compliant data compliant to the BDMV standard and, if it is the BDMV standard compliant data, selects the BDMV directory to record the BDMV standard compliant data set in the recording media as the recording destination on a priority basis and, when the data-to-be-recorded is the expanded data (BDMV standard non-compliant data), selects the BDAV directory different from the BDMV directory as the recording destination and performs the data recording process.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0236">When the process in Step S<b>103</b> or Step S<b>104</b> is ended, the procedure goes to Step S<b>105</b>.

<p id="p-0233" num="0237">In Step S<b>106</b>, the management information (database) corresponding to the AV stream recorded in the BDMV directory is created and set in the BDMV directory, whereby the data structure in the BDMV directory is completed.

<p id="p-0234" num="0238">Subsequently, in Step S<b>107</b>, management information (database) corresponding to the AV stream recorded in the BDAV directory is created and set in the BDAV directory, whereby the data structure in the BDAV directory is completed.

<p id="p-0235" num="0239">Subsequently, in Step S<b>108</b>, management information corresponding to the recorded AV stream is created and set in the BU directory, whereby the data structure in the BU directory is completed. As described above, the management information set in the BU directory, for example, the index file [index.bdmv], and the movie object file [MovieObject.bdmv] are needed to be set as data including the management information on all of the recorded data in the BDMV directory in the medium and the expanded data recorded in the BDAV directory, and are renewed so as to record the management information corresponding to all the recorded data.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0240">Furthermore, the playlist file, the clip information file corresponding to the stream file set in the BDAV directory are also read out and are subjected to a process of recording in the BU directory after having converted into a playlist file and a clip information file compliant with the BDMV standard.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0241">In addition, the file name conversion table (manifest file (BUMF)) described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is also subjected to a process of adding an entry corresponding to a stream file recorded newly in the BDAV directory.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0242">The process in Step S<b>108</b> corresponds to a process of creating or renewing management information to be applied to the reproduction by the virtual file system in which the recorded data in the respective BDMV/BDAV/BU directories are consolidated and recording the same in the BU directory. The management information includes the management information on all the data-to-be-reproduced recorded in the BDMV/BDAV directories. More specifically, it is management information including any one of the index file, the movie object file, the playlist file, and the clip information file to be applied to the reproducing process on the basis of the virtual file system.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0243">Subsequently, the procedure goes to Step S<b>109</b>, where a renewing process including creating a virtual file system (VFS) construction program (BD-J) for merging the AV stream recorded in the BDAV directory with the BDMV directory and adding the same to the [BDJO], [JAR] in the BDMV directory is performed. For the reference sake, if the virtual file system (VFS) construction program (BD-J) is already created, this process needs not to be performed anew.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0244">In this manner, the data recording process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0245">Referring now to a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a data reproducing process sequence will be described. The data reproducing process is executed in the data processing unit in the information processing apparatus. The data processing unit includes a CPU having an application program executing function. The processes in the respective steps of the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0246">In Step S<b>201</b>, the program (BD-J) recorded in [BDJO], [JAR] set in the BDMV directory is executed in Step S<b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0247">In Step S<b>202</b>, whether the reproducing apparatus is an apparatus of the related art which executes only the BDMV application in the related art, or an expanded apparatus which is capable of reproducing the expanded data produced by constructing the virtual file system (VFS) is determined. This determining process may include a process of determining the apparatus or the apparatus-packaged program using the program (BD-J) or may be performed using information entered by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0248">If the reproducing apparatus is the apparatus of the related art which executes only the BDMV application of the related art, the procedure goes to Step S<b>203</b>, where a reproducing process intended to reproduce only the data in the BDMV directory recorded in the media is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0249">In contrast, if the reproducing apparatus is the expanded apparatus which is capable of reproducing the expanded data produced by constructing the virtual file system (VFS), the procedure goes to Step S<b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0250">In Step S<b>204</b>, a process of copying the AV stream data in the BDAV directory to the local memory by the execution of the BD-J program is performed. This process is a copying process for the local memory <b>120</b> of the stream file <b>201</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0251">Subsequently, in Step S<b>205</b>, the BD-J program is executed to copy the management information file (including manifest file) in the BU directory to the local memory. This process is a copying process for the local memory <b>120</b> of the data <b>202</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0252">Subsequently, in Step S<b>206</b>, the BD-J program is executed to output a virtual file system (VFS) construction request to the reproducing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0253">Subsequently, in Step S<b>207</b>, a reproducing process program (player) of the reproducing apparatus constructs a virtual file system (VFS) including the data in the BDMV directory and the data copied to the local memory. This process is the virtual file system (VFS) constructing process described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and is performed as a process of creating (<i>b</i>) the virtual package of the virtual file system (VFS) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0254">Subsequently, in Step S<b>208</b>, the reproducing process is executed using the BDMV directory in the virtual package set in the virtual file system (VFS). When performing the reproducing process, if the data-to-be-reproduced is data stored in the local memory, a process of referencing the file name conversion table included in the management information in the local memory, acquiring a file name indicating the destination of recording of data from the file names on the virtual file system, and acquiring the data-to-be-reproduced is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0255">In this reproducing process, a reproducing process using the index file [index.bdmv], and the movie object file [MovieObject.bdmv] as the management information set in the BU directory described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is performed. In the management information, the management information on all the data recorded in the BDMV directory and the BDAV directory are registered. When performing the reproducing process, a reproducing process using this management information as index information with respect to the data-to-be-reproduced is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0256">For example, the menu display is achieved by one program in the movie object file [MovieObject.bdmv] specified from the index file [index.bdmv]. In the menu, information for accessing all the data recorded in the BDMV directory and the BDAV directory is registered. Therefore, all of the BDMV standard data, and the expanded data (BDMV standard non-compliant data) can be reproduced using one menu.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0257">For reference sake, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the virtual file system also includes the BDJO, JAR directories set in the BDMV directory. Therefore, the Java (registered trademark) program stored in the BDJO, JAR directories can be used. By using the Java (registered trademark) program, the menu display having various designs is achieved. Also by using the Java (registered trademark) program, for example, the various control buttons can be displayed for achieving the reproducing process using the interactive function.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0258">In addition, in this example, the reproduction is performed after having copied the BDMV standard non-compliant AV stream data and the management information to the local memory in S<b>204</b> and S<b>205</b>. However, by recording the BDMV standard non-compliant AV stream in the BDAV directory, reproduction as data in the normal BDAV directly is also possible in the apparatus which is capable of decoding the BDMV standard non-compliant AV stream. In this case, although the menu screen of the BDMV, which can be displayed using the management information on the BU directory, is not displayed, a step of storing the AV stream to the local memory is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0259">In other words, the description given above is summarized as follows. The data in the BDMV directory can be reproduced by the BDMV reproducing mechanism of the related art. In contrast, the BDMV standard non-compliant data recorded in the BDAV directory can be reproduced as the BDMV data by performing a process from S<b>204</b> to S<b>208</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> if an interactive reproduction by displaying the menu compliant to the BDMV standard is wanted. In contrast, when the capacity of the local memory is not enough, or when the time for copying is not available, reproduction as the BDAV data is possible as long as a function of decoding the corresponding BDMV standard non-compliant AV stream is provided.</p>

Therefore, at the time of reproducing process using the virtual file system, the Java (registered trademark) program stored in the BDJO, JAR directories can be used.

<p id="p-0306" num="0312">Referring first to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the data recording process sequence in this example will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0313">The data recording process is executed by the data processing unit in the information processing apparatus. The data processing unit includes a CPU having an application program executing function. The processes in the respective steps of the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0314">In Step S<b>401</b>, the AV stream to be recorded is whether or not the BDMV standard compliant data is determined. As described above, for example, in the case of the BDMV application standard, recording and reproducing of the [1080/60p image] or 3D images as three-dimensional images, or 4K&#xd7;2K images having approximately 4000&#xd7;2000 pixels are not permitted. When recording these data, the determination in Step S<b>401</b> is No.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0315">For example, if the AV stream to be recorded is the BDMV standard compliant data such as [1080/60i image], the determination in Step S<b>401</b> is Yes, and the procedure goes to Step S<b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0316">In Step S<b>402</b>, whether or not it is necessary to make the BDMV standard compliant data reproducible by using the BDMV player of the related art is determined. This determination may be performed by the user, or either setting may be decided in advance. The determining process in Step S<b>402</b> is a determination step for permitting even the BDMV standard data-to-be-recorded in the BU directory. In other words, in a case where all the BDMV standard compliant data are set to be recorded in the BU directory, the determining process in Step S<b>402</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0317">If the result of determination in Step S<b>402</b> is Yes, the procedure goes to Step S<b>403</b>, and the AV stream is recorded in the stream directory [STREAM] in the BDMV directory.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0318">In contrast, if the result of determination in Step S<b>401</b> is No, that is, if the data-to-be-recorded is an expanded data which is not the BDMV standard compliant data, and if the result of determination in Step S<b>402</b> is No, that is, the data-to-be-recorded is a BDMV standard compliant data is to be recorded in the BU directory, the procedure goes to Step S<b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0319">In Step S<b>404</b>, the AV stream is recorded in the BU directory.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0320">In this manner, the information processing apparatus in this example determines whether or not the data-to-be-recorded in the recording media is the standard compliant data compliant to the BDMV standard and, when it is the BDMV standard compliant data, selects the BDMV directory to record the BDMV standard compliant data set in the recording media as the recording destination on a priority basis and, when the data-to-be-recorded is the expanded data (BDMV standard non-compliant data), selects the BU directory different from the BDMV directory as the recording destination and performs the data recording process.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0321">When the process in Step S<b>403</b> or Step S<b>404</b> is ended, the procedure goes to Step S<b>405</b>. In Step S<b>405</b>, whether or not any other AV stream to be recorded is present and, if yes, the process from Step S<b>401</b> onward is repeated. When it is determined there is no other AV stream to be recorded in Step S<b>405</b>, the procedure goes to Step S<b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0322">In Step S<b>406</b>, the management information (database) corresponding to the AV stream recorded in the BDMV directory is created and set the same in the BDMV directory, whereby the data structure in the BDMV directory is completed. When there is no AV stream recorded in the BDMV directory, this process can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0323">Subsequently, in Step S<b>407</b>, management information corresponding to the recorded AV stream is created and set in the BU directory, whereby the data structure in the BU directory is completed. In this example, the management information set in the BU directory, for example, the index file [index.bdmv], and the movie object file [MovieObject.bdmv] need to be set as data including the management information on all of the data recorded in the BDMV directory and the expanded data recorded in the BU directory in the medium, so that renewal to record the management information corresponding to all the recorded data is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0324">In addition, the file name conversion table (manifest file (BUMF)) described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is also subjected to a process of adding an entry corresponding to a stream file recorded newly in the BU directory.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0325">The process in Step S<b>407</b> corresponds to a process of creating or renewing the management information to be applied to the reproduction by the virtual file system in which the recorded data in the respective BDMV/BU directories are consolidated and recording the same in the BU directory. The management information includes the management information on all the data-to-be-reproduced recorded in the BDMV/BU directories. More specifically, it is the management information including any one of the index file, the movie object file, the playlist file, and the clip information file to be applied to the reproducing process on the basis of the virtual file system.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0326">Subsequently, the procedure goes to Step S<b>408</b>, where a renewing process including creating a virtual file system (VFS) construction program (BD-J) for merging the AV stream recorded in the BU directory with the BDMV directory and adding the same to the [BDJO], [JAR] in the BDMV directory is performed. If the virtual file system (VFS) construction program (BD-J) is already created, this process needs not to be performed again.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0327">In this manner, the data recording process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0328">Referring now to a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the data reproducing process sequence will be described. The data reproducing process is executed in the data processing unit in the information processing apparatus. The data processing unit includes the CPU having the application program executing function. The processes in the respective steps of the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0329">In Step S<b>501</b>, the program (BD-J) recorded in [BDJO], [JAR] set in the BDMV directory is executed in Step S<b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0330">In Step S<b>502</b>, whether the reproducing apparatus is the apparatus of the related art which executes only the BDMV application of the related art, or the expanded apparatus which is capable of reproducing the expanded data produced by constructing the virtual file system (VFS) is determined. This determining process may include a process of determining the apparatus or the apparatus-packaged program using the program (BD-J) or may be performed using information entered by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0331">If the reproducing apparatus is the apparatus of the related art which executes only the BDMV application of the related art, the procedure goes to Step S<b>503</b>, where the reproducing process intended to reproduce only the data in the BDMV directory recorded in the media is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0332">In contrast, if the reproducing apparatus is the expanded apparatus which is capable of reproducing the expanded data produced by constructing the virtual file system (VFS), the procedure goes to Step S<b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0333">In Step S<b>504</b>, a process of copying the data in the BU directory to the local memory by the execution of the BD-J program is performed. This process is a copying process for the local memory <b>120</b> of the data <b>351</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The data to be copied includes the expanded data (BDMV standard non-compliant stream data) and the management information file in the BU directory (including manifest file).</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0334">Subsequently, in Step S<b>505</b>, the BD-J program is executed to output the virtual file system (VFS) construction request to the reproducing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0335">Subsequently, in Step S<b>506</b>, the reproducing process program (player) of the reproducing apparatus constructs the virtual file system (VFS) including the data in the BDMV directory and the data copied to the local memory. This process is the virtual file system (VFS) constructing process described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and is performed as a process of creating (<i>b</i>) the virtual package of the virtual file system (VFS) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0336">Subsequently, in Step S<b>507</b>, the reproducing process is executed using the BDMV directory in the virtual package set in the virtual file system (VFS). For reference sake, when performing the reproducing process, if the data-to-be-reproduced is data stored in the local memory, a process of referencing the file name conversion table included in the management information in the local memory, acquiring a file name indicating the destination of recording of data from the file names on the virtual file system, and acquiring the data-to-be-reproduced is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0337">In this reproducing process, a reproducing process using the index file [index.bdmv], and the movie object file [MovieObject.bdmv] as the management information set in the BU directory described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is performed. In these management information, the management information on all the data recorded in the BDMV directory and the BU directory are registered. When performing the reproducing process, a reproducing process using this management information as index information with respect to the data-to-be-reproduced is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0338">For example, the menu display is achieved by one program in the movie object file [MovieObject.bdmv] specified from the index file [index.bdmv]. In the menu, information for accessing all the data recorded in the BDMV directory and the BU directory is registered. Therefore, all of the BDMV standard data, and the expanded data (BDMV standard non-compliant data) can be reproduced using one menu.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0339">For reference sake, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the virtual file system also includes the BDJO, JAR directories set in the BDMV directory. Therefore, the Java (registered trademark) program stored in the BDJO, JAR directories can be used. By using the Java (registered trademark) program, the menu display having various designs is achieved. Also by using the Java (registered trademark) program, for example, the various control buttons can be displayed for achieving the reproducing process using the interactive function.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">[3. Example of Configuration of Information Processing Apparatus]</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0340">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an example of configuration of the information processing apparatus that executes the recording and reproducing process described above will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a block diagram showing an example of configuration of an information processing apparatus <b>400</b> according to an example of the present invention.

More specifically, for example, the information processing apparatus <b>400</b> is an apparatus such as a recording and reproducing apparatus, a player apparatus, a recorder apparatus, a video camera, and a PC.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0341">For reference sake, although a disk-type medium is shown as the medium <b>410</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the medium is not limited to the disk-type medium and may be a medium such as a flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0342">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the information processing apparatus <b>400</b> includes a data processing unit (recording and reproducing control unit) <b>401</b>, a memory <b>402</b>, an input unit <b>403</b>, an output unit <b>404</b>, a media interface <b>405</b>, and a local memory <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0343">The data processing unit <b>401</b> includes a CPU having a program executing function for executing various data processing programs.
