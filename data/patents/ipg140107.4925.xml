<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-138835 filed on Jun. 18, 2010. The entire subject matter of the application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description relates to one or more developer supply devices configured to supply charged powdered development agent to an intended device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A developer supply device has been known that includes a photoconductive drum, a development roller, and a developer electric-field transfer unit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The development roller is disposed to face the photoconductive drum in a predetermined area. The development roller has a developer holding surface configured to hold and carry charged development agent thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The developer electric-field transfer unit is disposed to face the developer holding surface across a predetermined distance at an upstream side relative to the development area in a moving direction of the developer holding surface (i.e., a moving direction of a circumferential surface of the development roller which surface moves in response to rotation of the development roller). The developer electric-field transfer unit includes a plurality of transfer electrodes. The developer electric-field transfer unit is configured to transfer the development agent by the action of a traveling-wave electric field generated when a transfer bias containing a multi-phase alternating-current (AC) voltage component is applied to the transfer electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such a configuration, the development agent, transferred under the traveling-wave electric-field generated by the developer electric-field transfer unit, adheres onto the developer holding surface in a position where the developer electric-field transfer unit faces the development holding surface. Namely, in the position, the development agent is held and carried on the developer holding surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The development agent held on the developer holding surface is conveyed up to the development area with the developer holding surface moving in response to rotation of the development roller, and supplied for development of an electrostatic latent image. Thereby, the development agent adheres, in a shape of an image corresponding to the electrostatic latent image, onto an electrostatic latent image holding surface as a circumferential surface of the photoconductive drum. In other words, the electrostatic latent image on the electrostatic latent image holding surface is developed with the development agent. Thereby, an image of development agent (a developer image) is formed on the electrostatic latent image holding surface.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a developer supply device of this kind, it is required to prevent as effectively as practicable the development agent from leaking to the outside of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Aspects of the present invention are advantageous to provide one or more improved techniques for a developer supply device, which techniques make it possible to prevent as effectively as practicable the development agent from leaking to the outside of the device.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is noted that various connections are set forth between elements in the following description. It is noted that these connections in general and, unless specified otherwise, may be direct or indirect and that this specification is not intended to be limiting in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Hereinafter, an embodiment according to aspects of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompany drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">&#x3c;Configuration of Laser Printer&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a laser printer <b>1</b> includes a sheet feeding mechanism <b>2</b>, a photoconductive drum <b>3</b>, an electrification device <b>4</b>, a scanning unit <b>5</b>, and a toner supply device <b>6</b>. A feed tray (not shown), provided in the laser printer <b>1</b>, is configured such that a stack of sheets P is placed thereon. The sheet feeding mechanism <b>2</b> is configured to feed a sheet P along a predetermined sheet feeding path PP.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">On a circumferential surface of the photoconductive drum <b>3</b>, an electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS is formed as a cylindrical surface parallel to a main scanning direction (i.e., the z-axis direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS is configured such that an electrostatic latent image is formed thereon in accordance with an electric potential distribution. Further, the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS is configured to hold toner in positions corresponding to the electrostatic latent image. It is noted that in the embodiment, the toner is positively-chargeable nonmagnetic-one-component dry-type black toner. The photoconductive drum <b>3</b> is driven to rotate in a direction (clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) as indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> around an axis parallel to the main scanning direction. Thus, the photoconductive drum <b>3</b> is configured to move the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS along an auxiliary scanning direction perpendicular to the main scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The electrification device <b>4</b> is disposed to face the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS. The electrification device <b>4</b>, which is of a corotron type or a scorotron type, is configured to positively and evenly charge the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The scanning unit <b>5</b> is configured to generate a laser beam LB modulated based on image data. Specifically, the scanning unit <b>5</b> generates the laser beam LB within a predetermined wavelength range, which laser beam LB is emitted under ON/OFF control depending on whether there is a pixel in a target location on the image data. In addition, the scanning unit <b>5</b> is configured to converge the laser beam LB in a scanned position SP on the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS, and to move (scan) the position where the laser beam LB is converged on the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS, along the main scanning direction at a constant speed. Here, the scanned position SP is set in a downstream position relative to the electrification device <b>4</b> in the rotational direction of the photoconductive drum <b>3</b> (i.e., the clockwise direction indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The toner supply device <b>6</b> is disposed under the photoconductive body <b>3</b> so as to face the photoconductive body <b>3</b>. The toner supply device <b>6</b> is configured to supply the charged toner, in a development position DP, onto the photoconductive drum <b>3</b> (the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS). It is noted that the development position DP denotes a position where the toner supply device <b>6</b> faces the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS in closest proximity thereto. A detailed explanation will be provided later about the configuration of the toner supply device <b>6</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">&#x3c;&#x3c;Formation of Toner Image on Electrostatic Latent Image Holding Surface&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">While the sheet P is being conveyed to the transfer position TP as described above, an image of the toner (hereinafter referred to as a toner image) is formed on the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS that is the circumferential surface of the photoconductive drum <b>3</b>, as will be mentioned below.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">&#x3c;&#x3c;Formation of Electrostatic Latent Image&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Firstly, the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS of the photoconductive drum <b>3</b> is charged evenly and positively by the electrification device <b>4</b>. The electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS, charged by the electrification device <b>4</b>, is moved along the auxiliary scanning direction to the scanned position SP to face the scanning unit <b>5</b>, when the photoconductive drum <b>3</b> rotates in the direction (clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the scanned position SP, the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS is exposed to the laser beam LB modulated based on the image data. Namely, while being scanned along the main scanning direction, the laser beam LB is rendered incident onto the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS. In accordance with the modulation of the laser beam LB, areas with (substantially) no positive charges remaining thereon are generated on the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS. Thereby, an electrostatic latent image is formed with a positive charge pattern (positive charges distributed in the shape of an image) on the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS. The electrostatic latent image, formed on the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS, is transferred to the development position DP to face the toner supply device <b>6</b> when the photoconductive drum <b>3</b> rotates in the direction (clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">&#x3c;&#x3c;Transfer and Supply of Charged Toner&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the toner stored in the activating portion <b>610</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is charged due to contact and/or friction with the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b>. The charged toner is conveyed in the toner transfer direction TTD, by the traveling-wave electric field generated when the transfer bias, containing the multi-phase AC voltage component, is applied to the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> (the transfer electrodes <b>631</b><i>e </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The toner, immediately after leaving the activating portion <b>610</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, might contain toner charged in an undesired manner as well (such as negatively charged toner, inadequately charged toner, and uncharged toner). Nonetheless, in the embodiment, inappropriately charged toner drops down off a vertically-extending toner transfer path by the action of the gravity, when being conveyed vertically up toward the toner carrying position TCP from the activating portion <b>610</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> by the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b>. Thereby, it is possible to selectively convey adequately charged toner to the toner carrying position TCP.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The toner, transferred up to the toner carrying position TCP, is held and carried on the toner carrying surface TCS in the vicinity of the toner carrying position TCP. The toner, which has passed through the toner carrying position TCP without being carried on the toner carrying surface TCS, is conveyed to the downstream storage section <b>610</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When the toner carrying surface TCS carrying the toner moves up to the development position DP in response to the development roller <b>62</b> being driven to rotate, the toner is supplied to the development position DP. In the vicinity of the development position DP, the electrostatic latent image formed on the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS is developed with the toner. Namely, the toner is transferred from the toner carrying surface TCS to adhere to the areas with no positive charge on the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS. Thereby, the toner image (i.e., the image of the toner) is formed and carried on the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The toner carried on the toner carrying surface TCS, which toner has passed through the development position DP (without being consumed in the development position DP), reaches (the vicinity of) the toner retrieving position TRP in response to rotation of the development roller <b>62</b>. In the vicinity of the toner retrieving position TRP, the toner is retrieved by the toner retrieving roller <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">At this time, the retrieving roller <b>64</b> rotates in non-contact with the toner carrying surface TCS while retrieving the toner from toner carrying surface TSC. Hence, a portion, which faces the toner retrieving position TRP, of the circumferential surface of the retrieving roller <b>64</b> moves in response to rotation of the retrieving roller <b>64</b> without sliding in contact with the toner carrying surface TCS. The toner adhering to the circumferential surface of the retrieving roller <b>64</b> is removed by the removing blade <b>65</b>, and falls into the bottom portion of the downstream storage section <b>610</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, such areas on the circumferential surface of the retrieving roller <b>64</b> that the toner adhering thereto is reduced or completely removed are sequentially supplied to the toner retrieving position TRP. In addition, it is possible to prevent an undesired situation where there is toner improperly left (to form an undesired toner adhering pattern) on the toner carrying surface TCS due to contact and/or sliding in contact between the retrieving roller and the toner.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the meantime, the toner, which reaches the vicinity of the toner carrying position TCP, is charged enough to be conveyed up to the toner carrying position TCP under the electric field generated by the electric transfer board <b>631</b>. Further, there may be a case where while being conveyed to the vicinity of the toner carrying position TCP by the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b>, the toner is charged up due to collision and/or friction with the surface of the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Therefore, the toner having passed through the toner carrying position TCP without being carried on the toner carrying surface TCS and the toner retrieved by the retrieving roller <b>64</b> and removed by the removing blade <b>65</b> after once carried on the toner carrying surface TCS (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;the toner having passed through the toner carrying position TCP&#x201d; in a generic manner) are at relatively high charged levels. When such toner is returned as is into the upstream storage section <b>610</b><i>a </i>(the activating portion <b>610</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>), the toner might be aggregated together by the action of the charges (the electrostatic forces) in the activating portion <b>610</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">To avoid the aggregation of the toner, in the embodiment, the toner having passed through the toner carrying position TCP is once held in the downstream storage section <b>610</b><i>b </i>before returned into the upstream storage section <b>610</b><i>a </i>(the activating portion <b>610</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>). Then, the toner, once held in the downstream storage section <b>610</b><i>b</i>, is returned into the upstream storage section <b>610</b><i>a </i>by the toner agitating unit <b>66</b>. Thereby, it is possible to prevent in a favorable manner the aggregation of the toner that might be caused when the toner having passed through the toner carrying position TCP is returned as is directly into the upstream storage section <b>610</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">One of possible reasons why the aggregation of the toner can be prevented is considered to be as follows: the relatively high charged level of the toner having passed through the toner carrying position TCP is brought down to such a lower level that the toner is not aggregated in the upstream storage section <b>610</b><i>a</i>, while being held in the downstream storage section <b>610</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Thus, in the embodiment, it is possible to prevent the aggregation of the toner that might be caused when the toner having passed through the toner carrying position TCP is returned as is directly into the upstream storage section <b>610</b><i>a</i>. Thus, it is possible to stably supply the charged toner.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Subsequently, an explanation will be provided about operations and effects that are brought by the toner supply device <b>6</b> configured as above in the embodiment, with reference to the relevant drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As described above, in the state where the development roller <b>62</b>, the transfer board unit <b>63</b> the retrieving roller <b>64</b>, and the side seal members <b>671</b> are attached to the casing <b>61</b>, the relative positional relationship between the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> and the development roller <b>62</b> in the toner carrying position TCP (the predetermined distance of gap between the carrying position facing portion <b>631</b><i>b </i>and the toner carrying surface TCS) is determined in a favorable manner with the guide projections <b>632</b><i>d </i>provided to the transfer board unit <b>63</b>, the guide groove <b>612</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and the development roller supporting hole <b>612</b><i>b </i>provided to each side frame <b>612</b>, and the development roller bearing <b>623</b>.</p>

The side seal member <b>671</b> is configured to, when the toner supply device <b>6</b> operates, slide in contact with the toner carrying surface TCS at each end of the development roller main body <b>621</b> in the main scanning direction while filling the gap between the toner carrying surface TCS and the casing <b>61</b> at each end of the development roller main body <b>621</b> in the main scanning direction. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the toner from leaking from the gap between the toner carrying surface TCS and the casing <b>61</b> at each end of the development roller main body <b>621</b> in the main scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the embodiment, the side seal supporting rib <b>612</b><i>c</i>, which is disposed to be concentric with the development roller main body <b>621</b> when viewed in the main scanning direction, is formed to protrude inward from the inner wall surface of each side frame <b>612</b>.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, the side seal members <b>671</b> are disposed outside the toner transfer area TTA (the area, within which the toner is effectively transferred, in the main scanning direction on the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b>). Therefore, it is possible to reduce, as effectively as practicable, the amount of toner to inflow into a sliding contact interface between the toner carrying surface TCS and the side seal members <b>671</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the toner from leaking to the outside via the aforementioned gaps.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> is fixed to the carrying position supporting portion <b>632</b><i>b </i>at the carrying position facing portion <b>631</b><i>b </i>thereof that faces the carrying position supporting portion <b>632</b><i>b</i>. Further, the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> is supported by the transfer board supporting member <b>632</b>, with a tension being provided to between the carrying position facing portion <b>631</b><i>b </i>and each end of the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> in the toner transfer direction TTD (i.e., between the carrying position facing portion <b>631</b><i>b </i>and the upstream end <b>631</b><i>a </i>and between the carrying position facing portion <b>631</b><i>b </i>and the downstream end <b>631</b><i>c</i>). Thereby, it is possible to prevent the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> from being loose, in a favorable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Hereinabove, the embodiment according to aspects of the present invention has been described. The present invention can be practiced by employing conventional materials, methodology and equipment. Accordingly, the details of such materials, equipment and methodology are not set forth herein in detail. In the previous descriptions, numerous specific details are set forth, such as specific materials, structures, chemicals, processes, etc., in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it should be recognized that the present invention can be practiced without reapportioning to the details specifically set forth. In other instances, well known processing structures have not been described in detail, in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Only an exemplary embodiment of the present invention and but a few examples of their versatility are shown and described in the present disclosure. It is to be understood that the present invention is capable of use in various other combinations and environments and is capable of changes or modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein. For example, the following modifications are feasible.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Aspects of the present invention may be applied to electrophotographic image forming devices such as color laser printers, and monochrome and color copy machines, as well as the single-color laser printer as exemplified in the aforementioned embodiment. Further, the photoconductive body is not limited to the drum-shaped one as exemplified in the aforementioned embodiment. For instance, the photoconductive body may be formed in the shape of a plate or an endless belt.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Additionally, light sources (e.g., LEDs, electroluminescence devices, and fluorescent substances) other than a laser scanner may be employed as light sources for exposure. In such cases, the &#x201c;main scanning direction&#x201d; may be parallel to a direction in which light emitting elements such as LEDs are aligned. Namely, the &#x201c;main scanning direction&#x201d; may be referred to as a &#x201c;sheet width direction&#x201d; (a direction always perpendicular to a sheet feeding direction) or a &#x201c;device width direction.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Alternatively, aspects of the present invention may be applied to image forming devices employing methods other than the aforementioned electrophotographic method (e.g., a toner-jet method using no photoconductive body, an ion flow method, and a multi-stylus electrode method).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The board unit contact projections <b>611</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> may be in contact with the transfer range restricting members <b>633</b>, with the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b>, or with the transfer board supporting member <b>632</b>. Namely, there may be portions, on which the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> and/or the transfer range restricting members <b>633</b> are not provided, formed in areas, with which the board unit contact projections <b>611</b><i>b </i>are in contact with, on outer wall surfaces of the both ends of the transfer board unit <b>63</b> in the main scanning direction,</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an exploded side view schematically showing (a part of) a configuration of a toner supply device <b>6</b> in a modification according to aspects of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the rib surfaces <b>612</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> of the side seal supporting ribs <b>612</b><i>c</i>, the carrying position supporting portion <b>632</b><i>b</i>, and the side seal fixing portions <b>612</b><i>d</i><b>1</b> of the retrieving roller supporting portions <b>612</b><i>d </i>may be provided to keep a substantially constant distance from the rotational center axis of the development roller <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In such a configuration, a distance between each side seal supporting rib <b>612</b><i>c </i>and the toner carrying surface TCS, a distance between each transfer range restricting member <b>633</b>, a distance between each retrieving roller end seal <b>613</b> and the toner carrying surface TCS, and a distance between the side seal fixing portion <b>612</b><i>d</i><b>1</b> of each retrieving roller supporting portion <b>612</b><i>d </i>are substantially identical to each other. Thereby, each side seal member <b>671</b> is supported by a smooth shape formed along the (cylindrical-surface-shaped) toner carrying surface TCS when viewed in the main scanning direction. Accordingly, it is possible to stably set the side seal members <b>671</b> and to make the side seal members <b>671</b> in closer contact with the toner carrying surface TCS.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The retrieving roller supporting portions <b>612</b><i>d </i>may be included in the retrieving frame <b>611</b><i>c</i>, instead of being included in the side frames <b>612</b>. Further, each side frame <b>612</b> may be configured without one or both of the retrieving roller supporting portion <b>612</b><i>d </i>and the communication portion <b>615</b>. Namely, each side frame <b>612</b> may be configured as a completely-flat plate member.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref> are exploded perspective views schematically showing a configuration of a toner supply device <b>6</b> in another modification according to aspect of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref>, there is a gap defining projection <b>6321</b> formed to protrude toward the development roller shaft <b>622</b> from each of the both ends of the carrying position facing portion <b>631</b><i>b </i>in the main scanning direction. Each gap defining projection <b>6321</b> may be configured to, when penetrating through a notched portion <b>6711</b> provided to the side seal member <b>671</b> and contacting the development roller bearing <b>623</b>, define a relative positional relationship between the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> and the development roller <b>62</b> in the toner carrying position TCP (i.e., set a predetermined distance of gap between the carrying position facing portion <b>631</b><i>b </i>and the toner carrying surface TCS).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">According to the toner supply device <b>6</b> of the modification, it is possible to define the relative positional relationship in a simple and certain manner. Further, it is noted that in this case, the toner supply device <b>6</b> may be configured without the guide grooves <b>612</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> of the side frames <b>612</b> or the guide projections <b>632</b><i>d </i>of the transfer board supporting member <b>632</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The casing main body <b>611</b>, which is formed with a substantially U-shaped cross-section when viewed in the main scanning direction, may be formed integrally with the bottom frame <b>611</b><i>a</i>, the supply frame <b>611</b><i>b</i>, and the retrieving frame <b>611</b><i>c </i>in a seamless manner. Alternatively, the tube-shaped board unit housing frame, which includes the supply frame <b>611</b><i>b</i>, the retrieving frame <b>611</b><i>c</i>, and the two side frames <b>612</b>, may be formed integrally in a seamless manner. In these cases, each guide groove <b>612</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> may be formed to extend downward from the development roller supporting hole <b>612</b><i>b</i>. Further, the configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref> may be employed. Furthermore, the configuration of the casing <b>61</b> may be flexibly modified within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The development roller <b>62</b> may be disposed to form a predetermined distance of gap between the toner carrying surface TCS and the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS in the development position DP. Alternatively, the development roller <b>62</b> may be disposed such that the toner carrying surface TCS contacts the electrostatic latent image carrying surface LS in the development position DR Further, the development roller <b>62</b> may be replaced with a sleeve-shaped one. Namely, the development roller <b>62</b> may be configured with a sleeve-shaped member and a roller-shaped member inserted into the sleeve-shaped member. In this case, the roller-shaped member may be made of rubber or sponge.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">When it is assumed that the toner is efficiently transferred to be carried on the toner carrying surface TCS in the toner carrying position TCP and there is hardly toner left to be conveyed on the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> toward the downstream storage section <b>610</b><i>b </i>after passing through the toner carrying position TCP, the toner supply device <b>6</b> may be configured without the transfer electrodes <b>631</b><i>e </i>in the flat-plate portion, which faces the downstream storage section <b>610</b><i>b</i>, of the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b>. Alternatively, the toner supply device <b>6</b> may be configured without the flat-plate portion.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Further, instead of the removing blade <b>65</b>, a brush roller may be employed to remove the toner from the retrieving roller <b>64</b>. Moreover, instead of the retrieving roller <b>64</b>, a blade member similar to the removing blade <b>65</b> or a brush roller may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Further, the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> may be divided into two sections, i.e., an upstream section and a downstream section with respect to the toner carrying position TCP. Further, different direct-current (DC) bias voltages may be applied to the upstream section and the downstream section, respectively. In this case, the retrieving roller <b>64</b> may be disposed to closely face the downstream section across a predetermined distance of gap. Thereby, the toner is retrieved from the retrieving roller <b>64</b> by the downstream section. Alternatively, the toner supply device <b>6</b> may be configured without the retrieving roller <b>64</b>, such that the toner is retrieved from the toner carrying surface TCS by the downstream section.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The side seal members <b>671</b> may be disposed such that the inner end lines thereof in the main scanning direction correspond to the outer end lines of the toner transfer area TTA in the main scanning direction, respectively. Namely, the transfer range restricting members <b>633</b> and the side seal members <b>671</b> may be configured and disposed such that the inner end lines of the transfer range restricting members <b>633</b> in the main scanning direction correspond to the inner end lines of the side seal members <b>671</b> in the main scanning direction, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The toner supply device <b>6</b> may be configured without the transfer range restricting members <b>633</b>. In this case, the side seal members <b>671</b> may directly contact or be attached with the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> or the transfer board supporting member <b>632</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The toner supply device <b>6</b> may not necessarily be configured such that the toner is transferred vertically up toward (the vicinity of) the toner carrying position TCP as exemplified in the aforementioned embodiment. For instance, the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> may be configured to have an upstream section (i.e., a flat-plate section between the upstream end <b>631</b><i>a </i>and the carrying position facing portion <b>631</b><i>b</i>) for transferring the toner toward (the vicinity of) the toner carrying position TCP, which upstream section has a down-facing toner transfer surface on which the toner is transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Specifically, the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> configured with the upstream section having the down-facing toner transfer surface may be realized when the toner supply device <b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is rotated clockwise by an angle of 10 to 90 degrees and the upstream end <b>631</b><i>a </i>of the electric-field transfer board <b>631</b> is disposed at the lowest end of the activating portion <b>610</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>. In this case, the configurations of other elements such as the casing <b>61</b> and the toner agitating unit <b>66</b> may be changed appropriately as needed from those as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
