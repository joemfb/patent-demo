The polypropylene is extruded to provide a sheet which is oriented in at least one direction and has a thickness of 10-100 mils. The sheet is heated to a temperature of 135-160&#xb0; C, and thermoformed in contact with a template having the desired configuration to produce the thermoformed article.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to the preparation of thermoformed articles formed of an isotactic polypropylene and more particularly to the preparation of such thermoformed articles exhibiting good dimensional stability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Isotactic polypropylene can be produced by the polymerization of propylene in the presence of catalysts such as Ziegler Natta catalysts or isospecific metallocene catalysts. Isotactic polypropylene can be used in the production of molded articles in which the polypropylene is heated and then extruded through one or more dies or nozzles into a mold cavity in which it moves in both a longitudinal direction (referred to as the flow direction) and in a transverse or lateral direction (sometimes referred to as the cross flow direction). The structure of isotactic polypropylene is characterized in terms of the methyl group attached to the tertiary carbon atoms of the successive propylene monomer units lying on the same side of the main chain of the polymer. That is, the methyl groups are characterized as being all above or below the polymer chain. Isotactic polypropylene can be illustrated by the following chemical formula:</p>

</chemistry>
<br/>
Stereoregular polymers, such as isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene, can be characterized in terms of the Fisher projection formula. Using the Fisher projection formula, the stereochemical sequence of isotactic polypropylene as shown by Formula (1) is described as follows:

<img id="EMI-C00002" he="5.84mm" wi="39.62mm" file="US08623261-20140107-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
<br/>
Another way of describing the structure is through the use of NMR. Bovey's NMR nomenclature for an isotactic pentad is . . . mmmmm . . . with each &#x201c;m&#x201d; representing a &#x201c;meso&#x201d; dyad, or successive methyl groups on the same side of the plane of the polymer chain. As is known in the art, any deviation or inversion in the structure of the chain lowers the degree of isotacticity and crystallinity of the polymer. In the case of random ethylene propylene copolymers, a relatively low ethylene content in the copolymer is randomly distributed throughout the polymer chain so that ethylene units are randomly interposed between the repeating propylene units.
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Polypropylene can be formed into molded articles through various operations in which the polymer is heated and conformed to a desired shape and then cooled at to arrive at the final product. Two well known operations involve injection molding and thermoforming.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In injection molding operations, the molten polymer is introduced into a mold cavity. The molten polymer is retained in the cavity for a sufficient time to allow the desired component to form. The period of time required for cooling and subsequent removal of the molded component from the mold cavity is an important factor in the manufacturing efficiency of the injection molding operation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In thermoforming operations the molten polymer is subjected to a sheet extrusion operation followed by thermoforming of the sheet over a template to arrive at the desired shape of the thermoformed article followed by cooling of the article which is then recovered from the template. Typical thermoforming operations may be carried out employing sheet extrusion and formation of a sheet roll which is then used in a roll fed continuous thermoforming unit. Thermoforming may also be carried out with integrated in-line systems in which a heat extrusion system and thermoforming system are integrated into one automated unit. After the thermoforming operation, the thermoformed article is cooled and then trimmed as necessary to arrive at the final product followed by recovery of the product from the automatic system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">During the manufacturing of formed plastic components by injection molding, shrinkage within the mold and subsequent withdrawal of the hard component from the mold results in a volume difference between the initial and the final molded article. If the dimensional changes are relatively uniform in the transverse (cross flow) and longitudinal (flow) directions of the mold, the shrinkage characteristic is considered to be isotropic. With significant differential dimensional changes in the transverse and longitudinal directions, the dimensional changes are characterized as anisotropic or differential. Warpage is caused by variations in shrinkage throughout injection molded part (D Rosata, Injection Molding Handbook, Chapman &#x26; Hall, New York, 1995). More anisotropic shrinkage often leads to warpage problems in injection molding applications. Regardless of whether the shrinkage characterized is isotropic or anisotropic, the relative shrinkage should be taken into account in order to obtain the end use articles of the molded article of the correct dimension. Similar considerations can apply in the case of sheet extrusion and thermoforming operations. In this case, the direction of the continuous linear extrusion leading from the sheet extrusion system to the thermoforming system can be considered to be a longitudinal flow direction and the transverse direction across the direction of the flow of the sheet extrusion system can be considered to be the transverse direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method for the preparation of a thermoformed article which is considered to be relatively isotropic in nature in terms of shrinkage of the final thermoformed article along the sheet extrusion flow path (the longitudinal direction) and the transverse direction. In carrying out the invention, there is provided an isotactic polypropylene produced by the polymerization of propylene in the presence an isospecific metallocene catalyst. The polypropylene may be a homopolymer or a copolymer, specifically an ethylene propylene copolymer contains small amounts of ethylene, typically up to 2&#xbd; wt. %. The polymer has a melt flow rate within the range of 1-5 grams/10 minutes and a melting temperature of no more than 160&#xb0; C. The polypropylene is extruded to provide a sheet which is oriented in at least one direction (the longitudinal direction) and has a thickness within the range of 10-100 mils and more specifically 15-80 mils. The sheet is heated to a temperature within the range of 135-160&#xb0; C. and more specifically 140-150&#xb0; C., and thermoformed in contact with a template having the desired configuration to produce the thermoformed article. The thermoformed article is then cooled and retrieved from the template to arrive at the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of the invention, the final thermoformed article has a uniformed shrinkage at 48 hours after thermoforming of at least 85%, as determined by the differential in transverse and longitudinal shrinkages of the thermoformed product at 48 hours after retrieving the thermoformed article from the template. In further aspect of the invention, the thermoformed article is characterized as having a shrinkage 48 hours after retrieving the article from the template which is more isotropic than the shrinkage of a corresponding article formed with isotactic polypropylene produced by the polymerization of a Ziegler Natta catalyzed polymer which is then extruded and thermoformed under the same conditions as the metallocene catalyzed polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further aspect of the invention, the isotactic polypropylene has a melt flow rate within the range of 1.5-5 grams/10 minutes, and more specifically, within the range of 2-4 grams/10 minutes. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the isotactic polypropylene has a melting temperature within the range of 150-155&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another embodiment of the invention is carried out with isotactic polypropylene having an isotacity of least 98% and more particularly 99% as determined by the percent of the polymer fluff which is not xylene soluble. Prior to extruding isotactic polypropylene, an additive component selected from a group consisting of a nucleating agent, a clarifying agent, and mixtures thereof maybe incorporated into the polymer.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention can be carried out with any suitable sheet extrusion and thermoforming systems. The systems may take the form of extrusion winding systems in which the polymer pellets are converted to sheets which are then applied to a winder to produce a sheet roll. The sheet on the roll is unwound and supplied to a thermoformer to convert the sheet to thermoformed parts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> schematically illustrate systems in which the polymer pellets are converted to extrusion sheets followed by conversion of the extrusion sheets to parts through a roll fed continuous thermoformer. More particularly and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sheet forming system comprises a hopper <b>10</b> through which polymer pellets are supplied to a screw extrusion unit <b>12</b> which comprises a heated outer cylinder <b>14</b> within which an extrusion screw <b>15</b> rotates and takes in a pelletized polymer material from the hopper <b>10</b>. The extrusion unit <b>12</b> comprises a drive unit <b>17</b> for the rotatable screw and a die section <b>18</b> through which a molten polymer is extruded to form a continuous sheet. The sheet is supplied from the die to a take-away unit <b>20</b> which comprises a chill roll stack comprising a plurality of chill rolls <b>21</b>. The chill roll stack is cooled by a coolant supplied by a coolant pumping unit <b>22</b>. The sheet is withdrawn from the chill roll stack through a pull roll section <b>24</b> and supplied from there onto a winder section <b>26</b> in which a sheet roll <b>27</b> is formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a roll fed continuous thermoformer system which comprises an unwind stand <b>30</b> from which a sheet roll <b>32</b> is unwound and the sheet <b>34</b> supplied to the thermoformer <b>36</b> comprising an oven section <b>39</b> within which the sheet is heated and then supplied to a forming section <b>40</b> in which the isothermoforming operation takes place. Forming section <b>40</b> comprises one or more template and conforming members <b>42</b> which cooperate to form a web <b>44</b> of shaped objects from the sheet <b>34</b>. The resulting web of thermoformed articles are supplied to a trim press <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates another system which can be employed in carrying out the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is illustrated an integrated in-line continuous thermoforming unit in which polymer pellets are converted directly to the final parts rather than through the use of an intermediate sheet-roll system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a screw extrusion system <b>50</b> (corresponding to unit <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is operated to produce a sheet which is withdrawn through a die <b>52</b> and applied to a chill roll stack <b>54</b>. The sheet is supplied from the chill roll stand <b>54</b> to an accumulator <b>56</b> which functions to interface the roll stand <b>54</b> with a thermoforming unit <b>58</b>. The forming unit comprises an oven section <b>60</b> as described previously and a forming section <b>62</b> in which the thermoformed parts are formed. The thermoformed parts are withdrawn in a web system <b>64</b> which is then supplied to a trim press as described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The forming section, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may be of any suitable type typically involving a female template member and a conforming plug member which extends into the template member. The operation of a typical forming station which involves a plug assisted vacuum forming operation is illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in which successive stages of operation are labeled as A, B, C, and D. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the forming section comprises a template member <b>70</b>, a plug member <b>72</b> which conforms in shape with the internal portion of the template member, and a clamping frame <b>74</b>. Template <b>70</b> is provided with a gas port <b>76</b>. In the initial stage of operation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a sheet of polymer material <b>78</b> is transported into the forming section while the clamp frame and plug member are withdrawn from the template member. After the polymer sheet <b>78</b> is in place, the clamp frame <b>74</b> is moved into contact with the template to hold the sheet in place and a pressurizing gas introduced into the bottom of the template through opening <b>76</b>. This results in a pre-stretching extension of the sheet member <b>78</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. In the next stage of operation, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the interior of the template member is vented or placed under a vacuum and the plug member <b>72</b> enters into the template to press the sheet member downwardly within the conforming interior of the template member. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, a vacuum is then imposed in the interior of the template member through port <b>76</b> in order to bring the sheet into conformance with the interior of the template member <b>70</b> to arrive at the thermoformed article of the desired shape. In conclusion of the forming operation, the clamp frame is withdrawn from the template member and the web containing the thermoformed article is then removed from the forming section. It is to be recognized that the thermoforming systems illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> are exemplary only and any suitable thermoforming system may be used when carrying out the present invention. For a further description of thermoforming techniques and systems which may be employed in themoforming operations to carry out the present invention, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 6,926,513 to Schlepp and U.S. Pat. No. 7,071,462 to Young.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As will be understood to those skilled in the art, the plug assisted forming methods, such as those described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, can be used to produce containers such as containers for food and the like, and closure members for such containers. In such containers, dimensional consistency between the containers and the lids, or closures members therefore, can be very important. The present invention can be used to employ such containers and closure members therefore of very good dimensional consistency.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention has a particular application in a formation of lids for food containers and the like where dimensional consistency is very important. An example can be found in leak proof thermoformed lids which are configured to have a closure member which is adapted to fit over an access opening of a container and a lip section which extends from the closure member. The lip section is adapatably placed in contact with a wall segment of the container, such as in a &#x201c;snap-on&#x201d; operation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is illustrated a container, such as may be formed in the thermoforming operation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and an associated container lid also formed by thermoforming. The container <b>80</b> comprises a wall <b>81</b> terminating at a transverse rim <b>82</b> which surrounds an opening <b>83</b> in the container which provides access to its interior. The closure lid <b>84</b> (shown in exploded view immediately above the container) comprises a closure member <b>86</b> which fits over the access opening. The lid further comprises a lip section <b>88</b> extending from the closure member <b>86</b> which extends outwardly and terminates in a downwardly extending snap-on rim <b>90</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the lip section <b>88</b> fits on top of the rim <b>82</b> of the container and the rim <b>90</b> snaps over the outer edge of the rim in a so-called snap-on configuration. Another example of a container and lid configuration in which dimensional consistency is important is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> which is a side-view with parts broken away of a container <b>92</b> having an access opening <b>93</b> over which a lid <b>95</b> having a closure member <b>96</b> fits. The lid structure in this case terminates in a downwardly extending lip section <b>98</b> which fits over the upper outer wall of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The isotactic propylene polymer employed in carrying out the present invention can be a homopolymer of propylene or a copolymer of propylene. Where a copolymer is employed, it may take the form of an ethylene propylene random copolymer, typically containing up to 2 &#xbd; wt. % ethylene, and more specifically, up to 2 wt. % ethylene. Lower amounts of ethylene, up to 1 wt. % ethylene, can be incorporated into the random copolymer. The melting temperature is somewhat dependent upon the ethylene content and may range from about 135&#xb0; C. for copolymers in which the ethylene content is about 2 wt. % or slightly above, up to about 155&#xb0; C. or even 160&#xb0; C. in the case of homopolymers. A more specific melting temperature is about 150-155&#xb0; C. in the case of homopolymers, or copolymers of very little ethylene content.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The isotactic propylene polymer employed in carrying out the present invention can be produced by the polymerization of propylene, together with ethylene in the case of a copolymer, over any suitable isospecific metallocene, such as a metallocene formed of a bridged bis indenyl (or tetrahydrobisindenyl) ligand structure. The bis indenyl ligand structure may be substituted or unsubstituted. A specific metallocene which may employed to produce the isotactic polypropylene is a di-methylsilyl bis(2-methyl, 4-pheny), zirconium dichloride and a co-catalyst comprising an alky alumoxane such as methylalumoxane and a scavenger such as triethylaluminum (TEAL). The isotactic polypropylene is further characterized by isotacity of at least 98% and more specifically at least 99%. The isotacitity is determined by measuring the amount of polymer fluff as recovered from the polymerization reactor which is not soluble in xylene at or slightly above room temperature. In terms of the stereoregularity of the polymer, the polymer can be expected to have at least 99% meso diads.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The isotactic polypropylene employed in the present invention is further characterized by a melting temperature of 155&#xb0; C. or less and a melt flow rate within the range of 1-5 grams/10 minutes. The melt flow rate, is determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 condition L which specifies a temperature of 230&#xb0; C. and a load of 2.16 kg with the result reported in terms of grams/10 minutes. They may be identified as melt index MI<sub>2</sub>. A more specific characterization of the melt flow rate of the polymer employed in carrying out the present invention is a melt flow rate within the range of 1.5-5 grams/10 minutes, and more specifically, 2-4 grams/10 minutes. The polymer, as noted previously, exhibits a melting temperature of no more than 160&#xb0; C. and usually no more than 155&#xb0; C. This is well below the melting temperatures of a corresponding isotactic polypropylene produced by a Ziegler Natta catalyst which would exhibit a melting temperature greater than 160&#xb0; C. More specifically, the melting temperature of the metallocene based isotactic polypropylene employed in the present invention is within the range of 150-155&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The thermoformed articles produced in accordance with the present invention can be characterized in terms of uniform shrinkage of the article at a designated time after thermoforming as determined by the differential in transverse and longitudinal shrinkages at the designated time after retrieving the thermoformed article from the forming section. The shrinkage values are determined in terms of longitudinal and transverse or cross-flow directions with reference to the extrusion direction of the original polymer sheet as applied to the thermoforming system. The longitudinal direction is considered the direction of flow of the extruded sheet as it is withdrawn from the die in the extrusion section. That is, the longitudinal direction, is the direction in which the sheet is moved in the thermoformer system as it is unrolled from a sheet roll in a roll-fed system of the type depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or as it withdrawn from the accumulator and moved through the oven in the in-line continuous thermoforming system of the type depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The transverse direction is the cross-flow direction as the sheet is extruded through the die and, in terms of movement in the thermoforming system, the transverse direction is 90&#xb0; from the flow direction of the polymer sheet as it moves through the thermoforming system.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The uniformity of shrinkage at a designated time after thermoforming indicates the resistance to a tendency of warping of the thermoformed article. Where the shrinkage is identical in both the longitudinal and transverse directions, the uniform shrinkage factor of the article is 100% indicating no warping. Where the shrinkage in one of the longitudinal and transverse directions varies by 10% from the shrinkage in the other direction the article is characterized as having a uniform shrinkage factor of 90% indicating only moderate warping. Where a differential in shrinkage in one direction as compared with the other direction is 20%, the article will be characterized as having a uniform shrinkage factor of 80%. In the present invention a target for unifonn shrinkage at 48 hours after thermoforming is at least 85% as determined by the differential in transverse and longitudinal shrinkages. In a further aspect of the invention, the uniform shrinkage factor at 48 hours after thermoforming is at least 90% as determined by the differential in transverse and longitudinal shrinkages at 48 hours after the retrieval of the thermoformed article from the thermoforming station.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The metallocene catalyzed isotactic polypropylene employed in the present invention can also be characterized in terms of its isotropic characteristics relative to the corresponding isotactic polymer of the same isotacity and molecular weight produced by polymerization of propylene with a Ziegler Natta catalyst. Specifically, the metallocene catalyzed polypropylene employed in the present invention has a shrinkage at 48 hours after retrieving the thermoformed article which is more isotropic than the isotactic polypropylene produced by the polymerization of propylene with a Ziegler Natta catalyst and then extruded and thermoformed under identical conditions to that employed in producing the thermoformed article from the metallocene in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As noted previously, metallocene catalysts which may be employed in polymerization of the propylene homopolymer or ethylene-propylene copolymers employed in the present invention include bridged bis indenyl or bis tetrahydroindenyl metallocenes which are known to function to exhibit high isospecificity. These metallocenes, which may be substituted or unsubstituted, are racemic or at least have a substantially high content of racemic isomers as compared with meso isomers. The bis indenyl (or tetrahydroindenyl) ligands may be substituted or unsubstituted, especially suitable racemic bis indenyl structures are those in which the indenyl groups are substituted by a bulky substituent, e.g., phenyl or tertiary butyl, at the 4 position and with less bulky substituents, e.g., methyl or ethyl groups, at the 2 position. Other metallocenes which can be employed in producing isotatic polypropylene include stereo rigid cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl ligand structures which are substituted on either or both of the cyclopentadienyl and fluorenyl groups in a manner to eliminate the bilateral symmetry which would normally be present in the cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl ligand structure. Other metallocene catalysts which may be employed in producing the ethylene propylene copolymers used in the process of the present invention include metallocenes incorporating bis fluorenyl ligand structures of a staggered conformation. Here the fluorenyl groups (including octohydro fluorenyl groups) are bridged and the two fluornyl groups are independently substituted on opposed sides of the bridged symmetry line through the ligand structure in order to provide a staggered conformation in which bilateral symmetry is eliminated. The transition metals employed in forming metallocene catalysts of the type described above are normally from Group 4 or Group 5 of the Periodic Table of Elements (new notation). Especially suitable transition metals are zirconium hafnium and titanium. For a further description of bridged metallocene catalysts which are effective in producing isotatic polymers, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 6,262,199 to Ewen, et al and U.S. Pat. No. 6,313,242 to Reddy, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Having described specific embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood that modifications thereof may be suggested to those skilled in the art, and it is intended to cover all such modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
