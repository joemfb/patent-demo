<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a division of application Ser. No. 13/221,456, filed Aug. 30, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a nitride semiconductor light emitting device and a method for manufacturing the nitride semiconductor light emitting device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are conventionally-known nitride semiconductor light emitting devices in each of which a p-type Mg-doped AlGaN layer as an electron barrier layer to trap electrons in an active layer is formed on an active layer including an In-containing nitride semiconductor (see the description of Japanese Patent No. 3446660 and Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2006-261392, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the nitride semiconductor light emitting device disclosed in the description of Japanese Patent No. 3446660, the p-type AlGaN layer includes a first p-type AlGaN layer and a second p-type AlGaN layer. The first p-type AlGaN layer is formed by MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition) which uses a N2 gas to inhibit the deterioration of the active layer. The second p-type AlGaN layer is formed by MOCVD which uses a H2 gas to form barrier potential.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the nitride semiconductor light emitting device, however, the Al composition ratio of the first p-type AlGaN layer is almost the same as that of the second p-type AlGaN layer, and is set at 0.1 or greater. In addition, the first p-type AlGaN layer is doped with a large amount of Mg for decreasing the bulk resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a result, the nitride semiconductor light emitting device entails a problem that the quality of the active layer is deteriorated due to excessive diffusion of Mg into the active layer in the process of forming the second p-type AlGaN layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The nitride semiconductor light emitting device disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2006-261392 has an intermediate layer between the active layer and the p-type AlGaN layer for the purpose of inhibiting excessive diffusion of Mg into the active layer. The intermediate layer includes an undoped GaN layer, an undoped AlGaN layer and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the case of the nitride semiconductor light emitting device, however, the temperature of the substrate is raised while the intermediate layer is being grown on the active layer. As a result, the nitride semiconductor light emitting device has a problem that the active layer thermally deteriorates during the temperature rise, and accordingly entails the quality degradation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In short, the nitride semiconductor light emitting devices have problems such as the decrease in the light-emission efficiency and the incapability of producing sufficient light output.</p>

A GaN layer and a first AlGaN layer having a first Al composition ratio are formed on the active layer in order by metal organic chemical vapor deposition at a first growth temperature in a nitrogen gas atmosphere without doping with Mg.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A composition ratio x of In to InGaN in each InGaN well layer <b>16</b> (the In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N layer, 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;1) is set at approximately 0.1 for the purpose of making a peak light-emission wavelength equal to approximately 450 nm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A gallium nitride layer <b>17</b> (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;GaN layer&#x201d; <b>17</b>) is formed on the MQW active layer <b>14</b>.

The composition of the first AlGaN layer is expressed with Al<sub>x1</sub>Ga<sub>1-x1</sub>N (0&#x3c;x&#x3c;1).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The GaN layer <b>17</b> and the first AlGaN layer <b>18</b> are formed without doping, as described later.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Hereinafter, the GaN layer <b>17</b> will be referred to as a GaN cap layer <b>17</b>, and the first AlGaN layer <b>18</b> will be referred to as an AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With this taken into consideration, the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> needs a combination of the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> and the thickness which satisfies the following two requirements: a requirement that the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> should effectively inhibit the thermal deterioration of the MQW active layer <b>14</b> in order that the light emission efficiency should not be impaired, and a requirement that the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> should be able to obtain a lower bulk resistance in order that the operation voltage should not be disturbed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The GaN cap layer <b>17</b> needs the thickness which satisfies the following two requirements: a requirement that the GaN cap layer <b>17</b> should absorb Mg which diffuses into the GaN cap layer <b>17</b>, and a requirement that the function of a p-type AlGaN layer serving as an electron barrier layer to trap electrons in the MQW active layer <b>14</b>, which will be described later, should not be impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this respect, the thickness of the GaN cap layer <b>17</b> is set at approximately 5 nm, for example. It is desirable that the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> of the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> should be greater than zero but not greater than 0.01. The Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> of the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> is set at 0.003, for example. The thickness of the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> is set at 1 nm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A p-type AlGaN electron barrier layer <b>19</b> (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;second AlGaN layer&#x201d; <b>19</b> from time to time) to trap electrons in the MQW active layer <b>14</b> is formed on the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b>. The second AlGaN layer <b>19</b> is doped with Mg in a high concentration. The composition of the second AlGaN layer is expressed with Al<sub>x2</sub>Ga<sub>1-x2</sub>N (0&#x3c;x<b>2</b>&#x3c;1 and x<b>1</b>&#x3c;x<b>2</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The concentration of Mg in the p-type AlGaN electron barrier layer <b>19</b> is set at approximately 1E19 to 1E20 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, for example. The thickness of the p-type AlGaN electron barrier layer <b>19</b> is approximately 10 nm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A p-type gallium nitride clad layer <b>20</b> (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;p-type GaN clad layer&#x201d; <b>20</b> or a &#x201c;second clad layer&#x201d; <b>20</b>) is formed on the p-type AlGaN electron barrier layer <b>19</b>. The p-type GaN clad layer <b>20</b> is approximately 100 nm in thickness, and is doped with Mg in a high concentration, for example. The concentration of Mg in the p-type GaN clad layer <b>20</b> is set at approximately 1E19 to 1E20 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A p-type gallium nitride contact layer <b>21</b> (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;p-type GaN contact layer&#x201d; <b>21</b>) is formed on the p-type GaN clad layer <b>20</b>. The p-type GaN contact layer <b>21</b> is approximately 10 nm in thickness, and is doped with Mg in a concentration which is higher than the concentration of Mg in the p-type GaN clad layer <b>20</b>, for example. The concentration of Mg in the p-type GaN contact layer <b>21</b> is set at approximately 1E20 to 1E21 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A p-side electrode <b>22</b> made of Ni/Au is formed on the p-type GaN contact layer <b>21</b>. In addition, one lateral portion of the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> is dug in from the p-type GaN contact layer <b>21</b> to a portion of the n-type GaN clad layer <b>13</b>, and an n-side electrode <b>23</b> made of Ti/Pt/Au is formed on an exposed portion of the n-type GaN clad layer <b>13</b>. The n-type GaN clad layer <b>13</b> functions as an n-type GaN contact layer at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Light is emitted from the MQW active layer <b>14</b> when an electric current is caused to pass between the p-side electrode <b>22</b> and the n-side electrode <b>23</b> with the p-side electrode <b>22</b> and the n-side electrode <b>23</b> connected to the respective positive and negative electrodes of a power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this respect, the functions respectively of the n-type GaN clad layer <b>13</b>, the MQW active layer <b>14</b>, the p-type GaN clad layer <b>20</b> and the p-type GaN contact layer <b>21</b> are well known. For this reason, descriptions for these layers are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The thus-structured nitride semiconductor light emitting device is configured in a way that, during the formation of the p-type AlGaN electron barrier layer <b>19</b> to the p-type GaN contact layer <b>21</b> which are doped with Mg in the high concentration, the effect of inhibiting the thermal deterioration of the MQW active layer <b>14</b> and the effect of preventing the diffusion of Mg into the MQW active layer <b>14</b> are enhanced by optimizing the two-layered structure including: the GaN cap layer <b>17</b> for which the thick film having a better crystallinity can be formed even at a relatively low growth temperature; and the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> which is capable of effectively inhibiting the thermal deterioration of the MQW active layer <b>14</b> because of the chemical stability exhibited at a relative high melting point.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For the purpose of checking this, an examination was made on the depth profile of Mg in the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b>. The result of the examination will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The other examination was further made on the influence of the GaN cap layer <b>17</b>, the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> and the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> on the light emission efficiency. The result of the examination will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing the depth profile of Mg in the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b>. The depth profile of Mg was obtained by use of the SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition to the depth profile of Mg, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows: the depth profile of hydrogen (H), which exhibited the same behavior as did Mg because H was taken in through the bonding of H with Mg during the film formation; and the secondary ionic strengths respectively of Al and In which were used as markers to identify the layers.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A thick continuous line indicates the depth profile of Mg, and a thin continuous line indicates the depth profile of H. In addition, a dashed line indicates the secondary ionic strength of Al, and a chain line indicates the secondary ionic strength of In.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It was learned from the secondary ionic strength respectively of Al and In as well as the depth profiles that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the depth of the interface between the MQW active layer <b>14</b> and the undoped GaN cap layer <b>17</b> was approximately 100 nm from the surface (the design value was 126 nm, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">No significant diffusion of Mg into the MQW active layer <b>14</b> was observed, because the gradients (approximately 7 nm/decade) of the rises of the secondary ionic strengths of Al and In were almost the same as the gradient of the fall of the concentration of Mg which was not higher than the background level (approximately 5E18 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) of the concentration of H. This tells that Mg in the MQW active layer <b>14</b> was well below the detection limit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, the concentration of Mg in each of the undoped GaN cap layer <b>17</b> and the undoped AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> was estimated at 1E18 cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or less.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As a result, it was confirmed that the diffusion of Mg into the MQW active layer <b>14</b> was effectively inhibited by the two-layered structure including: the undoped thick GaN cap layer <b>17</b>; and the undoped thin AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> in which the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> was low.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing a dependency of the light emission efficiency of the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> on an electric current in comparison with a dependency of the light emission efficiency of a first comparative example on an electric current. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the first comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The dependency of the light emission efficiency of each nitride semiconductor light emitting device was obtained by measuring the intensity of light emitted from the nitride semiconductor light emitting device by use of an integrating sphere while changing the electric current to be supplied to the nitride semiconductor light emitting device; and dividing the intensity of the light by the supplied electric current.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In general, the dependency of the light emission efficiency of any nitride semiconductor light emitting device tends to decrease as the electric current increases, except for a low range of the electric current at and immediately after the time of the rise. This stems from something such as: the decrease in the efficiency of the carrier injection which occurs because the probability of injected carriers overflowing from the MQW active layer <b>14</b> becomes larger as the electric current increases; and the decrease in the internal quantum efficiency of the MQW active layer which occurs due to the heat generation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this respect, the first comparative example was a nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>40</b> which, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, did not include the undoped thick GaN cap layer <b>17</b>. To begin with, the first comparative example is explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>40</b> of the first comparative example exhibited almost the same light emission efficiency as did the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> of the embodiment, while the electric current was 5 mA or less. However, the light emission efficiency of the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>40</b> of the first comparative example decreased rapidly as the electric current increased.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the other hand, the light emission efficiency of the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> of the embodiment decreased slowly as the electric current increased. In addition, higher light emission efficiency was obtained from the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> of the embodiment than from the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>40</b> of the first comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The rate of the increase in the light emission efficiency was approximately 9% when the electric current was 20 mA, and approximately 17% when the electric current was 50 mA. The rate of the increase tended to increase as the electric current increased.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">This suggests that particularly the undoped thick GaN cap layer <b>17</b> inhibited the diffusion of Mg into the MQW active layer <b>14</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this respect, the second comparative example was a nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>60</b> which, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, did not include the undoped thin AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> in which the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> was low. To begin with, the second comparative example will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>60</b> of the second comparative example exhibited almost the same light emission efficiency as did the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> of the embodiment, while the electric current was 10 mA or less. However, the light emission efficiency of the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>60</b> of the second comparative example decreased rapidly as the electric current increased.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">On the other hand, the light emission efficiency of the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> of the embodiment decreased slowly as the electric current increased.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The rate of the increase in the light emission efficiency was approximately 3% when the electric current was 20 mA, and approximately 6% when the electric current was 50 mA. The rate of the increase tended to increase as the electric current increased.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">This suggests that even the thin AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> in which the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> was low efficiently inhibited the thermal deterioration of the MQW active layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing the dependency of the light emission efficiency of the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> on the electric current in comparison with the dependency of the light emission efficiency of a third comparative example on the electric current.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is the diagram showing the dependency of the light emission efficiency of each of: the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> of the embodiment where the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> in the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> was 0.003; and the nitride semiconductor light emitting device of the third comparative example where the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> in the AlGaN cap layer was 0.05.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the dependency of the light emission efficiency on the electric current was almost the same between the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> of the embodiment and the nitride semiconductor light emitting device of the third comparative example. However, higher light emission efficiency was obtained from the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> of the embodiment than from the nitride semiconductor light emitting device of the third comparative example in the full range of the electric current.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The rate of the increase in the light emission efficiency was approximately 3% when the electric current was 20 mA, and approximately 2.2% when the electric current was 50 mA. The rate of the increase in the light emission efficiency per unit increase in the electric current tended to be almost constant.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">This suggests that because the crystallinity of the AlGaN layer increased as the Al composition ratio became lower, the effect of inhibiting the diffusion of Mg into the MQW active layer <b>14</b> was better in the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> than in the AlGaN cap layer of the third comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">From this, it was confirmed that the optimizing of the two-layered structure including the GaN cap layer <b>17</b> and the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> created the synergism between the effect of inhibiting the thermal deterioration of the MQW active layer <b>14</b> and the effect of preventing the diffusion of Mg into the MQW active layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, a method for manufacturing the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 11</figref> are cross-sectional views showing the manufacturing steps for the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> in the sequential order.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">First of all, as a preliminary treatment, a substrate <b>11</b>, for example, a C-plane sapphire substrate is subjected to organic cleaning and acid cleaning, for example. Thereafter, the resultant substrate <b>11</b> is contained in a reaction chamber of the MOCVD system. Subsequently, the temperature Ts of the substrate <b>11</b> is raised to T<b>0</b>, for example, 1100&#xb0; C. by high-frequency heating in a normal-pressure atmosphere of a mixed gas of a nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas and a hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas. Thereby, the surface of the substrate <b>11</b> is etched in gas phase, and a natural oxide film formed on the surface of the substrate <b>11</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Afterward, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the undoped GaN layer <b>12</b> with a thickness of 3 &#x3bc;m is formed by using the mixed gas of the N<sub>2 </sub>gas and the H<sub>2 </sub>gas as a carrier gas while supplying an ammonium (NH<sub>3</sub>) gas and trimethyl gallium (TMG), for example, as process gases.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Subsequently, the n-type GaN clad layer <b>13</b> with a thickness of 2 &#x3bc;m is formed while supplying a silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) gas, for example, as the n-type dopant.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Thereafter, the temperature Ts of the substrate <b>11</b> is decreased to and kept at T<b>1</b>, for example, 800&#xb0; C. which is lower than T<b>0</b>, while continuing supplying the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas with the supply of TMG and the SiH<sub>4 </sub>gas stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Afterward, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the GaN barrier layer <b>15</b> with a thickness of 5 nm is formed by using the N<sub>2 </sub>gas as the carrier gas while supplying the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas and TMG, for example, as the process gases. After that, the InGaN well layer <b>16</b> with a thickness of 2.5 nm, in which the In composition ratio is 0.1, is formed by supplying trimethyl indium (TMI) as another process gas.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Subsequently, the forming of the GaN barrier layer <b>15</b> and the forming of the InGaN well layer <b>16</b> are alternately repeated 7 times, for example, while intermittently supplying TMI. Thereby, the MQW active layer <b>14</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the undoped GaN cap layer <b>17</b> with a thickness of 5 nm is formed while continuing supplying TMG and the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas with the supply of TMI stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Afterward, the undoped AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> with a thickness of 1 nm, in which the Al composition ratio is 0.003, is formed while supplying trimethyl aluminum (TMA) with the supply of TMG continuing.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">After that, the temperature Ts of the substrate <b>11</b> is raised to and kept at T<b>2</b>, for example, 1030&#xb0; C. which is higher than Ti, in the N<sub>2 </sub>gas atmosphere while continuing supplying the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas with the supply of TMA stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the p-type AlGaN electron barrier layer <b>19</b> with a thickness of 10 nm, in which the concentration of Mg is 1E19 to 20 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, is formed by using the mixed gas of the N<sub>2 </sub>gas and the H<sub>2 </sub>gas as the carrier gas while supplying: the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas, TMG and TMA as the process gases; and bis(cyclopentadienyl) magnesium (Cp2Mg) as the p-type dopant.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Thereafter, the p-type GaN clad layer <b>20</b> with a thickness of approximately 100 nm, in which the concentration of Mg is 1E20 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, is formed while continuing supplying TMG and Cp2Mg with the supply of TMA stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Thereafter, the p-type GaN contact layer <b>21</b> with a thickness of approximately 10 nm, in which the concentration of Mg is 1E21 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, is formed while supplying an increased amount of Cp2Mg.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Afterward, the temperature Ts of the substrate <b>11</b> is lowered naturally with the supply of only the carrier gas continued while continuing supplying the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas with the supply of TMG stopped. The supplying of the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas is continued until the temperature Ts of the substrate <b>11</b> reaches 500&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">After that, the resultant substrate <b>11</b> is taken out of the MOCVD system. Subsequently, a portion of the resultant substrate <b>11</b> is removed by RIE (reactive ion etching) until the removed portion reaches the n-type GaN clad layer <b>13</b>. Thereafter, the n-side electrode <b>23</b> made of Ti/Pt/Au is formed on the exposed portion of the n-type GaN clad layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Furthermore, the p-side electrode <b>22</b> made of Ni/Au is formed on the p-type GaN contact layer <b>21</b>. The nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is obtained through these steps.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The measurement of the I-V (current-voltage) characteristic of the nitride semiconductor light emitting device <b>10</b> shows that the operation voltage is 3.1 to 3.5V when the electric current is 20 mA. On this occasion, approximately 15 mW is obtained as the light output. The peak wavelength of the light emission is approximately 450 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the embodiment, as described above, the undoped thick GaN cap layer <b>17</b> and the undoped thin AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b>, in which the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> is low, are formed at the temperature which is equal to the temperature T<b>1</b> for forming the MQW active layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As a result, the thermal deterioration of the MQW active layer <b>14</b> is prevented while the temperature is raised from the temperature T<b>1</b> to the temperature T<b>2</b>. In addition, the diffusion of Mg into the MQW active layer <b>14</b> can be prevented while the p-type AlGaN electron barrier layer <b>19</b> and the p-type GaN contact layer <b>21</b> are formed at the temperature T<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thereby, the quality of the MQW active layer <b>14</b> is maintained. This makes it possible to obtain: the nitride semiconductor light emitting device capable of offering the sufficient light output; and the method for manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The film thickness of the GaN cap layer <b>17</b> as well as the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> and the film thickness of the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b>, which are mentioned in the foregoing descriptions of the embodiment, are shown as the examples. It is more desirable that the film thickness of the GaN cap layer <b>17</b> as well as the Al composition ratio x<b>1</b> and the film thickness of the AlGaN cap layer <b>18</b> should be optimized depending on the structure of the nitride semiconductor light emitting device, the manufacturing conditions for the nitride semiconductor light emitting device, and the like within the scope not departing from the gist which has been described above.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The foregoing descriptions have been provided for the case where the C-plane sapphire substrate is used as the substrate <b>11</b>. However, another substrate, for example, a GaN substrate, a SiC substrate, a ZnO substrate or something similar may be used as the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Furthermore, the plane orientation of the substrate <b>11</b> is not limited to the C-plane. Another plane, for example, a nonpolar plane may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The foregoing descriptions have been provided for the case where MOCVD is used as the film-forming technique for a nitride semiconductor layer. However, another film-forming technique, for example, hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), or something similar may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The foregoing descriptions have been provided for the case where TMG, TMA, TMI, NH<sub>3 </sub>are used as the process gases. However, another process gas, for example, triethyl gallium (TEG) may be used.</p>
