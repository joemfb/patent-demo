<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Field devices are used in a variety of process installations to provide extremely important process monitoring and control functions. Examples of process installations include petroleum, pharmaceutical, chemical, pulp, and other fluid processing installations. In such installations, the process control and measurement network may include tens or even hundreds of various field devices that periodically require maintenance to ensure that such devices are functioning properly and/or calibrated. Moreover, when one or more errors in the process control and measurement installation are detected, the use of a handheld field maintenance tool allows a technician to quickly diagnose such errors in the field. Handheld field maintenance tools are generally used to configure, calibrate, and diagnose problems relative to intelligent field devices using digital process communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Since at least some process installations may involve highly volatile, or even explosive, environments, it is often beneficial, or even required, for field devices and the handheld field maintenance tools used with such field devices to comply with Intrinsic Safety requirements. These requirements help ensure that compliant electrical devices will not generate a source of ignition even under fault conditions. One example of an Intrinsic Safety requirement is set forth in: APPROVAL STANDARD INTRINSICALLY SAFE APPARATUS AND ASSOCIATED APPARATUS FOR USE IN CLASS I, II, and III, DIVISION NUMBER 1 HAZARDOUS (CLASSIFIED) LOCATIONS, CLASS NUMBER 3610, promulgated by Factory Mutual Research October, 1998. An example of a handheld field maintenance tool that complies with Intrinsic Safety requirements includes that sold under the trade designation Model 475 Field Communicator, available from Emerson Process Management of Austin, Tex.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While intelligent field devices and handheld field maintenance devices have provided a variety of new functions and capabilities with respect to handheld field maintenance, some functions are still somewhat cumbersome. For example, the task of commissioning field devices (connecting them for the first time) for a process control system is typically a two-person operation. One person is out in the field connecting the field device and the other person is in the control room monitoring the control system display or displays to see if the connections are successful. Proving a system and method that could transform heretofore two-person field maintenance tasks to single-person tasks would facilitate handheld field maintenance. Moreover, such a system could also generally provide enhanced interaction with the process control system itself.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Intelligent field devices typically use an industrial communication protocol often called a fieldbus to communicate with the control system. The fieldbus is generally optimized for process control functions performed by the field device. The person in the field (such as a technician) will typically use a special purpose handheld field maintenance tool called a field communicator to communicate with the field device over the fieldbus using a process industry standard communication protocol to make adjustments to the field device that are necessary to prepare it for connection to the control system or to perform its specific function in the control system. As set forth above, at least some tasks of handheld field maintenance currently require two people. However, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, the need for a person in a control room may be eliminated if a suitable remote terminal or connection is provided to the technician in the field for tasks currently being done in the control room. While some embodiments of the present invention could be practiced with the functionality of a laptop or tablet computer using a wireless connection back to the control system host running software that performs the functions of the workstation(s) being used in the control room, it is preferred to use a handheld field maintenance tool. This is because the physical requirement of a laptop or tablet computer would provide just another device that the technician would need to carry. Further, since at least some process installations have highly volatile environments, the need for an intrinsically safe device would be required. While tablet computers and laptop computers are common, intrinsically safe computers are special-purpose devices that are very expensive and complex.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagrammatic view of a process control and monitoring system with which embodiments of the present invention are particularly useful. Control room <b>10</b> is coupled to one or more field devices <b>18</b> via a process communication loop <b>16</b>. Field device <b>18</b> is illustratively depicted as a process fluid pressure sensor mounted to process fluid conduit <b>14</b>. However, a variety of process fluid variable generators, such as process fluid temperature sensors, process fluid flow sensors, et cetera, are known. Control room <b>10</b> is illustrated simply as a rectangular box. In reality, control room <b>10</b> is a location that is physically spaced from the volatile, and potentially explosive, atmosphere of the process installation. Moreover, control room <b>10</b> may include one or more workstations or personal computers that operate process control software and/or asset management software. The one or more various workstations and computers disposed within control room <b>10</b> are generally communicatively coupled together via a data communication network, such as an Ethernet network.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Process control loop <b>16</b> is generally a special form of communication network. This is because the communication through loop <b>16</b> is generally done in an energy-limited fashion in order to ensure that energy levels are kept low enough to ensure that no sources of ignition can be provided to the potentially explosive environment. Examples of known process communication or control loop protocols include the Highway Addressable Remote Transducer (HART&#xae;) Protocol, FOUNDATION&#x2122; Fieldbus, PROFIBUS-PA, et cetera.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As set forth above, for some tasks relative to the maintenance of a process control system, it is generally necessary for a technician to travel into the field proximate the location of a field device, such as process fluid pressure transmitter <b>18</b>, to provide maintenance to that field device. Generally, a handheld field maintenance tool is used by a technician to interact with the field device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are diagrammatic views of a handheld field maintenance tool <b>22</b> coupled to field device is in accordance with the prior art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, handheld field maintenance tool includes a pair of terminals <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> that couple to task leads <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, respectively, which are then are coupled to terminals <b>24</b> of field device <b>20</b>. Terminals <b>24</b> may be dedicated terminals to allow such a handheld field maintenance tool to couple to device <b>20</b> and interact with device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows an alternate arrangement where handheld field maintenance tool <b>22</b> couples directly to the process control loop <b>34</b> to which field device <b>23</b> is coupled. In either case, the wired connection between the handheld field maintenance tool and the field device allows the handheld field maintenance tool to interact with the desired field device <b>20</b>, <b>23</b>. More recently, wireless process communication protocols, such as WirelessHART have been provided. Handheld field maintenance tools are also beginning to take advantage of these wireless technologies to interact with wirelessly-communicating field devices.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Maintenance technicians and mobile workers typically perform duties in plant environments using tools such as handheld field maintenance tools. These tools can be synchronized with host asset management applications such as AMS device manager, available from Emerson Process Management of Austin, Tex., for the exchange of field device configuration information. However, when the handheld field maintenance tool is used in the field and is attached to a fieldbus network (HART&#xae;, FOUNDATION&#x2122; fieldbus, PROFIBUS-PA, or other network involving digital communications protocols), the handheld field maintenance tool does not have access to historical or other information regarding instruments being examined. Applications such as AMS Device Manager contain a wealth of asset information not usually stored on the handheld field maintenance tool, such as current and historical configuration data, device changes, current and historical alert information, product data sheets, current and historical calibration information, as well as user-entered information such as drawings and notes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present invention generally leverage the digital communication channel necessarily present at each field device to provide a communication channel to a handheld field maintenance tool. The fact that the handheld field maintenance tool is connected to a fieldbus network means that communications could technically be established with a host application running on a host computer or higher-level plant network and allow the tool to act as a client application if the appropriate application software is provided on both the handheld field maintenance tool and the host computer. While embodiments of the present invention can be practiced with a laptop or tablet computer providing a direct Wi-Fi connection back to the control system host network running software that performs the functions of the work stations being used in the control room, preferred embodiments generally include a handheld field maintenance tool that communicatively couples with the host computer. Since the handheld field maintenance tool is already required to perform the tasks necessary to commission field devices, a preferred embodiment in comparison to a laptop or tablet is to enable the handheld field maintenance tool to perform the functions of the workstation being used in the control room. One manner in which this can be provided is for the handheld field maintenance tool to use a simple software application running in the processor of the handheld field maintenance tool that connects as a remote terminal or thin-client, while the handheld field maintenance tool is located out in the field, to a server application in the control room, where the majority of the computational work is done by the workstation(s) in the control room.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagrammatic view of a handheld field maintenance tool or mobile device <b>122</b> physically coupled to field device <b>18</b> by virtue of dashed connection <b>124</b>. Wired connection <b>124</b> allows handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> to communicate over process communication loop <b>16</b>. More particularly, for process installations that employ digital process communication protocols, such as the Highway Addressable Remote Transducer (HART&#xae;) Protocol, or the FOUNDATION&#x2122; Fieldbus, handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> is able to communicate digitally with devices coupled to process communication loop <b>16</b>. Industry standard process communication protocols utilize communication technologies that are able to, in some instances, wholly power connected field devices. Moreover, such protocols can be used with field devices that comply with intrinsic safety specifications such as that set forth above. While the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is preferred, embodiments of the present invention are also applicable to wireless process communication techniques as well. For example, field device <b>18</b>, instead of having a wired connection to a process communication loop may include wireless process communication circuitry, such as WirelessHART communication set forth in International Standard (IEC 62591). This standard uses wireless communication, at the 2.4 GHz frequency, but otherwise employs the same command structure as that used in wired HART communication. While the WirelessHART protocol is one example of a wireless process communication protocol, other standards can be employed in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Additional details of the WirelessHART specification are published by the HART Communications Foundation. Relevant portions of the WirelessHART specification include: HCF_Spec 13, revision 7.0; HART Specification 65&#x2014;Wireless Physical Layer Specification; HART Specification 75&#x2014;TDMA Data Link Layer Specification (TDMA refers to Time Division Multiple Access); HART Specification 85&#x2014;Network Management Specification; HART Specification 155&#x2014;Wireless Command Specification; and HART Specification 290&#x2014;Wireless Devices Specification. Accordingly, suitable radio-frequency communication circuitry within handheld device <b>122</b> may be able to communicate in accordance with a wireless process communication protocol, such as WirelessHART.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">By virtue of the field device's location, it can be assumed with certainty that a communicative link is possible via either a wired process communication link, or a wireless process communication link. Leveraging this knowledge, handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> is able to join or otherwise communicate over the process communication loop through which field device <b>18</b> communicates, or will communicate. Accordingly, by virtue of its communicative coupling, handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> or mobile device is able to establish communication through the process communication loop to a host computer (illustrated diagrammatically at reference numeral <b>126</b>). While the communicative coupling of the mobile device or handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> to work station <b>126</b> may be performed using either wired process communication, or wireless process communication, a communication channel or link <b>128</b> is obtained between the device <b>122</b> and work station <b>126</b>, regardless. Link <b>128</b> may be created using the appropriate communications protocol specific to the type of fieldbus network for field device <b>18</b>. For example, some form of pass-through or embedded message may be used within the allowable payloads of the specific process communication protocol. For example, the techniques taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,370,448 for communicating HTTP, or other suitable information, over a process communication loop can be employed in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagrammatic view of a handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> coupled to workstation <b>126</b> via communicative coupling <b>128</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a thin-client <b>132</b> running within tool <b>122</b>. Thin-client <b>132</b> is a computer program executing upon the processor of handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> that depends heavily on thin-client server module <b>130</b> running within workstation <b>126</b> to fulfill its computational role. For example, in one embodiment, handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> is that sold under the trade designation, <b>475</b> Field Communicator available from Emerson Process Management of Eden Prairie, Minn. That device runs on Windows CE, a robust, real-time operating system. Accordingly, in one embodiment, thin-client <b>132</b> includes remote desktop connection or terminal services client software <b>132</b> suitable for operation on the Windows CE operating system. In such embodiment, workstation <b>126</b> runs a Microsoft Windows-based operating system, such as Windows <b>7</b> and provides a server daemon or process <b>130</b>. When thin-client <b>132</b> is executing within handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> and coupled to server daemon <b>130</b>, thin-client <b>132</b> can present, on the display of handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b>, a display that corresponds to that currently shown on the display of workstation <b>126</b>. Additionally, user inputs, such as key presses and stylus or cursor positioning on handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> are instead transferred to and injected into workstation <b>126</b>. In this way, the handheld field maintenance tool becomes an extension of the user interface for work station <b>126</b> thereby allowing the technician to interact with the control system and/or asset management system to which work station <b>126</b> is coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram of a method <b>150</b> of interacting with a process control system using a mobile device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Method <b>150</b> begins at block <b>152</b> where a mobile device, such as a handheld field maintenance tool, is brought into physical proximity of a field device. At block <b>154</b>, the mobile device is coupled to the digital process communication channel of the field device. As set forth above, this may be either a wired or a wireless coupling. At block <b>156</b>, a client software application is initiated on the mobile device. This application may be a remote terminal, or any other suitable client. At block <b>158</b>, the client software application is communicatively coupled to a host application through the communication channel of the field device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">While handheld field maintenance tools have generally been synchronized with asset management systems, they have not typically had access to historical or other information regarding the instruments being examined while the handheld field maintenance tools were used in the field. Applications such as AMS Device Manager contain a wealth of asset information not usually stored on the handheld field maintenance tool. Such information includes current and historical configuration data, device changes, current and historic alert information, product data sheets, current and historical calibration information as well as user-entered information such as drawings and notes. All such information can now be accessed quickly and easily by the technician while in the field with the handheld field maintenance tool. This can help provide the field maintenance worker with information to ensure that the best possible decisions can be made relative to the duties that are being performed in the field. In addition, this kind of activity may allow the actions being performed in the field to initiate actions within the asset management system, such as the logging of events or alerts, recording of manual steps being performed, as well as the initiation of work requested to a higher-level application such as a Computer Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS). Moreover, asset management systems are available to continuously monitor assets in the plant environment over fieldbus networks, and have the abilities to detect field changes and alert information. However, to date, there has not been a mechanism for a user or technician connected to one of those networks in the field to actually become a client to the asset management system over the fieldbus network. While the thin-client description has been provided with respect to the Windows-based operating systems, those skilled in the art will recognize that other thin-clients are possible. Moreover, the thin-client executing within handheld field maintenance tool <b>122</b> may be configured to access a plurality of different servers within the control room or process control network. Thus, a vast array of new functions can be easily performed by the field maintenance worker, while in the field, that traditionally required a second operator seated at the workstation, such as work station <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
