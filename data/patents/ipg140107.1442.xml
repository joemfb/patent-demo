<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to connectorized optical fibers, and more specifically, to methods for collapsing voids in the cladding of nano-engineered optical fibers, and to a method of manufacturing optical connectors that include such fiber(s).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Technical Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Optical fibers containing voids or holes are being designed and produced for a number of applications. However, optical fiber containing voids or holes may present problems in connectorization of this type of fiber. For example, material ingress into the holes or egress out of the holes can change the properties of the optical fiber in an undesirable manner if they are large enough, and could also interfere with connector function. In addition, in fibers with a high density of holes the mechanical cleaving process is disrupted and hackle may result. Also, when such fiber is used in optical connectors, difficulties may arise in connecting or splicing such optical fiber to conventional optical fiber. For example, core alignment of the optical fibers to be joined is hindered by the presence of the holes in the vicinity of the end to be spliced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Optical fiber connectors enable rapid connection and disconnection of optical fibers as compared to fusion splicing. Connectors serve to align the cores of mating optical fibers so that light can pass between them with minimal loss (attenuation), and provide mechanical coupling to hold the mating fibers together. In the early days of fiber optic systems, the use of connectors was problematic because poor connections introduced attenuation, and the connectorization process was time-consuming and required highly trained technicians. However, manufacturers have since standardized and simplified optical fiber connectors, thereby contributing to their increased use in fiber optic systems. The increased use of connectors has greatly contributed to new uses and applications for fiber optic systems, including new and creative deployments in building infrastructures.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Attendant with the increased use of fiber optic systems are issues relating to deploying optical fiber cables wherein the cables need to be bent to accommodate the geometry of a pre-existing structure or infrastructure. Improper handling and deployment of a fiber optic cable can result in macrobending losses, also known as &#x201c;extrinsic losses.&#x201d; In ray-optics terms, severe bending of an optical fiber can cause the angles at which the light rays reflect within the fiber to exceed the critical angle of reflection. Stated in electromagnetic-wave terms, the bending causes one or more of the guided modes of the optical fiber to become leaky modes wherein light escapes or &#x201c;leaks&#x201d; from the guiding region of the fiber. Such bending losses can be prevented by observing the minimum bend radius of the particular optical fibers and optical fiber cables that carry the optical fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Because deploying fiber optic cables typically involves bending one or more of the cables at some location, advanced optical fibers have been developed that have improved bend performance properties. Enhanced bend performance allows for fiber optic cables to be deployed in a greater number of locations than might otherwise be accessible due to the bending limits of a conventional fiber optic cable. One type of bend-performance optical fiber is a &#x201c;nano-engineered&#x201d; fiber that utilizes small holes or voids (&#x201c;airlines&#x201d;) formed in the optical fiber. Nano-engineered fibers operate using basically the same wave-guiding principles as ordinary optical fibers wherein the light is guided in the core by the index difference between the core and cladding, with the exception that the nano-engineered region enhances the fibers' light-carrying ability even when severely bent. However, while nano-engineered bend-performance fibers offer a significant increase in the minimum bend radius, there are some shortcomings when it comes to connectorizing such fibers because of the voids or airlines present at the end of a cleaved fiber. For example, contaminants can fill the fiber voids (i.e., airlines) at the fiber end face and ingress into the fiber, thereby reducing the efficiency of the connection. One such contaminant is water. Other contaminants include micro-debris generated at the connector end face during the connector polishing processes, such as mixtures of zirconium ferrule material and silica glass removed during polishing, abrasives from polishing films, and deionized water. These contaminants may become trapped or embedded in the airlines at the connector end face. Due to the various forces and attendant heat that the connector end experiences during the polishing process, it is extremely difficult to remove the contaminants once they are in place. In addition, contamination in the fiber that is freed during operation and/or handling of the fiber and that moves across the connector end face into the fiber core region may also increase signal attenuation.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Reference is now made to preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Whenever possible, the same reference numbers and symbols are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the description below, the &#x201c;refractive index profile&#x201d; is the relationship between refractive index or relative refractive index and waveguide fiber radius. The &#x201c;relative refractive index percent&#x201d; is defined as &#x394;<sub>i</sub>(%)=[(n<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>&#x2212;r<sub>c</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2n<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>]&#xd7;100, where n<sub>i </sub>is the maximum refractive index in region i, unless otherwise specified, and n<sub>c </sub>is the average refractive index of a cladding region, as discussed below. In some example embodiments, n<sub>c </sub>is taken as the refractive index of an inner annular cladding region <b>32</b>, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As used herein, the relative refractive index percent is represented by &#x394;(%) or just &#x201c;&#x394;&#x201d; for short, and its values are given in units of &#x201c;%&#x201d;, unless otherwise specified or as is apparent by the context of the discussion.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In cases where the refractive index of a region is less than the average refractive index of the cladding region, the relative refractive index percent is negative and is referred to as having a &#x201c;depressed region&#x201d; or a &#x201c;depressed index,&#x201d; and is calculated at the point at which the relative refractive index is most negative unless otherwise specified. In cases where the refractive index of a region is greater than the average refractive index of the cladding region, the relative refractive index percent is positive and the region can be said to be raised or to have a positive index.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An &#x201c;updopant&#x201d; is herein considered to be a dopant, which has a propensity to raise the refractive index relative to pure undoped SiO<sub>2</sub>. A &#x201c;downdopant&#x201d; is herein considered to be a dopant, which has a propensity to lower the refractive index relative to pure undoped SiO<sub>2</sub>. An updopant may be present in a region of an optical fiber having a negative relative refractive index when accompanied by one or more other dopants that are not updopants. Likewise, one or more other dopants that are not updopants may be present in a region of an optical fiber having a positive relative refractive index. A downdopant may be present in a region of an optical fiber having a positive relative refractive index when accompanied by one or more other dopants that are not downdopants. Likewise, one or more other dopants that are not downdopants may be present in a region of an optical fiber having a negative relative refractive index.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Other techniques to form depressed index regions besides the use of downdopants, such as through the use of microstructures, are used in example embodiments of the present invention and are described in greater detail below. Microstructures include, for example, non-periodic and periodic discrete microvoids occurring along the length of the fiber such as airlines having a diameter in fiber cross-section of greater than 5 nm (nanometer) and less than 1550 nm (for example airlines greater than 5 nm with an average diameter of approximately 250 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The terms voids, holes and airlines can be used interchangeably and mean a portion of the optical fiber which contains empty space or a gas.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The mode field diameter (MFD) is a measure of the spot size or beam width of light across the end face of an optical fiber. MFD is a function of source wavelength and the fiber geometry, i.e., fiber core radius and fiber refractive index profile. The vast majority of the optical power propagating in an optical fiber travels within the fiber core, with a small amount of power propagating in the cladding as an evanescent field. Mismatches in the mode field diameter can affect splice and connector loss. The MFD is measured using the Peterman II method wherein, 2 w=MFD, and w<sup>2</sup>=(2&#x222b;f<sup>2 </sup>rdr/&#x222b;[df/dr]<sup>2 </sup>rdr), the integral limits being 0 to &#x221e;. A method of experimentally measuring the MFD is the variable aperture method in the far field (VAMFF), which is described in the article by Parton, J. R., &#x201c;Improvements in the Variable Aperture Method for Measuring the Mode-Field Diameter of a Dispersion-Shifted Fiber,&#x201d; <i>Journal of Lightwave Technology</i>, Vol. 7, No. 8, August 1989 (pp. 1158-1161), which article is incorporated by reference herein. The MFD is measured in irradiance, which is optical power per unit area (W/cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For a Gaussian power distribution in a single-mode optical fiber, the MFD is measured between points at which the electric and magnetic field strengths are reduced to 1/e of their maximum values, i.e., it is the diameter at which the optical power is reduced to 1/e<sup>2 </sup>of the maximum power, wherein power is proportional to the square of the field strength. As used herein, MFD assumes a given wavelength (e.g., 1550 nm) unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A related concept to MFD is the &#x201c;effective area&#x201d; of an optical fiber, which is defined as: A<sub>eff</sub>=2&#x3c0;(&#x222b;f<sup>2 </sup>r dr)<sup>2</sup>/(&#x222b;f<sup>4 </sup>r dr), where r is the radial coordinate, the integration limits are 0 to &#x221e;, and f is the transverse component of the electric field associated with light propagated in the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In multi-mode fibers (either the step-index or the graded-index variety), the core diameter is typically used to measure the distribution of the light beam exiting the fiber. The core size is measured optically, and in a preferred approach is defined as the diameter corresponding to a specific threshold percentage of power in the core. A standard core diameter measurement approach is set out by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard IEC 60793-1-2 (2001). For reference, see the IEC 60793-1-2 document under &#x201c;Measurement methods and test procedures&#x2014;Fibre geometry,&#x201d; Section C.4.2.2 Option 2, which document section is incorporated by reference herein by way of background information. The IEC standard is used herein as the definition of core diameter for multi-mode nano-engineered fibers <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Note that MFD and the core diameter are related concepts that describe the distribution of light exiting the fiber based on a threshold amount of power. In the present invention, these parameters change by substantially the same amounts. Accordingly, the description herein and the claims below use the term &#x201c;mode field diameter&#x201d; or MFD in the general sense to describe the light distribution associated with either a single-mode or a multi-mode fiber, where the MFD for a single-mode fiber is defined as above, and wherein the MFD of a multi-mode fiber is defined as the core diameter according to the aforementioned IEC standard.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In general, the MFD increases after heating the fibers, though in some instances the MFD can decrease. Thus, changes in the MFD (denoted &#x201c;&#x394;MFD&#x201d;) refer to the absolute value of the change.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Nano-Engineered Fibers (&#x201c;nano-engineered fibers&#x201d;) have nano-engineered features in the form of relatively small aperiodically arranged airlines facilitate the guiding of optical-frequency electromagnetic waves in a glass fiber core in a manner that makes the optical fiber resistant to optical loss even when the fiber is bent to a small bending radius (i.e., the fiber is &#x201c;bend resistant&#x201d;). The nano-engineered fibers otherwise operate in the same manner as standard optical fibers. This is in contrast to photonic crystal fibers, which are constituted by a periodic array of relatively large holes formed in a dielectric medium (or by an array of dielectric tubes), wherein the guiding of optical-frequency electromagnetic waves is dictated by allowed and forbidden photonic energy bands defined by the array of holes. Nano-engineered fibers have airlines limited to a relative small airline-containing region wherein the air-fill percent (the area fraction of airlines to the area of the optical fiber times 100%, at a pre-selected cross-section) is less than about 1% and is usually about 0.02% to about 0.2% or about 0.3%. The term nano-engineered optical fiber (also sometimes referred to herein as micro-structured optical fiber) refers to an optical glass fiber comprising these nanometer-size features. In contrast, the holes in photonic crystal fibers occupy a large portion of the fiber and have an air-fill percent of 5% to 50%, i.e., at least five times greater, and more typically about two orders of magnitude greater than the nano-engineered fibers contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">These important physical differences between these two types of fibers have practical implications in the connectorization process. In particular, collapsing the holes of a photonic crystal fiber necessarily causes a significant change in the fiber size and thus the MFD, which adversely impacts the connectorization process and the resulting connector. Consequently, the systems and methods described herein apply only to nano-engineered fibers and not to photonic crystal fibers.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A protective cover <b>50</b> is shown surrounding outer annular cladding <b>36</b>. In an example embodiment, protective cover <b>50</b> includes one or more polymer or plastic-based layers or coatings, such as a buffer coating or buffer layer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an example embodiment, an annular hole-containing region <b>34</b> is comprised of periodically or non-periodically disposed holes or &#x201c;airlines&#x201d; 40 that run substantially parallel to centerline <b>16</b> and that are configured such that the optical fiber is capable of single mode transmission at one or more wavelengths in one or more operating wavelength ranges. By &#x201c;non-periodically disposed&#x201d; or &#x201c;non-periodic distribution,&#x201d; it will be understood to mean that when one takes a cross-section (such as a cross-section perpendicular to the longitudinal axis) of the optical fiber, the non-periodically disposed airlines are randomly or non-periodically distributed across a portion of the fiber. Similar cross sections taken at different points along the length of the fiber will reveal different cross-sectional airline patterns, i.e., various cross-sections will have different airline patterns, wherein the distributions of airlines and sizes of airlines do not match. That is, the airlines are non-periodic, i.e., they are not periodically disposed within the fiber structure. These airlines are stretched (elongated) along the length (i.e. in a direction generally parallel to the longitudinal axis) of the optical fiber, but do not extend the entire length of the entire fiber for typical lengths of transmission fiber. Typically the airlines extend less than 10 meters, e.g., 0.2 to 1 meter or less.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As mentioned above, the nano-engineered fibers <b>10</b> suitable for use in the present invention preferably include an air-fill percent less than about 1%, more preferably less than about 0.7%, and even more preferably less than about 0.3%, and even more preferably between about 0.02% and about 0.2%. An optical fiber suitable for use in the present invention further has an average hole size of about 0.3 microns or less, such as 0.15 or 0.09 microns and greater than 0.005 microns. In contrast, holey fiber available from NTT, Japan, has an average hole size of about 12 microns and an air-fill percent of &#x3e;1%, and typical photonic crystal fibers have air-fill percents &#x3e;5%. Thus, as mentioned above, it is the small airline size of the nano-engineered fibers considered herein that allows the fibers to retain their circularity and nominally their original size when the airlines are collapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, because of the small size of airlines <b>40</b>, fibers processed using the air hole collapsing methods of the present invention are capable of being ITU-T G.652 compliant in that a 125 &#x3bc;m fiber is &#xb1;1 &#x3bc;m in diameter for proper connectorization processing after subjecting the fiber to the air hole collapsing method because of the less than 1% air-fill percent. In contrast, photonic crystal fiber, after collapsing the air holes therein, has a diameter change far greater than &#xb1;1 &#x3bc;m, and thus is not ITU-T G.652 compliant for connectorization. Thus, the methods of the present invention are able to collapse airlines <b>40</b> at the end of the fiber, while the end of the fiber retains about the same shape, cross-sectional diameter, and circularity, making the fibers and methods advantageous for mounting within a ferrule prior to closing the airlines, without risk of the fiber debonding from the ferrule upon hole closing, and without the fiber end becoming bulbous or otherwise deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For a variety of applications, it is desirable for the airlines <b>40</b> of the nano-engineered fibers <b>10</b> to have greater than about 95% of the airlines (and preferably all of the airlines) exhibit a mean airline size in the cladding for the optical fiber that is less than 1550 nm, more preferably less than 775 nm, most preferably less than 390 nm and in some embodiments less than 250 nm and greater than 5 nm. Likewise, it is preferable that the maximum diameter of the airlines in the fiber be less than 7000 nm, more preferably less than 4000 nm, more preferably less than 1550 nm, and most preferably less than 775 nm and in some embodiments less than 300 nm. In some embodiments, the fibers disclosed herein have greater than 50 airlines, in some embodiments also greater than 200 airlines, and in other embodiments the total number of airlines is greater than 500 airlines, while still in other embodiments the total number of airlines is greater than 1000 airlines in a given optical fiber perpendicular cross-section. Of course, the most preferred fibers will exhibit combinations of these characteristics. Thus, for example, one particularly preferred embodiment of optical fiber would exhibit greater than about 200 airlines in the optical fiber, the airlines having a maximum diameter less than 1550 nm and a mean diameter less than 775 nm, for example, the maximum diameter is less than 775 nm and the mean diameter of about 200 nm, although useful and bend resistant optical fibers can be achieved using larger and greater numbers of airlines. The hole number, mean diameter, max diameter, and total void area percent of airlines can all be calculated with the help of a scanning electron microscope at a magnification of about 800&#xd7; and image analysis software, such as ImagePro, which is available from Media Cybernetics, Inc. of Silver Spring, Md., USA.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Because the nano-engineered fibers <b>10</b> considered herein rely on the core-cladding index difference to guide light, the fiber can generally include germania or fluorine to adjust the refractive index of the core and/or cladding of the optical fiber, but these dopants do not have to be present in the annular region <b>34</b>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The embodiments of the present invention discussed herein provide method(s) for collapsing airlines <b>40</b> in the cladding region <b>30</b> of nano-engineered fibers <b>10</b> so as to perform optical fiber connectorization in a manner that provides the following advantage(s): the method minimizes or has no impact on: (i) fiber shape); (ii) the MFD for single-mode fibers (or core diameter in the case of multi-mode fibers) (iii) and/or the outer cladding diameter, and facilitates the connectorization process by processing (including closing holes) the fiber end face.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to some embodiments, a method for closing the holes on the end face of a nano-engineered fiber having a core, a cladding with non-periodically disposed airlines, and at least one of a coating and a buffer, comprises the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">cleaving the fiber portion, thereby forming a cleaved end face; and</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">applying a predetermined amount of laser beam energy to the cleaved end face, the amount of energy being sufficient to collapse and seal the airlines exposed at the cleaved end face, to provide a fiber end face having no airlines Preferably, the voids (airlines) are sealed at the cleaved end face only to a depth of less than 11 &#x3bc;m. The collapsed airlines are preferably collapsed to a depth of less than 11 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Preferably, the method includes the step of stripping a length of at least one of the coating and the buffer to expose an end section of the optical fiber prior to cleaving. Preferably the energy is applied via a laser beam applied directly to the end face of the fiber. Preferably the laser beam is supplied by a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser. Preferably the heat from the laser beam mostly provides surface flux at the end face of the fiber and penetrates and thus collapses the holes to a depth of less than 11 &#x3bc;m, preferably less than 5 &#x3bc;m, and preferably no more than 2 &#x3bc;m (the depth is measured from the end face of the fiber). Preferably, less than 20 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>of energy is delivered to the end face of the fiber, and if the laser is capable of supplying more energy, the excess energy should be preferably diverted prior to reaching the fiber. This can be done, for example, by expanding the laser beam; inserting partial transmission devices in the beam path; and/or inserting beam splitters in the beam path</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">There are several ways of controlling the energy delivered to the end face of the fiber, for example:</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">1) Controlling the number of pulses of laser energy delivered;</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">2) Controlling pulse duration of the individual pulses;</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">3) Controlling rest time between pulses;</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">4) Controlling the delivered intensity of the pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">For example, if a laser controller is used in conjunction with the laser, the number of pulses supplied by the laser is determined by the pulse count into the laser controller. Thus the desired number of pulses can be easily obtained. Likewise, the pulse duration out of the laser is easily controlled choosing the pulse duration that in within the operational range of the laser (for example, a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser used in some of the embodiments has a documented rise time on the order of 75 &#x3bc;Sec and it may be difficult to repeatedly control the pulse duration if it is below that value). Preferably, the surface temperature of the end face of the fiber is between the softening point of the fiber material (e.g., about 1600&#xb0; C. for silica) more preferably above 2000&#xb0; C., and below its vaporization point (e.g., about 2700&#xb0; C. for silica) more preferably below 2600&#xb0; C. The laser intensity (per pulse) is determined, for example, by the laser cavity design. To reduce the intensity delivered to the fiber end face, some of the laser beam energy provided by the laser can be diverted (so that id does not reach the fiber end face), or absorbed, or the laser beam can expanded prior to impinging on the fiber end face. Hence, the total energy delivered to the end face of the fiber may be controlled by proper selection of the above parameters. In addition the depth d of the closed voids may be controlled by the pulse duration and rest time between pulses.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The invention will be further clarified by the following examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">An example embodiment of a method for processing a nano-engineered fiber <b>10</b> for connectorization is now described. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the method includes preparing the optical fiber by stripping the buffer and/or coating layer <b>50</b> from the optical fiber over a specified region to expose a length or section of bare fiber <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The fiber is then cut to form a fiber end face <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Bare fiber <b>110</b> is then optionally cleaned e.g., with isopropyl alcohol solvent. Bare fiber <b>110</b> needs to be sufficiently long to allow for fiber installation into an optical connector, allowing the bare fiber to extend through the length of a connector ferrule, as discussed further below. Airlines <b>40</b> are shown schematically by the parallel dashed lines in bare fiber <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">After stripping and cleaning, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> the bare fiber is inserted into an input end <b>202</b> of a central bore <b>203</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>) of a connector ferrule <b>204</b> contained within an optical connector housing <b>200</b>. The insertion is performed so that there is some length of bare fiber <b>110</b> that protrudes beyond ferrule output end face <b>206</b>. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> is a close-up view of ferrule end face <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As part of the connectorization process, bare fiber <b>110</b> is then precision cleaved as close as possible to the ferrule output end face <b>206</b> so that the new fiber end face <b>112</b> is formed by the precision cleaving. Preferably, the new end face <b>112</b> of bare fiber <b>110</b> is positioned coplanar with the ferrule end face <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The fiber end face <b>112</b> includes a plurality of airlines <b>40</b> and may include hackle (uneven surface structure) produced by cleaving. The hackle may be primarily caused by a poor cleave. It is noted that the presence of holes may contribute to the poor cleave.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Following this precision cleave step, the fiber end face is subjected to localized heat sufficient to close airlines <b>40</b> in airline-containing region <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to form an airline-free end face <b>112</b>A and an airline free region <b>130</b> extending a small axial distance d (i.e., the distance along the fiber) from fiber end face <b>112</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>), wherein in an example embodiment d is less than &#x2155; of one fiber diameter (d&#x2266;0.2D<sub>10</sub>). In some embodiments d is less than &#x215b; of one fiber diameter (d&#x2266;0.125D<sub>10</sub>). In some embodiments d&#x2266;0.1D<sub>10</sub>. Preferably, according to some embodiments, the distance d less than 11 &#x3bc;m. In one example embodiment d&#x2266;5 &#x3bc;m). In some example embodiments, d&#x2266;3 &#x3bc;m, or d&#x2266;2 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Localized heating of the fiber end face may be generated by a laser beam, for example such that the energy from the laser is deposited primarily on the surface of the end face and primarily extends to a depth d, such that the voids are collapsed to the depth d. Other sources of heat (e.g., electrodes, or a flame) tend to deform the end face <b>112</b>A, because the heat generated by such sources penetrates too far into the glass (for example by 35 &#x3bc;m, 75 &#x3bc;m, or more) or heats large areas and thus may also destroy a connector ferrule. The laser beam should preferably directly intercept the end face of the fiber and preferably not the rest of the fiber. For example, the optical axis of the output beam, in the following embodiments, intercepts the fiber end face. More specifically the optical axis of the laser beam, is preferably positioned within approximately &#xb1;45&#xb0; (and preferably &#xb1;15&#xb0;, and more preferably normal to the end face of the fiber) and the laser beam diameter should be preferably not larger than the diameter of the bare fiber <b>110</b>. If the laser beam intercepts the end face of the fiber at an angle (so that its optical axis is not normal to the fiber end face), the beam intensity on the fiber end face will be less uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Some exemplary laser beam diameters are 5 &#x3bc;m, 125 &#x3bc;m, for example: 100 &#x3bc;m, 80 &#x3bc;m, 75 &#x3bc;m, 60 &#x3bc;m, 55 &#x3bc;m, or 10 &#x3bc;m. Such beam sizes may be provided for example, by use of a focusing lens. In the present example embodiment, the closure of the holes on the end face <b>112</b>A is accomplished by a laser beam <b>122</b> from the laser <b>120</b> that provides a laser beam of a predetermined wavelength, intensity and duration. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the focusing lens (with a focal length f=60 mm), when used in conjunction with a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser beam, created a beam waist of about 55 &#x3bc;m in diameter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates one exemplary relationship between the laser beam radius w and the location of the beam, different distances z away from the beam waist location. (Please note that w is the distance from the beam axis where the beam intensity drops to 1/e<sup>2 </sup>(approximately 13.5%) of its maximum value.) Thus, larger beam size diameters were provided to the end face <b>112</b> by placing the end face <b>112</b> a predetermined distance away from the beam waist location. For example, to achieve a 125 &#x3bc;m diameter beam, the end face of the fiber is situated 100 &#x3bc;m away from the beam waist location. It is noted that the laser beam incident at the end face of the fiber may be ring-shaped, or have a shape that substantially matches that of the fiber region containing the voids, so that the beam is incident only on the area containing the voids.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Preferably, the laser beam characteristics are such that the energy from the laser beam is deposited primarily on the surface of the fiber's end face and extends to a depth on the order of the depth d. According to some embodiments, the wavelength of the laser is preferably either above or below the transmission band of the optical glass of the fiber. Thus, according to some embodiments, the wavelength of the laser is, for example, below 200 nm, and preferably below 150 nm. One exemplary laser is an excimer F2 153 nm laser. According to other embodiments the wavelength of the laser is, for example, longer than 2.5 &#x3bc;m or more preferably longer than 4.5 &#x3bc;m. Some exemplary laser that can be utilized are a 5 &#x3bc;m carbon monoxide laser, or a 10.6 &#x3bc;m CO<sub>2 </sub>laser. A suitable CO<sub>2 </sub>laser for use in carrying out the method of the present invention is, for example, a 10 W CO<sub>2 </sub>laser, model 48-1, available from Synrad Inc., Mukilteo, Wash., USA. The fiber end face <b>112</b> formed by the precision cleaving of fiber <b>110</b> is positioned such that the laser output beam be applied to the end face <b>112</b>, will be positioned at the end of a connector ferrule after the installation and polishing processes are completed. The laser beam heats the end face <b>112</b> of the bare fiber <b>110</b> and causes airlines <b>40</b> therein to collapse, forming a small airline free region throughout the distance (depth) d. A steady-state thermal analysis estimates about 0.044 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>radiant energy loss from the end face of a 125 &#x3bc;m diameter fiber (at 2600&#xb0; C.). Thus, in order to maintain that temperature on the fiber end face, energy balance requires the same amount of energy flux must be supplied by the laser. If the surface area of the exemplary fiber of about 0.012 cm<sup>2</sup>, then 0.0005 W of steady-state laser energy is needed to maintain that temperature on the fiber end face.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">An analysis of the thermal capacitance indicates that about 0.495 mJ are required to raise a 10 &#x3bc;m long section of 125 micron diameter silica fiber to 2600&#xb0; C. A 10 watt laser delivers this amount of energy in about 50 &#x3bc;Sec. The typical rise time for a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser is about 100 &#x3bc;Sec. Thus, in order to provide adequate energy control it is preferable to attenuate or divert some of the energy out of the laser (for example, via beam expansion(s) and/or beam splitter(s)), while increasing the laser pulse duration.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">A proper energy flux on the fiber end face <b>112</b> should be great enough to collapse the airlines but small enough not to cause glass ablation/vaporization. The output energy flux (energy density) on the fiber end surface is typically 0.1 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 20 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 1 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 5 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>(for a single fiber). The laser pulse duration will depend on the desired amount of flux on the end surface of the fiber, and is typically 100 &#x3bc;sec to 200 &#x3bc;sec. Preferably multiple pulses are utilized. Thus, one may need to use beam splitters or other sources of attenuation to reduce the laser beam power presented to the end face of the bare fiber <b>110</b>, in order to allow the use of practical pulse durations (for example, CO<sub>2 </sub>laser implementation, it is preferable to use pulse length of 100 &#x3bc;Sec or more).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Therefore, the amount of flux (energy density) on the end face of fiber can be controlled with a very high amount of precision. The energy from the laser beam penetrates only a small depth into the fiber end face, heating the fiber end face, smoothing out any hackle, if present, and closing holes within a small distance d into the fiber end face.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the beam from a &#x201c;low&#x201d; power CO<sub>2 </sub>laser (in this case a 10 watt CO<sub>2 </sub>operating at &#x3bb;=10.6 um) is pulse width modulated to control average power output. In this example embodiment, the laser is operated with a repetition rate of 5 kHz and varied pulse width. In this exemplary embodiment, the pulse width varied between 100 &#x3bc;Sec and 200 &#x3bc;Sec. The variation in pulse width was used to provide precise control over the pulse energy delivered to the end face <b>112</b> of the bare fiber <b>110</b>. For the case of this embodiment an average pulse width (i.e., pulse duration) of about 200 &#x3bc;Sec was used. Typically the pulse width will be between 100 &#x3bc;Sec and 2000 &#x3bc;Sec, for example between 100 &#x3bc;Sec and 1500 &#x3bc;Sec. The individual pulse energy can be found from the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Pulse energy (J)=(Total Power (watts))*(Pulse Duration (sec))=(10 watts*200&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>sec)=2 milli-Joules<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The energy density is controlled by positioning the end face <b>112</b> of the fiber along the beam's optical axis at the appropriate position relative to the focal position of the lens (i.e., before, at, or behind the focal plane), to control the beam spot size (diameter). Thus, in this exemplary embodiment the pulse energy density is:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Pulse Energy Density (J/&#x3bc;m2)=(Pulse Energy)/(Beam Spot Size)=2 mJ/&#x3c0; (138 &#x3bc;m)<sup>2</sup>=3.34&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>Joules/um<sup>2</sup>.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The energy delivered to the end face is:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Energy/Pulse=(Pulse Energy Density)*(Cross-sectional Area of Fiber End face)=3.34&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>Joules/um<sup>2</sup>*&#x3c0;*(62.5 um)<sup>2</sup>=0.4 milli-Joule.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Typically the energy delivered to an end face <b>112</b> should be between 0.1 and 10 milli-Joules.
</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Thus, by controlling the beam size, number of pulses and pulse duration, the total energy delivered to the fiber end face <b>112</b> may be controlled. This provides a mechanism by which the surface melting of the end face may be precisely controlled, mitigating undesired effects. In this embodiment 23 pulses (about 200 &#x3bc;Sec duration at a repetition rate of 1000/sec) were utilized. Thus, in this example, energy density was reduced to provide easy control of the total energy supplied by using a plurality of pulses. In addition, an aperture may be used to pass only a small portion of the beam to impinge solely on the optical fiber end face (not holder or ferrule material), and/or preferably only on the area containing holes.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The remaining connector parts (e.g., boot <b>210</b>) are then added to or otherwise incorporated with connector housing <b>200</b> to form the connectorized optical fiber assembly <b>250</b> as illustrated in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a close-up cross-sectional view of ferrule end face <b>206</b>, illustrating how airlines <b>40</b> terminate to form airline-free portion <b>130</b> at fiber end face <b>112</b>. Distance d is the length of airline-free portion <b>130</b> as measured from the new (i.e., cleaved) end face <b>112</b> formed when bare fiber <b>110</b> is arranged in ferrule <b>204</b>. The airlines stay present beyond that distance. In an example embodiment, about 0.5 &#x3bc;m&#x2266;d&#x2266;about 10 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates the end face <b>112</b> before the holes are closed, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates the end face <b>112</b>A, after the holes are closed (and thus are not visible). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>9</b>B and <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B demonstrate that there is minimal modification of the surface of the end face <b>112</b> of the fiber after the holes are closed. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> illustrates a surface profile of the end surface <b>112</b> prior to closure of the air holes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a gray scale representation of the topology of this surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates a surface profile of the end surface <b>112</b>A after the air holes are closed, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is a gray scale representation of the topology of this surface. In some embodiments (for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>), the fiber end face <b>112</b>A includes a shallow indentation (ring-shaped dimple) that is less than 1 &#x3bc;m deep, and typically no larger than 0.5 &#x3bc;m, for example, 0.003 &#x3bc;m to 0.3 &#x3bc;m. One exemplary indentation is shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>. (It is noted that a depth d<sub>d </sub>of 0.5 &#x3bc;m is smaller than the size of most dust particles). In some exemplary embodiments the indentation is 3 nm to 50 nm deep. In some exemplary embodiments the d<sub>d </sub>is about 0.03 to 0.04 &#x3bc;m. This dimple corresponds to the location of the previously present air hole containing region. In this embodiment, width w<sub>d </sub>of the dimple is larger than its depth d<sub>d</sub>. For example, the depth of the dimple may be: d<sub>d</sub>&#x2266;0.5 w<sub>d</sub>; d<sub>d</sub>&#x2266;0.25 w<sub>d</sub>; or d<sub>d</sub>&#x2266;0.1 w<sub>d</sub>. Since the depth of the dimple is very shallow and the aspect ratio w<sub>d</sub>/d<sub>d </sub>is relatively large, and the end face <b>112</b>A contains no (or much fewer) air holes, no significant amounts of dust or other contaminants can be imbedded at the end face <b>112</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Thus, a method for closing the holes on the end face of a nano-engineered fiber having includes the step of applying a predetermined amount of energy to the end face of the fiber to cause the holes to close. Preferably, optical irradiation energy from a laser. In some embodiments, the wavelength of the laser is either above or below the transmission band of the optical glass of the fiber (for example, when an IR CO<sub>2 </sub>laser is utilized). In some embodiments, the light absorption mechanism is primarily nonlinear (high peak optical intensity illumination). Nonlinear optical absorption (two photon absorption or plasma generation for example) can be applied within the transmission band of the glass of the optical fiber and in addition can be applied outside of the transmission band. Femtosecond Ti-Sapphire lasers operating in the 800 nm range can transfer energy to silica surfaces through plasma generation. In yet more embodiments multiple lasers with different wavelengths can be used together. An exemplary configuration would be to use a 10.6 &#x3bc;m CO<sub>2 </sub>laser to generally heat the region containing airlines, and the adjacent areas, and then to supply additional energy and heating in a more localized lateral spot with laser that can be focused tighter because it has a shorter wavelength. This small spot could also be scanned. In yet more embodiments, dopants and defects in the glass can cause absorptions of sufficient strength to allow lasers within the transmission window to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Preferably, the energy is delivered to a diameter just large enough to encompass all holes on the end face <b>112</b> of an optical fiber. Even more preferably, the energy is delivered only to the area on the end face <b>112</b> containing holes. For example, when the holes form a ring pattern on the end face of the fiber, this can be achieved by using a ring pattern illumination from a laser. Preferably the holes form a ring pattern on the end face of the fiber. The energy is preferably deposited on the surface of the end face of the fiber with shallow penetration depth (e.g., 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 5 &#x3bc;m)</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Following the cleave step, the new fiber end face <b>112</b> is buffed and polished using standard polishing techniques known in the art so that the new fiber end face <b>112</b> is co-planar with ferrule end face <b>206</b>. Standard polishing techniques will typically create some residual debris in the voids at the fiber end face. This debris is primarily ground up glass from the fiber end face and does not need to be removed as it is melted and incorporated back into the glass in the same step where the voids at the end face <b>112</b> are collapsed by a laser beam. The resulting fiber end face <b>112</b> is protected from external forces and contamination. Any residual water that may have made its way into the voids during a standard polishing process is preferably dried from the volume to be treated, prior to the laser beam sealing of the voids.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">MFD Considerations for Single-Mode (SM) Fiber</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">One important consideration in connectorizing nano-engineered fibers is how the MFD is affected by forming an airline-free portion <b>130</b> using the methods described above. Maintaining the MFD of the nano-engineered fiber is important because mismatches in MFD between fibers cause attenuation when the two fibers are connected, e.g., via fusion splicing or via a fiber optic connector.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Our analysis indicates that either no change, or very small changes &#x394;MFD (often undetectable) of less than 0.5%, often less than 0.2% (for example &#x394;MFD being no more than 0.1%, or no more than 0.05%, or no more than 0.01%) occur in MFD for the optical fiber <b>10</b> when the laser beam is properly applied to the end of the fiber. This very small change can be attributed to small changes in the index of refraction profile of the fiber due to thermal diffusion of one or more dopants in the core region, and also a very short penetration depth (length of fiber) that is heated and collapsed. For example, the penetration depth is &#x3c;10 &#x3bc;m, typically &#x2266;3 &#x3bc;m, such as 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 2 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Fiber Diameter Considerations</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As discussed above, nano-engineered fibers <b>10</b>, to which the methods of the present invention apply, have a relatively low air-fill percent of less than 1% and is usually about 0.02% to about 0.2%, in contrast to photonic crystal fibers, which have an air-fill percent of 5% to 20%, i.e., at least five times greater, and usually about two orders of magnitude greater. Thus, it is the small air-fill percent of the nano-engineered fibers considered herein that allows the fibers to retain their circularity and nominally their original size when the airlines are collapsed. This allows the processed fibers to remain compliant with the ITU-T G.652 standard wherein the (bare) fiber has a diameter D<sub>10</sub>=125 &#x3bc;m&#xb1;1 micron for proper connectorization.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In contrast, a photonic crystal fiber, after collapsing the air holes therein, has a diameter change far greater than &#xb1;1 micron, and thus is not ITU-T G.652 compliant for connectorization. Assuming that the relative air-fill percents correspond to the amount of fiber diameter change, then a photonic crystal fiber undergoes a diameter change of at least about 5&#xd7; that of a nano-engineered fiber, and more typically about 100&#xd7;. Thus, an overall change in D<sub>10 </sub>for a 125 &#x3bc;m fiber of less than 0.6 &#x3bc;m, which would be acceptable for connectorizing a nano-engineered fiber <b>10</b>, would translate into a change of at least 2.5 &#x3bc;m and more typically a change of about 5 to 50 &#x3bc;m when the method is applied to a photonic crystal fiber&#x2014;a change that would be deemed unacceptable for the connectorization contemplated by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The methods of the present invention are able to collapse airlines <b>40</b> in nano-engineered fiber <b>10</b> while retaining substantially the same cross-sectional diameter D<sub>10 </sub>and circularity, making the fibers and methods advantageous for mounting the processed nano-engineered fiber within a ferrule in the course of forming a connectorized fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In an example embodiment, the change &#x394;D<sub>10 </sub>in the diameter D<sub>10 </sub>of fiber <b>10</b> at airline-free region <b>130</b> as compared to the other non-processed (i.e., airline-inclusive) regions of the fiber is less than or equal to 1% (0.125 &#x3bc;m), more preferable less than or equal to 0.50% (0.625 &#x3bc;m), even more preferably less than or equal to 0.24% (0.30 &#x3bc;m), and even more preferably less than or equal to 0.08% (0.10 &#x3bc;m). The numbers in parenthesis are the actual values for a 125 &#x3bc;m diameter fiber. (Please note that 1% change in the fiber diameter would correspond to the airline volume fraction equal to 1%, where the entire cross section of the fiber contained airlines, and where the all of airlines were completely closed.)</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
