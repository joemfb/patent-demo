The third table is created based on: a CMYK value determined by C, M and Y values and a K value found from the C, M and Y values, the CMYK value having a proportion of the K value to the CMYK value larger than the proportion used when a second table is created; and a relationship between the CMYK value and the output color value for the CMYK value. This relationship is obtained based on a relationship between an input CMYK value and the output color value of the first table.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a color adjustment method, a color adjustment apparatus and a recording medium storing a program.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, output colors of a color printer are adjusted to desirable colors by a color management system using device profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This type of color management system uses a source profile and a destination profile to convert colors. The source profile is for converting values (e.g. RGB values or CMYK values) in a device-dependent color space such as the RGB color system or the CMYK color system into values (e.g. L*a*b* values or XYZ values) in a device-independent color space such as the L*a*b* color system or the XYZ color system. The destination profile is for converting color space data into CMYK values for a color printer which performs outputting.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2009-17089 describes a color management system which creates a correction profile based on a standard profile to save color material such as ink or toners used in a color printer so as to reduce running costs of the color management system. The correction profile is a profile to replace more CMY (cyan, magenta and yellow) with K (black) while maintaining degree of color matching.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the color management system described by Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2009-17089 obtains the correction profile by carrying out logic to increase a K value to reduce C, M and Y values for each LUT input point of a second table included in the standard profile, the second table being for converting L*a*b* data into CMYK data. Hence, with the color management system, although color reproducibility with high accuracy can be obtained while color material is saved, considerable time is required for arithmetic. When an output state of the color printer which performs outputting is changed due to its environment or aging, and the standard profile is re-created to perform calibration, it is necessary to create a new correction profile. That is, as described above, in order to maintain color reproducibility with high accuracy, considerable amount of time is required for arithmetic, and processing load is substantially high.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is made in view of the circumstances. Objects of the present invention are to provide a color adjustment method, a color adjustment apparatus and a recording medium storing a program for color adjustment, which prevent processing load from increasing, save color material, and maintain color reproducibility with high accuracy.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the following, a color adjustment system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following, components having the same function and/or configuration are denoted by the same reference numeral, and description thereof is omitted when available.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An aggregate of all devices of the embodiment of the present invention is referred to as a color adjustment system. However, it is needless to say that one, some or all of the devices constituting the color adjustment system can be referred to as a color adjustment apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a color adjustment system <b>1000</b> in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention. The color adjustment system <b>1000</b> includes a color printer <b>1</b>, a controller <b>2</b>, a measuring device <b>3</b> and a client PC (Personal Computer) <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The color adjustment system <b>1000</b> adjusts colors of image data outputted from a device (target device) which is a target for color adjustment, and reproduces the colors of the image data with the color printer <b>1</b> (destination device). In the following, the target device is a color monitor which outputs RGB image data.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The color printer <b>1</b> outputs CMYK images made of CMY (cyan, magenta and yellow) having hues different from each other, three primary colors, and K (black). The color printer <b>1</b> is connected to the controller <b>2</b> via an interface for communications.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The controller <b>2</b> is a PC or the like. The controller <b>2</b> obtains print jobs from another computer to which the controller <b>2</b> is connected via a network. The controller <b>2</b> performs the raster image processing on the obtained print jobs to generate image data of raster images.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the controller <b>2</b> stores a device link profile transmitted from the client PC <b>10</b> in a storage device such as an HDD (Hard Disk Drive). The controller <b>2</b> performs color conversion processing on the generated image data, using the device link profile. The controller <b>2</b> transmits the image data undergoing the color conversion processing to the color printer <b>1</b> so as to output images of the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The device link profile is a profile in which a device profile of the color monitor and a device profile of the color printer <b>1</b> are combined. More specifically, the device link profile makes RGB values of the color monitor and CMYK values of the color printer <b>1</b> correlated with each other without a device-independent color space. Accordingly, the controller <b>2</b> can directly convert RGB image data outputted by the color monitor into CMYK image data, using the device link profile.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, in the embodiment, in order to reduce consumption of color material (toners) of the color printer <b>1</b>, as described below, the controller <b>2</b> stores color adjustment tables transmitted from the client PC <b>10</b> in the storage device such as an HDD. Then, the controller <b>2</b> performs, based on the color adjustment tables, color adjustment on the CMYK image data converted with the device link profile.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The measuring device <b>3</b> measures a color chart outputted from the color printer <b>1</b> and color chips of spot colors. More specifically, the measuring device <b>3</b> measures, by spectrometry, colors of color patches included in the color chart and color chips of spot colors. Then, the measuring device <b>3</b> transmits measurement values of the measured colors to the client PC <b>10</b>. The measurement values obtained by the measuring device <b>3</b> are, for example, values of spectral reflectance, or XYZ values, L*a*b* values or the like of a device-independent color system defined by International Commission on Illumination (CIE). The spot colors are colors not made by CMYK color material. The spot colors are colors unable to be represented by CMYK (CMYK non-representable colors) or colors made by mixing the CMYK non-representable colors with CMYK color material. The spot colors are specific colors of ink used in offset printing, and sometimes included in image data for offset printing. The color printer <b>1</b> cannot output the spot colors as they are. Hence, it is necessary to measure the spot colors with the measuring device <b>3</b>, and convert values of the spot colors into CMYK values as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The measuring device <b>3</b> is connected to the client PC <b>10</b> via an interface for communications.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the measurement values obtained by the measuring device <b>3</b> are values of the spectral reflectance or XYZ values, the client PC <b>10</b> may convert the measurement values into L*a*b* values or values in CIECAM02.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Next, using the above interpolation formulas, the CPU <b>11</b> repeats the interpolation processing in the order indicated by the numbers I to III shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, on each interpolation point included in the C&#xd7;M&#xd7;Y:9&#xd7;9&#xd7;9 points.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, the CPU <b>11</b> can create the first LUT <b>100</b>.

That is, the nine values of each of C, M, Y and K are not the values obtained by dividing the maximum value, 100%, into eight values equally.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Hence, the CPU <b>11</b> converts the values of each of C, M, Y and K into eight equally divided values of 100%, using one-dimensional LUTs <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Then, the CPU <b>11</b> performs processing to input the converted CMYK values into the first LUT <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The second LUT <b>200</b> converts L*a*b* values into CMYK values. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the second LUT <b>200</b> is a three-dimensional input/four-dimensional output LUT to put CMYK values to L*&#xd7;a*&#xd7;b*:33&#xd7;33&#xd7;33=35937 LUT input points. The LUT input points are L*a*b* values. In the embodiment, one second LUT <b>200</b> is described. However, a plurality of second LUTs <b>200</b> may be prepared to correspond to a plurality of kinds of object information such as texts, graphics and images in PDL (Page Description Language) included in print jobs transmitted from the client PC <b>10</b> or the like, or a plurality of kinds of color matching methods such as colorimetric color matching, perceptual color matching and saturation color matching.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the following, a procedure of, creating the second LUT <b>200</b> is described. For making the explanation simple, the procedure is described by using two primary colors C and M. Note that the values of each of C, M, Y and K are between 0% and 100%.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">First, the CPU <b>11</b> converts four-dimensional data into three-dimensional data. The four-dimensional data is L*a*b* values for the C&#xd7;M&#xd7;Y&#xd7;K:9&#xd7;9&#xd7;9&#xd7;9 points in the first LUT <b>100</b> created as described above. The three-dimensional data is L*a*b* values for C&#xd7;M&#xd7;Y:9&#xd7;9&#xd7;9 points. For that, the method described in Japanese Patent No. 2898030 can be used, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, first, the maximum value of each of C, M and Y is divided into eight equally divided values to create an LUT-A having C&#xd7;M&#xd7;Y:9&#xd7;9&#xd7;9 LUT input points. The number of LUT input points of the LUT-A can be changed optionally. Next, a CMYK value, the K value of which is added to enhance a grey component, is inputted into each LUT input point of the LUT-A. The K value for enhancing a grey component is calculated based on the minimum value among the C, M and Y values by using a K curve K<b>0</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. That is, the K curve K<b>0</b> (K<sub>0</sub>) can be expressed by the following seventh formula.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>K</i><sub>0</sub>=2.0(min[<i>C,M,Y]&#x2212;</i>50(%))&#x2003;&#x2003;[Seventh Formula]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Note that when K<sub>0</sub>&#x3c;0, K<sub>0</sub>=0(%).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The K curve K<b>0</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a straight line from the beginning to the end. However, the K curve K<b>0</b> may be curved near the starting point or may be curved as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A K value obtained as described above is inputted into an LUT input point with C, M and Y values, with respect to each of the LUT input points. For example, a CMYK value inputted into an LUT input point (C:62.5%, M:75%, Y:87.5%) is described. Because the minimum value among the C, M and Y values (the C value, the M value and the Y value) is 62.5%, the K value is calculated as K:25%. By adding the K value to the C, M and Y values, the CMYK value inputted into the LUT input point is C:62.5%, M:75%, Y:87.5% and K:25%. With respect to each of the other LUT input points, a CMYK value is calculated as described above, and inputted into its LUT input point.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The K curve used for calculating a K value is not limited to the above-described K curve K<b>0</b>. Furthermore, CMYK values inputted into the LUT input points may be set to reduce the total amount of CMYK color material as described below. In the embodiment, information on the used K curve (K curve information) and information on a limit amount of color material (color material limit amount information) are stored, for example, with the second LUT <b>200</b>. The reason why the information is stored is, when CMYK values are calculated to create a color adjustment table described below, to make a K-CMYK proportion of a K value to a CMYK value (first K-CMYK proportion) larger than a K-CMYK proportion of a K value to a CMYK value (second K-CMYK proportion) calculated by the above-described way. That is, the reason is, when a color adjustment table is created, to use a K curve and/or a limit amount used for decreasing the total amount of CMYK color material, the K curve and/or the limit amount which make the first K-CMYK proportion more than the second K-CMYK used when the second LUT <b>200</b> is created. In the embodiment, the K curve used when the second LUT <b>200</b> is created is the K curve K<b>0</b>, and the limit amount of color material used at the time is 400%.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Next, similarly, the maximum value of each of C, M and Y is divided into eight equally divided values to create an LUT-B having C&#xd7;M&#xd7;Y:9&#xd7;9&#xd7;9 LUT input points. The LUT input points of the LUT-B respectively correspond to the LUT input points of the LUT-A. Then, L*a*b* values for the CMYK values inputted into the LUT input points of the LUT-A are found by interpolation processing, using the first LUT <b>100</b>, and inputted into their corresponding LUT input points of the LUT-B.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As described above, by finding the CMYK values and the L*a*b* values for the C&#xd7;M&#xd7;Y:9&#xd7;9&#xd7;9=729 points, the three-dimensional data of the C&#xd7;M&#xd7;Y:9&#xd7;9&#xd7;9 points can be created from the four-dimensional data of the C&#xd7;M&#xd7;Y&#xd7;K:9&#xd7;9&#xd7;9&#xd7;9 points.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Next, the CPU <b>11</b> derives CMYK values for the L*&#xd7;a*&#xd7;b*:33&#xd7;33&#xd7;33 LUT input points, using the created LUT-A and LUT-B.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">First, a procedure of deriving CMYK values are described with respect to the points having L*a*b* values as the measurement values (namely, the points inside the color gamut of the color printer <b>1</b>) among the L*&#xd7;a*&#xd7;b*:33&#xd7;33&#xd7;33 points. The color gamut is a range of colors producible or reproducible with a device which outputs images of image data, such as the color printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Conversion arithmetic processing used for the derivation is described in detail, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2003-78773. Hence, in the present application, the procedure of the derivation is described in summary.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a coordinate system in which lightness L* is plotted as ordinates and a* is plotted as abscissae for two-dimensional CM values of C&#xd7;M:9&#xd7;9 (Y=0%) points among three-dimensional CMY values.

The CPU <b>11</b> performs the derivation processing to derive three-dimensional CMY values in practice. However, for making the explanation simple, the derivation processing to derive two-dimensional CM values is described.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a target value T&#x2032; is an L*a*b* value of a target point for which a two-dimensional CM value is to be found, among the L*&#xd7;a*&#xd7;b*:33&#xd7;33&#xd7;33 points. Suppose that the target value T&#x2032; exists in a region V<b>0</b>&#x2032; enclosed by lattice points a&#x2032; to d&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this case, the CPU <b>11</b> estimates that a target value T, which is a combination of a C value and an M value in a CM coordinate system, exists in a region V<b>0</b> enclosed by lattice points a to d shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> respectively correspond to the lightness apexes H<b>1</b>&#x2032; and H<b>2</b>&#x2032;, W therein corresponds to the white apex W&#x2032;, and B therein corresponds to the blue apex B&#x2032;.</p>

The CPU <b>11</b> calculates values of the division points e to i by a weighted mean, using lattice points, the values of which are already found, around the division points e to i. Then, the CPU <b>11</b> plots the L*a*b* values for the division points e to i in the a*L* coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Division points e&#x2032; to i&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> are plotted points respectively corresponding to the division points e to i shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>

For example, when the target value T&#x2032; exists in the region V<b>2</b>&#x2032; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the CPU <b>11</b> estimates that the target value T exists in the region V<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the region V<b>2</b> corresponding to the region V<b>2</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, the CPU <b>11</b> divides the estimated region V<b>2</b> into regions V<b>5</b> to V<b>8</b>, and estimates in which of the divided regions V<b>5</b> to V<b>8</b>, the target value T exists.

Then, the CPU <b>11</b> can find the target value T (a combination of a C value and an M value) from the average value of four lattice points or division points which form the converged region. In practice, the CPU <b>11</b> calculates target values T (each of which is a combination of a C value, an M value and a Y value) of target points so as to derive three-dimensional CMY values, respectively. That is, the CMY values are found by back-calculation from the LUT-B created as described above. The LUT-B corresponds to the LUT-A created as described above. Accordingly, CMYK values can be found by interpolation processing from the calculated CMY values. The reason why the CPU <b>11</b> performs the above-described convergence arithmetic processing is, because, although conversion from the coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to the coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is well known, the opposite conversion is very complicated, and a proper conversion formula therefor is still unknown.</p>

On the other hand, when judging that the color adjustment table to be created is the 5% saving table (Step S<b>102</b>; YES), the CPU <b>11</b> skips Step S<b>103</b>, and moves to Step S<b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">At Step S<b>104</b>, the CPU <b>11</b> creates an LUT-D (Step S<b>104</b>). More specifically, the CPU <b>11</b> creates the LUT-D in the same way as the LUT-B is created. The LUT input points of the LUT-D respectively correspond to those of the LUT-C. The CPU <b>11</b> finds L*a*b* values for the CMYK values inputted into the LUT input points of the LUT-C by interpolation arithmetic, using the first LUT <b>100</b>, and inputs the found L*a*b* values into the LUT input points of the LUT-D corresponding to the LUT input points of the LUT-C, so as to create the LUT-D.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Next, the CPU <b>11</b> creates the third LUT <b>300</b>, using the LUT-C and the LUT-D created as described above (Step S<b>105</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, like the second LUT <b>200</b>, the third LUT <b>300</b> is a three-dimensional input/four-dimensional output LUT to put CMYK values to the L*a*b* values of L*&#xd7;a*&#xd7;b*:33&#xd7;33&#xd7;33 LUT input points. The CPU <b>11</b> creates the third LUT <b>300</b> in the same way as the second LUT <b>200</b> is created, and stores the third LUT <b>300</b> in the storage section <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The CPU <b>11</b> reads the first LUT <b>100</b> and the third LUT <b>300</b> created as described above and stored in the storage section <b>16</b> (Step S<b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Then, the CPU <b>11</b> creates the color adjustment table, using the read first LUT <b>100</b> and third LUT <b>300</b> (Step S<b>107</b>), and then ends the color adjustment table creation processing. More specifically, first, the CPU <b>11</b> obtains CMYK values as output values by interpolation arithmetic, making L*a*b* values for the CMYK values of the lattice points of the first LUT <b>100</b> as input values of the third LUT <b>300</b>. In the embodiment, these output values are referred to as adjusted CMYK values. Then, the CPU <b>11</b> creates the color adjustment table constituted of the &#x201c;CMYK-CMYK LUT&#x201d; in which the CMYK values of the lattice points of the first LUT <b>100</b> are LUT input points, and the adjusted CMYK values obtained as described above are output values.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Next, the total amount limit setting processing performed at Step S<b>103</b> of the color adjustment table creation processing is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">First, the CPU <b>11</b> judges whether or not, among the LUT input points of the created LUT-C, there is an LUT input point as a conversion point (Step S<b>201</b>). More specifically, the CPU <b>11</b> searches for an LUT input point, the C, M, Y and K values (i.e. the CMYK value) of which are 220% to 400% in total, and the C, M and Y values (i.e. the CMY value) of which are not converted yet, as a conversion point. The total value of the C, M, Y and K values of an LUT input point thereof can be optionally set.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">When judging that there is an LUT input point as a conversion point (Step S<b>201</b>; YES), the CPU <b>11</b> reads the C, M, Y and K values (the CMYK value) described in the LUT input point (Step S<b>202</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Then, the CPU <b>11</b> converts the read C, M, Y and K values in such a way that the total value of the read C, M, Y and K values becomes a predetermined maximum value (the limit amount, an upper limit value) or less (Step S<b>203</b>). That is, the CPU <b>11</b> converts the total value being 220% to 400% into a total value being 220% to the maximum value, using a predetermined one-dimensional LUT. The maximum value is determined based on the K curve information and the color material limit amount information held with the second LUT <b>200</b> as described above. In the embodiment, the K curve used when the second LUT <b>200</b> is created is the K curve K<b>0</b>, and the limit amount of color material used at the time is 400%. Hence, for example, when the 10% saving table is created, the maximum value is 330%, and when the 20% saving table is created, the maximum value is 270%.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Then, the CPU <b>11</b> subtracts the K value, which is the K value before the conversion, from the total value of the C, M, Y and K values converted at Step S<b>203</b>, so as to calculate the total value of the converted C, M and Y values (a post-conversion CMY total value) (Step S<b>204</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Then, the CPU <b>11</b> divides the post-conversion CMY total value calculated at Step S<b>204</b> by the total value of the C, M and Y values, which are the C, M and Y values before the conversion (a pre-conversion CMY total value), so as to calculate a subtraction coefficient (Step S<b>205</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Then, the CPU <b>11</b> multiplies each of the C, M and Y values of the LUT input point read at Step S<b>202</b> by the subtraction coefficient calculated at Step S<b>205</b>, so as to calculate C, M and Y values (a post-conversion CMY value) which are the C, M and Y values after the conversion, and also adds the K value before the conversion to the post-conversion CMY value, so as to find a post-conversion CMYK value (Step S<b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">More specifically, for example, when the 20% saving table is created, if C, M, Y and K values are respectively 100%, 100%, 75% and 25%, the total value of the C, M, Y and K values is 300%. When the total value of the C, M, Y and K values after conversion using a one-dimensional LUT is 250%, the post-conversion CMY total value is 250%&#x2212;25%=225%. Since the pre-conversion CMY total value is 275%, the subtraction coefficient is 225/275=0.818. By multiplying each of the C, M and Y values before the conversion by the subtraction coefficient, it is found that C value=81.8%, M value=81.8% and Y value=61.4% (a post-conversion CMY value). The K value before the conversion is not multiplied by the subtraction coefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">When the post-conversion CMYK value is calculated as described above, the CPU <b>11</b> replaces the CMYK value of the LUT input point read at Step S<b>202</b> with the post-conversion CMYK value (Step S<b>207</b>), and moves to Step S<b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The CPU <b>11</b> repeats Steps S<b>201</b> to S<b>207</b> until no LUT input point as a conversion point exists so that the LUT-C which limits the total amount of color material is created.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">When judging that no LUT input point as a conversion point exists (Step S<b>201</b>; NO), the CPU <b>11</b> ends the total amount limit setting processing.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As described above, the CPU <b>11</b> creates the third LUT <b>300</b> using the LUT-C, on which the above-described total amount limit setting processing is performed to limit the total amount of color material, and the LUT-D. Hence, the total value of a CMYK value does not exceed the maximum value. As a result, for example, when the 20% saving table is created, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the lower edge of the color gamut shown by a solid line is moved up to the position shown by a broken line, so that the color gamut becomes narrow such that a part having low lightness is up. In the embodiment, the total value of the CMYK value of each LUT input point of the LUT-C is limited to 270% or less, or 330% or less. However, the limit value to which the total value thereof is limited can be optionally set. Furthermore, the third LUT <b>300</b> which limits the total amount of color material is created based on the LUT-C in which the total value of the CMYK value of each LUT input point is limited to the maximum value or less. Accordingly, each CMYK value obtained by the third LUT <b>300</b> can be lower with the balance of the C, M, Y and K values being maintained. Also, even when an L*a*b* value of a point which is not an LUT input point of the third LUT <b>300</b> is inputted, a CMYK value for the L*a*b* value of the point is obtained by interpolation arithmetic from the CMYK values described in the LUT input points, the total value of each CMYK value being limited to the maximum value or less. Consequently, with respect to a color in the vicinity of an LUT input point too, the total value of the CMYK value does not exceed the limit value, and the color is not suddenly blocked up because of the limit value. Accordingly, change of colors between an LUT input point and a point in the vicinity of the LUT input point can be made continuously. Furthermore, when the LUT-D is created, the total value of the CMYK value of each LUT input point is limited to the above-described maximum value. Consequently, the LUT-D is a LUT into which L*a*b* values are inputted with the total amount of color material limited, especially around the point where all of the C, M and Y values (i.e. the CMY value) are 100% (i.e. black). Furthermore, by making the decreasing amount of color material more than that used when the second LUT <b>200</b> is created, namely, by using a limit amount (maximum amount) of color material lower than that used when the second LUT <b>200</b> is created, when the third LUT <b>300</b> is created, the proportion of a K value to a CMYK value (K-CMYK proportion) can be more than that used when the second LUT <b>200</b> is created.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The color conversion processing performed after the color adjustment tables are created as described above is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The color conversion processing is performed, for example, by a CPU or the like of the controller <b>2</b>. The color conversion processing is processing to perform color conversion to convert inputted CMYK image data or RGB image data into CMYK image data for the color printer <b>1</b> to output images of the image data, and also to perform color adjustment to save color material. The various tables such as the profiles used in the color conversion processing are transmitted from the client PC <b>10</b>, and held in the storage device of the controller <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">First, the controller <b>2</b> judges whether or not a color of image data (color data) inputted from the client PC <b>10</b> or the like shows a spot color (Step S<b>301</b>). When judging that the inputted color data shows a spot color (Step S<b>301</b>; YES), the controller <b>2</b> converts the L*a*b* value identified from the color data showing the spot color into a CMYK value by interpolation arithmetic, using the second LUT <b>200</b> (Step S<b>302</b>). This CMYK value is represented by C<sub>1</sub>M<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>K<sub>1</sub>. On the other hand, when judging that the inputted color data does not show a spot color, namely, judging that the inputted color data is RGB data (Step S<b>301</b>; NO), the controller <b>2</b> converts the inputted RGB value into a CMYK value by interpolation arithmetic, using the normal mode device link profile (Step S<b>303</b>). This CMYK value is represented by C<sub>1</sub>M<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>K<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Then, the controller <b>2</b> judges whether or not a saving mode in which color material is saved is set (Step S<b>304</b>). The saving mode is, for example, preset by a user.

When not judging that all of C<sub>1</sub>M<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>K<sub>1 </sub>are 0% (Step S<b>305</b>; NO), the controller <b>2</b> judges whether or not the color is a single color of one of CMYK (Step S<b>306</b>). That is, the controller <b>2</b> judges whether or not the color is a single color based on whether or not only one of C<sub>1</sub>M<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>K<sub>1 </sub>is not 0%. When not judging that the color is a single color of one of CMYK (Step S<b>306</b>; NO), the controller <b>2</b> judges whether or not the color is a secondary color of RGB (Step S<b>307</b>). That is, the controller <b>2</b> judges whether or not the color is constituted of two of RGB. When not judging that the color is a secondary color of RGB (Step S<b>307</b>; NO), the controller <b>2</b> judges whether or not K<sub>1 </sub>of C<sub>1</sub>M<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>K<sub>1 </sub>is 0%, and the minimum value among C<sub>1</sub>M<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1 </sub>is a predetermined threshold value (th<b>0</b>) or less (Step S<b>308</b>). The threshold value can be appropriately set in accordance with the performance or states of the color printer <b>1</b>. When not judging that K<sub>1 </sub>of C<sub>1</sub>M<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>K<sub>1 </sub>is 0%, and the minimum value among C<sub>1</sub>M<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1 </sub>is the predetermined threshold value or less (Step S<b>308</b>; NO), the controller <b>2</b> moves to Step S<b>309</b>.

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In the following, examples are given to describe the present invention more specifically. However, it is needless to say that the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">FIRST EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In accordance with the following method, test images of a first example and a first comparative example were outputted, and the saving amount of color material was evaluated. In the following examples, for the test images, an image of N3A (fruit basket) was used among the &#x201c;JIS X 9201-2001 (ISO 12640-1997) CMYK standard color image data (CMYK/SCID)&#x201d;. Based on a profile corresponding to the test images and a device profile in the sRGB format, CMYK image data of the test images was converted into RGB image data, and the RGB values of the RGB image data were inputted so as to output the test images. In the first example, the color printer <b>1</b> of the color adjustment system <b>1000</b> in the embodiment outputted the test image of a CMYK color image in the 20% saving mode, and also outputted, using K toners, the test image constituted of only the C component, the test image constituted of only the M component, the test image constituted of only the Y component and the test image constituted of only the K component. In the first comparative example, the color printer <b>1</b> thereof outputted the test image of a CMYK color image in the normal mode in which color material is not saved, and also outputted, using K toners, the test image constituted of only the C component, the test image constituted of only the M component, the test image constituted of only the Y component and the test image constituted of only the K component.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">[Result]</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">When the test image of the CMYK color image of the first example and the test image of the CMYK color image of the first comparative example were observed with eyes, it was found that there was almost no difference, so that high reproducibility was able to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">When the test image constituted of only the C component, the test image constituted of only the M component and the test image constituted of only the Y component of the first example, and the test image constituted of only the C component, the test image constituted of only the M component and the test image constituted of only the Y component of the first comparative example were observed with eyes, the color material of each of the C, M and Y components of the first example were less than that of the first comparative example. Consequently, the test images of the first example were lighter. In addition, it was found that the concentration of each of the C, M and Y components, in particular, at a shadow part of each of the test images of the first example was lower than that of the first comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">On the other hand, when the test image constituted of only the K component of the first example and the test image constituted of only the K component of the first comparative example were observed with eyes, it was found that the color material of the K component of the first example was more than that of the first comparative example, and consequently, the test image constituted of the K component of the first example was darker as a whole than that of the first comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Furthermore, the used amount of CMYK toners used in outputting the test images was evaluated. As a result, it was found that by taking the used amount of CMYK toners in the first comparative example as 100%, the used amount thereof in the first example was 75%. Therefore, the toners were saved by 25% in the first example.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">SECOND EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In accordance with the following method, test images of a second example and a second comparative example were outputted, and color change was evaluated. In the following examples, for the test images, a color chart image of the &#x201c;ISO 12642&#x201d; was used. In the second example, the color printer <b>1</b> of the color adjustment system <b>1000</b> in the embodiment outputted the test image of the CMYK color chart image in the 20% saving mode, and measured predetermined <b>809</b> color patches with L*a*b* values. In the second comparative example, the color printer <b>1</b> thereof outputted the test image of the CMYK color chart image in the normal mode, and measured the predetermined <b>809</b> color patches with L*a*b* values. Then, color differences between the second example and the second comparative example were found for the color patches, and the average color difference and the maximum color difference were found.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">[Result]</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">As a result, the average color difference between the second example and the second comparative example was 2.5, and the maximum color difference therebetween was 17.3. Because the total amount of C, M, Y and K components was limited, the maximum color difference was large. However, the average color difference was small. That is, it was found that color reproducibility with high accuracy was able to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">As described above, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the storage section <b>16</b> stores: the output device profile including the first LUT <b>100</b> and the second LUT <b>200</b>; the color conversion table (the normal mode device link profile, the second LUT <b>200</b>); and the color adjustment table. The first LUT <b>100</b> is for converting an input CMYK value of the color printer <b>1</b> into an output L*a*b* value indicating the coordinates on a device-independent color space. The second LUT <b>200</b> is for converting the output L*a*b* value into an output CMYK value. The second LUT <b>200</b> is created based on a CMYK value determined by arbitrary C, M and Y values and a K value found from the arbitrary C, M and Y values and based on a first relationship between the determined CMYK values and the output L*a*b* value corresponding to the determined CMYK value. This first relationship is obtained based on a second relationship between the input CMYK value of the first LUT <b>100</b> and the output L*a*b* value thereof. The color conversion table is for converting the input image data into the output CMYK value, and created based on the output device profile. The color adjustment table is for converting the output CMYK value into the adjusted CMYK value, and created based on the first LUT <b>100</b> and the third LUT <b>300</b>. The third LUT <b>300</b> is for converting the output L*a*b* value into the adjusted CMYK value. The third LUT <b>300</b> is created based on a CMYK value determined by arbitrary C, M and Y values and a K value found from the arbitrary C, M and Y values, and having a proportion of the K value to the CMYK value (first K-CMYK proportion) more than a K-CMYK proportion of the K value to the determined CMYK value (second K-CMYK proportion) used when the second LUT <b>200</b> is created, and based on the first relationship between the determined CMYK value and the output L*a*b* value corresponding to the determined CMYK value. This first relationship is obtained based on the second relationship between the input CMYK value of the first LUT <b>100</b> and the output L*a*b* value thereof. The controller <b>2</b> obtains the output CMYK value from the input image data, using the color conversion table. The controller <b>2</b> obtains the adjusted CMYK value from the output CMYK value, using the color adjustment table. The controller <b>2</b> selects a CMYK value (image-output CMYK value) for the color printer <b>1</b> to output an image, from among the output CMYK value and the adjusted CMYK value. In the embodiment, the processing to save color material is performed based on the CMYK value obtained using the color conversion table. Accordingly, the CMYK value (image-output CMYK value) based on which the color printer <b>1</b> outputs an image can be easily changed between when color material is saved and when color material is not saved. Furthermore, even when the output device profile (standard profile) is re-created because of aging of output colors of the color printer <b>1</b> or the like, it is not necessary to create a new color adjustment table. Accordingly, while color material can be saved with color reproducibility with high accuracy being maintained, increase of processing load can be suppressed. Furthermore, the third LUT <b>300</b> can be created by the same arithmetic as that used when the second LUT <b>200</b> is created. Accordingly, time required for creating the color adjustment table can be reduced, and the processing load can also be reduced. Furthermore, the color adjustment is performed on output CMYK values with the color adjustment table. Accordingly, with respect to the output device profile, even if feedback adjustment is performed to appropriately reproduce output CMYK values (colors), or fine adjustment is performed on an output result of the color printer <b>1</b>, color reproducibility is not badly influenced therefrom, and the adjustment result can be reflected on the output device profile. Accordingly, the present invention offers high convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">According to the embodiment, the third LUT <b>300</b> is created based on: the determined CMYK value which is set such that a total of the C, M, Y and K values of the determined CMYK value does not exceed a predetermined upper limit value; and the first relationship between the determined CMYK value and the output L*a*b* value corresponding to the determined CMYK value. Consequently, the C, M, Y and K values are determined to output an image. Accordingly, it becomes easy to manage the saving amount of color material.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">According to the embodiment, the third LUT <b>300</b> is created based on: a reduced CMYK value as the determined CMYK value, the reduced CMYK value being found such that the total of the C, M, Y and K values is converted into a target value being the upper limit value or less, a reduction rate is calculated from a total of the C, M and Y values of the determined CMYK value and a total of C, M and Y values found by subtracting the K value of the determined CMYK value from the target value, and the reduction rate is applied to the C, M and Y values of the determined CMYK value; and the first relationship between the reduced CMYK value as the determined CMYK value and the output L*a*b* value corresponding to the reduced CMYK value. Accordingly, an image, the colors of which are reproduced with high accuracy, can be outputted with the C, M, Y and K values limited.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">According to the embodiment, the color adjustment table includes a plurality of color adjustment tables respectively created based on the third LUT <b>300</b> with different second K-CMYK proportions of the determined CMYK value based on which the third LUT <b>300</b> is created.

Then, the controller <b>2</b> employs a color adjustment table among the color adjustment tables in accordance with the set saving amount so as to obtain the adjusted CMYK value from the output CMYK value.

<p id="p-0169" num="0168">According to the embodiment, the CPU <b>11</b> creates the output device profile, the color conversion table and the color adjustment table.

The CPU <b>11</b> creates the third LUT <b>300</b> to create the color adjustment table. The CPU <b>11</b> determines the K-CMYK proportion based on the held K curve information and/or color material limit amount information when determining the CMYK value by the arbitrary C, M and Y values and the K value found from the arbitrary C, M and Y values, so as to create the third LUT <b>300</b>.

By using the CMYK value obtained with the color conversion table as it is for a color which does not undergo the processing to save color material, processing can be omitted, and the fear of a calculation error which could be made in performing the processing to save color material is eliminated.

<p id="p-0171" num="0170">According to the embodiment, when the K value of the obtained output CMYK value is 0, and a minimum value among the C, M and Y values of the output CMYK value is a predetermined value or less, the controller <b>2</b> selects the output CMYK value as the image-output CMYK value for the color printer <b>1</b> to output an image.

<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The color adjustment system of the present invention is not limited to the embodiment and examples described above. The detailed configurations and operations of the functional sections and the like of the color adjustment system can be appropriately modified.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Furthermore, in the embodiment, the color adjustment processing to save color material is performed by using the color adjustment table after the color conversion processing based on the source profile and the destination profile is performed. However, for example, it is possible to create a saving mode device link profile in which RGB/CMYK values of the LUT input points of the source profile are correlated with adjusted CMYK values obtained by the color adjustment processing, and to perform the color conversion processing based on the saving mode device link profile. Now, saving mode device link profile creation processing is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> as an example of processing to create the saving mode device link profile. The saving mode device link profile creation processing is performed, for example, by the CPU <b>11</b> of the client PC <b>10</b>. In the following description of the saving mode device link profile creation processing, the contents of the processing overlapping with those of the color conversion processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> are only described in summary, and details thereof are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">First, the CPU <b>11</b> selects a saving mode (Step S<b>501</b>). More specifically, the CPU <b>11</b> selects the saving mode set by the saving mode selection processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Next, the CPU <b>11</b> reads the normal mode device link profile stored in the storage section <b>16</b>, and reads an output CMYK value for an input RGB value of one LUT input point from the normal mode device link profile (Step S<b>502</b>). This value is represented by C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>K<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Then, the CPU <b>11</b> judges whether or not all of C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>K<sub>3 </sub>are 0% (Step S<b>503</b>). When not judging that all of C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>K<sub>3 </sub>are 0% (Step S<b>503</b>; NO), the CPU <b>11</b> judges whether or not the color is a single color of one of CMYK (Step S<b>504</b>). When not judging that the color is a single color of one of CMYK (Step S<b>504</b>; NO), the CPU <b>11</b> judges whether or not the color is a secondary color of RGB (Step S<b>505</b>). When not judging that the color is a secondary color of RGB (Step S<b>505</b>; NO), the CPU <b>11</b> judges whether or not K<sub>3 </sub>of C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>K<sub>3 </sub>is 0%, and the minimum value among C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3 </sub>is a predetermined threshold value or less (Step S<b>506</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">When not judging that K<sub>3 </sub>of C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>K<sub>3 </sub>is 0%, and the minimum value among C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3 </sub>is the predetermined threshold value or less (Step S<b>506</b>; NO), the CPU <b>11</b> reads a color adjustment table for the set saving mode (Step S<b>507</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The CPU <b>11</b> converts C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>K<sub>3 </sub>into C<sub>4</sub>M<sub>4</sub>Y<sub>4</sub>K<sub>4</sub>, using the read color adjustment table (Step S<b>508</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The CPU <b>11</b> judges whether or not creation of conversion data for all of the LUT input points of the normal mode device link profile is completed (Step S<b>509</b>). That is, the CPU <b>11</b> judges whether or not conversion data to convert an output CMYK value into an adjusted CMYK value is created with respect to all of the LUT input points of the normal mode device link profile.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">When not judging that creation of the conversion data for all of the LUT input points of the normal mode device link profile is completed (Step S<b>509</b>; NO), the CPU <b>11</b> moves to Step S<b>502</b>, and performs the above-described processing on another output CMYK value for which the conversion data to convert the output CMYK value into an adjusted CMYK value is not created. On the other hand, when judging that creation of the conversion data for all of the LUT input points of the normal mode device link profile is completed (Step S<b>509</b>; YES), the CPU <b>11</b> correlates input RGB values of the normal mode device link profile with C<sub>4</sub>M<sub>4</sub>Y<sub>4</sub>K<sub>4 </sub>creates the saving mode device link profile in which RGB values of the lattice points of the source profile are LUT input points, and C<sub>4</sub>M<sub>4</sub>Y<sub>4</sub>K<sub>4 </sub>correlated with the RGB values are output values, and stores the created saving mode device link profile in the storage section <b>16</b> (Step S<b>510</b>), and then ends the saving mode device link profile creation processing.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">When judging that all of C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>K<sub>3 </sub>are 0% (Step S<b>503</b>; YES), judging that the color is a single color of one of CMYK (Step S<b>504</b>; YES), judging that the color is a secondary color of RGB (Step S<b>505</b>; YES), or judging that K<sub>3 </sub>of C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>K<sub>3 </sub>is 0%, and the minimum value among C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3 </sub>is the predetermined threshold value or less (Step S<b>506</b>; YES), the CPU <b>11</b> allows C<sub>3</sub>M<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>K<sub>3 </sub>to be C<sub>4</sub>M<sub>4</sub>Y<sub>4</sub>K<sub>4 </sub>(Step S<b>511</b>), and moves to Step S<b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In the embodiment, the client PC <b>10</b> creates the tables such as the profiles, and the controller <b>2</b> performs the processing to save color material.

<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Alternatively, the functions of the client PC <b>10</b> and the controller <b>2</b> may be realized by one device.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Alternatively, the color printer <b>1</b> may have the functions of the client PC <b>10</b> and the controller <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Furthermore, in the embodiment, the input values and the output values are expressed by 0% to 100% with 100% as the maximum value. Alternatively, the input values and the output values may be expressed by 0 to 255 with 255, which is the maximum value of one byte, as the maximum value.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Furthermore, the color adjustment system <b>1000</b> of the embodiment can be applied to various color printers such as electrophotographic color printer, inkjet color printer and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Furthermore, in the embodiment, as the color printer <b>1</b>, a CMYK (four-color) printer is used. However, for example, a color printer using other colors too such as light cyan and light magenta may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Furthermore, in the embodiment, the tables such as the profiles created by the client PC <b>10</b> are stored in the storage section <b>16</b> of the client PC <b>10</b>, and the tables necessary for the color conversion are held in the controller <b>2</b>. However, some or all of the created tables may be stored in the controller <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Furthermore, in the embodiment, with respect to the CMYK color data, the color material of which is not saved, the processing to save color material is not performed, and the color printer <b>1</b> performs outputting based on the CMYK values obtained by the normal color conversion processing. However, the processing to save color material may be performed with respect to the CMYK color data, the color material of which is not saved, too. For example, a color adjustment table may be configured such that output CMYK values of the CMYK image data, the color material of which is not saved, do not change.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Furthermore, in the embodiment, the color adjustment system <b>1000</b> in which RGB image data is inputted to obtain CMYK values is used.

Alternatively, a color adjustment system may be configured such that both RGB image data and CMYK image data can be inputted.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Furthermore, in the embodiment, the C, M and Y components are reduced, and the K component is increased to save color material, by both the K curve and the color adjustment table which limits the total amount of the C, M, Y and K components. Alternatively, the color material may be saved by the K curve or by the color adjustment table which limits the total amount of the C, Y, M and K components.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Furthermore, in the embodiment, the device link profile is created in the normal color conversion processing, and the color conversion is performed using this device link profile. However, the color conversion may be performed using the source profile and the destination profile, without creating the device link profile.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Furthermore, in the embodiment, the color adjustment table is created based on the first LUT and the third LUT, and the color adjustment is performed using this color adjustment table. However, the color adjustment may be performed using the first LUT and the third LUT, without creating the color adjustment table.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Furthermore, in the embodiment, as a computer readable medium storing the programs of the present invention, a hard disk, a semiconductor nonvolatile memory or the like is used.
