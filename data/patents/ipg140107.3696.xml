<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Silicon on sapphire (SOS) is a hetero-epitaxial process for integrated circuit manufacturing that consists of a thin layer (e.g., thinner than 1.0 micrometers) of silicon grown on a sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) wafer. Circuits constructed in the silicon layer are isolated from each other. The sapphire substrate is an electrical insulator that prevents electrical cross-talk to nearby circuit elements. In some implementations, SOS can include complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. With the insulating sapphire substrate, the SOS CMOS technology may eliminate parasitic bipolar junction transistors in the bulk silicon substrate and hence removes the mechanism for latch-ups.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example serializing system <b>100</b> for combining signals to form signals with high date rates. For example, the system <b>100</b> may be used to combine, aggregate or otherwise multiplex parallel signals into a signal with a data rate of about 4 to 5.8 Gigabits per second (Gb/s) or greater using relatively large transistors. The transistor size may be 0.10 micrometers (&#x3bc;m) or greater such as 0.13 &#x3bc;m or 0.25 &#x3bc;m. In some implementations, the system <b>100</b> may include complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology with a 0.25 &#x3bc;m feature size. In addition, the system <b>100</b> may include Silicon-on-Sapphire (SOS) such as 0.25 &#x3bc;m SOS CMOS technology. In some implementations, the system <b>100</b> may execute one or more of the following: receive a plurality of digital signals encoding information associated with the detected radiation; successively multiplex pairs of the digital signal to produce a single serialized signal encoding information from the original digital signal at high data rates such as about 5 Gb/s or greater; convert the serialized signal to an optical signal for transmission to downstream processors; and/or others. By using relatively large feature size for high data rates, the system <b>100</b> may reduce perturbations in the signals caused by the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">At a high level, the system <b>100</b> includes a conversion element <b>104</b> connected to channels <b>106</b>. The channels <b>106</b> pass parallel digital signals to the conversion element <b>104</b>. The parallel digital signals may be transmitted through the channels <b>106</b> using any suitable device. In the present illustration, a sensor system <b>102</b> is coupled to the conversion element <b>104</b> through the channels <b>106</b>. The sensor system <b>102</b> is merely for illustration purpose only and the conversion element <b>104</b> may be coupled to other devices that produce parallel digital signals without departing from the scope of the disclosure. The conversion element <b>104</b> includes a serializer <b>108</b> that serializes signals and a converter <b>110</b> for converting digital signals to optical signals. In terms of a high level description of operation, the sensor system <b>102</b> detects radiation <b>114</b> and generates a plurality of digital signals encoding the detected information. The sensor system <b>102</b> transmits the digital signals to the serializer <b>108</b> through the channels <b>106</b>. The serializer <b>108</b> combines, multiplexes or otherwise serializes the digital signals to a single data signal encoding the information from the received digital signals. The serializer <b>108</b> operates at a data rate of, for example, at least 5 Gb/s. The serializer <b>108</b> passes the serialized signal to the converter <b>110</b> through the connection <b>112</b>. The converter <b>110</b> converts the digital signal to an optical signal and transmits the signal for downstream processing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Turning to a more detailed description, the sensor system <b>102</b> includes hardware and may include software and/or firmware for detecting one or more properties of radiation <b>114</b>. For example, the sensor system <b>102</b> may be a semiconductor particle detector that detects a path of subatomic particles. The one or more properties may include an energy, path, particle type, frequency, and/or other properties. In some implementations, the sensor system <b>102</b> may detect subatomic particles and/or electromagnetic waves. As for particles, the sensor system <b>102</b> may be a gaseous ionization detector, a solid-state detector, a calorimeter, and/or other type of device that detects particles and generates signals encoding the detected particles. As for electromagnetic waves, the sensor system <b>102</b> may be an optical detector, one or more photodiodes, photomultiplier, a charge-coupled device (CCD), and/or other device configured to detect electromagnetic waves and generate signals encoding the detected information. In some implementations, the sensor system <b>102</b> may include a plurality of sensors that spatially detects incident radiation <b>114</b> over a specified area. For example, the sensor system <b>102</b> may detect incident radiation <b>114</b> over one or more time periods and generate signals for different portions of an area for each time period. In these instances, the signals transmitted through the channels <b>106</b> may represent different spatial information for different portions of the sensor system <b>102</b> at a specified time period. By detecting spatial information over several time periods, the system <b>100</b> may determine the development of one or more properties of the incident radiation <b>114</b> such as a path of one or more particles. In some implementations, the channels <b>106</b> may transmit parallel data as low-voltage differential signals (LVDSs).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The conversion element <b>104</b> can include any software, hardware and/or firmware configured to receive multiple signals and generate an optical signal based on the received signals. For example, the conversion element <b>104</b> may receive multiple digital signals and generate a single optical signal encoding the information included in the multiple signals. As previously mentioned, the conversion element <b>104</b> includes a serializer <b>108</b> for multiplexing signals and a converter <b>110</b> for electrical-to-optical conversion. The serializer <b>108</b> can include any software, hardware and/or firmware that combines, aggregates or otherwise serializes signals into one or more signals. For example, the serializer <b>108</b> may serialize a plurality of received digital signals into a single signal having a high data rate. In some implementations, the serializer <b>108</b> can be an integrated circuit (IC or chip) that converts parallel data to serial data. In these instances, the serializer <b>108</b> may receive parallel data from the channels <b>106</b> and combine the parallel data into a single signal. The serializer <b>108</b> may include multiple interfaces in a single package. In general, the serializer <b>108</b> may facilitate the transmission of parallel data between two points over serial streams and reduce the number of data paths and, thus, the number of connecting PINS and/or wires. In some implementations, the serializer <b>108</b> may generate a single data stream that transmits data bit by bit. The serializer <b>108</b> may include one or more of the following elements: multiplexer (e.g., 2:1 multiplexer); phase-locked loop; d flip-flops; voltage controlled oscillator; sapphire substrate; CMOS technology; phase detector; and/or other elements.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some implementations, the serializer <b>108</b> may based on a serialization circuit unit that utilizes a group of static D-flip-flop circuits in a cascade structure to achieve serialization with the power of 2. In these examples, the serializer <b>108</b> may include 2:1 multiplexing units to be reused before the last stage of multiplexing. As a result of including static logic, the serializer <b>108</b> may keep the power consumption low and make serialization robust. Working in the power of 2 may also simplify and speed up the divider chain in a phase locked loop (PLL) design. In the last 2:1 multiplexing unit in this example, which is the only stage that needs to operate at the full design speed of 5 Gb/s, the serializer <b>108</b> may include a pair of complementary CMOS clock signals to the d flip-flop. A differential voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) in the clock synthesizing unit may generate a pair of substantially matched clock signals. This type of serializer <b>108</b> may minimize, decrease, or otherwise reduce the mismatch in the clock signals to the D-flip-flop and, as a result, may improve the speed of the 2:1 multiplexer and of the serializer <b>108</b>. In some implementations, the serializer <b>108</b> may include differential ring-oscillator PLL with dual loop path to generate the clock signals for all the multiplexing circuits.</p>

For example, the serializer <b>108</b> may consist of a thin layer (typically thinner than 0.6 &#x3bc;m) of silicon grown on a sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) wafer. In some implementations, the serializer <b>108</b> can be an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) using, for example, a 0.25 &#x3bc;m SOS CMOS technology.

<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate an example serializer <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure. In general, the illustrated serializer <b>108</b> receives digital parallel data and generates a serial signal based, at least in part, on the parallel data. In the illustrated implementation, the serializer <b>108</b> includes a multiplexer <b>202</b> for successively multiplexing pairs of digital signals to generate a serial signal and a phase-locked loop (PLL) <b>204</b> for generating clock signals for each multiplexing step. The multiplexer <b>202</b> includes a plurality of multiplexing levels that generate multiplexed signals having a data rate greater that the previous data rate. At the final stage, the multiplexer <b>202</b> generates a serial signal with a data rate about 5 Gb/s. The illustrated multiplexer includes 16 interfaces <b>206</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>for receiving low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) signals, a first set of 2:1 multiplexers <b>208</b><i>a</i>-<i>h</i>, a second set of 2:1 multiplexers <b>210</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, a third set of 2:1 multiplexers <b>212</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, a final multiplexer <b>214</b> and a CML driver <b>216</b>. Eight pairs of the 16 LVDS interfaces <b>206</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>are each connected to one multiplexer in the first set of multiplexers <b>208</b><i>a</i>-<i>h</i>. In addition, each multiplexer <b>208</b> receives the same first clock signal <b>218</b> and multiplexes the received pair in accordance with the clock signal <b>218</b>. Pairs in the first set of multiplexers <b>208</b> pass the associated multiplexed signals to a single multiplexer in the second set of multiplexers <b>210</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. In other words, each in the second set of multiplexers <b>210</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>receive two inputs from different pairs of multiplexers <b>208</b> in the first set. In addition, each multiplexer <b>210</b> receives the same first clock signal <b>220</b> and multiplexes the received pair in accordance with the clock signal <b>220</b>. The two pairs of multiplexers <b>210</b> each pass their multiplexed signals to one multiplexer in the third set of multiplexers <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b</i>. In other words, multiplexer <b>212</b><i>a </i>receives signals from multiplexers <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b</i>, and multiplexer <b>212</b><i>b </i>receives signals from multiplexers <b>210</b><i>c </i>and <b>210</b><i>d</i>. In addition, each multiplexer <b>212</b> receives the same clock signal <b>222</b> and multiplexers the received pair in accordance with the clock signal <b>222</b>. Multiplexers <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>pass their multiplexed signals to the final multiplexer <b>214</b>. The final multiplexer <b>214</b> receives the clock signal <b>224</b> and splits the clock signal to two signals. In some implementations, the final multiplexer <b>214</b> introduces a phase shift in one of the two clock signals to substantially correct a phase discrepancy. The final multiplexer <b>214</b> multiplexes the two received signals in accordance with the phase-corrected clock signals to generate a serial signal with a data rate of approximately 5 Gb/s or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The PLL <b>204</b> uses the reference signal <b>226</b> to phase lock with generated clock signals. In the illustrated implementation, the PLL <b>204</b> includes a phase frequency detector (PFD) <b>228</b>, a charge pump (CP) <b>230</b>, a low-pass filter (LPF) <b>232</b>, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) <b>234</b>, and frequency dividers <b>236</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. The PFD <b>228</b> determines an error in phase between the reference signal <b>226</b> and the signal produced by the VCO <b>234</b>. The amount of charge stored by the CP <b>230</b> is based, at least in part, on the difference in frequency or error between the two signals. The LPF <b>232</b> substantially attenuates signals with a frequency above a specified threshold. The CP <b>230</b> provides a voltage to the VCO <b>234</b> in accordance with the amount of stored charge. The VCO <b>234</b> generates an initial clock signal <b>224</b> for the multiplexer <b>202</b> based, at least in part, on the applied voltage. The clock signal <b>224</b> is passed to the final multiplexer <b>214</b> and a first frequency divider <b>236</b><i>a</i>. The frequency divider <b>236</b><i>a </i>generates the clock signal <b>222</b> with a frequency about half the clock signal <b>224</b> and passes the clock signal <b>222</b> to the multiplexers <b>212</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and a second frequency divider <b>236</b><i>b</i>. The second frequency divider <b>236</b><i>b </i>generates a clock signal <b>220</b> with a frequency about half the clock signal <b>222</b> and passes the clock signal <b>220</b> to the multiplexers <b>210</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and a third frequency divider <b>236</b><i>c</i>. The third frequency divider <b>236</b><i>c </i>generates a clock signal <b>218</b> with a frequency about half the clock signal <b>220</b> and passes the clock signal <b>218</b> to the multiplexers <b>208</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>and the PFD <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example d flip-flop <b>300</b> in accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure. In particular, the d flip-flop <b>300</b> substantially corrects a phase difference of a clock signal <b>306</b> and a complimentary clock signal <b>308</b>. As previously mentioned, a multiplexer (e.g., MUX <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may include a plurality of d flip-flops to aggregate or otherwise combine signals. For example, a 2:1 multiplexer may include two d flip-flops. In the illustrated implementation, the d flip-flop <b>300</b> includes two latches <b>302</b><i>a </i>and <b>302</b><i>b </i>and two differential-to-single converters (D2S) <b>304</b><i>a </i>and <b>304</b><i>b</i>. The latch <b>302</b><i>a </i>receives the data input <b>312</b> and stores the data for a period of time prior to passing the data to the latch <b>302</b><i>b</i>. Both the two D2S <b>304</b><i>a </i>and <b>304</b><i>b </i>receive the clock signal <b>306</b> and the complimentary clock signal <b>308</b>. In the event that D1 is greater than D2, D2S <b>304</b><i>a </i>will output a logical 1 (e.g., 2.5 V) and D2S <b>304</b><i>b </i>will output a logical 0 (e.g., 0 V). In the event that D2 is greater than D1, D2S <b>304</b><i>a </i>will output a logical 0 (e.g., 0 V) and D2S <b>304</b><i>b </i>will output a logical 1 (e.g., 2.5 V). In doing so, D2S <b>304</b><i>a </i>and <b>304</b><i>b </i>may substantially eliminate or otherwise reduce a phase discrepancy between the initial clock signal <b>306</b> and the complimentary clock signal <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an example method <b>400</b> for serializing digital signals in accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure. In particular, the method <b>400</b> includes introducing a phase shift in a final multiplexing step to reduce a mismatch in clock signals. Method <b>400</b> contemplates using any appropriate combination and arrangement of logical elements implementing some or all of the described functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Method <b>400</b> begins at step <b>402</b> where 16 digital signals are received from a particle detector. For example, the multiplexer <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may receive 16 digital signals from a detector. At step <b>404</b>, eight pairs of signals are identified from the sixteen received signals. In the example, different pairs of interfaces of the multiplexer <b>202</b> may be wired to different multiplexers <b>208</b>. Next, at step <b>406</b>, each pair is passed to a first set of 2:1 multiplexers. A first clock signal having a first frequency is passed to each multiplexer in the first set at step <b>408</b>. Again in the example, the first clock signal <b>218</b> may be passed from the PLL <b>204</b> to each of the multiplexers <b>208</b>. At step <b>410</b>, each pair is multiplexed using the first clock signal to generate eight multiplexed signals.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Next, at step <b>412</b>, four pairs of the eight multiplexed signals are identified. As for the example, the output from different pairs of the multiplexers <b>208</b> are connected to a single multiplexer <b>210</b> such as the outputs of multiplexers <b>208</b><i>g </i>and <b>208</b><i>h </i>are connected to the multiplexer <b>210</b><i>d</i>. Each pair is passed to a second set of 2:1 multiplexers at step <b>414</b>. Returning to the example, the initial multiplexed signals are passed to the multiplexers <b>210</b>. At step <b>416</b>, a second clock signal having a second frequency approximately double the first frequency is passed to each of the multiplexers in the second set. Again in the example, the second clock signal <b>220</b> is passed from the PLL <b>204</b> to each multiplexer <b>210</b>. Next, at step <b>418</b>, each pair of signals is multiplexed using the second clock signal to generate four multiplexed signals.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At step <b>420</b>, two pairs of the four multiplexed signals are identified. As for the example, the output from different pairs of the multiplexers <b>210</b> are connected to third set of multiplexers <b>212</b> such as the outputs of multiplexer <b>210</b><i>c </i>and <b>210</b><i>d </i>are connected to the multiplexer <b>212</b><i>b</i>. Each pair is passed to a third set of 2:1 multiplexers at step <b>422</b>. Returning to the example, the multiplexed signals are passed to the multiplexers <b>212</b>. At step <b>422</b>, a third clock signal having a third frequency approximately double the second frequency is passed to each of the multiplexers in the third set. Again in the example, the third clock signal <b>222</b> is passed from the PLL <b>204</b> to each multiplexer <b>212</b> at step <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At step <b>426</b>, one pair of multiplexed signals are identified. As for the example, the output from different pairs of the multiplexers <b>212</b> are connected to a final multiplexer <b>214</b> such as the outputs of multiplexer <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>are connected to the multiplexer <b>214</b>. Each pair is passed to a final 2:1 multiplexer at step <b>428</b>. Returning to the example, the multiplexed signals are passed from multiplexer <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>to the multiplexers <b>214</b>. At step <b>430</b>, a fourth clock signal having a fourth frequency approximately double the third frequency is passed to the final multiplexer. Again in the example, the fourth clock signal <b>224</b> is passed from the PLL <b>204</b> to the final multiplexer <b>214</b>. At step <b>432</b>, the fourth clock signal is split into a primary and complimentary clock signal. Next, at step <b>434</b>, the complimentary clock signal is phase shifted to substantially correct mismatches between the primary and complimentary clock signal. The pair is, at step <b>436</b>, multiplexed using the primary and phase-shifted clock signals to generate the serialized signal.</p>
