<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/357,222, filed on Jun. 22, 2010.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to communication systems, and, more particularly, to wireless communication systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless communication systems implement a network of base stations or other access nodes to provide wireless connectivity to different geographical areas or cells. User equipment or other access terminals located within the cells can access the wireless communication system by establishing an over the air communication session with one or more access nodes. User equipment may also be able to move or roam between different cells and so the wireless communication system typically implements mobility functionality that allows the system to hand off user equipment between different access nodes and to keep track of the serving access node for the user equipment. However, in some circumstances the network may need or want to determine a more precise geographical location of user equipment. For example, the network may provide location-dependent services that use the geographic location (e.g., coordinates such as latitude-longitude) of user equipment to configure the services provided to the user equipment. For another example, the network may provide emergency services that allow user equipment to be located in emergency, e.g., in response to a 911 call from the user equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wireless communication devices, particularly mobile user equipment, often implement global positioning system (GPS) functionality to determine the geographic location of the device using multiple GPS satellite signals. However, GPS functionality consumes significant battery power and so users often disable or turn off the GPS functionality when they are not using a specific location-dependent service that requires geographic information. Disabled GPS functionality may be unable to provide requested location information in emergency situations and enabling a disabled GPS function and then acquiring the necessary satellite signals may introduce significant time delays. Furthermore, GPS functionality may not work when the user equipment is obscured or shielded and unable to acquire the necessary number of satellite signals.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The geographic locations of user equipment can also be determined by triangulation or trilateration using distances between the user equipment and multiple base stations. For example, user equipment can determine its geographic location using downlink observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA) measurements for signals transmitted by a group of neighboring base stations. The difference between the arrival times of signals from two different base stations can be used to determine a locus of possible user equipment locations. The locus typically includes more than one candidate location and the redundancy/degeneracy can be broken using one or more additional loci determined using the OTDOA for signals received from another pair of base stations. However, the base stations that transmit the positioning reference signals (PRS) may need to limit or mute transmission concurrently with transmitting the OTDOA signals to reduce interference so that the user equipment can detect the downlink signals with a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). This can significantly impact overall system capacity. Moreover, OTDOA techniques require additional functionality and computing power at the user equipment.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Illustrative embodiments are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions should be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The disclosed subject matter will now be described with reference to the attached figures. Various structures, systems and devices are schematically depicted in the drawings for purposes of explanation only and so as to not obscure the description with details that are well known to those skilled in the art. Nevertheless, the attached drawings are included to describe and explain illustrative examples of the disclosed subject matter. The words and phrases used herein should be understood and interpreted to have a meaning consistent with the understanding of those words and phrases by those skilled in the relevant art. No special definition of a term or phrase, i.e., a definition that is different from the ordinary and customary meaning as understood by those skilled in the art, is intended to be implied by consistent usage of the term or phrase herein. To the extent that a term or phrase is intended to have a special meaning, i.e., a meaning other than that understood by skilled artisans, such a special definition will be expressly set forth in the specification in a definitional manner that directly and unequivocally provides the special definition for the term or phrase.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Generally, the present application describes embodiments of techniques that can be used to support location determination using uplink time delay of arrival (UTDOA) measurements. The location of user equipment can be determined using uplink time delay of arrival measurements for signals (such as sounding reference signals) transmitted from the user equipment to its serving base station and two or more neighboring base stations. Since the neighboring base stations have not been chosen as the serving base station, it is very likely that the user equipment is located near the edge or even outside of the cell boundaries of the neighboring base stations. The signal strength received at the neighboring base station from the user equipment is therefore relatively weak compared to the signal strength received at the neighboring base station from user equipment that are operating within the neighbor cell and/or are served by the neighbor cell. Consequently, user equipment operating within the neighbor cell can generate strong interference for the signals received from the user equipment associated with the serving cell. For example, cross-correlations between sounding reference signals generated using different root sequences can create noise or interference between the user equipment in a synchronized communication system. Sequence hopping could be used to randomize the interference but this has not been shown to provide sufficient uplink time delay of arrival performance.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present application therefore describes embodiments of interference cancellation and/or noise removal techniques. In one embodiment, each neighboring cell extracts reference signals transmitted by user equipment served by the neighboring cell from a received signal. For example, a neighboring cell can decode sounding reference signal transmissions from user equipment within the neighboring cell. The received signal may be a superposition of the reference signals from user equipment served by the neighboring cell and reference signals from user equipment served by the serving cell. The extracted reference signals may be fed back so that they can be subtracted from a delayed version of the received signal. For example, the decoded sounding reference signals from user equipment and the neighboring cell can be subtracted from the received sounding reference signal symbol before performing decoding of the sounding reference signal symbol from the target user equipment for the UTDOA measurement. Reference signals received from user equipment served by the serving cell may then be extracted following removal of the feedback signals. In some embodiments, the reference signals are accumulated over multiple subframes, e.g., to enhance the signal-to-noise or signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios. The accumulated signals can then be used to estimate timing delays between the user equipment and the receiving base station.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> conceptually illustrates a first exemplary embodiment of a wireless communication system <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the wireless communication system <b>100</b> includes a network of access nodes such as base stations <b>105</b> that are used to provide wireless connectivity within corresponding geographic areas or cells.

In the illustrated embodiment, the base station <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) is the serving access node for user equipment <b>110</b>, as indicated by the arrow <b>125</b>. User equipment <b>115</b> are served by the base station <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>) and user equipment <b>120</b> are served by the base station <b>105</b>(<b>3</b>). In the interest of clarity, the specific connections or associations between user equipment <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> and base stations <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>) are not indicated by arrows. The base stations <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>) may be able to receive signals from the user equipment <b>110</b> even though user equipment <b>110</b> is not served by either of the base stations <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, sounding reference signals transmitted by user equipment <b>110</b> can be received at the base stations <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>), as indicated by dashed arrows <b>130</b>, <b>135</b>. However, as discussed herein, signals received at the base stations <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>) from the user equipment <b>110</b> may be relatively weak compared to signals received at the base stations <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>) from user equipment <b>115</b>, <b>120</b>. Furthermore, signals received from the user equipment <b>110</b> may be obscured by interference or noise generated by the user equipment <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> that are served by the neighboring base stations <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>). This interference can be removed or canceled by extracting signals transmitted by the user equipment <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> from the received signal before attempting to decode the relatively weak signals received from user equipment <b>110</b>, as discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">User equipment <b>110</b> can be located using uplink signals received at the base stations <b>105</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, user equipment <b>110</b> transmits sounding reference signals over uplink channels that can be received by the base stations <b>105</b>, e.g., as indicated by the arrows <b>125</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>135</b>. If the timing errors and/or time offset of the user equipment <b>110</b> is known precisely (e.g., within a particular tolerance), the timing of the received uplink signals can be compared to a timing reference that is used to synchronize the base stations <b>105</b> to determine a timing delay that indicates distances between the user equipment <b>110</b> and the base stations <b>105</b>. For example, each of the base stations <b>105</b> may determine a corresponding timing delay that indicates a distance <b>140</b> between the base station <b>105</b> and the user equipment <b>110</b>. Each base station <b>105</b> could therefore determine that the user equipment <b>110</b> is located on a circle <b>145</b> defined by the corresponding distance or radius <b>140</b>. The location of the user equipment <b>110</b> can be determined by combining information indicative of multiple circles <b>145</b>. Alternatively, if the timing errors and/or time offset of the user equipment <b>110</b> is not known, trilateration based on the relative time delays of arrival for signals received at different base stations <b>105</b> can be used to determine the location of the user equipment <b>110</b>. For example, a trilateration algorithm may be used so that the unknown timing error and/or time offset associated with the user equipment <b>110</b> is at least partially canceled out by taking the difference of the two timing measurements for the user equipment <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> conceptually illustrates a second exemplary embodiment of a wireless communication system <b>200</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the wireless communication system <b>200</b> includes access nodes such as base stations <b>205</b> that are used to provide wireless connectivity to one or more user equipment <b>210</b>. For example, base station <b>205</b>(<b>1</b>) is the serving base station for user equipment <b>210</b>, as indicated by the arrow <b>215</b>. The user equipment <b>210</b> may therefore establish wireless communication links over air interface channels with the serving base station <b>205</b>(<b>1</b>). Signals transmitted by the user equipment <b>210</b> may also be received at other neighboring base stations such as the base stations <b>205</b>(<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>) even though these base stations are not serving base stations for the user equipment <b>210</b>, as indicated by the dotted arrows <b>220</b>, <b>225</b>. The neighboring base stations <b>205</b>(<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>) may attempt to decode signals received from the user equipment <b>210</b> and use the decoded signals for various purposes such as location determination.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated embodiment, the user equipment <b>210</b> transmits reference signals such as pilot signals or sounding reference signals over the air interface. The reference signals have a predetermined format so that the base stations <b>205</b> can decode the signals and use the decoded information to determine a time delay relative to the reference time used to synchronize operation of the base stations <b>205</b>. In one embodiment, the user equipment <b>210</b> may transmit constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences over the air interface on channels allocated for transmission of reference signals. For example, the user equipment <b>210</b> may generate a sounding reference signal sequence S<sup>SRS </sup>using a cyclic shift of a root sequence:

Exemplary CAZAC sequences include Zadoff-Chu sequences, which are complex-valued mathematical sequences that can be applied to radio signals to generate an electromagnetic signal of constant amplitude. A Zadoff-Chu sequence exhibits the useful property that cyclically shifted versions of the sequence are substantially orthogonal to one another when each cyclic shift, viewed within the time domain of the signal, is substantially greater than the combined propagation delay and multi-path delay-spread of that signal between the transmitter and receiver.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> conceptually illustrates one exemplary embodiment of an equivalent frequency domain channel (H(t)) <b>300</b> for sounding reference signal (SRS) transmission and reception. In the illustrated embodiment, the source signal (S<sup>SRS</sup>) is generated and provided to a transmitter front-end <b>305</b>. As discussed herein, the source signal may be an orthogonal sequence such as a CAZAC sequence. The transmitter front-end <b>305</b> includes a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) element <b>310</b> and an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) element <b>315</b>. The transmitter front-end <b>305</b> then provides the signal over the air interface channels (h(t)) <b>320</b> and the transmitted signal is received at the receiver front-end <b>325</b>, which includes a fast Fourier transform (FFT) element <b>330</b> and an inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) element <b>335</b> for generating the received signal, R<sup>SRS</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the illustrated embodiments of the base stations <b>205</b> each include a location management unit (LMU) <b>230</b> that is configured to generate location information using received signals, such as the sounding reference signals received from user equipment <b>210</b>. For example, the LMUs <b>230</b> associated with the base stations <b>205</b> may be configured to measure a time delay for reference signals received from the user equipment <b>210</b> so that the location of the user equipment <b>210</b> may be determined. Although the LMUs <b>230</b> are shown as being implemented within the base stations <b>205</b>, persons of ordinary skill in the art having benefit of the present disclosure should appreciate that in alternative embodiments the LMUs <b>230</b> may be implemented in other locations, e.g., they may be standalone devices that are electronically and/or communicatively connected to the base stations <b>205</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, each LMU <b>230</b> accesses signal energy that is received over a reference channel and uses this information to attempt to decode reference signals transmitted by the user equipment <b>210</b>. The received signal energy may be a superposition of signals received from different user equipment. For example, the signal energy received by the base station <b>205</b>(<b>2</b>) may be a superposition of the reference signal transmitted by the user equipment <b>210</b> and reference signals transmitted by other user equipment served by the base stations <b>205</b>. The LMUs <b>230</b> may therefore modify the received signal by removing estimated signals or channels for user equipment served by the corresponding base station <b>205</b> before attempting to decode the reference signal transmitted by the user equipment <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> conceptually illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a portion of a location management unit <b>400</b>. One function of the location management unit <b>400</b> is to identify and decode reference signals transmitted by user equipment that are not served by the base station associated with the location management unit <b>400</b>. For example, the location management unit <b>400</b> may be used to measure time delays for reference signals transmitted by a target user equipment that is served by a different base station. The location management unit <b>400</b> may therefore remove or cancel interference caused by reference signals transmitted by user equipment served by the base station associated with the location management unit <b>400</b>. Reference signals from the target user equipment may then be identified in the received signal after performing interference cancellation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrated embodiment, the location management unit <b>400</b> includes a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) element <b>405</b> that receives signals transmitted over the reference signal channel and performs a discrete Fourier transform on the received signals. The transformed signals may then be provided to two branches <b>410</b>. Signals transmitted on the first branch <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>) are provided to one or more time domain filters <b>415</b> that are used to filter or extract reference signals received from user equipment served by the base station associated with the location management unit <b>400</b>. In one embodiment, the reference signals for different user equipment are cyclically shifted versions of a root sequence and so the different reference signals are shifted relative to each other in the time domain. The time domain filters <b>415</b> can therefore be configured to filter out all of the reference signals except the desired reference signal from a particular user equipment served by the base station. The individual reference signals are then provided to a corresponding inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) element <b>420</b> and provided to multiplier elements <b>425</b> to multiply these signals by the conjugate of the corresponding cyclically shifted root sequence to generate the channel (H<sub>i</sub>) corresponding to the reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The second branch <b>410</b>(<b>2</b>) provides the received signals to a subtraction element <b>430</b>, which also receives feedback signals from the IDFT elements <b>420</b> of the first branch <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>). The feedback signals include signal energy for the reference signals transmitted by user equipment that are served by the base station associated with the location management unit <b>400</b>. The subtraction element <b>430</b> removes the signal energy for the feedback reference signals from the received signal. Delay elements <b>435</b>, <b>440</b> are used to delay the signals in the first and second branches <b>410</b> so that the signals that are fed back for a particular symbol transmitted over the air interface are synchronized with the same symbol in the received signal at the subtraction element <b>430</b>. The modified signal is then provided to a time domain filter <b>445</b> that is used to filter or extract the reference signal received from the target user equipment that is not served by the base station associated with the location management unit <b>400</b>. The individual reference signal may be provided to a corresponding inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) element <b>450</b> and then to a multiplier element <b>455</b> to multiply the signal by the conjugate of the corresponding cyclically shifted root sequence to generate the channel (H<sub>i</sub>) corresponding to the reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the location management unit <b>400</b> may be used to generate timing information for uplink time difference of arrival (UTDOA) calculations. For example, the received SRS signals may be a transposition of reference signals received from user equipment being served by various different base stations when multi-cell SRS transmissions are coordinated, e.g., using a common timing reference signal for transmissions in the different cells. The received SRS signal can therefore be expressed as:</p>

where &#x124;<sub>j </sub>represents the channels for user equipment in the serving cell other than the target user equipment for the UTDOA measurement. The residual errors between the actual channels and the estimated channels are very small. The target SRS after SRS interference cancellation may therefore be approximately represented as:

In the illustrated embodiment, the LMUs <b>230</b> provide measured timing delays (relative to a reference time used by the base stations <b>205</b>) for signals received from the user equipment <b>210</b> to a serving mobile location center (SMLC) <b>235</b>. Embodiments of the illustrated SMLC <b>235</b> may be network elements in networks such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) networks. The SMLC <b>235</b> may be implemented in a base station controller and may be configured to calculate a network-based location of user equipment such as user equipment <b>210</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the SMLC <b>235</b> uses the received timing information to determine relative time delays of arrival for signals received at the different base stations <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> conceptually illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a timing diagram <b>500</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the timing diagram depicts reference signals <b>505</b>, <b>510</b> received from a target user equipment by different base stations. These signals are synchronized to a common timing reference used by both base stations. A central entity, such as an eSMLC, can gather the timing information from the different base stations and then use it to determine the relative time delays of arrival <b>515</b> between signals received at different base stations from the target user equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the eSMLC <b>235</b> can use the relative time difference of arrival for signals received by pairs of the base stations <b>205</b> to estimate the location of the user equipment <b>210</b>. For example, the relative uplink time difference of arrival defines a hyperbola that includes the locus of points where the absolute value of the difference of the distances to the two foci (e.g., the pair of base stations) is a constant determined by the relative uplink time difference of arrival. When time difference of arrivals are measured for signals received by three or more base stations, well known triangulation techniques can be used to identify the location of the user equipment <b>210</b>, e.g., using the intersections of the various hyperbolas.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> conceptually illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a method <b>600</b> for estimating the location of user equipment using sounding reference signals. In the illustrated embodiment, a target user equipment transmits sounding reference signals over the air interface and the signals are received (at <b>605</b>) at the serving cell and one or more neighbor cells. Neighbor cells may also receive sounding reference signals from user equipment being served by the neighbor cell. The neighbor cell may therefore decode (at <b>610</b>) the sounding reference signals received from user equipment that the neighbor cell is serving. Energy associated with these user equipment may then be subtracted (at <b>615</b>) from the received signal to form a modified signal. Sounding reference signals transmitted by the target user equipment may then be decoded (at <b>620</b>) from the modified signal. The neighbor cell may then provide timing information associated with the target user equipment sounding reference signal to a central entity that can use this information to locate (at <b>625</b>) the target user equipment by applying uplink time delay of arrival techniques to relative timing delays that are determined using information provided by serving and neighbor cells.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show the results of performing location estimation using UTDOA with and without using embodiments of the sounding reference signal interference cancellation described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of position errors (measured in meters) for different sets of simulation parameters. In both embodiments, the sounding reference signals are accumulated over 100 subframes before performing the timing offset estimation. The United States Federal Communications Commission (US FCC) mandated performance requirements for terrestrial positioning technology require that the system locate user equipment with an error of less than 150 m at least 67% of the time. The US FCC regulations also require that the system be able to locate user equipment within an error of less than 300 m at least 95% of the time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the CDF of the position error when no interference cancellation is used. The results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> indicate that a position error of less than 150 m is only achieved approximately 40-50% of the time and a position error of less than 300 m is achieved less than 90% of the time for the cases considered. These results do not meet the US FCC requirements. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the CDF of the position error when embodiments of the interference cancellation techniques described herein are used. The results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> indicate that a position error of less than 150 m is achieved approximately 95-97% of the time and a position error of less than 300 m is achieved almost 100% of the time.
