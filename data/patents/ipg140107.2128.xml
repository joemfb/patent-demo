<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for producing a dispersion of hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles, a coating composition containing the dispersion, to obtain a coating film having high antireflection properties, and a substrate with an antireflection coating film obtained by applying the coating composition.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles have an air gap in the interior of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>shell and have a high porosity, a low refractive index and a low dielectric constant and are thereby useful for prevention of reflection, an optical filter, a heat insulating material, a low dielectric constant material, drug delivery, etc. Particularly, they are known to be useful as an antireflection coating film material by virtue of their low refractive index owing to their hollow shape, and various processes for their production have been studied. Generally, such hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles are obtained by removing only core fine particles of core/shell fine particles wherein the shell is SiO<sub>2 </sub>so that the SiO<sub>2 </sub>shell remains and the interior of the particles becomes hollow.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">In the conventional method, one technical point is to determine which core fine particles are used and how they are removed by e.g. dissolution.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">For example, in a case where an organic polymer is used as the core fine particles, the core fine particles are removed by thermal decomposition (Patent Document 1), and in a case where an inorganic compound is used, it is common to remove the core fine particles by dissolving them with an acid (Patent Documents 2 and 3).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">However, the former method has such a restriction that thermal decomposition under high temperature conditions is required, and in a case where the substrate is an organic resin, the organic polymer core fine particles are preliminarily thermally decomposed and then dissolved in a solvent to prepare a coating fluid, such being troublesome.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">On the other hand, according to studies by the present inventors, the latter method, which seems to be carried out more easily, was found to have such a problem that the ionic strength in a solution suddenly increases by ions generated by addition of an acid and ions generated from the dissolved core fine particles, thus lowering the stability of the solution, whereby hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles are agglomerated in an uncontrollable state. If the hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles are agglomerated in an uncontrollable state, the agglomerated particle size tends to be too large, thus impairing transparency of the resulting coating film. Accordingly, the concentration of the solution when the inorganic compound core fine particles are dissolved is restricted to a low concentration range, such being disadvantageous in productivity. Further, bothersome ultrafiltration is required to remove generated ions, and in addition, a very long time is required for filtration.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">Further, to remove the core fine particles, requirement such as thermal decomposition at high temperature in the case of the former method and addition of a strong acid in the case of the latter method are required, but as described above, it is difficult to control the dissolution step, and the core fine particles will not completely be decomposed or removed by dissolution unless operation conditions are very precisely controlled, and some of the core fine particles remain, whereby no sufficient antireflection properties will be obtained. Further, in a case where the core fine particles contain a SiO<sub>2 </sub>component, the SiO<sub>2 </sub>remains, whereby the antireflection properties are insufficient. As described hereinafter, in the present invention, ZnO which is easily soluble is used as the core, and accordingly such remaining of the core material will not occur, whereby high antireflection properties can be obtained.

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">Now, the present invention will be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">(a) (Formation of Core/Shell Particles)</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">In the process for producing a dispersion of fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles having hollow SiO<sub>2 </sub>dispersed in a dispersion medium of the present invention, first, formation of core/shell particles, i.e. step (a) of reacting a precursor of SiO<sub>2 </sub>constituting the shell of particles at a pH higher than 8 in the presence of fine ZnO particles constituting the core in the dispersion medium to form SiO<sub>2</sub>, thereby to obtain a dispersion of fine particles comprising the fine ZnO particles covered with the formed SiO<sub>2</sub>, is carried out.</p>

It may, for example, be preferably water; an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, t-butanol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, cyclopentanol, cyclopentanediol or cyclohexanol; a ketone such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, isopropyl methyl ketone, isobutyl methyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone or acetophenone; an ether such as glyme, diglyme, isopropyl ether, isobutyl ether, methyl isopropyl ether, anisole, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane; an ester such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl acetoacetate, butyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl propionate, methyl butyrate or ethyl butyrate; a glycol ether such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether or ethylene glycol monoethyl ether; a nitrogen-containing compound such as N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylformamide, 2-pyrrolidinone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone or 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone; or a sulfur-containing compound such as dimethyl sulfoxide or sulfolane.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">Water is not essentially contained in the dispersion medium for ZnO, but considering that the dispersion medium is used as it is for the subsequent step of hydrolysis/polycondensation of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor, a preferred dispersion medium is water alone or a solvent mixture of water and the above organic solvent. The organic solvent is an organic solvent which is partially soluble at least in water, preferably an organic solvent in which water is partially soluble, most preferably an organic solvent miscible with water.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">The average primary particle size of the fine ZnO particles is preferably from 5 to 200 nm with a view to maintaining an optimum dissolution rate of the core in the subsequent core particles dissolution step and an optimum size of the cavity in the obtained hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles. If the particle size is less than 5 nm, the cavity in the hollow particles tends to be small, and when the hollow particles are blended in the coating film, the antireflection properties tend to be insufficient, and if it exceeds 200 nm, the core dissolution rate tends to be insufficient, whereby completely hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles are hardly obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">Further, in a case where agglomerates of the hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles are to be obtained, if the core particles are monodispersed particles, agglomerates of the hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles are hardly obtained, such being undesirable, and agglomerates having from 2 to 10 core fine particles agglomerated are preferably used. However, in general, the fine ZnO particles may be either monodispersed particles or agglomerates.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">In such a case, the average agglomerated particle size of the core particles influences over the size of the hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles to be obtained, and to obtain an optimum size, it is from 50 to 400 nm, more preferably from 50 to 350 nm. If it is less than 50 nm, the particle size of the hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles to be obtained will be small, whereby an antireflection film having low chroma saturation will hardly be obtained, and if it exceeds 400 nm, the particle size of SiO<sub>2 </sub>to be obtained tends to be too large, whereby transparency of the coating film having the hollow fine particles blended may be insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">The dispersion of fine ZnO particles is obtained by adding, to a ZnO particulate powder, the above-mentioned dispersion medium such as water, an alcohol, a ketone, an ester, an ether, a glycol ether, a nitrogen-containing compound or a sulfur-containing compound, followed by peptization by a dispersing machine such as a ball mill, a bead mill, a sand mill, a homomixer or a paint shaker.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">The solid content concentration of the dispersion of fine ZnO particles is preferably at most 50 mass % and at least 0.1 mass % so as to secure stability of the dispersion, more preferably at most 30 mass % and at least 1 mass %. If it exceeds 50 mass %, stability of the dispersion tends to decrease.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">(Decomposition of SiO<sub>2 </sub>Precursor and pH and Temperature at the Time of Forming the Shell)</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">To obtain the dispersion of hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles, first, a dispersion of core/shell fine particles wherein the shell is SiO<sub>2 </sub>is produced. Specifically, a hydrolysis catalyst such as an acid or an alkali is added in the presence of the fine ZnO particles dispersed in the dispersion medium so that the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor is reacted at a pH higher than 8, whereby the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor is hydrolyzed and precipitated around (on the outer surface of) the fine ZnO particles to form the shell. If the pH of the dispersion at the time of mixing the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor is at most 8, ZnO will be dissolved at this stage, and accordingly it is preferably higher than 8.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">The pH of the dispersion is more preferably within a range of from 9 to 11. The higher the pH, the higher the reaction rate of hydrolysis/polycondensation of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor, whereby the SiO<sub>2 </sub>shell can be formed in a short time. However, if the pH exceeds 11, the hydrolysis rate tends to be too high, whereby formed SiO<sub>2 </sub>itself agglomerates, whereby homogeneous formation of the shell on the outer surface of the fine ZnO particles tends to be difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">Further, in order to increase the ionic strength to easily form the shell from the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor in production of the dispersion of core/shell fine particles, an electrolyte such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, lithium nitrate, calcium nitrate, magnesium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, ammonia, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide may be added, to adjust the pH by such an electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">The higher the temperature at the time of forming the SiO<sub>2 </sub>shell, the higher the reaction rate of hydrolysis/polycondensation of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor, whereby the SiO<sub>2 </sub>shell can be formed in a short time, and accordingly the temperature is usually preferably within a range of from 20 to 100&#xb0; C. If the temperature exceeds 100&#xb0; C., the formed SiO<sub>2 </sub>shell may be formed into non-porous, such being undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">The SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor may be one member or a mixture of at least two selected from the group consisting of silicic acid, a silicate and an alkoxysilane, or may be a hydrolysate or a polymer thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">Specifically, the silicic acid may be silicic acid obtained by e.g. a method of decomposing an alkali metal silicate with an acid, followed by dialysis, a method of peptizing an alkali metal silicate or a method of bringing an alkali metal silicate into contact with an acid-form cation exchange resin.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">The silicate may be an alkali metal silicate such as sodium silicate or potassium silicate, a quaternary ammonium silicate such as ammonium silicate or tetraethylammonium silicate, or a silicate of an amine such as ethanolamine.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">Further, the alkoxysilane may be ethyl silicate, an alkoxysilane containing a fluorinated functional group such as a perfluoropolyether group and/or a perfluoroalkyl group, or an alkoxysilane containing one or more functional groups selected from a vinyl group and an epoxy group. The alkoxysilane containing a perfluoropolyether group may, for example, be perfluoropolyether triethoxysilane; the alkoxysilane containing a perfluoroalkyl group may, for example, be perfluoroethyl triethoxysilane; the alkoxysilane containing a vinyl group may, for example, be vinyl trimethoxysilane or vinyl triethoxysilane; and the alkoxysilane containing an epoxy group may, for example, be 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyl trimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl methyldiethoxysilane or 3-glycidoxypropyl triethoxysilane.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">(Dispersion Medium, Solid Content Concentration, etc.)</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">In production of the dispersion of core/shell fine particles, the dispersion medium in which the core fine ZnO particles are dispersed and in which the decomposition reaction of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor is carried out, is basically water and/or an organic solvent such as an alcohol, a ketone, an ester, an ether, a glycol ether, a nitrogen-containing compound or a sulfur-containing compound which has been described in detail as the dispersion medium for ZnO. However, presence of water is essential in step of hydrolysis/polycondensation/shell formation of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor, and accordingly, it is necessary that water in an amount of preferably from 5 to 100 mass % is contained in the entire solvent. If the water content is less than 5 mass %, the reaction will not sufficiently proceed. It is necessary that water at least in a stoichiometric amount or more is present in the system based on the amount of Si in the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor in the dispersion medium.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">Further, in production of the dispersion of core/shell fine particles, the solid content concentration is preferably within a range of at most 30 mass % and at least 0.1 mass %, more preferably within a range of at most 20 mass % and at least 1 mass %. If it exceeds 30 mass %, stability of the dispersion of fine particles tends to decrease, and if it is less than 0.1 mass %, productivity of the hollow SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles tends to be very low.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">(b) (Dissolution of Core Fine ZnO Particles/Use of Acidic Ion Exchange Resin)</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">Now, step (b) of dissolving the fine ZnO particles in the dispersion of core/shell fine particles to obtain a dispersion of hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">The fine ZnO particles become Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions at a pH of at most 8 and are dissolved in the dispersion, and in the present invention, one of characteristics is that the pH of the dispersion is adjusted to be within a range of from 2 to 8, preferably from 2 to 6 by using an acidic cation exchange resin. The eluted Zn<sup>2+</sup> are exchanged with H<sup>+</sup> and fixed on a resin as described hereinafter, whereby ZnO is dissolved without suddenly increasing the ionic strength in the solution. Whereas, if the pH is adjusted to be 8 or below with an acid as in a conventional method, the ionic strength in the solution suddenly increases by ions generated by addition of the acid and the eluted Zn<sup>2+</sup>, whereby the hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles are likely to be agglomerated in an uncontrollable state.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">(Acidic Cation Exchange Resin)</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">The acidic cation exchange resin is preferably an acidic cation exchange resin at least in which ZnO is soluble, which is capable of adjusting the pH of the dispersion to be at least 2 and at most 8, preferably at least 2 and at most 6. The acidity of the cation exchange resin is determined by the functional group, and the functional group may be a &#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>H group in the case of a strongly acidic cation exchange resin and a &#x2014;COOH group in the case of a weakly acidic cation exchange resin, but in the present invention, it is preferred to use a highly acidic cation exchange resin having higher capability of dissolving the fine ZnO particles. If the pH is less than 2, the handling tends to be difficult, and such a cation exchange resin may be harmful to the human body.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">A strongly acidic cation exchange resin is a resin having a composition comprising sulfonic acid groups introduced as exchange groups to a crosslinked polystyrene as mentioned above, and ZnO as the core of the core/shell fine particles is dissolved by the resin as follows.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0047">As mentioned above, by use of a sulfonic acid type highly acidic cation exchange resin, ZnO can be dissolved without increasing the ionic strength in the solution.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">(Exchange Capacity, Surface Area, Particle Size, etc. of Resin)</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">The amount of the acidic cation exchange resin to be added is preferably such that the total exchange capacity is larger than at least the amount of Zn<sup>2+</sup> generated. Namely, specifically, at least the acidic cation exchange resin in such an amount that all basic ions present in the solution and Zn<sup>2+</sup> generated by dissolution of the ZnO core can be exchanged, is required. If the amount of Zn<sup>2+</sup> generated is larger than the total exchange capacity, the fine ZnO particles will not completely be dissolved but remain in the center portion of the hollow particles, whereby the antireflection properties will be insufficient. The amount of the resin is preferably within a range of from 1.1 to 5 times the required amount. The larger the amount of the acidic cation exchange resin, the higher the dissolution rate of the core, such being favorable, but if the resin amount is too large and it is in excess of 5 times, no higher effect can be expected, and stirring may be difficult, such being unfavorable.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">With respect to the cation exchange resin, the larger the surface area, the larger the area of contact with ions, whereby the dissolution rate of ZnO as the core tends to be high. Therefore, the cation exchange resin is preferably one having a large surface area such as a porous type or a highly porous type rather than a gel type. The ZnO dissolution rate is high when the intraparticle diffusion rate of the cation exchange resin is high (low degree of crosslinking) and when the particle size is small. Therefore, it is possible to optimally adjusting the rate of dissolution of ZnO by properly selecting such physical properties.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">For example, with respect to the particle size, considering that the smaller the particle size of the cation exchange resin, the larger the surface area and the more the area of contact with ions increases, thus increasing the core dissolution rate, specifically, it is preferred to use a cation exchange resin of 10 to 50 mesh.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">With respect to the temperature conditions when the ZnO core is dissolved, the dissolution reaction basically proceeds even at room temperature. Further, the temperature is preferably higher, whereby the dissolution reaction and the rate of diffusion of dissolved ions or the like tend to increase, thus increasing the core dissolution rate. However, if the temperature is too high, the properties of the cation exchange resin may be deteriorated, or the rate of volatilization of the dispersion medium to be used is no more negligible, and accordingly, the temperature is usually from 10 to 100&#xb0; C., preferably from about 20 to about 80&#xb0; C.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0053">Finally, step (c) of separating the cation exchange resin by solid-liquid separation such as filtration after the fine ZnO particles are completely dissolved, to obtain the dispersion of hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles, is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">In a conventional method of adding an acid to dissolve the core fine particles, ions generated by dissolution of the core must be removed by a method which requires a long time, such as ultrafiltration. However, by the method of using a cation exchange resin as in the present invention, Zn ions generated by dissolution of ZnO as the core are adsorbed on the cation exchange resin, and accordingly only the cation exchange resin is separated from the dispersion of hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles by solid-liquid separation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">The solid-liquid separation may, specifically, be any unit operation used in conventional chemical engineering, so long as only particles of the cation exchange resin can be separated while the hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles as very fine particles are dispersed in the liquid. Particularly in the present invention, since the particle size of the cation exchange resin is overwhelmingly large as compared with the particle size of the fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles, they are very different in the sedimentation rate, whereby they can easily be separated by sedimentation. Further, it is possible to easily separate them using a filter having an appropriate pore size through which only the fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles pass but no cation exchange resin particles pass, utilizing the particle size difference. The simplest means is a method of removing the cation exchange resin using a filter vapor as the filter, whereby the dispersion of hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles is easily obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">(Properties of Hollow Fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>Particles and Dispersion)</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">In the present invention, hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles are obtained in the form of their dispersion as mentioned above, and the dispersion of fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles may be either a dispersion of monodispersed particles or a dispersion of agglomerates, preferably a dispersion of agglomerated particles. Further, the shape of particles is also not particularly limited, and one member or a mixture of two or more selected from spheres, rods, tubes and sheets may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">The average agglomerated particle size of agglomerated particles in the dispersion of hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles is preferably within a range of from 60 to 400 nm. When it is at least 60 nm, antireflection properties of the resulting coating film will be sufficient, and when it is at most 400 nm, transparency of the coating film will be sufficient. Further, the average primary particle size of the hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles is from 5 to 200 nm, more preferably from 10 to 100 nm. If it is less than 5 nm, antireflection properties of the coating film may be insufficient, and if it exceeds 200 nm, transparency of the coating film may be insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">Further, the thickness of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>shell is preferably within the range of from 1 to 20 nm and from one-fifth to one-third of the average primary particle size of the fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles. If the thickness of the shell is less than 1 nm and less than one-fifth of the average primary particle size, the hollow shape cannot be kept when the fine ZnO particles are dissolved, and if the thickness exceeds 20 nm and exceeds one-third of the average primary particle size, transparency of the coating film containing the hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles tends to be insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">The SiO<sub>2 </sub>shell preferably has a porous structure penetrating through the shell wall, since in a step of removing ZnO as the core by dissolution, the ionized core should be discharged to the outside of the particles through the SiO<sub>2 </sub>shell. The size of the pore is preferably within a range of from about 0.2 to about 10 nm which is sufficiently larger than the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ionic radius of from 0.74 to 0.88 &#x212b;. If the pore size is so large as larger than 10 nm, when a coating composition containing such a dispersion of hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles is formed, the binder component in the coating composition may infiltrate through the pores, thus decreasing the antireflection properties.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">Such a porous structure is required in the step of removing the core by dissolution, and is not necessarily required in the subsequent operations, and accordingly after the core is dissolved, the dispersion of hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles may be heated at about 100 to about 300&#xb0; C. in an autoclave to accelerate hydrolysis and polycondensation reaction of the silicon compound to make it non-porous.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">As described above, as a solvent of the dispersion of the hollow fine SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles, the solvent used in the step of hydrolysis/polycondensation of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>precursor is preferably used as it is. That is, water or an organic solvent such as an alcohol, a ketone, an ester, an ether, a glycol ether, a nitrogen-containing compound or a sulfur-containing compound may be used. Further, if desired, water may be removed by means of e.g. azeotropic distillation from the solvent so that substantially only an organic solvent is contained, or the organic solvent is removed so that only water or an aqueous solvent is contained.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0078">Further, it is preferred to adjust the thickness of the antireflection coating film to be obtained by the present invention so that the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm becomes minimum. The thickness can be adjusted in accordance with the thickness=&#x3bb;/4n (wherein &#x3bb; is the wavelength of light and n is the refractive index of the film).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">The transparency of the coating film is preferably evaluated by the haze in accordance with JIS K-7150 standard. The haze of the coating film is preferably at most 1%, particularly preferably at most 0.5%. If the haze exceeds 1%, the transmittance tends to be low, thus leading to poor transparency.</p>
