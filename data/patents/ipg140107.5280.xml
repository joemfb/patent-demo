<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to controlling heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many modern automotive vehicles now operate at times on battery power, either fully or partially. Since the range of a vehicle on battery power is generally much less than a conventional vehicle operated with a gasoline or diesel engine, the drain on the battery from particular vehicle systems becomes more significant. For example, in battery electric vehicles, extended range electric vehicles and some types of hybrid electric vehicles, the HVAC system can consume as much power as the average load on the traction motor on cold days. The HVAC cooling load can also be quite high on hot days. Either way, the drain on the battery from the HVAC load can significantly shorten the range the vehicle can travel on battery power. Thus, it is desirable to increase the electric driving range by decreasing the vehicle electrical loads where possible, without sacrificing occupant comfort and conveniences.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An embodiment contemplates a method of increasing a range of a vehicle by decreasing trapped HVAC energy at an end of a trip, the method comprising the steps of: determining a destination list based on locations where the vehicle may be parked in the future, the destination list accessible by a control module in the vehicle; determining HVAC reduction regions around each of the locations on the destination list, the HVAC reduction regions accessible by the control module; operating a HVAC system while the vehicle is moving; tracking the location of the vehicle relative to the locations on the destination list; and the control module automatically reducing the energy usage of the HVAC system when the vehicle enters one of the HVAC reduction regions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An advantage of an embodiment is that the range of a vehicle operating on battery power can be extended by reducing power consumed by the HVAC system, while preserving thermal comfort for the vehicle occupants. Energy already in the HVAC system can be used near the end of a trip to provide heating or cooling, thus minimizing thermal energy trapped in the HVAC system when the vehicle arrives at a destination. This can also be applied to a more conventional vehicle using a gasoline or diesel engine, where the refrigerant compressor operation may be terminated before arriving at a destination. The slight decrease in HVAC performance near the end of a trip may be minimal on the vehicle occupants since the vehicle will have already been conditioned during the most of the trip. The HVAC operation can be modified with respect to programmed destinations, learned destinations or both. The destinations and vehicle location can be tracked via a navigation system, OnStar&#x2122;, or other types of systems that can be employed to track the particular location of the vehicle.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a portion of a vehicle <b>20</b> is shown schematically. The vehicle <b>20</b> may include an electric motor <b>22</b> that may provide torque to vehicle wheels <b>24</b> and be powered by a battery <b>26</b>. The vehicle may also include a power plant <b>28</b> that provides torque to the vehicle wheels or charges the battery <b>26</b> or both. The power plant <b>28</b> may be, for example, an internal combustion engine or a fuel cell. Alternatively, the vehicle <b>20</b> may not include a power plant <b>28</b>, or may include a power plant such as an internal combustion engine without employing a motor to provide torque to the wheels <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One or more control module(s) <b>30</b> may be employed to communicate with and control the various vehicle systems. The control modules may be made up of various types of electronic hardware and software as is known to those skilled in the art. The control module <b>30</b> is in communication with a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system <b>32</b> and can control the operation of this system <b>32</b>. The control module <b>30</b> may also be in communication with a navigation system <b>34</b> and/or another type of electronic system, such as, for example, an OnStar&#x2122; system <b>36</b>. Generally, the control module <b>30</b> is in communication with some type of system that can track the location of the vehicle <b>20</b>. This may use, for example, Global Positioning System (GPS), cell towers and/or some other means to determine the location of the vehicle. The control module <b>30</b> may also be in communication with various sensors. Such sensors may include, for example, an odometer <b>38</b> for measuring the distance the vehicle <b>20</b> travels, an external temperature sensor <b>40</b> for measuring ambient temperature around the vehicle <b>20</b>, a sun load sensor <b>42</b> for measuring the sun load on the vehicle <b>20</b>, and an internal temperature sensor <b>44</b> for measuring temperature inside a passenger compartment, among others known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a schematic view of a road system <b>100</b>, with various roadways that one may travel in the vehicle. The control module stores the locations that may be significant relative to the HVAC control. Alternatively, the locations may be stored remotely, but with a communication system that allows the control module to access the information. For example, recent battery charging locations <b>102</b>, indicated by a star shape on the map, may be sites that are stored in the control module on a destination list. Recent parking locations <b>104</b>, indicated by an octagonal shape on the map, may be sites that are stored in the control module on the destination list. Rules may be set for when a vehicle stopping is considered a parking location <b>104</b>. For example, the vehicle may have to be turned off for a minimum amount of time (measured in minutes or hours) for the vehicle stoppage to be considered a parking location <b>104</b>. Long term parking locations <b>106</b>, indicated by a triangle on the map, may be sites that are stored in the control module on the destination list. The long term parking location <b>106</b> may be set only when the vehicle has remained at that location for a long time, for example at least several days, before it is considered long term parking. In addition, programmed addresses <b>108</b>, indicated by diamond shapes on the map, may be sites that are programmed onto the destination list by the vehicle operator. This allows the vehicle operator to set locations where reduced HVAC use is acceptable without having to remember to adjust the HVAC system while one is operating the vehicle. The destination list may be set up such that some sites drop off the list after a certain amount of time. That way sites that are not visited regularly (or ever again) may be eliminated from the list, leaving the most relevant on the list. Although, programmed addresses may stay on the list, while only learned destinations are those that drop off the list.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The dashed, generally circular regions <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are regions for reduced HVAC use. That is, when the vehicle enters in these regions <b>110</b>, the energy used for heating (or air conditioning) is substantially reduced or eliminated (under certain circumstances). The diameter of the circle for these regions <b>110</b> may be a predetermined distance&#x2014;for example, a radius of about three kilometers. In addition, the predetermined distance may be varied based on various factors related to the climate around and in the vehicle. For example, if the air conditioning is running and the ambient temperature is quite high and/or the sun load is quite high, then the predetermined distance may be reduced since the vehicle interior will heat up much more rapidly. Of course, if the opposite is true, then the predetermined distance may be increased in order to achieve even greater energy savings. In addition, the difference between the actual passenger compartment temperature and the temperature requested by the vehicle occupants (the set point), may be a factor in adjusting the predetermined distance for the particular HVAC reduction region <b>110</b>. Rather than adjusting the predetermined distance, or in addition to this, the amount of reduction in the HVAC operation may be adjusted to account for the different ambient conditions. In addition, the HVAC reduction region size may be based on expected travel time to the location rather than distance from the location.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will now be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. After the vehicle <b>20</b> and HVAC system <b>32</b> are started, block <b>200</b>, a trip odometer is started, block <b>202</b>. Alternatively, a timer may be started for block <b>202</b>. A determination is made whether the trip odometer has passed an enable distance, block <b>204</b>. Alternatively, a determination is made whether the timer has passed an enable time, block <b>204</b>. This distance or time may be predetermined based on a distance or time that is needed to heat or cool the vehicle interior. This predetermined distance or time may also be increased or decreased based on ambient conditions around the vehicle <b>20</b>, with very high or very low temperatures increasing the predetermined time/distance.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">If the vehicle has not passed the enable distance (or time), then the check is repeated. If it has, then a determination is made whether the vehicle <b>20</b> is within a HVAC reduction region <b>110</b>, block <b>208</b>. If not, then the HVAC system continues with normal HVAC operation, block <b>206</b>. If it is, then the control module <b>30</b> changes the HVAC system <b>32</b> into a power saving (or off) mode. Thus, with the vehicle <b>20</b> within a predetermined distance/time of a possible stopping site, the energy used for HVAC operation is reduced. The operation then checks again to determine if the vehicle <b>20</b> is still within one of the HVAC reduction regions, block <b>208</b>. If it is not still in one of the regions <b>110</b>, then normal HVAC operation is resumed, block <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which will now be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, illustrates a method for learning destinations <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> that may be added to a destination list, creating new (or replacing old) HVAC reduction regions <b>110</b>. When the vehicle <b>20</b> is started, block <b>248</b>, a determination is made as to whether the vehicle has been stationary sufficiently long to be considered a parking location <b>104</b>, block <b>250</b>. This determination may also take into account if the vehicle <b>20</b> was charged at this location. Alternatively, there may be no minimum amount of time and the location may be considered a parking location <b>104</b> if, for example, the vehicle is turned off, the driver's door is opened, or the driver's seat is unoccupied.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">If not, then the location is not added to the destination list. If it is stationary for at least a predetermined time or meets other criteria sufficient to be considered a parking location <b>104</b> (or is a charging location <b>102</b>), then a determination is made whether this location is currently on the destination list, block <b>252</b>. If it is, then no addition is needed. Alternatively, this location may be moved up the list to show that it was a recent HVAC reduction location so that it does not drop from the destination list as new locations are added. If the location is not on the destination list, then it is added to the list, block <b>254</b>. A HVAC reduction region <b>110</b> is then added around this new destination location.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For block <b>250</b>, the determination may also include other criteria for determining when a parking location <b>104</b> should be added to the destination list. For example, the particular location may be added to the list only after the vehicle <b>20</b> has been parked at this location two or more times. There may also be a general error factor, so that the vehicle does not have to be parked in exactly the same parking space to be considered the same parking location <b>104</b>. For example, different parking spaces in a mall parking lot. Other criteria can be set for determining when a particular site should be added to the destination list, which determines where HVAC reduction regions <b>110</b> will be located. Of course these learned locations may be in addition to locations programmed onto the destination list by the vehicle operator.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As an alternative, for sites on the destination list, the route taken to get to the destination and the time of day and day of week the vehicle went to that particular site may be tracked as well. The probability of going to a particular destination on the list may be calculated based on not only the distance to that particular site but also on the route taken, time of day and day of the week. If the probability of going to a particular site on the destination list is below a predetermined threshold, then, even though the vehicle enters the HVAC reduction region for that site, the control module may not switch the HVAC system to a power reduction mode.</p>
