<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed is a high-swing voltage-mode transmitter or line driver. The transmitter can operate over a wide range of supply voltages. Increasing the available output swing merely involves increasing the supply voltage; the circuit adapts to maintain the desired output impedance. This allows for a tradeoff between output amplitude and power consumption. Another advantage of the proposed architecture is that it compensates for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) and mismatch variations so as to keep rise and fall times matched. This feature reduces common-mode noise and hence electromagnetic interference in systems in which the transmitter is used.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention generally relates to electronics. In particular, the invention relates to wired transmitters or line drivers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The bandwidth requirements of networking and high-performance processing applications have been projected to continue to increase into the tens of giga bits per second (Gb/s) rates. For example, with reference to serial attached SCSI (SAS) standard, the SAS-2.0 standard defines the maximum data rate as 6 Gb/s, with 12 Gb/s slated to follow in the upcoming SAS-3.0 standard.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One of the limiting factors for high-speed serial links is the band-limited response of the transmission medium (or channel) which causes increasing signal attenuation at high frequencies. In addition, residual low-frequency signal energy from adjacent symbols can cause inter-symbol-interference (ISI), which can corrupt the &#x201c;data eye&#x201d; and lead to a reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). ISI-induced SNR degradation can be effectively improved by various channel equalization techniques. More specifically, equalizers commonly compensate for the band-limited response by either de-emphasizing low-frequency power at the transmitter or amplifying high-frequency power at the receiver, both of which are limited by transmitted signal power reduction and receiver noise amplification, respectively. It has been demonstrated that combining transmitter and receiver equalizations can compensate up to 20-30 decibels (dB) of attenuation at the Nyquist frequency. See, for example, M. Meghelli, et al., A 10 Gb/s 5-Tap-DFE/4-Tap-FFE transceiver in 90 nm CMOS, in IEEE ISSCC Dig. Tech. Papers, February 2007, pp. 80-81 and R. Payne, et al., A 6.25-Gb/s binary transceiver in 0.13-&#x3bc;m MOS for serial data transmission across high loss legacy backplane channels, IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, vol. 40, no. 12, pp. 2646-2657, December 2005.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In future serial-link systems with data rates higher than currently used, the amount of attenuation at the Nyquist frequency could be worse than 30 dB because of (a) legacy backplanes that were not intended for use with the higher signaling frequency and/or (b) less appreciable improvements in the construction of the channel and its materials. See, for example, J Kim et al., A large-swing transformer-boosted serial link transmitter with &#x3e;VDD swing, IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, vol. 42, no. 5, pp. 1131-1142, May 2007. For some systems, one solution for maintaining sufficient SNR at the receiver is to increase the signal power by transmitting relatively large voltage swings.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In high-speed data transmission, current-mode-logic (CML) style transmitters are frequently employed because they support high data rates and have an inherently low susceptibility to power supply noise. These advantages, however, come along with some drawbacks, such as relatively high static power consumption, headroom problems due to the lower supply voltage in newer technologies, and the inability to support different DC termination voltages as the output of the CML circuit is generally referenced to one of the two power supply rails.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Voltage-mode transmitters overcome these disadvantages with a CMOS-oriented design style, supporting many different termination voltages. Other advantages of the voltage-mode type of transmitter include its potential for low-power operation (for a given output swing, a voltage-mode driver with a differential RX termination enables a potential <b>4</b> fold reduction in drive power compared to a CML driver), and good technology scaling due to the high relative content of digital circuitry versus analog circuitry. These factors make voltage-mode transmitters particularly suitable for multi-standard I/O applications.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As discussed above, some standards call for larger vertical eye openings (that is, higher launch amplitude). Equation 1 expresses a typical maximum output amplitude of a voltage-mode transmitter as a function of various parameters.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In Equation 1, the voltage V<sub>Odiff </sub>corresponds to the peak-to-peak differential output voltage, the voltage AVD corresponds to the supply voltage of the output driver, the resistance R<sub>L </sub>corresponds to the load impedance, such as, but not limited to 100 ohms (&#x3a9;), and the resistance R<sub>Odiff </sub>corresponds to the output impedance of the voltage-mode transmitter.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to Equation 1, an increase in the launch amplitude of a voltage-mode driver can be can be accomplished in two different ways for a constant load impedance: 1) the value of the resistance R<sub>Odiff </sub>can be reduced, to some extent, by trading off a degraded return loss, or 2) the supply voltage AVD can be raised from the typical 0.9-1.0 V limit used for thin-oxide FETs in 40 nm technology to a value of 1.5 V or even higher. The second option can be used when output swing should be increased more that what the R<sub>Odiff</sub>/return loss tradeoff can provide. This creates new design constraints, such as the desirability to interface a high-voltage output driver to a low-voltage pre-driver. Electrical overstress (EOS) should also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">One problem that can occur with voltage-mode transmitters is electromagnetic interference (EMI). EMI can be a difficult issue to resolve. EMI compliance requirements are seldom overlooked by product engineering in the specification phase, and EMI compliance is often considered only as an afterthought. EMI requirements typically cannot be waived. EMI compliance difficulties can lead to very expensive last minute shielding solutions or to expensive redesigns.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the invention advantageously address EMI. By tuning pull-up and/or pull-down resistances, rise and fall times of a non-inverting portion and an inverting portion of a differential signal can be well matched to reduce EMI. A higher launch amplitude enables the use of more equalization to compensate for printed circuit board (PCB) and transmission channel losses. Cheaper PCB materials or longer PCB traces can therefore be supported over lower launch amplitude transmitters. Likewise, longer channels can be supported for improved rack-to-rack connectivity.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Although particular embodiments are described herein, other embodiments of the invention, including embodiments that do not provide all of the benefits and features set forth herein, will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this description, reference is made to the drawings in which like reference numerals indicate identical or functionally similar elements.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The field-effect transistors (FETs) or &#x201c;transistors&#x201d; described herein can correspond to transistors known as metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). While the terms &#x201c;metal&#x201d; and &#x201c;oxide&#x201d; are present in the name of a MOSFET device, it will be understood that these transistors can have gates made out of materials other than metals, such as polysilicon, and that the dielectric oxide region can also be implemented not just with silicon dioxide, but with other dielectrics, such as high-k dielectrics. For example, reference in the description is made to &#x201c;thin oxide&#x201d; and to &#x201c;thick oxide,&#x201d; and it will be understood that these regions can be implemented with materials other than silicon dioxide.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Companies that integrate point-to-point links typically instantiate many channels in parallel. The presence of more channels results in more EMI radiated, which can cause errors during data transmission. Those companies therefore set tight EMI specifications and keep a close eye on the amount of common-mode noise generated by the transmitter. A transmitter generating too much common-mode noise can make the overall system fail an EMI specification. It can therefore be desirable to keep common-mode noise low over PVT variations, especially for relatively large output swings.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">One source of EMI occurs in the context of transmission of differential signals. Examples of high-speed serial interfaces currently in use are high speed USB, XAUI, Fiber-channel, Infiniband, serial ATA (SATA), serial attached SCSI (SAS), Gigabit Ethernet, SFP, XFI, and the like. These high-speed interfaces typically start from half a Gigabit per second (Gb/sec) and are now offering more than 10 Gb/sec data rates, with future information rates of over the 25 Gb/s, even 40 Gb/sec on a single high-speed input/output device (HSIO), such as a serializer/deserializer (SERDES). These interfaces use differential signal lines to carry high-speed digital data.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Differential signaling has several advantages over single-ended signaling. A differential signal is carried with two conductors to convey the signal from the transmitter to the receiver. When received at the receiver, the signal is more immune to noise as noise sources tend to affect both conductors carrying the signal in a similar fashion. While a receiver can reject the common mode signal on a pair of signal lines, radiation of the common mode signal can cause EMI.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Mismatches in rise and fall times are a problem for high speed transmitters. Mismatches in the rise and fall time give rise to high common mode signals, which results in EMI. See, for example, commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/627,345, filed Nov. 30, 2009, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. Techniques disclosed herein can improve the matching of the rise and fall times of differential signals, thereby reducing common mode signals and advantageously reducing EMI.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The positive-logic portion <b>102</b> receives an inverted input signal INN&#x2032; and generates a positive-logic output signal TXOP.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a conventional voltage-mode transmitter for high-swing applications. Again, the positive-logic portion <b>142</b> and the negative-logic portion <b>144</b> are identical to each other, save for the connections. In connection with the positive-logic portion <b>142</b>, to increase the voltage swing over the configuration illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>A<b>1</b>, a PMOS transistor <b>146</b> and a NMOS transistor <b>148</b> have thicker oxide regions than the PMOS transistor <b>114</b> and the NMOS transistor <b>116</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>A<b>1</b>) for higher voltage handling capability. The greater oxide thickness is illustrated in the drawing by a thick line from drain to source. In one example, with thin oxide FETs of 40 nanometer (nm) technology, the typical supply voltage limit is around 0.9 volts. With thicker oxide regions, a FET can handle higher voltages, such as around 1.5 volts, 1.8 volts, etc. In the illustrated embodiments, the general digital logic circuits with thin oxide FETs are powered from a supply voltage AVD, and the thicker oxide FETs are powered from a supply voltage AVDH, which is higher than the supply voltage AVD. In one example, general digital logic circuits can be supplied with 0.9 volts for digital supply AVD, and a supply voltage AVDH or voltage reference of 1.8 volts, intended for analog circuits, can be used for the PMOS transistor <b>146</b> and the NMOS transistor <b>148</b> of the high-swing voltage-mode transmitter to make the higher output swing possible. The sources of the PMOS transistors <b>146</b>, <b>156</b> are coupled to the supply voltage AVDH, and the sources of the NMOS transistors <b>148</b>, <b>158</b> are coupled to ground, which is indicated as AVS. Other voltage references than AVDH and AVS can alternatively be used. A level shifter <b>150</b> provides appropriate gate voltages to drive the PMOS transistor <b>146</b> and the NMOS transistor <b>148</b>. Conventional examples of the level shifter <b>150</b> will be described in greater detail later in connection with FIGS. <b>3</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>3</b>B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The negative-logic portion <b>144</b> includes a PMOS transistor <b>156</b>, an NMOS transistor <b>158</b>, a level shifter <b>160</b>, and the resistor <b>128</b>.

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Tunable Bias Level</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">FIG. <b>1</b>C<b>1</b> illustrates a top-level view of a high-swing voltage mode transmitter according to an embodiment of the invention. The transmitter includes pre-drivers <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, a tunable-output level shifter <b>170</b>, and an output driver. The pre-drivers <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> can be implemented as multiplexers (MUXes) as will be described later in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. While the illustrated pre-drivers <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> are shown as non-inverting buffers, inverters can alternatively be used with appropriate phase inversions elsewhere. Signals INN&#x2032;, INP&#x2032; are provided as inputs to the pre-drivers <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, which buffer the signals to generate the input signals INN, INP, which are functionally the same as the input signals INN&#x2032;, INP&#x2032; but are different voltage nodes. The positive-logic portion of the output driver includes a PMOS driver transistor <b>166</b>, an NMOS driver transistor <b>168</b>, and the termination resistor <b>118</b>. The negative-logic portion of the output driver includes a PMOS transistor <b>172</b>, an NMOS transistor <b>174</b>, and the resistor <b>128</b>. For high swing capability, the driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> are fabricated with thicker gate &#x201c;oxide&#x201d; regions than transistors used for digital circuits, such as for the pre-drivers <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>C<b>1</b>, the level shifter <b>170</b> has an input for a bias control. While conceptually illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>C<b>1</b> with a single line, the bias control can include more than one signal as will be described later in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. The conventional level shifters <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> described earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shifted drive levels to the driver transistors <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) from 0 to 0.9 volts to toggle between 0 and 1.8 volts for an amplitude of 1.8 volts, that is, with the amplitude of the analog supply voltage AVDH. In contrast, the level shifter <b>170</b> toggles the drive levels that vary with the bias control, which will be discussed later in connection with bias voltages VBN, VBP.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, for the case in which the analog supply voltage AVDH is about 1.8 volts, the level shifter <b>170</b> can toggle the drive level between about 1.8 volts and 0.9 volts for the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> and between about 0 and 0.9 volts for the NMOS driver transistors <b>168</b>, <b>174</b>. Advantageously, the drive level for the &#x201c;on&#x201d; condition (PMOS or NMOS transistor on, not necessarily logic state on) can be adjusted to change the &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance of the driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>174</b>. While the change in conductivity of a FET that is operating in the triode region is not as dramatic with gate voltage as it is for a FET that is operating in the saturation region, the gate voltage does have an effect on the &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance of a FET operating in the triode region.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">FIG. <b>1</b>C<b>2</b> illustrates a simplified model of the non-inverting portion of the transmitter illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> <b>1</b>. The model includes the pre-driver <b>162</b>, the level shifter <b>170</b>, a resistor R<sub>P </sub><b>176</b> modeling the PMOS driver transistor <b>166</b>, a resistor R<sub>N </sub><b>178</b> modeling the NMOS driver transistor <b>168</b>, the termination resistor R<sub>S</sub>, and the capacitor C. The termination resistor R<sub>S </sub>and the capacitor C are as described earlier in connection with FIG. <b>1</b>A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The resistor R<sub>P </sub><b>176</b> models the &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance of the PMOS driver transistor <b>166</b>, which corresponds to the pull-up resistance during operation. The resistor R<sub>N </sub><b>178</b> models the &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance of the NMOS driver transistor <b>168</b>, which corresponds to the pull-down resistance during operation. Typically, these two &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistances would not be on at the same time. As indicated by the slanted arrow within the resistors <b>176</b>, <b>178</b>, the &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistances are tunable. In a conventional voltage-mode transmitter such as the examples illustrated earlier in connection with FIGS. <b>1</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>A<b>2</b>, and <b>1</b>B, these &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistances are not controlled and can vary significantly over process, voltage, and temperature (PVT). Because the &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance can vary over PVT, this is likely to create a mismatch of the pull-up and pull-down strengths, which in turn is likely to create a mismatch of the rise and fall times, which results in EMI.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Embodiments of the invention permit the pull-up and pull-down resistances to be relatively well matched, which improves the matching of the rise and fall times, which improves EMI performance. With reference to FIG. <b>1</b>C<b>1</b>, it should be noted that it is the matching of the rise time of the TXOP signal with the fall time of the TXON signal, and the matching of the rise time of the TXON signal with the fall time of the TXOP signal that should be relatively well matched for low common mode generation and the resulting good EMI performance. However, the two PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>C<b>1</b> can be expected to track each other closely through PVT variations because they are identical to each other, and similarly, the two NMOS driver transistors <b>168</b>, <b>174</b> can also be expected to track each other closely through PVT variations. Good layout techniques will help keep good matching between the two PMOS (or NMOS) transistors. Accordingly, while the disclosed techniques match the rise and fall times within a driver for a single line TXOP or TXON, because of the matching of the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> and the NMOS driver transistors <b>168</b>, <b>174</b>, such techniques result in matching of the rise and fall times across the signals TXOP and TXON.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As will be explained later in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D</figref>, <b>3</b>C<b>1</b>, and <b>3</b>D<b>1</b>, a bias control input to the level shifter <b>170</b> indicates control of the &#x201c;on&#x201d; level of the data high positive logic signal DHP, data high negative logic signal DHN, data low positive logic signal DLP, and data low negative logic signal DLN from the level shifter <b>170</b> that drive the PMOS driver transistor <b>172</b>, the NMOS driver transistor <b>174</b>, the PMOS driver transistor <b>166</b>, and the NMOS driver transistor <b>168</b>, respectively. When &#x201c;on,&#x201d; at least one of the PMOS transistor or the NMOS transistors can be adjustably &#x201c;on&#x201d; within the triode region for control of at least one of rise or fall times such that rise and fall times match for relatively good EMI performance.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">FIG. <b>1</b>C<b>3</b> illustrates a top-level view of a high-swing voltage mode transmitter according to another embodiment of the invention. The embodiment illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>C<b>3</b> is identical to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>C<b>1</b> except that the termination resistors <b>118</b>, <b>128</b> are split into resistors <b>182</b>, <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>, <b>188</b>.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In yet another alternative embodiment, the transistors <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>C<b>1</b> or <b>1</b>C<b>3</b>) can be replaced with a cascoded output stage as will be explained later in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> illustrates a scalable high-swing transmitter with rise time and fall time mismatch compensation according to an embodiment of the invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the driver for the high-swing transmitter is implemented with N number of unit driver cells. The value for N can vary in a very wide range. In one embodiment, the number N corresponds to 48, but other values will be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, the N unit driver cells are each of the same scale. In other embodiments, the N unit driver cells can have at least two different scales, such as 8&#xd7;, 4&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, and 1&#xd7; cells. In addition, the N unit driver cells can be enabled/disabled individually and/or in groups.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A selected number, at least 1, of the N paralleled unit driver cells are enabled during operation. The number to be enabled depends on the desired output swing voltage. The higher the number of unit driver cells enabled, the lower the pull-up and pull-down resistances and the higher the output swing. Different cells can drive different patterns through the pre-drivers <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) so as to add de-emphasis. For more details on the voltage-mode transmitter structure, refer U.S. Pat. No. 7,501,851, which is incorporated by reference herein. For example, with reference to Equation 1, the resistance R<sub>Odiff </sub>can correspond approximately to the average of R<sub>P </sub>and R<sub>S </sub>and R<sub>N </sub>and R<sub>S</sub>, as illustrated in Equation 4, which can then be substituted into Equation 1 to estimate the voltage swing. In Equation 4, N corresponds to the number of cells.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the illustrated embodiment, a replica circuit <b>190</b> generates bias voltages VBP and VBN for control of the &#x201c;on&#x201d; levels of both the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> and the NMOS driver transistors <b>168</b>, <b>174</b>, and optionally generates AVD_REG_LS and AVS_REG_LS, which correspond to regulated voltages for power, which can be useful in combination with squelching as will be explained later in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. By control of the &#x201c;on&#x201d; levels, the pull-down resistance R<sub>P </sub>can be adjusted relative to pull-down resistance R<sub>N</sub>, which can then improve the matching between rise and fall times and improve EMI performance. In one embodiment, the pull-down resistance R<sub>P </sub>matches the pull-down resistance R<sub>N </sub>within 2%, thereby making the rise and fall times match within 2%. Other amounts of matching, such as, but not limited to 3%, 5%, and 10% will also be applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In alternative embodiments, fewer or additional bias voltages can be used. For example, in an alternative embodiment, one of the rise time or the fall time can be left alone, and the other adjusted to match.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">While described above with selection of the number of unit drivers being enabled being performed first and the bias levels for the relative resistance being adjusted later, the order of operation can be interchanged. For example, the relative amount of pull-up resistance R<sub>P </sub>versus pull-down resistance R<sub>N </sub>can be adjusted first, and then the number of unit driver cells selected later.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">By contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a conventional voltage-mode transmitter with impedance tuning banks See, for example, M. KOSSEL, A T-coil-enhanced 8.5 Gb/s high-swing SST transmitter in 65 nm bulk CMOS with &#x3c;&#x2212;16 dB return loss over 10 GHz bandwidth, IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, vol. 43, no. 12, pp. 2905-2920, December 2008. Rather than coupling the sources of a PMOS transistor <b>202</b> and an NMOS transistor <b>204</b> to voltage rails, additional transistors <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> are disposed in the power path between the PMOS transistor <b>202</b> and a first power rail, and between the NMOS transistor <b>204</b> and a second power rail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also illustrates an alternative configuration for termination resistors <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">By turning on a selected number of these additional transistors <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, the impedance at the output can be varied. One disadvantage of the conventional art is that the impedance can be varied only in discrete steps by activating or deactivating transistors <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. By contrast, in certain embodiments of the invention, the pull-up resistance R<sub>P </sub>and the pull-down resistance R<sub>N </sub>can be adjusted in an analog manner without having to resort to relatively discrete steps. Even when combined with control from a digital-to-analog converter, the step size can be smaller than that of activating or deactivating transistors <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. This can permit better matching of rise and fall times.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Transistors <b>350</b>, <b>370</b>, when disabled, eliminate the positive feedback of the cross coupled transistors <b>346</b>, <b>348</b> and transistors <b>366</b>, <b>368</b>, respectively. The positive feedback is useful in normal mode and in squelch mode because it helps maintain DHP/DHN and DLP/DLN differential. When in the disabled mode (DEN not asserted), on the other hand, the gates of the PMOS and NMOS transistors of the output driver should be pulled up and down, respectively, by a DC path, which will be discussed later in connection with another embodiment, so as to put the output driver in a high-impedance state. Having a state in which the data high signals DHP, DHN are equal to each other and the data low signals DLP, DLN are equal to each other is possible with the positive feedback killed, that is, with DEN=0.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Returning now to FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>1</b>, the first level shifter <b>340</b> is enabled when the enable signal DEN is high and disabled otherwise. When enabled, the third NMOS transistor <b>350</b> is on, and a node N<b>1</b> is biased approximately equal to the bias voltage VBP if the third NMOS transistor <b>350</b> is sized sufficiently large. When not enabled, the third NMOS transistor <b>350</b> is off, and the bias voltage VBP is not applied to the node N<b>1</b>. In an alternative embodiment wherein enabling is not used, the bias voltage VBP can be applied directly to the node N<b>1</b>. This bias voltage VBP is the voltage that is tuned to control the gate voltage of the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) to a particular level for control of their &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance. The tuning of the level VOL is illustrated by the double-headed arrow in the waveforms of FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>2</b>. The bias voltage VBN correspondingly can be adjusted to control the &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance of the NMOS driver transistors <b>168</b>, <b>174</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) as illustrated by the double-headed arrows in the waveforms of FIG. <b>3</b>D<b>2</b>. The following operational description assumes that the level shifters <b>340</b>, <b>360</b> are enabled. Operationally, at high speeds, the AC-coupled level shifter <b>340</b> can be simplified to the first coupling capacitor <b>342</b> and the second coupling capacitor <b>344</b>, which drive on or off the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). At high speeds, the transistors <b>346</b>, <b>348</b> do not operate fast enough to drive on or off the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>); rather, the signal is propagated through the AC coupled path. However, over a long time constant, the transistors <b>346</b>, <b>348</b> set the VOL voltage level (FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>2</b>) of the data high positive logic signal DHP and the data high negative logic signal DHN by providing a charging path for the capacitors <b>342</b>, <b>344</b>. For example, when the input signal INP is high, the input signal INN is low, and the enable switch <b>350</b> is on or enabled, the transistor <b>346</b> is on and provides a path for charging the capacitor <b>344</b> to the bias voltage VBP. When INN goes from low to high, DHN goes from the bias voltage VBP (the VOL level in FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>2</b>) to &#x201c;VBP+(coupling efficiency*AVD),&#x201d; which is the VOH level in FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>2</b>.&#x201d; Due to the parasitic capacitance in the path from the data high negative logic signal DHN to the bias voltage VBP and the drain-to-source resistance of the transistors <b>350</b>, <b>346</b>, it will typically take many cycles for the capacitor to charge to the bias voltage VBP. Given that transistors <b>346</b>, <b>348</b> are active devices and could potentially cause signal distortion and/or ISI, it is actually desirable to not have the transistors <b>346</b>, <b>348</b> play an effective role in driving the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) and instead, let the signals propagate through the AC paths undistorted. Given that transistors <b>346</b>, <b>348</b> only function to set the level VOL, in one embodiment, the transistors <b>346</b>, <b>348</b> can be as small as practical so as to minimize parasitic effects on the data high signals DHP, DLH and to improve coupling efficiency. For example, the transistors <b>346</b>, <b>348</b> can be the smallest geometry devices available under the fabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In one embodiment, a coupling efficiency of 80 to 90% can be used to have the voltage level VOH depicted in FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>2</b> sufficiently high so as to turn the PMOS transistor of the driver stage sufficiently off. Likewise, a relatively good coupling efficiency will assure that the voltage level VOL depicted in FIG. <b>3</b>D<b>2</b> is sufficiently low so as to turn the NMOS transistor of the driver stage sufficiently off. The amount of coupling efficiency used can depend on the threshold voltage of the transistors <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) used in the driver stage, which in turn depends on the process technology, for example, 40 nm, and the type of transistors (thin oxide vs. thick oxide). For example, with reference to Equation 6, a coupling efficiency of 90% can be obtained if the coupling capacitors <b>342</b>, <b>344</b>, <b>362</b>, <b>364</b> are about 9 times larger than the load capacitance on nodes carrying the signals DHN and DHP. Note that the load capacitance includes the parasitic capacitance of transistors <b>346</b>, <b>348</b>, <b>366</b>, <b>368</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b>, <b>1126</b>, <b>1128</b> (FIGS. <b>3</b>C<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>D<b>1</b>, <b>11</b>B) (hence the desirability for these transistors to be small), the routing capacitance from the level shifters <b>340</b>, <b>360</b> to the output stage transistors, and the gate capacitance of the output stage transistors <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>174</b>. For a coupling efficiency of 80%, the amount of coupling capacitance should be about 4 times larger than load capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">With the nodes N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b> clamped to the bias voltage VBP, VBN, respectively, by the enable switches <b>350</b>, <b>370</b>, the operation of the transistors <b>346</b>, <b>348</b>, <b>366</b>, <b>368</b> to control the VOL/VOH voltages for the data high signals DHP, DHN and the data low signals DLP, DLN will now be described. The order of operation is presented in the order of the positive logic output signal TXOP being asserted high, the positive logic output signal TXOP being asserted low, the negative logic output signal TXON being asserted high, and the negative logic output signal TXON being asserted low.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The positive logic output signal TXOP is asserted high as follows. With an input symbol transitions from a 0 to 1 such that the input signals INP, INN transition from (0,1) to (1,0), the following occurs with reference to the first level shifter <b>340</b>. The transition from 0 to 1 for the input signal INP is capacitively coupled via the first coupling capacitor <b>342</b> over to the data high positive logic signal DHP and to the gate of the first NMOS transistor <b>346</b>. This turns on the first NMOS transistor <b>346</b> and turns off the PMOS driver transistor <b>172</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), permitting the NMOS driver transistor <b>168</b> to control the negative logic output signal TXON. The input signal INN transitions from 1 to 0, and the capacitor <b>344</b> capacitively couples the transition to the data high negative logic signal DHN, which then turns on the PMOS driver transistor <b>166</b> to generate a &#x201c;high&#x201d; or &#x201c;1&#x201d; for the positive logic output signal TXOP. The level VOL of the data high negative logic signal DHN determines the on resistance of the PMOS driver transistor <b>166</b> when turned on to the triode region. The settling of the level VOL will now be discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Since the input signal INN transitions from 1 to 0, with logic state 0 being ground for the illustrated embodiment, the capacitor <b>344</b> then is momentarily connected between the data high negative logic signal DHN and ground. Returning to the first NMOS transistor <b>346</b> being on, by turning on the first NMOS transistor <b>346</b>, the data high negative logic signal DHN is momentarily connected to the bias voltage VBP through the following path: the first NMOS transistor <b>346</b>, to the node N<b>1</b>, and to third NMOS transistor <b>350</b>. Over time, the bias voltage VBP charges across the capacitor <b>344</b> and makes the level VOL (DHN) converge to the bias voltage VBP. Thus, the capacitor <b>344</b> can AC couple or capacitively couple over the input signal INN to the data high negative logic signal DHN with the VOL of the DHN signal (FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>2</b>) tunable for the desired on resistance for the driver transistor <b>166</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) by tuning of the bias level VBP.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the illustrated embodiment, the connection from the data high negative logic signal DHN to the bias voltage VBP is present only when a &#x2018;1&#x2019; is transmitted. At startup, depending on the initial charge across the capacitor <b>342</b>, VOL<sub>DHN </sub>might be far away from the bias voltage VBP, and it will typically take many bit periods for the two to converge given the small size of the first NMOS transistor <b>346</b> and its high on-resistance. Meanwhile, the data high negative logic signal DHN will toggle between VOH and VOL (due to the AC coupling cap) with VOL slowly converging to the bias voltage VBP. For example, in one embodiment, it can take on the order of a few microseconds for the VOL portion (FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>2</b>) to stabilize at the bias voltage VBP. The time it takes to stabilize can vary in a very broad range and will depend on various &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistances of the transistors, the parasitic capacitances involved, the data rate, and the bit pattern. If a feedback loop is used to set the bias voltage VBP, this settling time should be accounted for in the loop stability analysis. The corresponding transition from 1 to 0 for the input signal INN is capacitively coupled via the second coupling capacitor <b>344</b> to create a 1-0 transition on the data high negative logic signal DHN. The data high negative logic signal DHN is simultaneously pulled low through the first NMOS transistor <b>346</b>, the first node N<b>1</b>, and the third NMOS transistor <b>350</b>, as explained above, and through the second AC coupling capacitor <b>344</b>. Both paths work in parallel, with the pull-down path to the bias voltage VBP being configured to set the levels VOL<sub>DHN </sub>equal to the bias voltage VBP (with a long time constant), and the AC coupling capacitor being configured to couple the 0-1 and 1-0 transitions. Meanwhile, the second NMOS transistor <b>348</b> is off due to the 1-0 transition of the input signal INN and the data high negative logic signal DHN having toggled low. While the convergence of the level VOL (FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>2</b>) may be relatively slow, the switching of voltage via capacitively coupling across a capacitor occurs virtually instantaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">With the data high negative logic signal DHN low, the second NMOS transistor <b>348</b> is off and the pull-down path of the data high positive logic signal DHP, to the node N<b>1</b>, to the bias voltage VBP is disabled. In the illustrated embodiment, the high level state of the data high positive logic signal DHP is set by the AC-coupled path and can remain high since there is no discharge path for the charges (the pull-down path is off and the data high positive logic signal DHP is connected to the gate of the PMOS driver transistor <b>172</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). In addition, due to the conduction that occurs when the first NMOS transistor <b>346</b> is on, the second coupling capacitor <b>344</b> eventually charges to a voltage equal to the difference in voltage between (a) the bias voltage VBP and (b) the voltage for logic 0, which is typically 0 V, such that the voltage charged to is about VBP. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the second coupling capacitor <b>344</b> typically charges to the bias voltage VBP, which is then used for a subsequent cycle.</p>

The output drivers illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are in a cascoded configuration that is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The cascoded configuration can be used as an alternative to the CMOS-style thick-oxide driver described earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. There is an even number n transistors in series between ground (gnd) and nV<sub>DD</sub>. The value of n is typically 4, but other applicable values will be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. For the output stage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and for any high voltage design in a standard low voltage technology, one objective is to find the correct operating point so that the voltages across the terminals of the transistors are within the limits of the technology. This is called the transistor's safe operating region, in which breakdown mechanisms and hot carrier degradation are minimized. This should provide a reliable operation over the lifetime of the circuit. If the transistors operate outside of the safe region, electrical overstress (EOS) will occur, and the lifetime of the circuit will be degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Because it is built from thin-oxide devices, the cascoded output stage <b>402</b> may operate at higher speeds than a thick-oxide approach.

<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates multiplexed pre-drivers and various data paths for a high-swing transmitter. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the buffers within the pre-driver <b>162</b> are multiplexed so as to connect either one of MAIN or PE<b>1</b> to INP. If the MAIN input is some given signal, then the PE<b>1</b> input can be, for example, a delayed or advanced version of MAIN (and possibly inverted). By having different sub-cells drive different patterns on the output signals TXOP/TXON, an equalized output having pre-emphasis or de-emphasis can be generated. In addition, the strength of the drive provided by the pre-drivers can be adjusted as indicated in the drawing by the diagonal arrows. In one embodiment, three-state gate logic can be used to implement the multiplexing.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the output drivers <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> are shown as a block <b>502</b>, and the output drivers <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> are shown as a block <b>504</b> for clarity. A transmission gate <b>506</b> can optionally be included to keep the output impedance constant over various amplitude settings. The optional transmission gate <b>506</b> can maintain an impedance between the positive-logic output signal TXOP and the negative-logic output signal TXON when the transmitter is off.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">During operation, the various signal lines can be expected to be switching logic states. To illustrate the logic states along the data paths, bold signal lines indicate negative logic and normal signal lines indicate positive logic. Thus, bold signal lines can indicate one logic state (0 or 1) and the not bolded signal lines can indicate the opposite logic state (1 or 0). In addition, various letters A, B, C, and D appear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Examples of waveforms for the signal lines near the letter &#x201c;A&#x201d; are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the inputs to the level shifters <b>340</b>, <b>360</b> have an amplitude of 0.9 volts. The signal lines for &#x201c;B&#x201d; and &#x201c;C&#x201d; should appear to be the same except that they are inverted from one another. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> illustrates an example of waveforms for the signal lines near &#x201c;C.&#x201d; As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the outputs of the level shifters <b>340</b>, <b>360</b> have an amplitude of less than 0.9 volts.

<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> illustrates an example of waveforms for the signal lines near &#x201c;D.&#x201d; The level shifters <b>340</b>, <b>360</b> receive voltages bias VBP, VBN as control inputs. These bias voltages VBP, VBN can be generated by a replica circuit as will be described later in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. The bias voltage VBP sets the voltage VOL (voltage output low) of the signals DHP/DHN, which drive the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) of the output driver; and the bias voltage VBN sets the voltage VOH (voltage output high) of the signals DLP/DLN, which drive the NMOS driver transistors <b>168</b>, <b>174</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) of the output driver. By tuning the bias voltages VBP and VBN, which are used by the sub-cells of the transmitter, the &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistances can be adjusted and hence, the pull-up and the pull-down resistances can be matched over PVT. This results in well matched rise and fall times as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> and relatively low common-mode noise over PVT.</p>

<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As illustrated in Equation 8, the &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance R<sub>P </sub>varies as a function of the bias voltage VBP. Also, in Equation 8, V<sub>tp </sub>corresponds to the PMOS transistor threshold voltage, W to the width of the transistor, L to the length of the transistor, &#x3bc;<sub>p </sub>to the hole mobility, and C<sub>ox </sub>to the gate capacitance per unit area.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The pull-down resistance R<sub>N </sub>can be decreased by increasing the bias voltage VBN, whereas the pull-up resistance R<sub>P </sub>can be decreased by decreasing the bias voltage VBP. For reference, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates the driver portions described earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B-7D</figref> illustrate how the rise and fall times vary as a function of bias voltages VBP and VBN.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">If the bias voltage VBP is too high, then the pull-up resistance R<sub>P </sub>will be too large relative to the pull-down resistance R<sub>N</sub>. This would result in the conductivity of the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> being too weak relative to the conductivity of the NMOS driver transistors <b>168</b>, <b>174</b>, rise times being slower than fall times as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, and a common-mode noise profile with negative spikes <b>702</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">If the bias voltage VBP is too low, then the pull-up resistance R<sub>P </sub>will be too small relative to the pull-down resistance R<sub>N</sub>.

<p id="p-0145" num="0144">When the bias voltages VBP, VBN are set such that the pull-up resistance R<sub>P </sub>is about equal to the pull-down resistance R<sub>N</sub>, this equalizes the rise and fall times and reduces or minimizes common-mode noise thereby resulting in relatively good EMI performance. In addition, the bias voltages VBP, VBN can also be used to fine tune the output impedance of the transmitter as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. Tuning of the output impedance can be useful to reduce reflections in the system and to improve signal integrity. Tuning of the output impedance can also be used to boost output signal amplitude by, for example, reducing the output impedance from 100 ohms to 90 ohms as shown in the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. One way to tune the output impedance is by manipulating the optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b>, which will be described in further detail later in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. For example, by drawing more current than normally used in the optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b>, the output impedance of the drivers can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In a theoretical driver, the resistance of the pull-up and pull-down paths would be dominated by the corresponding series termination resistor, such as the termination resistor R<sub>S </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>), because the resistance of the switch FETs can be rather nonlinear and susceptible to process variations. However, from a practical point of view, to obtain a negligible resistance of the FETs in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; state, their widths would have to be large and consequently, the FETs would present a relatively high load capacitance for the pre-driver, which would be contrary to a design target of high-speed and low-power signaling.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In a transmitter architecture accordingly to an embodiment of the invention, it can be advantageous to keep the FETs <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> of the output driver relatively small because a capacitively-coupled level-shifter <b>170</b> sits in the signal path between the pre-drivers <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> and the output drivers <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>174</b>. Such a level-shifter can be sensitive to the load capacitance, which determines the coupling efficiency as described earlier in connection with Equation 6. In practice, a trade-off between the size of the switch FETs <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> and the series termination resistor R<sub>S </sub>is typically made to lower the load resistance at the cost of a slightly reduced accuracy of the pull-up/pull-down path resistance. The replica circuit to be discussed next compensates for the high variations on a FET's &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance over PVT. The replica circuit can also compensate for mismatch variations when it is used in a closed loop configuration.</p>

The first voltage reference <b>802</b> and the second voltage reference <b>818</b> can be implemented by a resistive divider off of the power supply voltage AVDH. Of course, the voltage dividers for both reference voltages can be generated from the same resistor tree. Other techniques of generating voltage references will be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, in alternative embodiments, the voltage references <b>802</b>, <b>818</b> can be adaptively adjusted to further tune initial values for the bias voltages VBP, VBN, and the single-loop replica circuit <b>800</b> operates to further adjust the bias voltages VBP, VBN over one or more PVT variations.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The single-loop replica circuit <b>800</b> operates as follows. A negative feedback loop exists from the output of the first operational amplifier <b>804</b>, through the PMOS replica transistor <b>806</b>, which inverts the signal, the first replica termination resistor R<sub>SR </sub><b>808</b>, and back to the non-inverting input of the first operational amplifier <b>804</b>. Via the feedback loop, the first operational amplifier <b>804</b> generates the bias voltage VBP such that the voltage at the node N<b>3</b> is about equal to the voltage at the inverting input of the first operational amplifier <b>804</b>. That bias voltage VBP is provided as an input to the level shifter <b>170</b>, <b>340</b> (FIGS. <b>1</b>D and <b>3</b>C<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Similarly, a negative feedback loop including the second operational amplifier <b>816</b> operates to generate the bias voltage VBN such that the voltage at the node N<b>4</b> is about the same as the voltage at the inverting input of the second operational amplifier <b>816</b>. That bias voltage VBN is provided as an input to the level shifter <b>170</b>, <b>360</b> (FIGS. <b>1</b>D and <b>3</b>D<b>1</b>). In the illustrated example, 0.45 volts is provided by the second voltage reference <b>818</b> to the inverting input of the second operational amplifier <b>816</b> and also appears at the node N<b>4</b>. Accordingly, the current through the path from the power supply voltage AVDH to AVS via the PMOS replica transistor <b>806</b>, the first replica termination resistor R<sub>SR </sub><b>808</b>, the replica far-end termination resistor <b>810</b>, the second replica termination resistor R<sub>SR </sub><b>812</b>, the NMOS replica transistor <b>814</b> should be equal to the voltage drop across the replica far-end termination resistor <b>810</b> divided by its resistance. In the illustrated embodiment, the DC current is thus 187.5 microamps (&#x3bc;A). Accordingly, the feedback loops operate to control the amount of &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance of the PMOS replica transistor <b>806</b> and of the NMOS replica transistor <b>814</b> to about 1.0 k&#x3a9; each, for a total pull up and pull down resistance of about 2.4 k&#x3a9; in the illustrated example. Of course, by selection of other values of reference voltages and other values of replica resistances, other values for the &#x201c;on&#x201d; resistance of the PMOS replica transistor <b>806</b> and of the NMOS replica transistor <b>814</b> will be applicable. Despite being subjected to variations over PVT, the feedback loops of the single-loop replica circuit <b>800</b> operate to provide appropriate values for the bias voltages VBP, VBN. In addition, one advantage of the single-loop replica circuit <b>800</b> is that it should consume a relatively small amount of chip area, and should accordingly be relatively inexpensive to implement.</p>

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In one embodiment, with the voltage reference VREF_TUNE output of the voltage reference <b>852</b> set to about half of the power supply voltage AVDH, the voltages of 0.9 volts and 1.8 volts are applicable for voltage reference VREF_TUNE and the power supply voltage AVDH, respectively, and the power supply voltage AVS is 0 volts. In one embodiment, the replica termination resistors <b>858</b>, <b>862</b>, <b>878</b>, <b>882</b> have about 1.4 k&#x3a9; of resistance. In one embodiment, each portion <b>860</b><i>a</i>, <b>860</b><i>b</i>, <b>880</b><i>a</i>, <b>880</b><i>b </i>of the replica far-end termination resistors <b>860</b>, <b>880</b> has about 2.4 k&#x3a9; of resistance, and each of the NMOS replica resistance <b>864</b> and the PMOS replica resistance <b>884</b> have about 1.0 k&#x3a9; of resistance. Assuming no contribution to the circuit operation from the optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b>, the operational amplifiers <b>854</b>, <b>874</b> operate to provide bias voltages VBP, VBN such that 0.9 volts appears at the nodes N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b> and such that 187.5 to of current flows through each of the PMOS replica transistor <b>856</b> and the NMOS replica transistor <b>876</b> through separate paths. With the voltage reference VREF_TUNE set to half of the power supply voltage, the bias voltages VBP, VBN are set such that the PMOS replica transistor <b>856</b> and the NMOS replica transistor <b>876</b> each have about 1.0 k&#x3a9; of resistance, and the pull-up resistance and the pull-down resistance contribution by the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) and the NMOS driver transistors <b>168</b>, <b>174</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), respectively, should be about the same, and EMI performance should be relatively good.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Should it be desired to tune the relative amounts of pull-up resistance and pull-down resistance, the voltage reference VREF_TUNE can be adjusted. An increase in the voltage reference VREF_TUNE lowers the bias voltage VBP, which in turn results in the PMOS replica transistor <b>856</b> being &#x201c;on&#x201d; with a lower resistance than previously and also results in the PMOS driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) switching &#x201c;on&#x201d; to a lower resistance when switched by the level shifter <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), <b>340</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>1</b>). As a result, the rise time should become shorter. Similarly, the same increase in the voltage reference VREF_TUNE lowers the bias voltage VBN, which in turn results in the NMOS replica transistor <b>876</b> being &#x201c;on&#x201d; with a higher resistance than previously and also results in the NMOS driver transistors <b>168</b>, <b>174</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) switching &#x201c;on&#x201d; to a higher resistance when switched by the level shifter <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), <b>360</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>1</b>). As a result, the fall time should become longer. Thus, when it is desired to shorten the rise time relative to the fall time, the voltage reference VREF_TUNE can be increased, which lowers the pull-up resistance relative to the pull-down resistance. Conversely, when it is desired to lengthen the rise time relative to the fall time, the voltage reference VREF_TUNE can be lowered, which raises the pull-up resistance relative to the pull-down resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">For example, without adjustment of the reference voltage VREF_TUNE, offsets and mismatches will make the pull-up and pull-down resistances slightly different, which in turn would cause a mismatch of the rise and fall times and hence common-mode noise, which generates EMI. In one hypothetical example, assume that the rise times are slightly faster than the fall times. In that situation, the common-mode voltage would be peaking up, as illustrated by the common-mode noise profile with positive spikes <b>704</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Because of the positive spikes on the common-mode signal, the average of the filtered common-mode signal avg(VCM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) will be slightly higher than midway between the voltage references AVDH, AVS that power the output drivers, which with 0 volts for the voltage reference AVS, should be the value of the voltage AVDH divided by two (midpoint value AVDH/2). In order to bring the average back down to the midpoint value AVDH/2, the voltage reference VREF_TUNE should be lowered. When the voltage reference VREF_TUNE is lowered, the inverting input of the first operational amplifier <b>854</b> becomes smaller than the positive input. This makes the first operational amplifier <b>854</b> increase its output voltage, which is the bias voltage VBP, which in turn increases the on-resistance of the PMOS replica transistor <b>856</b>. The larger PMOS resistance decreases the common-mode voltage of the PMOS replica transistor <b>856</b>, as well as that of the corresponding PMOS transmitter driver transistors <b>166</b>, <b>172</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). Meanwhile, lowering VREF_TUNE made the second operational amplifier <b>874</b> increase its output, which is the bias voltage VBN. A higher bias voltage VBN reduces the on-resistance of the NMOS replica transistor <b>876</b>, which pulls the common-mode voltage down. As illustrated in the foregoing, decreasing the reference voltage VREF_TUNE makes both the PMOS replica transistor <b>856</b> and the NMOS replica transistor <b>876</b> work in the same direction to pull the common-mode voltage back down to the midpoint value AVDH/2. For the case in which the rise times are slightly slower than the fall times, the negative peaks on the common-mode signal can result and an average that is slightly lower than the midpoint value AVDH/2 can result. In order to compensate for that situation, VREF_TUNE would typically be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Moreover, the voltage reference VREF_TUNE can either be adjusted in open loop or in closed loop. Note that the voltage reference VREF_TUNE can be an analog voltage that is controlled digitally using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). In open loop operation, for example, test equipment can sweep the DAC setting and monitor the filtered common-mode voltage avg(VCM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) during production or manufacturing test. The DAC setting that reduces or minimizes the difference between the average common-mode voltage VCM avg(VCM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) and the midpoint value AVDH/2 should be picked. In one embodiment, this setting is applied across all devices. In an alternative embodiment, EMI can be monitored and the DAC setting that reduces or minimizes EMI can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b> can be used to switch in and out other resistances in parallel with the replica far-end termination resistors <b>860</b>, <b>880</b>. While illustrated in connection with the two-loop replica circuit <b>850</b>, the principles of the optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b> are also applicable to the single-loop replica circuit <b>800</b>. Returning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, in one embodiment, N unit driver cells are arranged in parallel. During operation, a selected number of these N unit driver cells are enabled based on the desired output swing voltage. In one embodiment, the replica circuit <b>800</b>, <b>850</b> is optimized for operation with all N unit driver cells enabled, though of course, it can be optimized for other conditions, such as relatively few unit driver cells enabled. When optimized for all N unit driver cells in operation, but only relatively few unit driver cells are actually enabled, there can be a mismatch between the replica circuit <b>800</b>, <b>850</b> and the enabled sub-cells. One way to compensate for the mismatch is to include the optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b> and switch them on in parallel with the replica far-end termination resistors <b>860</b>, <b>880</b> when the number of enabled unit driver cells is low. This causes the operational amplifiers <b>854</b>, <b>874</b> to drive the replica transistors <b>856</b>, <b>876</b> &#x201c;on&#x201d; harder, that is, to pass more current, and provide more appropriate bias voltages VBP, VBN as a result. Of course, the optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b> can be activated in stages, or in other embodiments, can be in series with the feedback loops and controlled in the opposite manner as described for the illustrated paralleled embodiment. In addition, while illustrated in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b> can also be used with the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> or <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D. In an alternative embodiment, the function provided by the optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b> can be provided by current sources/sinks instead of resistors. The function of the optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b> is to push or pull an incremental current from the PMOS replica transistor <b>856</b> and the NMOS replica transistor <b>876</b> so that the total current drawn from the transistors of the replica is the same (adjusted for scale) as the current drawn from the transistors in the sub-cells as the output amplitude changes. If the currents are equal, then their drain-to-source voltages VDS will be equal, and the transistors in the replica will have their terminal characteristics (gate-to-source voltage VGS and drain-to-source voltage VDS) matched to the transistors of the sub-cells. Note that matching the gate-to-source voltage VGS is handled by the propagation of the bias voltages VBP, VBN to the sub-cells; the optional switchable replica resistors <b>890</b> takes care of matching the drain-to-source voltage VDS.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Further, the two-loop replica circuit <b>850</b> can be used in either open loop or in closed loop to find appropriate values for the bias voltages VBP, VBN. For example, in open loop, the reference voltage VREF_TUNE can be swept to find a value that is appropriate to reduce or minimize common-mode noise. The selected setting for the single reference voltage VREF_TUNE can be used across the various unit driver cells, such as across all the unit driver cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). In closed-loop operation, the voltage reference VREF_TUNE can be used as an actuator in a feedback loop; in one embodiment, a relatively good setting for the voltage reference VREF_TUNE can be found for each device or channel. A similar technique can be used for the single-loop replica circuit <b>800</b> and will be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0179" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is a chart that illustrates simulated EMI generation (vertical axis in dBmV) versus a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) setting (horizontal axis) that is used to control the voltage reference VREF_TUNE. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates how the EMI varies with the DAC setting. In this particular example, the optimum DAC setting is 8.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In the closed-loop configuration that will be described later in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the common-mode voltage is low-pass filtered on-chip to generate the filtered common-mode voltage avg(VCM). The feedback loop then uses the filtered common-mode signal avg(VCM) as an input to assess whether the voltage reference VREF_TUNE should be increased or decreased. If the filtered common-mode signal avg(VCM) is greater than the midpoint value AVDH/2 or the midpoint between the power supply voltages AVDH and AVS, then the voltage reference VREF_TUNE should be decreased. Else, it should be increased. The feedback loop can either be an analog loop or a digital loop. In an analog loop, an operational amplifier can compare the filtered common-mode voltage avg(VCM) to the midpoint value AVDH/2 and set the voltage reference VREF_TUNE so as to reduce or minimize their difference. Stability issues should be taken into considerations for the analog loop. With the digital loop, a comparator is used to compare the filtered common-mode voltage avg(VCM) to the midpoint value AVDH/2. If the filtered common-mode voltage avg(VCM) is greater than the midpoint value AVDH/2, then the comparator outputs a 1. Otherwise, it outputs a zero. A digital controller can then use the output of the comparator to converge to a relatively good voltage reference VREF_TUNE setting, such as an optimum voltage reference VREF_TUNE setting.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates laboratory results of AC common-mode (ACCM) noise (vertical axis in dBmV) versus a DAC setting (horizontal axis) for the level shifter circuit for several different channel characteristics. By contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates simulation results. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, a relatively good choice for the DAC setting can vary due to channel-to-channel variations. In the illustrated example, the optimum DAC settings for channels 6 and 20 are 4 and 18, respectively. When operated in open loop, the transmitter is therefore typically not always using an optimum voltage reference VREF_TUNE setting.</p>

<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The functionality of the replica circuit <b>800</b>, <b>850</b> can be summarized as follows: When operated in open loop with the voltage reference VREF_TUNE set to the middle of the range, the replica circuit <b>800</b>, <b>850</b> provides a relatively coarse bias voltage VBP, VBN settings for matching the rise and fall times. Closing the loop allows the replica circuit <b>800</b>,<b>850</b> to fine tune the setting over mismatch variations for improved common-mode noise. The voltage reference VREF_TUNE plays a role similar to the control voltage in a PLL. In open loop, the PLL generates a frequency close to but typically not exactly equal to the desired frequency. Closing the loop allows the PLL to fine tune the control voltage so as to generate the desired frequency and acquire phase lock.</p>

The level shifter unit <b>1101</b> can be used in place of the level shifter <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). The level shifter unit <b>1101</b> has both the capacitively-coupled paths of the level shifters <b>340</b>, <b>360</b> of FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>C<b>2</b> and <b>11</b>A<b>1</b> and adding direct current (DC) coupled paths and an enable path from the low-voltage side. The DC coupled paths are shown with dashed or dotted lines. The enable path includes a first DC level shifter <b>1102</b>, which converts the enable signals DEN, <o ostyle="single">DEN</o> for enabling a sub-cell from the low voltage side to the high voltage side and should be included with or without the DC coupled paths.

</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In the context of the second DC level shifter <b>1104</b>, the third DC level shifter <b>1106</b>, and Equation 9, the enable signal EN is high to enable the DC path and is low to disable the DC path. When normal operation is desired and the sub-cell is enabled, the data enable DEN is high and the inverted data enable <o ostyle="single">DEN</o> is low. Accordingly, when the enable signal DEN is high, the enable signal EN is low unless the signal PASS_DC is high. In other words, the DC path is typically disabled unless the sub-cell is disabled or unless the signal PASS_DC is high, which can be the case for squelching or high impedance modes.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In one embodiment, these DC level shifters <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> are implemented by the level shifter <b>300</b> described earlier in connection with FIG. <b>3</b>A<b>1</b> and therefore have logic levels at about 0 volts and at the supply voltage AVDH. However, other level shifters can alternatively be used.

However, when both DC coupled paths and capacitively-coupled paths are present, signal integrity can be compromised in high-speed applications. Hence, the DC path should be on only for low-speed applications, such as for squelch mode. In addition, &#x201c;bold&#x201d; lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> illustrate data signals in one state (negative logic) while the normal lines illustrate the other state (positive logic).

<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In one embodiment, in order to speed up the time used to go out of the squelch mode, the power supply voltages AVDH, AVS provided to the level shifter unit <b>1101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>) can optionally be replaced by regulated power supply voltages, AVD_REG_LS, AVS_REG_LS. These regulated power supply voltages AVD_REG_LS and AVS_REG_LS can be generated on-chip as described in Equation 10 and Equation 11. Of course, the power supply voltages can vary from the levels calculated using Equation 10 and Equation 11. The power supply voltage AVD corresponds to the voltage supply that is used for normal, non-higher voltage circuits. The coupling efficiency variable in Equation 10 and Equation 11 can be as expressed in Equation 6. While illustrated in Equation 10 and Equation 11 using precise formulas, it will be understood that other voltages for the regulated power supply voltages can be used. In a non-limiting example, the regulated power supply voltages conform to Equation 10 and Equation 11 to within about 5% or within 10%.

<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In one example, for a power supply voltage AVDH of 1.8V and a power supply voltage AVD of 0.9V, the replica circuit <b>850</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) generates a bias voltage VBP of about 0.8V and a bias voltage VBN of about 1V. With a coupling efficiency of 90%, the regulated voltage AVD_REG_LS is about 1.6V, which is about 200 mV lower than AVDH. For the same coupling efficiency, the regulated voltage AVS_REG_LS is about 200 mV. As can be seen, the regulated voltages are about 200 mV away from the rails. Using the regulated voltages AVD_REG_LS and AVS_REG_LS to power up the level-shifter unit <b>1101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>) charges the capacitors <b>342</b>, <b>344</b>, <b>362</b>, <b>364</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>) of the level-shifter unit <b>1101</b> close to their steady-state value in normal, transient mode. This effectively reduces the time used to charge or discharge the capacitors <b>342</b>, <b>344</b>, <b>362</b>, <b>364</b> when going out of the squelch mode and reduces steps on the resulting common-mode voltage. Since the SAS protocol sets relatively stringent requirements on the common-mode step when going out of the squelch mode, regulating the supplies of the level-shifter unit <b>1101</b> can be insufficient by itself There can remain a small settling time when a cell is turned on or off due to mismatch variations.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In one embodiment, to address this issue, logic can be added to reduce or minimize the number of cells that change state at a time, that is, be turned on or off, when going into or out of the squelch mode. In one embodiment of the logic, there is at most one sub-cell out of, for example, 48 total cells in the high-swing transmitter, at a time that toggles between the on and off states such that the cells gradually enter or exit the squelch mode. If the lowest amplitude supported uses 12 of the 48 sub-cells, then one sub-cells caries 8.3% of the drive strength. Common-mode steps due to that sub-cell are therefore negligible, especially when the supply voltages of the level-shifter unit <b>1101</b> are regulated. At high amplitudes with even more cells enabled, the sub-cell that is turned on or off carries even less of the total drive strength and has virtually no influence on the common-mode step when going into or out of squelch.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates an embodiment of implementing squelch so as to have at most 1 sub-cell turned on or off when going into or out of squelch. Of course, in alternative embodiments, more than 1 sub-cell can be turned on or off at a time. As discussed earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the transmitter can be made of N cells. These N cells can further be grouped into, for example, 8&#xd7;, 4&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, and 1&#xd7; cells for efficient control. Various combinations can be selected for the particular voltage swing desired. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an 8&#xd7; cell is actually built from two 4&#xd7; cells with separate multiplexer controls for the two 4&#xd7; cells. In normal mode, the two 4&#xd7; cells within the 8&#xd7; cell drive the same pattern; in squelch mode, the two 4&#xd7; cells drive opposite logic so as to create contention within the 8&#xd7; cell. As a result, the output of an 8&#xd7; cell taken in isolation is squelched without having to pair it with another 8&#xd7; cell. For some amplitude settings, pairing the 8&#xd7; cell with another 8&#xd7; cell is not possible and the 8&#xd7; cell should be turned off for the output to be squelched (thereby creating common-mode spikes, which should be kept small).</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a way to solve the &#x201c;pairing&#x201d; problem: the 8&#xd7; cell is self-squelching. Of course a 1&#xd7; sub-cell cannot be split internally like, for example, 8&#xd7;, 4&#xd7;, and 2&#xd7; cells. When possible, the 1&#xd7; sub-cell can be paired with another 1&#xd7; sub-cell to keep the output squelched; otherwise it should be turned off. Using this &#x201c;self-squelch&#x201d; approach for, for example, 8&#xd7;, 4&#xd7;, and 2&#xd7; cells, there will be at most one sub-cell that should be turned off when going into squelch and that is going to happen when an odd number of sub-cells is enabled in normal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Ordinarily, the enabled sub-cells operate in parallel to drive the same logic state. However, when more than 1 sub-cell is available, and particularly when an even number of sub-cells is being used, the sub-cells can be deliberately brought into contention for squelching. Contention is ordinarily a problem to be avoided, particularly with respect to computer busses, since it can cause logic errors, can be wasteful of power, and can cause overheating of components. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates one way in which an 8&#xd7; sub-cell transmitter can be configured so that 4 sub-cells <b>1302</b> contend with 4 other sub-cells <b>1304</b> by driving opposite logic states. For clarity, simplified blocks are shown. The multiplexers (MUXes) <b>1312</b>, <b>1322</b> can correspond to the multiplexed pre-drivers <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> described earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The level shifters <b>1314</b>, <b>1324</b> can correspond to the level shifter unit <b>1101</b> described earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. The output drivers <b>1316</b>, <b>1326</b> can correspond to the transistors <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> and the termination resistor <b>118</b>, and the output drivers <b>1318</b>, <b>1328</b> can correspond to the transistors <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> and the termination resistor <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In the illustrated example, the equalized path having pre-emphasis (PE<b>1</b>) can have the opposite static logic state as the main path. Alternatively, logic gates, such as AND and OR gates, can force particular lines to 0 or 1 as appropriate. The multiplexed pre-drivers <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> can then be set to select the main path for some sub-cells and the equalized path for other sub-cells.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">For example, four sub-cells drive a 1 state, while the remaining four drive a 0 state. The four cells driving a 1 each have their pull-up path enabled, while the four cells driving a zero each have their pull-down path enabled. As a result, a resistive path between the voltage biases AVDH and AVS exists. Since the replica circuit <b>850</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) sets the pull-up and pull-down resistances to be equal, the positive-logic output signal TXOP should be equal to the negative-logic output signal TXON, and both should be midway between the power supply voltages AVDH, AVS or AVDH/2 for the case in which the power supply voltage AVS is zero. With this alternative implementation, none of the sub-cells need to change state (i.e. be turned on or off) when going into or out of squelch. Said another way, the same units that were activated to generate the desired output amplitude are maintained active when going into squelch mode. This reduces common-mode steps. The 4&#xd7; and 2&#xd7; cells use the same approach, whereas a 1&#xd7; cell may potentially change state when going in or out of squelch if there is no other 1&#xd7; cell with which to pair it.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">High-Impedance Mode</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The high-impedance mode of operation can useful to disable the transmitter and to save power, or possibly to change the output impedance of the transmitters. The two enable switches <b>350</b>, <b>370</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>) that gate the bias voltages VBP, VBN illustrate one way of making the high-impedance mode possible. The enable switches <b>350</b>, <b>370</b> are used to disable the positive feedback of the cross-coupled devices when the transmitter is to be put in high impedance mode. With the positive feedback disabled, the DC path can pull up the data high positive logic signal DHP and the data high negative logic signal DHN to AVDH (or AVD_REG_LS), thereby increasing significantly the resistance of the PMOS driver transistors. This sets the pull-up path in high impedance mode. Likewise, the DC path pulls down the data low positive logic signal DLP and the data low negative logic signal DLN nodes to set the pull-down path in high impedance mode. In high-impedance mode, relatively little to no static or dynamic current flows from the power supply voltage AVDH to the power supply voltage AVS, and so power consumption is reduced.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Scalability</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">One advantage of embodiments of the invention is that the transmitter architecture is applicable to a wide range of power supply voltages AVDH with no significant impact on signal integrity, rise and fall times, and jitter, and is accordingly readily scalable with respect to changes to the power supply voltage AVDH.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A</figref>, <b>14</b>B, and <b>14</b>C illustrate simulated waveforms of output signals TXOP, TXON of the transmitter for three different AVDH supply voltages: 1.8V, 1.5V, and 1.2V, respectively. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14C</figref>, the architecture can handle AVDH supplies that approach the low-voltage supply AVD, which can be 0.9V in one embodiment. This can be used to tradeoff output amplitude for reduced power consumption. The replica circuits <b>800</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), <b>850</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) and the level-shifter units <b>1100</b> (FIG. <b>11</b>A<b>1</b>), <b>1101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>) permit the transmitter to be scalable.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The replica circuits <b>800</b>, <b>850</b> are able to adapt to a lower power supply voltage AVDH by simply lowering bias voltage VBP. As the power supply voltage AVDH approaches the lower power supply voltage AVD, the bias voltage VBP gets closer and closer to the power supply voltage AVS, which is typically ground. A rail-to-rail operational amplifier for the first operational amplifier <b>804</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) or the first operational amplifier <b>854</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) should therefore be used in the replica circuit <b>800</b>, <b>850</b> when support for the widest possible range of voltages for the power supply voltage AVDH is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The level shifter unit <b>1100</b> (FIG. <b>11</b>A<b>1</b>) or the level shifter unit <b>1101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>) also contribute to making the overall architecture scalable. First, the level shifter unit <b>1100</b>, <b>1101</b> looks like a passive circuit in normal mode, so a lower voltage headroom due to a lower supply will not be a problem, to some extent. Second, the third NMOS transistor <b>350</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>C<b>1</b>) can pass through the shifted-down bias voltage VBP as the power supply voltage AVDH scales down.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Closed Loop Adaptive Feedback</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a scalable high-swing transmitter with rise/fall time mismatch compensation with a feedback loop for level shifter bias control according to an embodiment of the invention. As discussed earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, N unit driver cells or &#x201c;sub-cells&#x201d; can be instantiated in parallel, and the value for N can vary in a very broad range.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The bias voltage VBP, the bias voltage VBN, the regulated power supply voltage AVD_REG_LS, and the regulated power supply voltage AVS_REG_LS are provided as inputs to the inputs to the level shifter (LS) <b>170</b>. The output stage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> uses thick-oxide transistors, but cascoded thin-oxide transistors could also be used as described earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. An optional transmission gate <b>506</b> as described earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> connects the positive and negative branches of the output driver and is used as a parallel termination. When a unit cell is enabled, the transmission gate should be disabled; when the unit cell is disabled to reduce the output amplitude, the transmission gate should be enabled to maintain the output impedance relatively constant. In the illustrated embodiment, a unit cell is disabled by pulling signals DHP and DHN up and pulling signals DLP and DLN down. In one embodiment, this is implemented using the DC path of the level shifter unit <b>1101</b> described earlier in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> by control of the enable signal EN applied to the level shifters <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b>. This provides an alternative way of disabling a sub-cell. For general principles regarding configuration of amplitude, de-emphasis, and parallel termination, please refer to U.S. Pat. No. 7,501,851, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Two resistors R<sub>F </sub><b>1502</b>, <b>1504</b> are connected in series between the outputs TXOP and TXON. The resistors R<sub>F </sub><b>1502</b>, <b>1504</b> should have a high enough impedance to not load the outputs TXOP, TXON. The common tap of the resistors R<sub>F </sub><b>1502</b>, <b>1504</b> is connected to a relatively large on-chip capacitor C<sub>F </sub><b>1506</b> to form a low-pass filter to generate the filtered common-mode signal avg(VCM). In the illustrated embodiment, the filtered common-mode signal avg(VCM) is then provided as an input to a comparator <b>1507</b>. The comparator <b>1507</b> compares the filtered common-mode signal avg(VCM) with a reference for the common mode, which can be, for example, half of the supply voltage AVDH when the supply voltage AVS is zero. Of course, ratios other than half can be used with appropriate adjustments to the voltage reference AVDH/2, which can be adjusted via a change in an associated voltage divider, control of a DAC output, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Depending on the output value of the comparator <b>1507</b>, a filter <b>1508</b>, which can be embodied by a digital controller, will either increase on decrease a digital signal VREF_TUNE[4:0]. In the illustrated embodiment, the digital signal VREF_TUNE[4:0] corresponds to a 5-bit wide digital signal, and a digital-to-analog converter converts the digital signal VREF_TUNE[4:0] to the analog voltage reference VREF_TUNE inside the block for a replica circuit <b>1512</b>; this analog voltage sets the reference of the operational amplifiers <b>854</b>, <b>874</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Other features of the replica circuit <b>1512</b> can be as described for the replica circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Should it be desired to hold the analog voltage reference VREF_TUNE at a particular value, the loop can be effectively opened up via a switch <b>1510</b>, which then provides a digital signal VREF_TUNE OPEN LOOP[4:0] as the digital signal VREF_TUNE[4:0]. The digital signal VREF_TUNE OPEN LOOP[4:0] can be, for example, a value stored during production test. Of course, other methods of opening up the feedback loop, such as latching, can alternatively be used, and the switching and/or muxing can be performed in the analog domain as well. For example, in another embodiment, the switch <b>1510</b> can be implemented in analog domain and select between the voltage reference derived from the digital signal VREF_TUNE[4:0] or the voltage VREF_TUNE from the voltage reference <b>852</b> described earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">In an alternative embodiment, the comparator <b>1507</b>, the filter <b>1508</b>, and the D/A converter of the replica circuit <b>1512</b> can be replaced by an opamp to implement analog compensation instead of digital compensation.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Physical Link Example</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In one example, the high-swing transmitter with rise/fall time mismatch compensation can be instantiated 24 times in a device for use in, for example, a SAS RAID controller supporting 24 links&#xd7;6 Gb/s per link. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a physical link can include a set of four wires arranged as two differential signal pairs. One differential signal transmits in one direction while the other differential signal transmits in the opposite direction. Data may be transmitted in both directions simultaneously. A physical layer PHY contains a transceiver (1 transmitter+1 receiver) that electrically interfaces to a physical link, which attaches to another physical layer PHY.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The disclosed architecture makes use of multiple cells connected in parallel to provide an effective output impedance matched to the load impedance. The disclosed architecture provides a relatively constant output impedance for supported amplitude and de-emphasis settings. Alternatively, the output impedance can be changed by putting some of the cells in high-impedance mode. In one embodiment: the output stage can be powered from a relatively high-voltage supply and use thick-oxides transistors instead of thin-oxide transistors. Alternatively, the thick-oxide transistors can be replaced by cascoded low-voltage transistors. With thin-oxide transistors, cascoding can be used to limit electrical overstress. A high-speed level-shifter is disposed in the signal path between the pre-driver and the output driver to interface low-voltage logic to high-voltage logic. A replica of the output driver generates bias voltages that keep the rise/fall times matched and the output impedance relatively constant over process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Embodiments of the invention introduce innovations including, but not limited to, the following: the level-shifter (see FIGS. <b>3</b>C<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>D<b>1</b>, <b>11</b>B) includes a capacitively coupled architecture and adds 1) a programmable shift of the outputs, 2) a DC path, and 3) an enable switch. The programmable shift is controlled by the replica circuit and is used to compensate for the output stage's FET and poly resistance variations over PVT. This functionality provides control over the output impedance, a good matching of the rise and fall times, and therefore low common-mode noise. The programmable shift can be fine tuned automatically by the replica circuit when the amplitude setting changes. The DC path is used to support a squelch/idle mode, during which the transmitter holds its differential outputs at the common-mode level for some time. The squelch/idle mode can be a required feature for standards such as SAS and PCI-Express. One particularity of the DC path implementation is that it can be fully disabled in normal mode to provide better signal-integrity (that is, the level-shifter looks like a passive circuit in normal mode, with only the capacitors in the data path). The level-shifter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> also has a DC path, but the later is an inherent part of the level-shifting functionality and cannot be disabled. Signal integrity therefore suffers at high speed. The level-shifter of U.S. Pat. No. 7,586,358 does not have a DC path and therefore cannot support a squelch/idle mode. The DC path is also used to support a high-impedance mode, during which the transmitter should have a high output impedance. The enable switch is added so that the positive feedback of the cross-coupled devices of the level-shifter can be disabled when the output stage is to be put in high-impedance mode.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">The architecture can support a wide range of voltage supplies levels. The circuit adapts automatically as the supply voltage is increased (to provide a higher output swing) or decreased (to save on power). The rise and fall times can be equalized for low common-mode noise and EMI over PVT and mismatch variations. The compensation is analog, so it does not suffer from the granularity of a digital approach.</p>
