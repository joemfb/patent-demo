<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to a method for delivery of fluids to animals, and, in particular, to a method for drug delivery thereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A syringe pump is a device which typically uses an electromechanical drive to advance and/or retract the plunger on a syringe mounted to that device. Syringe pumps perform multiple tasks in medical care and in biomedical research. Syringe pumps represent the most precise and reproducible means of delivering small volumes of fluid into the body or body tissues of animals. A catheter is a hollow, flexible tube, typically made from a biocompatible plastic, that can be inserted into a vein or artery in the body. For example in humans, the insertion procedure can take place quickly and with minimal discomfort if the vein is close to the skin and readily accessible. When the vein is close to the skin, a sharp needle is inserted into the vein and the catheter is inserted through the lumen (interior) of the needle until it exits the needle tip and enters the vein. The needle is then withdrawn, leaving the catheter tip positioned within the vein. The catheter is then secured to the skin to keep it in position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">After insertion, a catheter can be attached to a syringe and/or syringe pump, so that fluid can be delivered through it, or blood withdrawn from it. Examples of the types of fluids delivered to the body, for humans or various other animals, include physiological solutions such as saline (0.9% sodium chloride), Ringer's Solution, Ringer's Lactate Solution, or artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Such solutions can be administered alone, as in cases of dehydration or detoxification, or with supplements, including nutrients such as glucose, or therapeutic drugs intended to be delivered by parenteral administration (i.e. by the intravenous route). The administering and withdrawal of fluids from an animal can be controlled by the use of valves, or other like means for stopping or allowing fluid flow through the catheter. An example of a system that utilizes pinch valves, a syringe, a syringe pump and a catheter to withdraw blood and infuse saline is the Culex Automated Blood Sampling System manufactured by Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. of West Lafayette, Ind. US and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,062,224.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is not atypical, especially during biomedical research with laboratory animals, to administer more than one type of fluid. The methods for making a change in solution include: (1) removing the syringe from the syringe pump and replacing it with another syringe filled with the new fluid; (2) removing, rinsing and refilling the syringe with the new solution; (3) inserting another catheter into another blood vessel and attaching another syringe pump to that blood vessel; or (4) attaching two syringe drives to some type of mechanism which allows the user to switch to the output between these drives. In example (4), the mechanism is often a two-way or three-way valve that is actuated by hand, by electric motor, or by a mechanical or electromechanical fluid switch device. Such mechanisms require that the fluid from both syringes pass into and through the device itself, exposing the fluid to the device and exposing the device to the fluid. Such exposure means that the device must be: (1) discarded after use; or (2) thoroughly cleaned between uses to avoid contamination leftover from prior experiments. Depending on the type of materials used in the switching device, it may not be possible to easily sterilize it between uses since not all materials are thermally stable, or resistant to the effects of sterilizing gases, radiation, or cold-sterilant fluids. Thus, it is desired to provide a device and method for delivery of solutions to animals that does not use a mechanism that exposes the switching device to the solution. Further, it is desired to provide a device and method for delivery of solutions that does not require manual operation or intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In pharmaceutical research, with laboratory animals, new drugs in solution can be introduced into the body via a catheter into the bloodstream. This approach provides a means of controlling how much of the drug enters the body because the concentration of drug (e.g. milligrams per milliliter) in the solution will be known and the volume of drug delivered (e.g. milliliters) will be known. When a drug is administered by mouth, it is necessary to perform multiple tests to learn how much of that drug eventually enters the blood stream since there are several factors affecting absorption of the drug through the barrier represented by the gastrointestinal tract. When a drug solution is administered via a catheter, it can be described as a bolus dose, which is a relatively small volume of fluid administered over a relatively short period of time. In the rat, an example of a bolus dose would typically be a volume on the order of less than 3.0 milliliters and a time of less than 5 minutes. When a drug is administered as a bolus dose, its residence time in the body is determined by the rate at which the body can either metabolize it (e.g. via the liver) or excrete it (e.g. via the kidney or bile duct).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another approach commonly followed is to administer a continuous infusion dose. In this scenario, the volume of fluid administered can be considerably larger, but the rate of flow is usually lower (e.g. less than 10 microliters per minute), and the length of the experiment can extend for several hours or days. When a drug is administered as a continuous dose, its residence time in the body reaches a steady state in which the rate of drug input (determined by flow rate of the syringe pump) is offset by the rate of drug metabolism and excretion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These methods of delivering drugs to animals have several shortcomings. In many instances, a technician is required to manually introduce the drug into a solution for administration to the animal. Manual operation requires that the technician be present at all times that the drug(s) is(are) to be delivered. For a continuous infusion dose, constant attention by the technician is required to make certain that there is sufficient fluid remaining in the syringe or that the syringe is refilled without delay. Such use of human resources is expensive. Further, the accuracy of drug dose delivery is affected by the technician's skill and experience. Thus, accuracy may be compromised. Also, if more than one drug is to be administered, more than one technician may be required. These issues are further complicated by the need to change a solution and the shortcomings thereof as discussed herein. Therefore, it is desired to provide a device and method of drug delivery that does not require manual operation, is capable of delivery of more than one drug, does not contaminate the solution by requiring the solution to come into contact with a switching device that was exposed to another solution during a prior delivery, and permits for control of the amount and rate of flow of introduction of the drug(s) to the animal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The need to deliver drugs for pharmaceutical testing purposes extends both to laboratory animals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, gerbils, monkeys, and pigs), as well, as humans. Thus, it is desirable that the device and method be useable for all &#x201c;animals&#x201d;, where the term &#x201c;animals&#x201d; encompasses any mammals (including humans), reptiles, amphibians, or any other animal used for laboratory testing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There also is a need to deliver fluids to animals other than through a catheter placed in a blood vessel. For example, a catheter or tube may be implanted into the stomach or duodenum of the animal. Thus, it is desired to provide a device and method for drug delivery to an animal that works in combination with all types of &#x201c;catheters.&#x201d; As used herein, &#x201c;catheter&#x201d; refers to any type of tube connection to an animal's blood vessels and/or any type of tube connection that provides fluid (with or without a drug or drugs therein) to or extracts fluid from any part of the body, body tissues, organs, or blood system of the animal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For purposes of understanding the effect of a drug on a subject, it is desirable to extract blood samples from an animal that has received the drug. Such samples are useful for a myriad of purposes, including, ascertaining the level of drug present in the blood stream of the animal at any time relative to the original introduction of that drug. Of course, it is also possible that extraction of other body fluids may be desired, such as in determining the level of drug in the bile, or the kidney, or the aqueous humor of the eye, or fluids in the lung, for example. In addition, there are other techniques for taking biological samples based on the use of dialysis probes that involve exchange of molecules but not fluids. Therefore, it is desired to provide a method of drug delivery for animals that works in conjunction with other equipment intended to extract fluid or dialyze molecules from the animal.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Exemplary embodiments relate to a device and a method for delivery and collection of fluids to and from animals and, in particular, to a device and method for drug delivery to animals. In one embodiment, the device comprises a drug delivery device that comprises a housing that holds a fluid subsystem and a first syringe pump, a second syringe pump and a third syringe pump. Each of the first, second and third syringe pumps are associated with a first, second and third syringe, respectively. The syringe pumps are associated with electronic controllers that control the push and/or pull operation of the first, second, and third syringes. The syringes are of the type often used for drug delivery and may be disposable. The fluid subsystem comprises a plurality of valves and plastic disposable tubing. In this embodiment, each valve is a two-position, pinch valve with two orifices that receive tubing. The orifices may be slots that make it easy to place the tubing in the valve without dismantling the fluid subsystem. Because each valve comprises a two-position, pinch valve, each orifice of the valve essentially comprises a first and second subvalve.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this embodiment, each of the syringes are joined to a first, second or third fluid reservoir by a first syringe inlet, a second syringe inlet and a third syringe inlet, respectively. Each syringe inlet passes through the first subvalve of first, second and third pinch valves, respectively. Each of the first, second and third syringes are joined to each other by first, second and third syringe outlets that each pass through the second subvalve of the first, second, and third pinch valves, respectively. Further, the fluid subsystem is joined to a catheter by a catheter outlet that passes through a first subvalve of a fourth pinch valve. The fluid subsystem is also joined to a waste outlet that passes through the second subvalve of the fourth pinch valve.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One exemplary embodiment of the method for delivering fluids to and collecting fluids from an animal can utilize the drug delivery device to control the path of fluid(s) flowing through the fluid subsystem. The method operates the first, second and third syringe pumps to push or pull the first, second, and third syringes, and opens and closes the first and second subvalves of the first, second, third, and fourth pinch valves. The opening and closing of the subvalves determines what tubes are opened and closed to the flow of fluids and causes the drug delivery device to inject one or more fluids into an animal through a catheter without contamination. Further, the method may also collect fluid samples from the animal through the waste outlet.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a block diagram of one embodiment of the drug delivery device of the present disclosure. In this embodiment, a drug delivery device <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>11</b>, a first syringe pump <b>12</b>, a second syringe pump <b>14</b>, a third syringe pump <b>16</b>, a first valve <b>18</b>, a second valve <b>20</b>, a third valve <b>22</b>, a fourth valve <b>24</b>, and a fluid subsystem <b>26</b>. Each of the first, second, and third syringe pumps <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b> have associated therewith electronic controllers (not shown) disposed within housing <b>11</b> for controlling the operation (push and pull) of a first syringe <b>28</b>, a second syringe <b>30</b>, and a third syringe <b>32</b>. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the electronic controllers can be disposed within housing <b>11</b> and a separate controller <b>114</b> or can be housed solely within the separate controller <b>114</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Such syringe pumps include, for example, the Empis pumps made by Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. of West Lafayette, Ind. US. First, second, and third syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b> are of the type often used for drug delivery, and may be disposable. Such syringes include, for example, the 3 mL disposable luer syringes made by Becton Dickinson Corporation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this embodiment, the electronic control circuitry (not shown) for valves <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> are housed within housing <b>11</b>. In addition, the electronic control circuitry may reside, in whole or in part, in separate controller <b>114</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In this embodiment, each of the valves <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> comprises a two-position, pinch valve with a first and second position that can each open and close. The first and second positions of each of the valves are orifices that receive disposable tubing. The orifices may be slots or other structures that make it easy to place the tubing in each valve without dismantling the fluid subsystem. Because each valve comprises a two-position, pinch valve, the orifice at the first position essentially comprises a first subvalve and the orifice at the second position essentially comprises a second subvalve. During operation, each valve's first position or second position will be open while the other position will be closed. The first position and second position cannot both be open or both be closed at the same time. While each position of each valve is either referred to as the first or second position, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that there is no difference between the two positions. Further, other means for stopping or allowing fluid flow will be obvious to those skilled in the art and are considered to be within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of the fluid subsystem utilized in this exemplary embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in this embodiment, first valve <b>18</b> comprises a first subvalve <b>80</b> and a second subvalve <b>81</b>, second valve <b>20</b> comprises a first subvalve <b>82</b> and a second subvalve <b>83</b>, third valve <b>22</b> comprises a first subvalve <b>84</b> and a second subvalve <b>85</b>, and fourth subvalve <b>24</b> comprises a first subvalve <b>86</b> and a second subvalve <b>87</b>. The electronic control circuitry controls the opening and closing of each of these subvalves. In operation, when the first subvalve (and hence the tube through the first subvalve) is open, the second subvalve is closed and, when the second subvalve (and hence the tube through the second subvalve) is open, the first subvalve is closed. Examples of two-position pinch valves used in the device of the present disclosure are the Empis Valve Assemblies made by Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, fluid subsystem <b>26</b> includes first syringe <b>28</b>, second syringe <b>30</b>, third syringe <b>32</b>, first valve <b>18</b>, second valve <b>20</b>, third valve <b>22</b>, fourth valve <b>24</b>, a first fluid reservoir <b>34</b>, a second fluid reservoir <b>36</b>, and a third fluid reservoir <b>38</b>. First reservoir <b>34</b> is connected to first syringe <b>28</b> by a first syringe inlet <b>40</b> that passes through first subvalve <b>80</b> of valve <b>18</b>. First syringe inlet <b>40</b> and syringe <b>28</b> are joined together by a first tee connector <b>66</b>. Syringe <b>28</b> is connected to the rest of the fluid subsystem <b>26</b> by a first syringe outlet <b>42</b> that passes through second subvalve <b>81</b> of valve <b>18</b>. Syringe outlet <b>42</b> and syringe <b>28</b> are also joined together by first tee connector <b>66</b>. Further, syringe outlet <b>42</b> is connected to the rest of fluid subsystem <b>26</b> by a first y-connector <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Fluid reservoir <b>36</b> is connected to second syringe <b>30</b> by a second syringe inlet <b>44</b> that passes through first subvalve <b>82</b> of valve <b>20</b>. Second syringe inlet <b>44</b> and syringe <b>30</b> are joined together by a second tee connector <b>68</b>. Syringe <b>30</b> is connected to the rest of fluid subsystem <b>26</b> by a second syringe outlet <b>46</b> that passes through second subvalve <b>83</b> of valve <b>20</b>. Second syringe outlet <b>46</b> and syringe <b>30</b> are also joined together by second tee connector <b>68</b>. Further, syringe outlet <b>46</b> is connected to the rest of fluid subsystem <b>26</b> by first y-connector <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Fluid reservoir <b>38</b> is connected to third syringe <b>32</b> by a third syringe inlet <b>48</b> that passes through first subvalve <b>84</b> of valve <b>22</b>. Third syringe inlet <b>48</b> and syringe <b>32</b> are joined together by a third tee connector <b>72</b>. Syringe <b>32</b> is connected to the rest of fluid subsystem <b>26</b> by a third syringe outlet <b>50</b> that passes through the second subvalve <b>85</b> of valve <b>22</b>. Third syringe outlet <b>50</b> and syringe <b>32</b> are also joined together by third tee connector <b>72</b>. Further, third syringe outlet <b>50</b> is connected to the rest of fluid subsystem <b>26</b> by a second y-connector <b>70</b>. Second y-connector <b>70</b> is connected to first y-connector <b>64</b> by a connecting tube <b>62</b>. Y-connector <b>70</b> is also connected to a third y-connector <b>74</b> by a system outlet <b>52</b>. Third y-connector <b>74</b> connects system outlet <b>52</b> to a catheter outlet <b>54</b> that passes through first subvalve <b>86</b> of valve <b>24</b> and to a waste outlet <b>56</b> that passes through second subvalve <b>87</b> of valve <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each of the tee connectors and y-connectors have three receiving positions that can receive one of the tubes described above or one of the first, second and third syringes. While the tee connectors and y-connectors are shown as different structures in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the tee connectors and y-connectors can be the same structure. Further, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that any type of connector can be used with the device, so long as the connectors in this embodiment have three receiving positions that can receive one of the tubes described above or one of the first, second and third syringes. Moreover, while the terms &#x201c;inlet&#x201d; and &#x201c;outlet&#x201d; are used herein to describe the tubing of fluid subsystem <b>26</b>, such terms are not intended to be limiting as to the direction of fluid therethrough. Specifically, each &#x201c;inlet&#x201d; tube and each &#x201c;outlet&#x201d; tube supports bidirectional flow of fluid therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">First, second, and third syringe pumps <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are operable to push or pull first, second, and third syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b>, respectively. As previously mentioned, each of the subvalves <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, and <b>87</b> are electrically controlled as well. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that one of the subvalves associated with each syringe will be open at all times. Thus, any action by the syringe associated with that subvalve will affect the flow of fluid through that valve. Accordingly, drug delivery device <b>10</b> will be able to control the path of fluid(s) flowing through fluid subsystem <b>26</b> by controlling the subvalves and the syringes. To better understand the fluid subsystem, block diagrams of three alternate exemplary embodiments of the fluid subsystem are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first subvalve <b>80</b> of first valve <b>18</b>, first subvalve <b>82</b> of second valve <b>20</b>, and first subvalve <b>84</b> of third valve <b>22</b> are all shown in the open position. If the plungers in first, second and third syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively, are pulled out, then fluid residing in reservoirs <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b> will travel down syringe inlets <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>, and <b>48</b>, respectively, to fill syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b>. The syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b> could be activated in any order or any combination in order to be filled in this manner. In contrast, if second subvalve <b>81</b> of first valve <b>18</b>, second subvalve <b>83</b> of second valve <b>20</b>, and second subvalve <b>85</b> of third valve <b>22</b> were all open, then first subvalves <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, and <b>84</b> would be closed. If this were the case, any action by syringe <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, or <b>32</b> to expel the fluid contained inside that syringe would result in flow through the respective open second subvalve <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, or <b>85</b>. Again, syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b> may be activated in any order or any combination in order to be emptied in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, second subvalve <b>87</b> of fourth valve <b>24</b> is shown open, while first subvalve <b>86</b> of fourth valve <b>24</b> is closed. If any combination of second subvalves <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, or <b>85</b> was open and any of syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, or <b>32</b> was emptied by pushing the syringes, then fluid would travel through the corresponding syringe outlet <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, or <b>50</b> and through second subvalve <b>87</b> of fourth valve <b>24</b> to waste. If, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first subvalve <b>86</b> of fourth valve <b>24</b> was open, then second subvalve <b>87</b> of fourth valve <b>24</b> would be closed. If any combination of second subvalves <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, or <b>85</b> was open and any of syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, or <b>32</b> was emptied, then fluid would travel through the corresponding syringe outlet <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, or <b>50</b> and through first subvalve <b>86</b> of fourth valve <b>24</b> to the catheter. Likewise, if any combination of first subvalves <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, or <b>85</b> was open and the plunger on any of syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, or <b>32</b> was withdrawn, then fluid would travel from the catheter through first subvalve <b>86</b> of fourth valve <b>24</b> to line <b>52</b> and possibly through syringe outlets <b>42</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>50</b> depending on the length of time the syringe was activated and the speed with which the plunger was withdrawn.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows another exemplary embodiment of a fluid subsystem that can be utilized in the device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this embodiment comprises a fluid subsystem <b>58</b> that has the same components of the previous embodiment except for third fluid reservoir <b>38</b> and third syringe inlet <b>48</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are not present. In this embodiment, third tee connector <b>72</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is not needed and third syringe outlet <b>50</b> is connected directly to third syringe <b>32</b>. Hence, third syringe <b>32</b> cannot be refilled in this embodiment. Thus, third syringe <b>32</b> need only be operated by third syringe pump <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in a single direction (i.e., the push direction, to push fluid residing within third syringe <b>32</b> into third syringe outlet <b>50</b>). Alternatively, third syringe pump <b>16</b> could still operate in both directions in order to pull the plunger while first subvalve <b>86</b> of fourth valve <b>24</b> was opened in order to allow fluid to pass from the catheter into fluid subsystem <b>58</b>. Thus, syringe <b>32</b> could be used to pull fluid including blood or other fluid from the catheter. This embodiment may be useful in the event the particular solution of third syringe <b>32</b> is only needed in limited quantities, or when testing the catheter to make sure that it is not occluded by a blood clot or other biological obstacle. It is also useful in cases when there is a limitation on the amount of available drug and there is not sufficient material available to prepare a bag of solution as in fluid reservoir <b>34</b> or <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows another exemplary embodiment of the fluid subsystem of the present disclosure. This embodiment comprises fluid subsystem <b>60</b> and differs from the other embodiments because it only has one fluid reservoir, namely, first fluid reservoir <b>34</b>. Thus, this embodiment does not have second fluid reservoir <b>36</b>, third fluid reservoir <b>38</b>, second syringe inlet <b>44</b>, and third syringe inlet <b>48</b>. Further, second and third tee connectors <b>68</b> and <b>72</b> are not needed. Accordingly, second syringe outlet <b>46</b> connects second syringe <b>30</b> directly to first y-connector <b>64</b> and third syringe outlet <b>50</b> connects third syringe <b>32</b> directly to y-connector <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, second and third syringes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> need only be operated by second and third syringe pumps <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in a single direction (i.e., the push direction in order to push fluid residing within second syringe <b>30</b> into second syringe outlet <b>46</b> and to push fluid residing within third syringe <b>32</b> into third syringe outlet <b>50</b>). This embodiment may be useful in the event the particular solutions of second and third syringes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are only available in limited quantities, or when it is desirable to create a gradient in which the proportions of fluids in syringes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> changes over time, increasing the proportion of one fluid relative to the other. It will also be appreciated by one skilled in the art that that the second and third syringe pumps <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> can operate to pull second syringe <b>30</b> and third syringe <b>32</b> to cause fluid to be drawn into second syringe outlet <b>46</b> and third syringe outlet <b>50</b> in order to collect a sample through the catheter from the animal.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The alternate embodiments of the fluid subsystem illustrate the flexibility of the fluid subsystem. While only three embodiments are shown and described, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that many other versions are possible and contemplated to be within the scope of this disclosure. For example, another embodiment can comprise a fluid system that has no fluid reservoirs connected to any of first, second and third syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. In this embodiment, syringe pumps <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> operates syringes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> as described above in order to deliver fluids through the catheter outlet and/or waste outlet or to withdraw fluids from the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown a block diagram of the device connected to a movement-responsive caging system and to a blood sampling system. The movement-responsive caging system is of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,816,256, and the blood sampling system of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,062,224. These U.S. Patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, housing <b>11</b> of drug delivery device <b>10</b> is connected to a sterile saline reservoir <b>112</b>. Sterile saline reservoir <b>112</b> is comparable to first fluid reservoir <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The movement-responsive caging system comprises a cage <b>100</b> having a rat <b>102</b> therein, and a controller <b>104</b>. The blood sampling system includes a blood sampling controller <b>106</b>, a sterile saline reservoir <b>108</b>, and a fraction collector <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, this exemplary embodiment also includes a processor <b>116</b> and a syringe controller <b>114</b>. In this embodiment, syringe controller <b>114</b> contains the electrical power and control systems for control of the syringe pumps and the valves housed within housing <b>11</b>. This arrangement differs from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that the electronic control resides outside of housing <b>11</b>. Housing <b>11</b> is electrically connected to syringe controller <b>114</b> by a syringe control line <b>118</b>. Syringe controller <b>114</b> is also electrically connected to controller <b>104</b> of the movement-responsive caging system by a first line <b>120</b> and to processor <b>116</b> by a second line <b>122</b>. The electrical connection between syringe controller <b>114</b> and controller <b>104</b> of the movement-responsive caging system is for the purpose of providing an alternate route for recording animal activity signals, including rotation, duration of rotation, rearing, and duration of rearing, when the test system comprises only the drug infusion device and the interactive caging system. Furthermore, syringe controller <b>114</b> is electrically connected to controller <b>106</b> of the blood sampling system by a third line <b>124</b>. In this manner, communication is possible between the device, the movement-responsive caging system, and the blood sampling system.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment, processor <b>116</b> provides a user interface for the device of the present disclosure and the blood sampling system. Processor <b>116</b> may comprise a personal computer, for example, having the WindoWS&#x2122; operating system and user interface program operating thereon. In addition to being connected by second line <b>122</b> to syringe controller <b>114</b>, processor <b>116</b> is also electrically connected by a fifth line <b>128</b> to controller <b>106</b> of the blood sampling system. The electrical connection between controller <b>106</b> of the blood sampling system and processor <b>116</b> is for the purpose of sending instructions from the user interface software on processor <b>116</b> to an operational processor in controller <b>106</b>, and for recording operational messages from controller <b>106</b> on the storage media of processor <b>116</b>. Controller <b>106</b> is also connected to fraction collector <b>110</b> by a fourth line <b>126</b>. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that lines <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> can comprise any type of electrical connections including, but not limited to, serial connection, parallel connection, use of a bus, ethernet, internet, Appletalk or other network, radio frequency, microwave, or Internet. The salient feature of each operative connection between these devices is that it is able to transmit and/or receive the data appropriate to the device at a speed sufficient for operational use of the device and in a manner that does not interfere with other devices in proximity to that device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The use of the device with a movement-responsive caging system and blood sampling system permits for the sampling of blood of a freely moving animal (within the cage) while administering drug(s) to the animal. For example, in a typical experiment, the animal would be allowed to acclimate to the environment of the caging system for some period of time. During this time, a sample of blood would be taken to establish that no drug was present in the system prior to administration by drug delivery device <b>10</b>. During this time, the animal activity would be monitored by processor <b>116</b> to establish a pre-dose pattern of activity. Then, drug delivery device <b>10</b> would be activated to deliver a predetermined volume of fluid from one or more syringes to the animal, and this would also trigger blood sampling to occur at predetermined intervals. Animal activity would be continuously recorded by processor <b>116</b> to monitor post-dose activity.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is shown a block diagram of one embodiment of multiple drug delivery devices <b>10</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> connected to a central processor <b>116</b>. In this embodiment and the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, processor <b>116</b> comprises a computer. Further, in this embodiment, drug delivery devices <b>10</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> are all electrically connected to syringe controller <b>114</b> by syringe control lines <b>118</b>. Further, controller <b>114</b> is electrically connected by line <b>122</b> to processor <b>116</b>. In this embodiment, all four drug delivery devices <b>10</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, and <b>144</b> are controlled by controller <b>114</b>. While this exemplary embodiment utilizes four drug delivery devices, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that any number of the drug delivery devices can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will also be appreciated by one skilled in the art that controller <b>114</b> could, alternatively, only provide a power source for drug delivery devices <b>10</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, and <b>144</b>, while a processor within each of the drug delivery devices could provide the operational control for each device. Further, drug delivery devices <b>10</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> can form a network with one another and processor <b>116</b> while controller <b>114</b> serves as a power source. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a block diagram of an embodiment of multiple drug delivery devices <b>10</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> where the drug delivery devices are all connected to a network feeding back to processor <b>116</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, drug delivery devices <b>10</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, and <b>144</b> are networked together by a plurality of wires <b>150</b>. Further, drug delivery devices <b>10</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> are networked with processor <b>116</b> so that each drug delivery device in the network feeds back to processor <b>116</b>. In this arrangement, the power supply would be isolated from possible damage by fluid leaks or spillage from drug delivery devices <b>10</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, and <b>144</b>. The user interface for such control and for the results obtained with devices <b>10</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, and <b>144</b> is at processor <b>116</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> are further illustrative of the flexibility of the device. Multiple experiments or drug deliveries may be operated simultaneously and independently using these drug delivery devices. For example, the experimental protocol carried out on device <b>10</b> would not have to resemble the protocol carried out on any of the other devices <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, or <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In two separate tables, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> outlines two sample procedures using the exemplary embodiment of the drug delivery device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the first procedure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a procedure is illustrated for checking a catheter and flushing the catheter with sterile saline. To illustrate one method to accomplish this objective, reference is made to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. First syringe reservoir <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is filled with saline solution. Second syringe reservoir <b>36</b> and third syringe reservoir <b>38</b> are either empty or full. The catheter connected to catheter outlet <b>54</b> is implanted in a blood vessel, such as the jugular or femoral vein, of the animal.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">To begin, first valve <b>18</b> is set to the position that opens subvalve <b>80</b> and allows fluid to pass through first syringe inlet <b>40</b>. Second valve <b>20</b> is set to the position that opens subvalve <b>82</b> and allows fluid to pass through second syringe inlet <b>44</b>. Third valve <b>22</b> is set to the position that opens subvalve <b>85</b> and allows fluid to pass through third syringe outlet <b>50</b>. Fourth valve <b>24</b> is set to the position that opens subvalve <b>86</b> and allows fluid to pass through catheter outlet <b>54</b>. First syringe <b>28</b> is pulled by first syringe pump <b>12</b>, second syringe <b>30</b> is left stationary, and third syringe <b>32</b> is pulled by third syringe pump <b>16</b> until blood appears in catheter outlet <b>54</b>. In this manner, first syringe <b>28</b> is filled with saline, while catheter outlet <b>54</b> is partially filled with blood to indicate that the catheter is not occluded by a clot, other biological obstacle, or kink in the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">After first syringe <b>28</b> and third syringe <b>32</b> are pulled, first valve <b>18</b> is set to the position that opens subvalve <b>81</b> and allows fluid to pass through first syringe outlet <b>42</b>. Third valve <b>22</b> is set to the position that opens subvalve <b>84</b>. Second valve <b>20</b> remains open to second syringe inlet <b>44</b> and fourth valve <b>24</b> remains open to catheter outlet <b>54</b>. Second and third syringes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> remain stationary and first syringe is pushed by first syringe pump <b>12</b>. In this manner, saline from syringe <b>28</b> is pushed through fluid subsystem <b>26</b> until it pushes blood out of catheter outlet <b>54</b> and back down the catheter. The catheter is now flushed and ready for introduction of one or more drugs.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the second procedure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a procedure is illustrated for flushing a catheter with sterile saline, refilling the second syringe, injecting fluid from the second syringe, and flushing with saline. This procedure outlines the sequence of events used to deliver a bolus injection of a drug. The procedure could be repeated with increasing concentrations of the drug as needed. To illustrate one method to accomplish this objective, reference is made to the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After the steps described above in association with the first procedure of checking a catheter and flushing the catheter with sterile saline, valve <b>18</b> is set to the position where subvalve <b>80</b> is open and allows fluid to pass through first syringe inlet <b>40</b>. Valve <b>20</b> is set to the position that opens subvalve <b>82</b> and allows fluid to pass through second syringe inlet <b>44</b>. Valve <b>22</b> is set to the position that opens subvalve <b>84</b> and allows fluid to pass through third syringe inlet <b>48</b>. Valve <b>24</b> is set to the position that opens subvalve <b>86</b> and allows fluid to pass through catheter outlet <b>54</b>. While third syringe <b>32</b> remains stationary, second syringe <b>30</b> is pulled by second syringe pump <b>14</b> until it fills with the fluid from second fluid reservoir <b>36</b> and first syringe <b>28</b> is pulled by first syringe pump <b>12</b> until it fills with saline from first fluid reservoir <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, valves <b>18</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> remain in the same position while valve <b>20</b> is set to the position that opens subvalve <b>83</b> and allows fluid to pass through second syringe outlet <b>46</b>. While first and third syringes remain stationary, second syringe <b>30</b> is then pushed until the total volume of the fluid is delivered. Fluid from reservoir <b>36</b> will normally comprise a drug that is desired to be tested. After the drug is delivered, valve <b>18</b> is set to the position where subvalve <b>81</b> is open and allows fluid to pass through first syringe outlet <b>42</b> and valve <b>20</b> is set to the position where subvalve <b>82</b> is open and allows fluid to pass through second syringe inlet <b>44</b>. While second and third syringes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> remain stationary, first syringe <b>28</b> is pushed by first syringe pump <b>12</b>. In this manner, saline from syringe <b>28</b> is pushed through fluid subsystem <b>26</b> until the total volume of saline is delivered. In this manner, drug delivery device <b>10</b> flushes the fluid subsystem <b>26</b> and the catheter. The catheter is now flushed and ready for introduction of one or more other drugs. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, there are additional procedures that could be achieved by the device. Other examples include situations such as delivery of a bolus injection (loading dose) followed by continuous delivery of a drug from a refillable syringe (continuous infusion).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">This embodiment and procedure enables the drug delivery device to flush saline, or another like fluid, down the catheter to keep the catheter from becoming occluded by other fluids, such as clotted blood. The volume of saline and the interval for this flushing can be preprogrammed. The flushing will occur as described above in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, but will also keep subvalve <b>81</b> of valve <b>18</b> closed momentarily while syringe pump <b>12</b> begins to push syringe <b>28</b>. In this way, drug delivery device <b>10</b> begins to build up pressure. Once subvalve <b>81</b> is open and allows fluid to pass through first syringe outlet <b>42</b> the pressure behind the flushing saline will blow out any clots forming in the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that these embodiments of the device and method meets the specific needs of drug delivery, because they utilize multiple disposable syringes that can be easily replaced with clean and sterile syringes. Further, each syringe is independently programmable, with start, stop, direction and flow rate independent of the others, so that one syringe may run while the other syringe(s) is(are) stopped, or two syringes may run while the other syringe(s) is(are) stopped, or all syringes may run together, or none may run, during any programmed sequence. The independent control for each of these syringes conserves the fluid in the syringes until the syringes are activated. Moreover, each syringe can be automatically refillable from independent reservoirs of drug solution, when connected to those reservoirs.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The fluid reservoirs and syringes are connected together into a single fluid subsystem, by means of sterile, disposable plastic tubing, tee connectors and y-connectors. Accordingly, fluid remains in the syringes, sterile tubing and fluid reservoirs and does not exit the fluid subsystem or contaminate other components, such as the valves that control the flow of fluid. Further, the syringes, sterile tubing and sterile reservoirs are immediately accessible by the user and can be replaced with ease. The fluid subsystem is connected to a catheter attached to an animal, including, but not limited to, a catheter implanted into a blood vessel. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that this fluid subsystem can be connected to any type of catheter, including catheters not used in blood vessels. For example, the fluid subsystem can be connected to a tube implanted into the stomach or duodenum of an animal.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each syringe can be used to deliver fluids to or collect fluids from an animal. Each syringe pump is reversible (i.e. can be used to pull as well as push). Thus, these embodiments can take samples by pulling a syringe to extract fluid past the last valve, into one of the syringes and, subsequently, by pushing the syringe to force the extracted fluid out the waste outlet for collection. Switching among the contents of the syringes is achieved by the position of valves associated with each syringe. The position of the valves either allow the fluid to be delivered to or collected from the catheter by a syringe or allows a syringe to be bypassed by the collected or delivered fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, these embodiments can be programmed to deliver a desired volume of fluid from one or multiple syringes into a single catheter without that fluid being exposed to any component which is not part of either the disposable tubing, tee connectors, y-connectors or syringes that comprise the fluid subsystem. These embodiments also provide for a mechanism for flushing fluid through the fourth valve either to the catheter or to the waste outlet in order to reduce the total volume of fluid flowing to the catheter after a syringe change has been initiated. In one embodiment, one syringe can be dedicated to providing a periodic flush and to ensure that the catheter is kept filled with a sterile solution, such as saline, to prevent the catheter from becoming occluded by other fluids, such as clotted blood, when used in connection with a catheter implanted in a blood vessel of the animal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While the device and method of the present disclosure have been described in considerable detail with references to particular embodiments thereof, such is offered only by way of non-limiting examples of embodiments of the device and methods as many other versions are possible. It is anticipated that a variety of other modifications and changes will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art and that such modifications and changes are intended to be encompassed with the spirit and scope of the pending claims.</p>
