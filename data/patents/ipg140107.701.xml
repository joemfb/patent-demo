<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 National Stage entry of International Application No. PCT/KR2007/005185, filed on Oct. 22, 2007, which claims priority to Korean Application No. 10-2007-0058511, filed Jun. 14, 2007, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an air conditioner and a method of controlling the same, and more particularly, to an air conditioner and a method of controlling the same in which the surface of a heat exchanger can be prevented from freezing by supplying energy to the heat exchanger.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Air conditioners are devices for cooling and cooling indoor rooms using a cooling cycle including a compressor, a condenser, an expansion device, and an evaporator. During the operation of a cooling cycle of an air conditioner, i.e., during the operation of a compressor, water in the air is condensed on the surface of an evaporator, and thus, compressed water is generated. Then, the compressed water drops below the evaporator. However, if the compressed water freezes up on the surface of the evaporator due to low-temperature air around the evaporator, the performance of the air conditioner may deteriorate due to an unsmooth heat exchange between a coolant and air.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to address this, the operation of a compressor may be stopped in the middle of the operation of an air conditioner so that the operation of the air conditioner can also be stopped. Then, a defrost operation may be performed for a predetermined amount of time so that the surface of an evaporator can be defrosted. Once the surface of the evaporator is completely defrosted, the operation of the compressor may be resumed so that the operation of the air conditioner can be resumed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, since a defrost operation can be performed only after the operation of an air conditioner is stopped, a cooling function or a heating function cannot be performed during a defrost operation, thereby reducing user convenience.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The method of controlling an air conditioner according to the present invention includes performing an anti-freeze operation by applying a voltage to one or more electrodes for generating in a heat exchanger an electric field that interferes with the freeze of water if the heat exchanger satisfies a set of anti-freeze initiation conditions; and canceling the anti-freeze operation by cutting off the voltage if the heat exchanger satisfies a set of anti-freeze release conditions. Thus, it is possible to prevent the freeze of water while consuming less power.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The method of controlling an air conditioner according to the present invention also includes reducing the operating capacity of an air conditioner during an operation of an anti-freeze apparatus. Thus, it is possible to stably perform an anti-freeze operation while preventing fluctuations in the temperature of water and to prevent the probability of the malfunction of an air conditioner.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the air conditioner includes a compressor <b>2</b>, an outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, an expansion device <b>6</b>, an indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b>, and an anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> which supplies energy to the compressor <b>2</b>, the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, the expansion device <b>6</b> and the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> and can thus prevent water, if any, on the surfaces of the compressor <b>2</b>, the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, the expansion device <b>6</b> and the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> from freezing.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The air conditioner may be either an air cooler which can cool indoor rooms or a heat pump which not only can cool but also can heat indoor rooms. If the air conditioner is an air cooler, a coolant compressed by the compressor <b>2</b> is condensed by passing through the outdoor heat exchanger <b>5</b>, and the condensed coolant is expanded by passing through the expansion device <b>6</b>. The expanded coolant is evaporated by the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b>. Then, the evaporated coolant is circulated back into the compressor <b>2</b>. That is, the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> may serve as a condenser, and the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> may serve as an evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, if the air conditioner is a heat pump, rather than an air cooler, the air conditioner may also include a cooling/heating switching valve <b>10</b> which shifts the passage of flow of a coolant compressed by the compressor <b>2</b> according to whether the air conditioner performs a cooling operation or a heating operation. During a cooling operation, a coolant compressed by the compressor <b>2</b> is circulated into the compressor <b>2</b> by sequentially passing through the cooling/heating switching valve <b>10</b>, the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, the expansion device <b>6</b>, the indoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, and the cooling/heating switching valve <b>10</b>. In this case, the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> may serve as a condenser, and the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> may serve as an evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">On the other hand, during a heating operation, a coolant compressed by the compressor <b>2</b> is circulated into the compressor <b>2</b> by sequentially passing through the cooling/heating switching valve <b>10</b>, the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b>, the expansion device <b>6</b>, the outdoor heat exchanger <b>5</b>, and the cooling/heating switching valve <b>10</b>. In this case, the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> may serve as a condenser, and the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> may serve as an evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">During the operation of the air conditioner, water is generated on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> or on the surface of the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b>. More specifically, if the air conditioner is an air cooler, water may be generated on the surface of the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b>. If the air conditioner is a heat pump and performs a cooling operation, water may be generated on the surface of the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b>. If the air conditioner is a heat pump and performs a heating operation, water may be generated on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>. Such water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> or the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> may freeze up at low temperature and may thus adversely affect the heat exchange performance of the air conditioner. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an atmosphere in which water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> or the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> can be prevented from freezing even at low temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> prevents water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> or the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> from freezing. If the air conditioner is an air cooler, the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> may be disposed so that energy can be supplied to the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b>, and that water on the surface of the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> can be prevented from freezing. If the air conditioner is a heat pump, the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> may be disposed so that energy can be supplied not only to the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> but also to the outdoor heat exchanger <b>8</b>, and that water on the surface of the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> or the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> can be prevented from freezing.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> may prevent the freezing of water by using the phenomenon of super cooling, which is the cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid. The anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> may include a mechanical vibrator and thus prevent the freezing of water by applying mechanical vibrations to whichever of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> and the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> serves as an evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">However, an anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> having a mechanical vibrator may damage the connections between a coolant pipe and whichever of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> and the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> serves as an evaporator, and thus may not be suitable for use in an air conditioner. Therefore, an anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> using the phenomenon of super cooling may be suitable for use in an air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In general, when the temperature of an indoor room is below zero, it is more likely to perform a heating operation than to perform a cooling operation. Therefore, the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> may supply energy so that water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> can be prevented from freezing during a heating operation performed by a heat pump. However, people from cold climates may feel hot even at temperatures below zero and may thus need a cooling operation. In this case, water on the surface of the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> may freeze due to such low temperatures. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent water on the surface of the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> from freezing by using the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b>. By doing so, it is possible to improve the performance of a cooling operation. In addition, since the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> is cooled by the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b>, it is possible to further improve the performance of a cooling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> is more likely to be frozen than the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> due to being exposed to low-temperature outside air. Thus, the operation of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> will hereinafter be described in further detail, focusing mainly on the prevention of water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> from freezing during a heating operation of a heat pump.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> includes an electrode unit <b>22</b> which generates an electric field and applies the electric field to the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> and a voltage generation unit <b>28</b> which applies a voltage, and more particularly, a high-frequency alternating voltage, to the electrode unit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The electrode unit <b>22</b> converts a high-frequency alternating voltage provided by the voltage generation unit <b>28</b> into an electric field, and applies the electric field to the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>. The electrode unit <b>22</b> may include plates or wires which are formed of a metal such as copper or platinum. More specifically, the electrode unit <b>22</b> includes a plurality of electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> which are disposed on the opposite sides of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are covered with electrode covers <b>25</b> and <b>27</b>, respectively, for the purpose of safety. The electrode covers <b>25</b> and <b>27</b> will be described later in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An electric field generated by the electrode unit <b>22</b> is caused by a high-frequency alternating voltage. The polarity of the electric field varies according to the frequency of the high-frequency alternating voltage. Thus, the electric field constantly vibrates and rotates water molecules composed of oxygen with a negative polarity (&#x2212;) and hydrogen with a positive polarity (+) so that water molecules can be prevented from being crystallized and can thus be maintained to be liquid even at temperatures below the freezing point of water.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The voltage generation unit <b>28</b> generates an alternating voltage according to setting values regarding a predetermined voltage magnitude and a predetermined frequency and applies the alternating voltage to the electrode unit <b>22</b>. The voltage generation unit <b>28</b> may vary at least one of the magnitude and frequency of a voltage, thereby generating an alternating voltage. More specifically, the voltage generation unit <b>28</b> generates an alternating voltage according to setting values (e.g., setting values regarding a predetermined voltage magnitude and a predetermined frequency) provided by a control unit <b>30</b> and applies the alternating voltage to the electrode unit <b>22</b> so that the electrode unit <b>22</b> can generate an electric field and apply the electric field to the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>. The voltage generator <b>28</b> may vary the frequency of a voltage so that the magnitude of the voltage can vary within the range of 0.5-10 KV. The voltage generator <b>28</b> may vary the frequency of a voltage within a high-frequency range ranging from 0.5 kHz to 500 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The voltage generation unit <b>28</b> applies an alternating voltage having a high frequency of 0.5-500 kHz because a voltage having a frequency lower than 0.5 kHz or higher than 500 kHz can only slightly rotate or vibrate water molecules, thereby resulting in the phase transformation of water. A voltage having a magnitude greater than 10 KV may result in dielectric breakdown of the electrode covers <b>25</b> and <b>27</b>. An alternating voltage having a frequency higher than 500 kHz may spread in the form of an electric wave, instead of generating an electric field. In addition, the speed at which the polarity of an alternating voltage having a frequency higher than 500 kHz varies may be excessively high so that the movement of water molecules cannot keep up with the variation of the polarity of the alternating voltage. Thus, the optimum frequency and the optimum voltage for a voltage generated by the voltage generation unit <b>28</b> may be set to the range of 0.5-500 kHz and the range of 0.5-10 KV, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> or the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> is a pin/tube-type heat exchanger including a coolant tube, which a coolant flows therethrough and is formed of aluminum or copper, and an aluminum pin, which is disposed in the coolant tube, an electric field generated by the electrode unit <b>22</b> may concentrate on the aluminum pin and generate heat due to the resistance of the aluminum pin. In general, when a voltage having a voltage of about 7000 V is applied to a stainless material as a direct current (DC) pulse, the stainless material emits negative ions, and the negative ions give an impulse to water molecules so that the water molecules can be prevented from freezing. By using this phenomenon, it is possible to prevent the freeze of water by applying a high voltage to the aluminum pin so that negative ions emitted from the aluminum pin can give an impulse to water molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">That is, it is possible to maintain an anti-freeze state by applying a high voltage to the aluminum pin. In addition, it is possible to reduce the probability of the occurrence of an electric shock by grounding the aluminum pin and providing an additional active electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the air conditioner may also include the control unit <b>30</b> and a load sensing unit <b>40</b>. The control unit <b>30</b> controls the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b>, and particularly, the voltage generation <b>28</b>, according to the state of operation of the air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The load sensing unit <b>40</b> determines the existence of water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> and the amount of water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>. The control unit <b>30</b> controls the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> according to the results of the sensing performed by the load sensing unit <b>40</b>. The load sensing unit <b>40</b> may include a temperature sensing unit which senses the temperature of a pipe connected to the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, the temperature of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> or the temperature outside the room where the air conditioner is installed. Alternatively, the load sensing unit <b>40</b> may include a current detection unit or a voltage detection unit which detects a current or voltage that results from an electric field generated by the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> during the operation of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">If the load sensing unit <b>40</b> includes a temperature sensing unit, the load sensing unit <b>40</b> may include at least one of an outdoor heat exchanger temperature sensor <b>42</b> which senses the temperature of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, an inlet temperature sensor <b>44</b> which senses the temperature of a pipe at the inlet of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, an outlet temperature sensor <b>46</b> which senses the temperature of a pipe at the outlet of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, and an outdoor temperature sensor <b>48</b> which senses the temperature outside the air conditioner. The control unit <b>30</b> may determine the existence of water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> or the amount of water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> based on the result of the sensing performed by at least one of the outdoor heat exchanger temperature sensor <b>42</b>, the inlet temperature sensor <b>44</b>, the outlet temperature sensor <b>46</b>, and the outdoor temperature sensor <b>48</b>. Then, the control unit <b>30</b> may determine whether to drive the voltage generation unit <b>28</b> and determine a frequency and a voltage magnitude for the voltage generation unit <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">If the load sensing unit <b>40</b> includes a current detection unit or a voltage detection unit, the resistance of the current detection unit or the voltage detection unit may vary according to the existence of water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> or the amount of water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>. Thus, the control unit <b>30</b> may determine the existence of water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> or the amount of water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> based on the resistance of the current detection unit or the voltage detection unit. Then, the control unit <b>30</b> may determine whether to drive the voltage generation unit <b>28</b> and determine a frequency and a voltage magnitude for the voltage generation unit <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The control unit <b>30</b> may control the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> not only by using the load sensing unit <b>40</b> but also by taking into consideration whether the air conditioner performs a heating operation. The control of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> by the control unit <b>30</b> will hereinafter be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">If the air conditioner satisfies a set of anti-freeze initiation conditions, the control unit <b>30</b> may drive the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b>. On the other hand, if the air conditioner satisfies a set of anti-freeze release conditions, the control unit <b>30</b> may terminate the operation of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The anti-freeze initiation conditions are the conditions in which water is generated on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> and is likely to freeze. The anti-freezing initiation conditions may include at least one of the following conditions: whether the air conditioner performs a heating operation, the amount of time for which long the compressor <b>2</b> of the air conditioner has been continuously driven, a water load condition, and an elapsed time after the initiation of an anti-freezing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, if the air conditioner performs a heating operation, the compressor <b>2</b> has been continuously driven for more than a predefined amount of time, the temperature of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> is lower than a reference temperature, and a predefined amount of time has not yet elapsed since the initiation of an anti-freeze operation, the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> may be driven. On the other hand, if the air conditioner performs an operation, other than a heating operation, the compressor <b>2</b> has been continuously driven, but for less than a predefined amount of time, the temperature of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> is higher than a reference temperature, and a predefined amount of time has already elapsed since the initiation of an anti-freeze operation, the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> may not be driven.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The anti-freeze release conditions are the conditions in which an anti-freeze operation is unnecessary because no water is generated on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> or because water, if any, on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> is less likely to freeze. The anti-freeze release conditions include at least one of the following conditions: whether the air conditioner performs a heating operation and a water load condition.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">For example, if a heating operation performed by the air conditioner is terminated during the operation of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> or if the temperature of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> is higher than a reference temperature, the operation of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> may be terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In addition, if the air conditioner performs a heating operation, the compressor <b>2</b> has been continuously driven for more than a predefined amount of time, and the temperature of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> is lower than a reference temperature, the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> may be driven regardless of an elapsed time after the initiation of an anti-freeze operation.

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Referring to a first energy line I (1.38 W) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, since a large amount of energy is applied to water, the temperature of water is almost uniformly maintained at 0&#xb0; C., and thus, super cooling does not occur even if water begins to freeze at its freezing point (a temperature of 0&#xb0; C. at a pressure of 1 atm).</p>

The greater the amount of energy applied to water, the higher the anti-freeze temperature becomes. On the other hand, the less the amount of energy applied to water, the lower the anti-freeze temperature becomes.

If the optimum frequency band and the optimum voltage are set to the range of 0.5-500 kHz and the range of 0.5-10 KV, respectively, an anti-freeze state of water may be effectively maintained regardless of a variation in the amount of water.

<p id="p-0137" num="0136">During a cooling operation of the air conditioner, a coolant sequentially passes through the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, the expansion device <b>6</b>, the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> and the compressor <b>2</b>, the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b> removes heat from air in a room in which the air conditioner is installed, and the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> releases the heat to the outside of the room.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">On the other hand, during a heating operation of the air conditioner, the control unit <b>30</b> drives the compressor <b>2</b>, controls the cooling/heating switching valve <b>10</b> to operate in a heating mode, and drives the motor <b>9</b>B of the indoor blower <b>9</b> and the motor <b>5</b>B of the outdoor blower <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">During a heating operation of the air conditioner, a coolant sequentially passes through the compressor <b>2</b>, the indoor heat exchanger <b>8</b>, the expansion device <b>6</b>, the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> and the compressor <b>2</b>, the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> removes heat from air from the outside of the room and the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> releases the heat into the room (S<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">During a heating operation of the air conditioner, condensed water is generated on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b>, and the control unit <b>30</b> drives the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> if the air conditioner satisfies a set of anti-freeze initiation conditions (S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">For example, if the air conditioner is currently performing a heating operation, the compressor <b>2</b> has been continuously driven for more than a predefined amount of time (e.g., for more than ten minutes), and the temperature of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> is lower than a reference temperature (e.g., a temperature 2&#xb0; C. higher than the freezing point of water), the control unit <b>30</b> may drive the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">More specifically, the control unit <b>30</b> controls the voltage generation unit <b>28</b> to apply a voltage having a predefined magnitude and belonging to a predefined frequency band to the electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. Then, an electric field is generated between the electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the electrode unit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The electric field continuously vibrates and rotates water molecules on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> so that the water molecules can become in a super-cooling state even before reaching the freezing point of water. Therefore, due to the electric field, water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> can be prevented from freezing.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In other words, the air conditioner can perform a heating operation while preventing water on the surface of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> from freezing. Thus, there is no need to perform a defrost operation during a heating operation of the air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">During the operation of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b>, the control unit <b>30</b> lowers the operating capacity of the air conditioner, and particularly, the operating capacity of the compressor <b>2</b> and the expansion device <b>6</b>, so that severe temperature variations can be prevented, and that an anti-freeze operation can be stably performed.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">When a predefined amount of time (e.g., three minutes) elapses after the initiation of the operation of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b>, the control unit <b>30</b> controls the voltage generation unit <b>28</b> to reduce the frequency of the voltage applied to the electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the electrode unit <b>22</b> and thus to reduce the power consumption of the air conditioner (S<b>4</b> and S<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The predefined amount of time is the time taken to stabilize an anti-freeze state and may be experimentally determined.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Once the anti-freeze state is stabilized, the motion in water molecules becomes regular and thus becomes less affected by a reduction in the frequency of the voltage applied to the electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. Therefore, the anti-freeze state can be uniformly maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The control unit <b>30</b> terminates the operation of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> if the air conditioner satisfies a set of anti-freeze release conditions (S<b>6</b> and S<b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">For example, if a heating operation of the air conditioner is terminated during the operation of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b> or if the temperature of the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> is higher than a reference temperature (e.g., a temperature 2&#xb0; C. higher than the freezing point of water), the control unit <b>30</b> may terminate the operation of the anti-freeze apparatus <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In other words, the control unit <b>30</b> cuts off the voltage applied to the electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the electrode unit <b>22</b> so that no electric field can be generated in the outdoor heat exchanger <b>4</b> any longer.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The control unit <b>30</b> may control the electrode units <b>22</b> and <b>22</b>&#x2032; to reciprocally generate an electric field.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The control unit <b>30</b> may control the voltage generation unit <b>28</b> to sequentially apply a voltage to the electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> and the electrodes <b>24</b>&#x2032; and <b>26</b>&#x2032; or to generate an electric field at the same time. An off period during which a voltage is not applied may be set. For example, the electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> may be turned on first. The electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> may be turned off a predefined amount of time after they are turned on. Then, the electrodes <b>24</b>&#x2032; and <b>26</b>&#x2032; may be turned on immediately or a predefined amount of time after the electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are turned off. The electrodes <b>24</b>&#x2032; and <b>26</b>&#x2032; may be turned off a predetermined amount of time after they are turned on.
