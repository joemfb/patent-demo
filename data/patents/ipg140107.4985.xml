<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A modulator, such as a polar modulator, in a wireless communications device may require spectral quality for modulation schemes. Typically, most wireless communications devices are based on constant-envelope modulation schemes (i.e., phase or frequency modulated). An advantage with constant-envelope modulation scheme provides that a final radio frequency (RF) power amplifier in the polar modulator does not have to be linear, and as a consequence, the final RF power amplifier can be operated in the most power efficient region near saturation. However, a drawback with constant-envelope modulation scheme is the inefficient use of the RF spectrum, where data rate transmission for a given bandwidth is not maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To utilize the RF spectrum efficiently, a varying envelope and varying phase modulation scheme may be used. When a varying envelope modulation is applied to a power efficient nonlinear amplifier, distortion may be generated by the nonlinear amplifier which may cause interference with adjacent channels. The distortion may also result in detection error of the information signal at the receiver end of the communication channel. For most applications, the distortion is to be avoided, and may require a linear amplifier; however, linear amplifiers typically have low power efficiency, making a linear amplifier unsuitable for varying envelope and phase modulation scheme. To obtain linear amplification and high power efficiency for transmission in the polar modulator, linearization of a power efficient and nonlinear amplifier may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Linearization may refer to a method of compensation or correction of non-linearity in a polar modulator component to maintain stability at the output of the polar modulator. Linearization of the polar modulator may require a feedback receiver component to couple the polar modulator output into a signal path of the amplifier's input. The feedback receiver component may produce linear amplification and power efficiency in the polar modulator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The feedback receiver component may be used as a quadrature demodulator and require additional circuitry (e.g., high frequency local oscillator, mixers, 90 degree shifters, etc.). Such additional circuitry may draw significant amounts of current in the polar modulator. Furthermore, delay sensitivity may further be included due to different delays in signal sources and local oscillator input used in the quadrature demodulator. The delay sensitivity may result in degradation of the circuitry at microwave frequencies due to sub nanosecond delay variation requirements.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This disclosure is directed towards techniques and methods of performing linearization in the polar modulator to attain linear amplification and high power efficiency during transmission. Although a polar modulator is described, it is contemplated that the techniques and methods may be applied to other modulators. The linearization may be implemented through the use of a polar feedback receiver in the polar demodulator to directly extract magnitude and phase baseband signal in modulated radio frequency (RF) output. The polar feedback receiver avoids the use of additional circuitry (e.g., quadrature demodulator) which may include additional current consumption and delay sensitivity in the polar modulator.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a polar modulator component <b>100</b> that includes a baseband component <b>102</b> and a RF component <b>104</b>. During transmission, baseband component <b>102</b> may encode a data signal; identify the data signal's prior state before modulation; convert the inphase signal (I) and quadrature phase signal (Q) into polar form; and transmit the data signal for modulation. Output from the baseband component <b>102</b> is referred to as a baseband signal. During demodulation, baseband component <b>102</b> may identify the prior state of the data signal following demodulation. The baseband component <b>102</b> decodes the demodulated data signal to re-create the data signal. The prior state of the data signal may include attributes of the data signal, such as amplitudes of I and Q, frequency, and phase amount.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">During modulation, RF component <b>104</b> may combine the baseband signal with RF frequency carrier to produce a modulated RF frequency signal, amplify the modulated RF frequency signal, and further filter the modulated RF frequency signal before transmission. The RF frequency carrier may refer to the frequency of oscillation in the RF component <b>104</b> when a modulating baseband signal is not present. During receiving, the RF component <b>104</b> may receive the modulated RF frequency signal, amplify the modulated RF frequency signal, filter the modulated RF frequency signal, and demodulate the modulated RF frequency signal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A signal from peripherals, camera, display etc. <b>106</b> may be received by Input/Output (I/O) component <b>108</b> for initial processing. The I/O component <b>108</b> may convert analog data signals into digital data signals, while the digital data signals are maintained in the same state (i.e., remain digital). Furthermore, the I/O component <b>108</b> may process the data signals to produce the amplitudes of I and Q.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The data signals <b>110</b> are received by a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>112</b>. The DSP <b>112</b> may use a filter to limit the bandwidth forming a spectrum of the equivalent low pass signal or baseband signal. The DSP <b>112</b> may include a Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) component to transform the amplitudes of I and Q of the baseband signal into equivalent polar representations. The equivalent polar representations may contain the phase and magnitude of the baseband signal, where the magnitude of the baseband signal may also refer to amplitude of the baseband signal.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">After transformation of the baseband signal into the equivalent polar form, the baseband signal from the DSP <b>112</b> may pass through digital interface <b>114</b>. The digital interface <b>114</b> may provide concurrent bi-directional communications between the baseband component <b>102</b> and RF component <b>104</b>. The digital interface <b>114</b> may contain clock signals to provide timing references for transmit and receive communications between baseband component <b>102</b> and RF component <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">During transmission, the baseband signal from digital interface <b>114</b> is received by phase modulator/analog signal processing component <b>116</b>. The phase modulator/analog signal processing component <b>116</b> may include an output that contains the modulated RF signal by varying the phase and magnitude of the RF carrier corresponding to the baseband signal to be transmitted. The phase modulator/analog signal processing component <b>116</b> may further support the linearization mechanism for the polar modulator <b>100</b>. A modulated RF signal <b>118</b>, which is the output of phase modulator/analog signal processing component <b>116</b>, is passed to a nonlinear amplifier <b>120</b> for further amplification before transmission. The nonlinear amplifier <b>120</b> may include a relatively high power efficient amplifier suitable for varying envelope and phase modulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A modulated RF signal <b>122</b> is an output of the nonlinear amplifier <b>120</b>. The modulated signal <b>122</b> may contain distortions which may cause interference in the adjacent channels. The distortions may be caused by unexpected delay between the phase modulation signal and amplitude modulation signal. The unexpected delay may result in the signals (e.g., phase modulation and amplitude modulation) being applied to different portions of the RF carrier. Furthermore, the amplitude modulation may cause inadvertent phase modulation due to undesired feedback between phase modulation components and amplitude modulation components. The distortions may not only cause interference to the adjacent channels, but may also affect reception at the receiving end. Therefore, the distortions should be avoided in order to produce linear amplification, and for high power efficiency transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an implementation, linearization may be used to compensate for the distortions at the polar modulator <b>100</b>. The linearization may include coupling of the polar modulator <b>100</b> output (i.e., signal <b>122</b>) into a polar feedback receiver <b>124</b>. The polar feedback receiver <b>124</b> may be used for polar demodulation of the loop back polar modulator <b>100</b> output in order to directly extract the phase and magnitude of the modulated RF signal. A linearization mechanism that includes the polar feedback receiver <b>124</b> may be made adaptive by extracting an error signal (e.g., phase and magnitude distortion) coefficient at the output (i.e., signal <b>122</b>) of the polar modulator <b>100</b>. The error signal coefficient may include unexpected delay between the phase modulation signal and amplitude modulation signal which may result in distortions in the polar modulator <b>100</b>. An input path signal <b>126</b> to the nonlinear amplifier <b>120</b> may be adjusted in accordance with the extracted error signal coefficient (e.g., phase and magnitude distortion) of the polar modulator <b>100</b> during real time operation, to effectively and continuously minimize distortion in the polar modulator <b>100</b> output. The adjusted modulated RF signal may be transmitted through antenna <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a RF component <b>104</b> using the polar feedback receiver <b>124</b> for linearization of the polar modulator <b>100</b>. After transformation of the amplitudes of I and Q into polar form in DSP <b>112</b> of the baseband component <b>102</b>, a baseband phase signal <b>200</b> and baseband magnitude signal <b>202</b> is received by RF component <b>104</b>.
