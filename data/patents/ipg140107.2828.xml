<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Fostriecin (or FST) is a polyketide with phosphate compound inititally separated (1983) from soil bacteria, <i>Streptomyces pulveraceus</i>. Fostriecin was also successfully synthesized via total synthesis by the research group of Boger in 2001. Meanwhile, other compounds (PD113270 and PD113271) with similar structure were also separated and detected in the natural FST producing strains having the structural formula below (see Lewy et. al., 2002).</p>

<br/>
and ovarian cancer is well-known in the art (leukaemia cells L1210, IC<sub>50</sub>=0.46 mM), FST is also effective in anti-tumors in vivo. Generally speaking, the activitiy of FST in anti-tumor is due to the selective inhibition on protein phophatase PP2A (IC<sub>50</sub>=1.5 nM) and PP4 (IC<sub>50</sub>=3 nM). It has been reported that the chemical synthetic and the naturally occurring FST analogues possess similar activities. For details of FST and analogues thereof, by reference, see Lewy et. al., 2002, &#x201c;Fostriecin: Chemistry and Biology&#x201d; Current Medicinal Chemistry 9: 2005-2032. Phase I of the clinical test for FST was stopped due to the difficulty in controlling the chemical purity of the products among different batches and the relatively low stability of the compounds both in vitro and in vivo (e.g. the dephosphation of FST results in the inactivated dephosphorylated FST). Development of FST derivatives of high purity, especially of high stability is highly required.
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">FST is a weak inhibitor against topoisomerase II (IC<sub>50</sub>=50 mM), which, however, is the most powerful selective PP2A and PP4 inhibitor. Since some other protein phophatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid and calyculin A generally exhibit the tumor-promoting activity rather than the anti-tumor activity, people are interested in the correlation of the anti-tumor activity of FST with its enzymatic inhibitory activity. In addition, it should be noted that FST can promote the compaction of chromatin, and render the tumor cells sensitive to radiotherapy. Therefore, in order to obtain an effective therapeutic approach in treating tumors or other diseases, development of a series of novel FST analogues either for single administration or combinatory administration is highly required. If it is possible to prepare some FST derivatives with higher stability, such kind of compounds must be clinically more effective, and hence, become a more effective means for treating cancers and are promising to become a novel anti-tumor drug having a novel mechansium of action.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">The objective of the present invention is to provide a series of novel and more stable FST compounds, and to provide the methods for preparing the same, for example by means of chemical modifications and/or genetic engeneering method. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising said compound, and use of said FST compounds in the preparation of the pharmaceutical composition for antitumor, inhibition of cell excessive growth, termination of cell growth, or reduction of myocardial infarction and injury to a cell.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0027">Firstly, dephosphorylated FST can be obtained by biochemical enzymolysis (as described in Example 1) or fermentation of a recombinant genetic engineering strain (as described in Example 2). Said recombinant genetic engineering strain comprises a modified-FST biosynthetic enzyme gene in which the DNA sequence (fosK gene) for encoding phosphorylated kinases (homoserine kinases) is inactivated by mutation, deletion or substitution of recombinant techniques. Said phosphorylated enzyme (kinases) FosK is responsible for the FST phosphorylation in FST biosynthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">Dehydroxylated FST can be obtained by fermentation of a recombinant genetic engineering strain of the present invention. Said strain comprises a modified FST biosynthetic enzyme gene in which the DNA sequence for encoding one of the three cytochrome P450 hydroxylated enzymes in a FST biosynthetic enzyme gene in a FST producing strain is inactivated by mutation, deletion or substitution of recombinant techniques. FST biosynthetic enzyme comprises three P450 gene encoding hydroxylated enzymes responsible for the hydroxylation to be taken place at C8 and C18 for FST, and at C4 for PD 113, 271, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">The genetic engineering strain of the present invention is obtained by DNA recombinant technique, by which a recombinant genetic engineering producing strain is obtained as a result of inactivation or substitution of one or more genes or functional groups involved in the FST biosynthesis by means of homologous recombination, i.e., cloning a gene or the functional group need to be modified to a suicide vector, followed by double-crossover between the gene in the suicide vector with the homologous gene of the genome contained in nucleus of the host cell. Said inactivation can be achieved by random or point genetic mutation, deletion or substitution. Thus obtained recombinant biosynthetic gene is different from the natural biosynthetic gene, and FST derivatives can be produced in the recombinant host cell as the main product.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">Compounds of formula I in some embodiments according to the present invention can be prepared from dephosphorylated FST or derivatives thereof using the general method as shown in the reaction scheme 1 below. The particularly preferable compound A can also be prepared from dephosphorylated FST using the method as described in Example 3 or the general method as shown in the reaction scheme 1.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">1. FST is subjected to biochemical enzymolysis to afford the dephosphorylated FST.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">2. Protecting groups may be present in the FST compounds to protect the corresponding functional groups from undergoing any undesirable side reactions, such as acylation, etherification, oxidation, solvolysis and the like. The protecting groups are characterized in that they get easily to be removed by solvolysis, reduction, and photolysis or by enzyme, and that they do not exist in the end products. For example, firstly the free 11-hydroxyl group and 18-hydroxyl group of FST are protected by TBDPS protecting groups, and then the free 8-hydroxyl group of FST is selectively protected by TES or TBS protecting group, to afford the protected dephosphorylated FST intermediate (P&#x2014;S).</p>
