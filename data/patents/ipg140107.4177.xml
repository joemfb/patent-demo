<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/CN2010/079892, filed on Dec. 16, 2010, which claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 201010107550.5, filed on Feb. 9, 2010, both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entireties.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to the circuit technology field, and in particular, to a DSL protection circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With development of the access network, different access technologies thrive, including ADSL2+ (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line, asymmetric digital subscriber line) and digital subscriber line (Digital Subscriber Line, shorted as DSL hereinafter) of VDSL2 (Very-high-bit-rate Digital Subscriber loop, very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber loop) that are considered as the most advanced and operable mainstream technologies. The DSL technology uses the existing entering-home copper strand wire as the medium and provides different bandwidth through different modulation modes to implement access of subscribers with different rates and solve the problem of last-mile access.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Copper cables for transmitting DSL signals are generally laid at an outdoor exposed environment at a length of several miles and are easy to be affected by overvoltage and overcurrent due to lightning strike, surge, and power line faults. Therefore, a protection design is required for subscriber ports of an access device. A general xDSL interface circuit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. On the xDSL circuit, a transformer and a high-voltage capacitor are available for the bandwidth part, isolation and protection can be almost implemented. The major problem is about protection of a splitter. In an actual application, generally, a DSL device is installed in an outdoor cabinet, a plain old telephone service (Plain Old Telephone Service, shorted as POTS hereinafter) wire is connected to a central equipment room, and a Line (port of mixed DSL signal and POTS signal) wire is connected to a DSL subscriber's home, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As the POTS wire and the Line wire are connected to different places, the following situation may occur: A two-wire short-circuit fault or grounding fault occurs on one end and lightning strike, power line induction, or contact occurs on the other end; at this time, overvoltage is added to two ends of the splitter or high current passes the splitter, and in this case, the splitter is damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A splitter of a DSL access device in the prior art is completely isolated and protected and no protection component is added to the splitter. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the splitter includes: discrete inductance (L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, L<b>3</b>) and capacitance component (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, C<b>5</b>), and the splitter uses a L<b>3</b> inductance for filtering, in which the inductance L<b>3</b> is used to suppress EMI (Election Magnetic Interference, election magnetic interference) common-mode induction. Ports of the splitter are completely isolated and protected. When P-XT or P-XR of the POTS at one end is short-circuited or to-ground short-circuited, horizontal surge voltage from the Line at the other end may be added to two ends of the splitter or high current passes the coil of the splitter due to contact, causing damage or on-fire to the splitter; reversely, when L-XT or L-XR of the Line at the other end is short-circuited or to-ground short-circuited, vertical surge voltage from the Line at the other end is added to two ends of the splitter or high current passes the coil of the splitter due to contact, also causing damage or on-fire to the splitter. In addition, the splitter as a discrete component has a large size, affecting density of a board.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">POTS and Line ports of some xDSL devices in the prior art use the protection solution of the fuse (Fuse) plus the voltage-switch thyristor surge suppressor diode (Thyristor Surge Suppressor, shorted as TSS hereinafter), and the protection circuit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When T and R at one end of the circuit are short-circuit or to-ground short-circuited, as the loop resistance of the splitter is only about 20&#x3a9;, when the current passing the splitter is not high enough to reach the start voltage of the TSS, the TSS does not work and cannot protect the splitter. When horizontal or vertical power line from the other end contacts the current to pass the coil of the splitter, high current passes the splitter because even if the fuse exists, the maximum non-operating current of the fuse within 15 minutes is still high, for example, about 2 A, and the loop resistance of the splitter is about 20&#x3a9;, and the splitter is overheated after a long time and damage or fire results.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the process of implementing the technical solutions of the present application, the splitter in the prior art has at least the following problem: The splitter is prone to be damaged when a two-wire short-circuit fault or grounding fault occurs on one end and lightning strike, power line induction, or contact occurs on the other end.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present application provides a DSL protection circuit to prevent a splitter from being damaged or getting on fire when a two-wire short-circuit fault or grounding fault occurs on one end of the splitter and lighting strike, power line induction or contact occurs on the other end.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embodiment of the present application provides a DSL protection circuit, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The DSL protection circuit includes: a DSL and POTS broadband and narrowband mixed signal port <b>4</b>, a narrowband POTS port <b>5</b>, and a splitter <b>6</b>, where the DSL and POTS broadband and narrowband mixed signal port <b>4</b> is connected to the narrowband POTS port <b>5</b> through the splitter <b>6</b>, and a line on which an input end or output end of the splitter is cascaded with a restorable current-limited component <b>2</b> for limiting abnormal current; the line on which the splitter <b>6</b> and the restorable current-limited component <b>2</b> are cascaded is connected in parallel with a voltage-limited component <b>3</b> for bypass of the splitter <b>6</b>; a line on which the DSL and POTS broadband and narrowband mixed signal port <b>4</b> is or a line on which the narrowband POTS port <b>5</b> is cascaded with an overcurrent fuse component <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The restorable current-limited component <b>2</b> according to the embodiment of the present application is a component that can limit abnormal current, for example, a thermistor; the voltage-limited component <b>3</b> is a component for bypass of the splitter <b>6</b>, for example, a gas discharge tube (Gas Discharge Tube, shorted as GDT); the current fuse component <b>1</b> is a security component that fuses when overcurrent occurs, for example, a fuse. It should be noted that any components that have the above functions may replace the components provided in the embodiment of the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The following takes an example that the restorable current-limited component <b>2</b> is a thermistor, the voltage-limited component <b>3</b> is a gas discharge tub, and the current fuse component <b>1</b> is a fuse, to describe the principle of circuit protection according to the embodiment of the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when a short-circuit or to-ground short-circuit fault occurs on T and R of a Line end <b>4</b>, and overvoltage and overcurrent occurs on a POTS end due to surge, power line induction or contact: 1) When overvoltage occurs due to surge, thermistors RT<b>1</b> and RT<b>2</b> do not act, but gas discharge tubes G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> are enabled and protect the splitter because of resistance and induction effects of a coil in the splitter <b>6</b>; 2) When overcurrent occurs due to the fault of a power line, for overcurrent with high current and short duration, the thermistors RT<b>1</b> and RT<b>2</b> act in a high impedance state to trigger the enabling of the gas discharge tubes G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>, so as to provide the overcurrent protection for the splitter <b>6</b>; for overcurrent with high current and long duration, the thermistors RT<b>1</b> and RT<b>2</b> act in a high impedance state to trigger the enabling of the gas discharge tubes G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>, and then the gas discharge tubes G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> are overheated and perform FS action to implement bypass of the overcurrent, to prevent on-fire or explosion of the gas discharge tubes G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>; for overcurrent with very high current, fuses F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> fuse and become open-circuited, thereby preventing the device from getting on fire or other security problems. Reversely, when a short-circuit or to-ground short-circuit fault occurs on T and R of the POTS end, and overvoltage and overcurrent occur on the other end, the Line end, due to surge, power line induction or contact, the principle of the circuit protection is similar.</p>

An input end of the splitter <b>6</b>, that is, the end connected to the line end <b>4</b> is cascaded with thermistors RT<b>1</b> and RT<b>2</b>, and a gas discharge tube G<b>1</b> is connected in parallel with a line on which the splitter <b>6</b> is cascaded with the thermistor RT<b>1</b>, and a gas discharge tube G<b>2</b> is connected in parallel with a line on which the splitter <b>6</b> is cascaded with the thermistor RT<b>2</b>; an end of the narrowband POTS port, that is, the end where the splitter is connected to the line end <b>4</b> is cascaded with fuses F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment, G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> are two-electrode gas discharge tubes with the Fail-Safe (FS) function.</p>

The direct current breakdown voltage is not larger than 300 V, and the joint capacitance is smaller than 2 pF. The FS function is a fail-safe protection function, that is, when the GDT is enabled for a long time and becomes overheated, the FS is started and reliably short-circuits two poles of the GDT, to ensure the safe failure of the GDT.</li>
