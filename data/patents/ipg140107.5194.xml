<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for detecting potential failures by a lead of an implantable medical device is provided. The method includes sensing a first signal over a first channel between a first combination of electrodes on the lead and sensing a second signal from a second channel between a second combination of electrodes on the lead. The method determines whether at least one of the first and second signals is representative of a potential failure in the lead and identifies a failure and the electrode associated with the failure based on which of the first and second sensed signals is representative of the potential failure. Optionally, when the first and second sensed signals are both representative of the potential failure, the method further includes determining whether the first and second sensed signals are correlated with one another. When the first and second sensed signals are correlated, the method declares an electrode common to both of the first and second combinations to be associated with the failure.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention generally pertain to implantable medical devices and more particularly to methods and systems that identify potential lead failures in the devices and take corrective action based thereon.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An implantable medical device (IMD) is implanted in a patient to monitor, among other things, electrical activity of a heart and to deliver appropriate electrical therapy, as required. Implantable medical devices include pacemakers, cardioverters, defibrillators, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), and the like. The electrical therapy produced by an IMD may include pacing pulses, cardioverting pulses, and/or defibrillator pulses to reverse arrhythmias (e.g., tachycardias and bradycardias) or to stimulate the contraction of cardiac tissue (e.g., cardiac pacing) to return the heart to its normal sinus rhythm.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electrodes coupled to leads are implanted in the heart to sense the electrical activity of the heart and to deliver electrical therapy to the heart. The electrodes communicate the electrical activity as cardiac signals to the IMD via the leads. The electrodes may be placed within the chambers of the heart and/or secured to the heart by partially inserting the electrodes into the heart. The cardiac signals sensed by the electrodes are used by the IMD to deliver appropriate pacing therapy and/or stimulation pulses, or &#x201c;shocks&#x201d; to the heart.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A lead failure occurs when an electrode fails. The electrodes may fail and no longer be capable of accurately sensing and communicating cardiac signals to the IMD. Known lead failures involve electrodes fracturing, breaking or becoming dislodged from the myocardium. Lead failures can result in increased noise in the cardiac signals communicated to the IMD. With respect to fractured electrodes, the noise may be caused by the fractured components of the electrode rapidly making and breaking contact with one another at the fracture site. This type of noise may be referred to as chatter noise.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Lead failures can result in an IMD applying unnecessary or incorrect pacing or stimulation pulses to the heart. For example, if chatter noise occurs at a sufficiently high rate, the IMD may misclassify the rate of the chatter noise as a tachycardia or fibrillation, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). The IMD may then erroneously apply pacing or stimulation pulses to the heart. Such unnecessary pacing and stimulation pulses can cause significant discomfort to patients.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Systems have been proposed to detect lead failures based on certain parameters such as differences in R to R intervals, high impedance, impedance trends and slew rate. However, prior detection systems do not identify which individual electrode(s) is associated with a lead failure. Nor do prior detection systems offer robust solutions to mitigate failures in sensing electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Early detection of lead failures and the locations of the lead failures is desired. Early detection and notification of a lead failure may enable the patient's physician to reconfigure the IMD to avoid using the failed electrode. Alternatively, the physician may otherwise adjust treatment of a patient until the failed lead can be replaced. Known methods of detecting lead failures may not accurately detect a location of the lead failure. That is, while the method may be able to determine that a lead failure has occurred, the methods do not provide the patient's physician with a location of the failure, such as an identification of the electrode on the lead that has failed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A need exists for a method and system that identifies a potential lead failure in an IMD and the location of the failure. As the application of stimulation and pacing pulses to a patient's heart largely depends on the accurate sensing of cardiac signals, detecting failed leads may avoid continued sensing using the failed leads. Additionally, earlier detection of failed leads may permit physicians to reconfigure operation of the IMD to avoid continued use of the failed leads until the leads can be replaced.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a method for detecting potential failures by a lead of an implantable medical device is provided. The method includes sensing a first signal over a first channel between a first combination of electrodes on the lead and sensing a second signal from a second channel between a second combination of electrodes on the lead. The method determines whether at least one of the first and second signals is representative of a potential failure in the lead and identifies a failure and the electrode associated with the failure based on which of the first and second sensed signals is representative of the potential failure. Optionally, when the first and second sensed signals are both representative of the potential failure, the method further includes determining whether the first and second sensed signals are correlated with one another. When the first and second sensed signals are correlated, the method declares an electrode common to both of the first and second combinations to be associated with the failure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, an implantable medical device is provided. The device includes a lead, a channel selection module and a failure detection module. The lead includes electrodes configured to be positioned within a heart and capable of sensing cardiac signals to determine a first signal over a first channel between a first combination of the electrodes and a second signal over a second channel between a second combination of the electrodes. The channel selection module is configured to control which of the electrodes are included in the first and second combinations of electrodes. The failure detection module determines whether at least one of the first and second signals is representative of a potential failure in the lead. The failure detection module also identifies a failure and the electrode associated with the failure based on which of the first and second sensed signals is representative of the potential failure. Optionally, the failure detection module compares at least one of an amplitude, a rate and a slew rate of the first and second signals to a predetermined threshold representative of a physiologically acceptable limit for the corresponding one of the amplitude, rate and slew rate. The channel selection module may be configured to enable a different third channel to sense cardiac signals from a third combination of electrodes when a failure is identified by the failure detection module.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, a method is provided for detecting potential failures by an implantable medical lead. The method senses a first signal over a first channel between a first combination of electrodes on the lead. The method determines whether the first signal is representative of a potential failure in the lead, obtains a secondary indicator of heart condition and utilizes the secondary indicator to confirm an arrhythmia of the heart when the determining operation identifies the lead to include the potential failure. The secondary indicator may represent an impedance plethysmography measurement indicative of a stroke volume. The secondary indicator may represent a hemodynamic indicator from one of a pressure sensor located in a heart chamber, a heart sound sensor and a peak endocardial acceleration sensor. The secondary indicator may be obtained from a hemodynamic sensor, where the secondary indicator is tested after the determining operation identifies the potential failure based on the first signal, and the secondary indicator is analyzed before delivery of a therapy. The method may further comprise performing additional analysis of a heart, when the secondary indicator is representative of normal sinus rhythm, before delivering a therapy.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the present invention may be practiced. These embodiments, which are also referred to herein as &#x201c;examples,&#x201d; are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. It is to be understood that the embodiments may be combined or that other embodiments may be utilized, and that structural, logical, and electrical variations may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. In this document, the terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; are used, as is common in patent documents, to include one or more than one. In this document, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is used to refer to a nonexclusive or, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with certain embodiments, methods and systems are provided for detecting potential failures of a lead in an implantable medical device. In one embodiment, the systems and methods described herein provide for the sensing of cardiac signals over different combinations of electrodes joined to a lead to identify an electrode associated with the lead failure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an implantable medical device (IMD) <b>100</b> coupled to a heart <b>102</b> in accordance with one embodiment. The IMD <b>100</b> may be a cardiac pacemaker, an ICD, a defibrillator, an ICD coupled with a pacemaker, a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) pacemaker, a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D), and the like. The IMD <b>100</b> may be a dual-chamber stimulation device capable of treating both fast and slow arrhythmias with stimulation therapy, including cardioversion, defibrillation, and pacing stimulation, as well as capable of detecting heart failure, evaluating its severity, tracking the progression thereof, and controlling the delivery of therapy and warnings in response thereto. Alternatively, the IMD <b>100</b> may be a triple- or quad-chamber stimulation device. Optionally, the IMD <b>100</b> may be a multisite stimulation device capable of applying stimulation pulses to multiple sites within each of one or more chambers of the heart <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The IMD <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>110</b> that is joined to several leads <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. The leads <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are located at various locations of the heart <b>102</b>, such as an atrium, a ventricle, or both, to measure cardiac signals of the heart <b>102</b>. The leads <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> include the right ventricular (RV) lead <b>104</b>, the right atrial (RA) lead <b>106</b>, and the coronary sinus lead <b>108</b>. Several electrodes are provided on the leads <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. The housing <b>110</b> may be one of the electrodes and is often referred to as the &#x201c;can&#x201d;, &#x201c;case&#x201d;, or &#x201c;case electrode.&#x201d; The RV lead <b>104</b> is coupled with an RV tip electrode <b>122</b>, an RV ring electrode <b>124</b>, and an RV coil electrode <b>126</b>. The RV lead <b>104</b> may include a superior vena cava (SVC) coil electrode <b>128</b>. The right atrial lead <b>106</b> includes an atrial tip electrode <b>112</b> and an atrial ring electrode <b>114</b>. The coronary sinus lead <b>108</b> includes a left ventricular (LV) tip electrode <b>116</b>, a left atrial (LA) ring electrode <b>118</b> and an LA coil electrode <b>120</b>. Alternatively, the coronary sinus lead <b>108</b> may be a quadropole lead that includes several electrodes disposed within the left ventricle. Leads and electrodes other than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be included in the IMD <b>100</b> and positioned in or proximate to the heart <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The IMD <b>100</b> senses cardiac signals over predetermined sensing channels on the leads <b>104</b>-<b>108</b>. A sensing channel is formed by one, two or other combination of the electrodes <b>110</b>-<b>128</b>. For example, the electrodes <b>110</b>-<b>128</b> associated with a channel may include two electrodes provided on the same lead <b>104</b>-<b>108</b> and/or located in the same chamber of the heart <b>102</b>. Alternatively, a channel may include electrodes <b>110</b>-<b>128</b> provided on different leads <b>104</b>-<b>108</b> and/or located in different chambers of the heart <b>102</b>. The electrodes used to sense cardiac signals for each channel are electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> primarily positioned inside the heart <b>102</b>. Using electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> within the heart <b>102</b> to sense signals over the channels may reduce the risk of sensing myopotentials, which could affect the cardiac signals used to identify potential lead failures. In one embodiment, a first channel senses cardiac signals using the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> and the RV ring electrode <b>124</b>. A second channel senses cardiac signals using the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> and the SVC coil electrode <b>128</b>. The first channel may be referred to as a bipolar channel and the second channel may be referred to as an integrated bipolar channel. While the discussion herein is in connection with example bipolar and integrated bipolar channels, the channels may include a different combination of electrodes, including one or more of the housing <b>110</b>, the LV tip electrode <b>116</b>, the LA ring electrode <b>118</b>, the LA coil electrode <b>120</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Optionally, one or more of the leads <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may include a hemodynamic sensor <b>117</b> and/or <b>119</b> that obtains a secondary indicator of heart condition. Alternatively, or in addition, a hemodynamic sensor <b>115</b> may be provided on a separate lead <b>113</b> and located outside, but proximate to, the heart to monitor the heart condition. The sensors <b>115</b>, <b>117</b> and <b>119</b> may represent one or more of an impedance plethysmography sensor to sense stroke volume, a pressure sensor to sense pressure in one or more chambers of the heart, a heart sound sensor to sense sounds produced by the heart and an endocardial sensor to sense a peak endocardial acceleration. The signals from sensors <b>115</b>, <b>117</b> and <b>119</b> are representative of normal or abnormal sinus rhythm.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a block diagram of exemplary internal components of the IMD <b>100</b>. The housing <b>110</b> of the IMD <b>100</b> includes several inputs to receive signals measured or sensed by the electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The inputs may include one or more of an LV tip input (VL TIP) <b>200</b>, an LA ring input (AL RING) <b>202</b>, an LA coil input (AL COIL) <b>204</b>, an RA tip input (AR TIP) <b>206</b>, an RV ring input (VR RING) <b>208</b>, an RV tip input (VR TIP) <b>210</b>, an RV coil input <b>212</b> and an SVC coil input <b>214</b>. The inputs may also include one or more hemodynamic sensor inputs <b>211</b> that are connected to sensors <b>117</b> and <b>119</b> on one or more of leads <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. One or more hemodynamic lead inputs <b>213</b> may be connected to one or more hemodynamic sensors <b>115</b> on a separate lead <b>113</b>. As the names of the inputs <b>200</b>-<b>214</b> imply, the inputs <b>200</b>-<b>214</b> are electrically coupled with the corresponding electrodes and sensors <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). For example, the LV tip input <b>200</b> may be connected with the LV tip electrode <b>116</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); the LA ring input <b>202</b> may connected with the LA ring electrode <b>118</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); the LA coil input <b>204</b> may be connected with the LA coil electrode <b>120</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); the RA tip input <b>206</b> may be connected with the RA tip electrode <b>112</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); the RV ring input <b>208</b> may be connected with the RV ring electrode <b>124</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); the RV tip input <b>210</b> may be connected with the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); the RV coil input <b>212</b> may be connected with the RV coil electrode <b>126</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); and the SVC coil input <b>214</b> may be connected with the SVC coil electrode <b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The IMD <b>100</b> includes a programmable microcontroller <b>216</b>, which controls the operation of the IMD <b>100</b> based on sensed cardiac signals. The microcontroller <b>216</b> (also referred to herein as a processor, processor module, or unit) typically includes a microprocessor, or equivalent control circuitry, and may be specifically designed for controlling the delivery of stimulation therapy and may further include RAM or ROM memory, logic and timing circuitry, state machine circuitry, and I/O circuitry. The microcontroller <b>216</b> receives, processes, and manages storage of digitized data from the various electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The cardiac signals and hemodynamic signals sensed by the electrodes and sensors <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> are communicated through the inputs <b>200</b>-<b>214</b> to an electronically configured switch bank, or switch, <b>232</b>. The switch <b>232</b> includes a plurality of switches for connecting the desired electrodes and switches <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and inputs <b>200</b>-<b>214</b> to the appropriate I/O circuits. The switch <b>232</b> closes and opens switches to provide electrically conductive paths between the circuitry of the IMD <b>100</b> and the inputs <b>200</b>-<b>214</b> in response to a control signal <b>250</b>. The cardiac signals are then communicated to an analog-to-digital (ND) data acquisition system <b>230</b>, a bipolar sensing amplifier <b>268</b>, or an integrated bipolar sensing amplifier <b>270</b>. The hemodynamic signals are communicated through the ND data acquisition system <b>230</b> to the microcontroller <b>216</b>. The microcontroller <b>216</b> may sense cardiac signals over a first channel between the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the RV ring electrode <b>124</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and over a second channel between the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> and the SVC coil electrode <b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The first channel may also be referred to as the bipolar channel. The second channel may be referred to as the integrated bipolar channel. The amplifiers <b>268</b>, <b>270</b> produce a difference between the input cardiac signals and output difference signals to the data acquisition system <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A control signal <b>234</b> from the microcontroller <b>216</b> determines when the data acquisition system <b>230</b> acquires signals, stores the signals in a memory <b>236</b> via a data/address bus <b>238</b>, or transmits data to an external device <b>240</b> via a telemetry circuit <b>272</b>. An atrial sensing circuit <b>242</b> and a ventricular sensing circuit <b>244</b> are selectively coupled to the leads <b>104</b>-<b>108</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through the switch <b>232</b> for sensing cardiac activity in the chambers of the heart <b>102</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Control signals <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> from the microcontroller <b>216</b> direct output of the atrial and ventricular sensing circuits <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The microcontroller <b>216</b> may include one or more modules and processors that examine the cardiac and hemodynamic signals to identify a potential failure in a lead <b>104</b>-<b>108</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The microcontroller <b>216</b> also may include modules and/or processors that enact or perform remedial responses or actions to mitigate the lead failure. A channel selection module <b>264</b> of the microcontroller <b>216</b> determines the sensing and therapy delivery channels. For example, the channel selection module <b>264</b> determines which combinations of the housing <b>110</b> and/or the electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> (shown in Figure <b>1</b>) are included in a particular sensing channel to sense cardiac signals associated with the particular sensing channel. The channel selection module <b>264</b> may vary which of the housing <b>110</b> and/or electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> are associated with a channel through the control signal <b>250</b> to the switch <b>232</b>. Optionally, only the first channel or only the second channel may be used for sensing. The channel selection module <b>264</b> disables a channel when a lead failure involving one of the electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> associated with the channel is identified by the microcontroller <b>216</b>. In order to mitigate a lead failure, the channel selection module <b>264</b> may disable sensing over a channel associated with the lead failure and enable a different channel to sense cardiac signals.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A failure detection module <b>266</b> determines whether a potential lead failure exists. For example and as described below, the failure detection module <b>266</b> may identify a potential lead failure based on cardiac signals sensed over the sensing channels. The failure detection module <b>266</b> identifies a lead failure and one or more electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> that are associated with the failure based on which of the signals from the sensing channel(s) are/is representative of the potential failure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An impedance measuring circuit <b>218</b> measures electrical impedance characteristics between predetermined combinations of the housing <b>110</b> and/or the electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The impedance measuring circuit <b>218</b> is enabled by the microcontroller <b>216</b> via a control signal <b>220</b>. The impedance measuring circuit <b>218</b> may measure a voltage potential at one or more electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> and/or a voltage potential difference between two or more electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b>. The electrical impedance measured may be utilized as a secondary indicator to confirm or reject a potential lead failure. An atrial pulse generator <b>222</b> and a ventricular pulse generator <b>224</b> each are configured to generate the pacing and/or non-pacing stimulation pulses to the atrial and ventricular chambers of the heart <b>102</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), respectively. The pulse generators <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> are controlled via corresponding control signals <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> from the microcontroller <b>216</b> to trigger the stimulation pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The memory <b>236</b> may be embodied in a computer-readable storage medium such as a ROM, RAM, flash memory, or other type of memory. The microcontroller <b>216</b> is coupled to the memory <b>236</b> by the data/address bus <b>238</b>. The memory <b>236</b> may store programmable operating parameters and thresholds used by the microcontroller <b>216</b>, as required, in order to customize operation of IMD <b>100</b> to suit the needs of a particular patient. The memory <b>236</b> may store data indicative of cardiac and hemodynamic signals sensed by the electrodes <b>112</b>-<b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The operating parameters of the IMD <b>100</b> may be non-invasively programmed into the memory <b>236</b> through the telemetry circuit <b>272</b> in communication with the external device <b>240</b>, such as a trans-telephonic transceiver or a diagnostic system analyzer. The telemetry circuit <b>272</b> is activated by the microcontroller <b>216</b> by a control signal <b>252</b>. The telemetry circuit <b>272</b> allows cardiac signals, intra-cardiac electrograms, impedance measurements, status information, hemodynamic signals and other data relating to the operation of IMD <b>100</b> to be sent to the external device <b>240</b> through an established communication link <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the case where IMD <b>100</b> is intended to operate as an ICD device, the IMD <b>100</b> detects the occurrence of a shift in one or more waveforms in sensed cardiac signals that indicates an arrhythmia, and automatically applies an appropriate electrical shock therapy to the heart <b>102</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) aimed at terminating the detected arrhythmia. To this end, the microcontroller <b>216</b> further controls a shocking circuit <b>260</b> by way of a control signal <b>262</b>. The shocking circuit <b>260</b> generates shocking pulses of low (up to 0.5 joules), moderate (0.5-10 joules) or high energy (11 to 40 joules). Such shocking pulses are applied to the heart <b>102</b> of the patient through at least two shocking electrodes, and as shown in this embodiment, selected from the LA coil electrode <b>120</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the RV coil electrode <b>126</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and/or the SVC coil electrode <b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A hemodynamic monitor module <b>267</b> collects and analyzes hemodynamic signals as a secondary indicator of the condition of the heart. When the module <b>267</b> is used, the IMD <b>100</b> may identify a potential arrhythmia based on cardiac signals while the hemodynamic signals indicate that the heart is in normal sinus rhythm. When the foregoing combination of contradictory indicators occurs, the IMD <b>100</b> may forego or delay delivery of the shock therapy for at least a supplemental analysis period of time. During the supplemental analysis time, an arrhythmia confirmation module <b>269</b> performs addition confirmation analysis of prior and/or new cardiac and/or hemodynamic signals. The addition analysis may utilize more robust arrhythmia detection algorithms (cardiac and/or hemodynamic based) that are not readily available for real-time continuous use. The addition analysis may review cardiac and/or hemodynamic signals from other chambers of the heart, collection and analysis of new cardiac and/or hemodynamic signals and the like. The IMD <b>100</b> may then deliver the therapy after the addition confirmation analysis, or abort any type of therapy, based on the results of the confirmation analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A battery <b>256</b> provides operating power to the circuits of the IMD <b>100</b>, including the microcontroller <b>216</b>. The IMD <b>100</b> also includes a physiologic sensor <b>258</b> that may be used to adjust pacing stimulation rate according to the exercise state of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate a process <b>300</b> for detecting potential lead failures of the IMD <b>100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The process <b>300</b> operates to determine if a lead failure has occurred and, if a lead failure has occurred, to identify the electrode(s) associated with the lead failure. The process <b>300</b> may continue to operate, after a lead failure, is identified to determine if any additional lead failures occur. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a table <b>400</b> in which each of the columns <b>402</b>-<b>408</b> includes information and data relevant to different types of lead states. Each column <b>404</b>-<b>408</b> corresponds to a different type or category of lead state, such as no fault, failure type 1, etc. The information in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will be referenced in connection with the following discussion of the process <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At <b>302</b>, during the &#x201c;no fault&#x201d; operation of the lead <b>104</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), cardiac signals are sensed over the bipolar or first channel and integrated bipolar or second channel. The first column <b>402</b> of the table <b>400</b> is associated with application of the process <b>300</b> when detecting a &#x201c;no fault&#x201d; condition of the IMD <b>100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), namely where no electrode failure is detected or identified in a lead. The first row <b>410</b> illustrates examples of different waveforms sensed by the first channel.

The bipolar waveform <b>430</b> in this embodiment represents the cardiac signals that are sensed using the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> and the RV ring electrode <b>124</b>. The second row <b>412</b> illustrates examples of different waveforms sensed by the second channel. The cell at the intersection of the second row <b>412</b> and the first column <b>402</b> illustrates an example of a second or integrated bipolar waveform <b>436</b> that is sensed over the integrated bipolar channel during the &#x201c;no fault&#x201d; state of the lead <b>104</b>. The bipolar and the integrated bipolar waveforms <b>430</b>, <b>436</b> include, among other things, several R-waves <b>432</b> and S-waves <b>434</b> that are indicative of the normal physiologic behavior of the left ventricle.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, at <b>304</b>, the cardiac signals sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels are compared to one another. In one embodiment, the cardiac rates of the cardiac signals are compared to one another. For example, the frequencies at which the R-waves <b>432</b> and/or the S-waves <b>434</b> occur over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels may be compared. If the cardiac rates are similar to one another, then the similar cardiac rates may be indicative of a normally operating lead <b>104</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that does not exhibit signs or evidence of a potential lead failure. The cardiac rates may be considered similar to one another when the cardiac rates are within a predetermined threshold range of one another over a predetermined time period. For example, the cardiac rates may be determined to be similar if the cardiac rate sensed over the bipolar channel is within 10% of the cardiac rates sensed over the integrated bipolar channel during the previous 60 seconds or over a predetermined number of cardiac cycles. Alternatively, a different percentage range and/or time period may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At <b>306</b>, if the cardiac rates are found to be similar at <b>304</b>, the cardiac rates sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels are compared to a predetermined rate threshold. The cardiac rates are compared to the predetermined rate threshold to determine if the cardiac rates are indicative of an abnormal heart rate, such as VT or VF. If the cardiac rates exceed the rate threshold, then the cardiac rates may be indicative of an abnormal heart rate. Alternatively, if the cardiac rates do not exceed the rate threshold or are not otherwise indicative of an abnormal heart rate, then the process <b>300</b> returns to <b>302</b>. The process <b>300</b> may proceed in a loop-wise manner between <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> where no potential lead failure is identified and the cardiac signals sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels do not exhibit cardiac rates that exceed the rate threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If the cardiac rates are found to exceed the rate threshold at <b>306</b>, flow moves to <b>308</b> where the cardiac signals are examined to determine if the signals correspond to physiologic (normal or abnormal) cardiac waveforms. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> at the cell at the intersection of row <b>416</b> and column <b>402</b>, when a simultaneous or concurrent high rate is found in the cardiac signals sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels, a physiologic test may be performed on the cardiac signals. The signals may be examined to determine if the signal waveforms have characteristics similar to those of normal or abnormal physiologic cardiac waveforms. If the cardiac signal waveforms are similar to abnormal physiologic cardiac waveforms, then the high cardiac rate sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels may be due to &#x201c;natural&#x201d; causes, such as a cardiac condition, VT, VF, and the like. Alternatively, if the cardiac signal waveforms are not similar to normal or abnormal physiologic cardiac waveforms, then the high cardiac rate sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels may be due to an unnatural cause, such as chatter noise resulting from a fractured electrode and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the physiologic test at <b>308</b> involves analyzing values of one or more physiologic indicators or parameters of the cardiac signals sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels. The physiologic indicators may include the cardiac rates, a slew rate, a zero crossing rate, and an amplitude of the cardiac signal waveforms. The slew rate represents the slope or rate of change in the cardiac signal. The zero crossing rate represents the rate at which the cardiac signal switches between positive and negative voltage potentials. The values of the physiologic indicators may be compared to one another or to predetermined thresholds to determine if the signals are physiologic or non-physiologic. The predetermined thresholds are representative of physiologically acceptable limits for corresponding ones of the physiologic indicators.</p>

The signal waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> are shown alongside corresponding horizontal axes <b>502</b>, <b>602</b> that are representative of time and vertical axes <b>504</b>, <b>604</b> that are representative of the amplitude of the signal waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The cardiac rate of the waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> may be measured over a predetermined time period to determine if the waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> are representative of physiologic waveforms. If the cardiac rates do not exceed a predetermined rate threshold, then the cardiac rates may indicate that the corresponding waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> are physiologic. For example, if the time interval between consecutive ventricular contractions that is represented by each waveform <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> does not exceed approximately 240 milliseconds, then the corresponding waveform <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> may be physiologic (normal or abnormal). In another example, if the cardiac rate is approximately constant over the predetermined time period (such as the cardiac rate of the waveform <b>500</b>), then the cardiac rate may indicate that the corresponding waveform is representative of a physiologic waveform. Alternatively, if the cardiac rate is not approximately constant over the time period (such as the cardiac rate of the waveform <b>600</b>), then the cardiac rate may indicate that the corresponding waveform is not representative of a physiologic waveform. The cardiac rate may be considered at <b>308</b> to be approximately constant over a time period when the cardiac rate does not vary outside of a predetermined range or percentage during the time period.

In one embodiment, the slew rate <b>506</b>, <b>606</b> is the largest, or maximum, rate of change in the cardiac signals over the predetermined time period.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Amplitudes <b>508</b>, <b>608</b> of the waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> represent a peak gain or strength <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> of each waveform <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>.

However, the amplifiers <b>268</b>, <b>270</b> have maximum capabilities gain that are reached when input signals have a substantial difference therebetween.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, at <b>308</b>, the process <b>300</b> may examine the number of zero crossings <b>512</b>, <b>612</b> occurring over a predetermined time period as a physiologic indicator. A zero crossing <b>512</b>, <b>612</b> occurs each time that the corresponding waveform <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> crosses over the time axis <b>502</b>, <b>602</b>.

The baselines of the waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are coextensive with the time axes <b>502</b>, <b>602</b>, but may be offset above or below the time axes <b>502</b>, <b>602</b>. The number or frequency of zero crossings <b>512</b>, <b>612</b> may be indicative of the physiologic nature of the waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>. For example, the number and frequency of zero crossings <b>612</b> for the waveform <b>600</b> is greater than the number and frequency of zero crossings <b>512</b> for the waveform <b>500</b> over the same time period shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The greater number of zero crossings <b>612</b> may be determined at <b>308</b> to indicate that the cardiac signals sensed over the corresponding channel may not be representative of cardiac behavior. Additionally, the frequency of zero crossings <b>612</b> may indicate that the waveform <b>600</b> is not representative of cardiac behavior and therefore is non-physiologic. For example, the frequency of zero crossings <b>612</b> may vary considerably relative to the frequency of zero crossings <b>512</b>. The varying frequency of zero crossings <b>612</b> may indicate that the waveform <b>600</b> is not representative of cardiac behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition or in another embodiment, the waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> may be compared at <b>308</b> to one or more predetermined physiologic waveform templates to determine if the morphology, or shape, of the waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> match or correspond to the waveform templates. The waveforms <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> may be compared with the waveform templates to generate corresponding morphology indicators. If the morphology indicator for the waveform <b>500</b> is greater than the morphology indicator for the waveform <b>600</b>, then the morphology indicators may indicate that the waveform <b>500</b> is physiologic and the waveform <b>600</b> is non-physiologic.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4</figref>, at <b>308</b>, the waveforms <b>430</b>, <b>436</b> that are sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels are found to be physiologic waveforms based on the analysis of one or more of the physiologic indicators discussed above (e.g., the cardiac rates, slew rates, amplitudes, morphology, and frequency or number of zero crossings). While the waveforms <b>430</b>, <b>436</b> are physiologic, they are abnormal because the rate threshold was exceeded at <b>306</b>. Next, in accordance with one embodiment, flow moves from <b>308</b> to <b>310</b>. At <b>310</b>, one or more stimulation pulses are applied to the heart <b>102</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). For example, the waveforms <b>430</b>, <b>436</b> are determined to have similar cardiac rates (at <b>304</b>), to have cardiac rates that exceed a predetermined rate threshold (at <b>306</b>) and to be physiologic waveforms (at <b>308</b>), thereby indicating that the waveforms <b>430</b>, <b>436</b> are not illustrative of a potential lead fracture, but do indicate tachycardia. As a result, no alert or notification of a potential lead failure is provided (as shown in the row <b>420</b>) and no mitigating action is taken (as shown in the row <b>422</b>). Because the waveforms <b>430</b>, <b>436</b> indicate an abnormal heart rate such as VT or VF, the stimulation pulse is applied at <b>310</b> as a remedial course of action (as shown in the row <b>424</b>). Once the stimulation pulse is applied, the process <b>300</b> may return to <b>302</b> to sense additional cardiac signals over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Returning to <b>308</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, when the signals are determined to be physiologic, flow may move along an alternative path <b>309</b> instead of going directly to <b>310</b>. When flow moves along <b>309</b>, the process <b>300</b> suspends therapy (at least temporarily) until additional analysis can be performed at <b>311</b> to confirm or reject a potential arrhythmia. When an arrhythmia is confirmed at <b>311</b>, a therapy is delivered. When a potential arrhythmia is rejected as false or negative, no therapy is delivered, and flow returns to <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates the process performed at <b>311</b> to confirm or reject a potential arrhythmia. At <b>330</b>, the hemodynamic monitor module <b>267</b> obtains hemodynamic signals, such as from a memory buffer or from one or more of sensors <b>115</b>, <b>117</b> and <b>119</b>. The hemodynamic signals represent a secondary indicator of heart condition. At <b>332</b>, the arrhythmia confirmation module <b>269</b> utilizes the secondary indicators (hemodynamic signals) to confirm or reject that the heart is experiencing an arrhythmia. As noted above, the hemodynamic indicator may represent an impedance plethysmothography measurement indicative of stroke volume, a pressure signal from a sensor located in a heart chamber, a heart sound signal, or a peak endocardial acceleration signal. The hemodynamic signals may be analyzed relative to templates or in connection with predetermined thresholds. Optionally, the hemodynamic signals may be analyzed relative to previously acquired hemodynamic signals from the same patient or a pool of patients. In the present example, the hemodynamic signals are obtained from the hemodynamic sensor after the first and/or second signals from the first and/or second channels are determined to be indicative of a potential lead failure. Optionally, hemodynamic signals may be continuously obtained throughout operation and not necessarily only after determination of a potential lead failure based on the first or second cardiac signals.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the hemodynamic signals confirm an arrhythmia at <b>332</b>, flow moves to <b>342</b> where a stimulation therapy is applied. When, at <b>332</b>, the hemodynamic signals do not confirm an arrhythmia, but instead are indicative of normal sinus rhythm, flow moves to <b>334</b>. When flow reaches <b>334</b>, contradictory indicators have occurred, namely one or both of the first and second channels have indicated an arrhythmia, while the hemodynamic secondary indicators have indicated normal sinus rhythm. In this situation, it may not be necessary or desirable to immediately apply stimulation at <b>342</b>. Instead, it may be desirable at <b>334</b> to, at least temporarily, suspend therapy delivery. Once the therapy is temporarily suspended, flow moves to <b>336</b> at which the hemodynamic monitor module <b>267</b> collects supplemental data (e.g., from memory buffer or from sensors <b>115</b>, <b>117</b> and <b>119</b> if needed). Optionally, the operation at <b>336</b> may be entirely removed and flow may pass directly to <b>338</b> where the arrhythmia confirmation module <b>269</b> performs additional confirmation analysis seeking to confirm or reject the arrhythmia.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">During the supplemental analysis time at <b>338</b>, the arrhythmia confirmation module <b>269</b> performs confirmation analysis, such as by analyzing prior and/or new cardiac signals. Optionally, the confirmation analysis may analyze prior and/or new hemodynamic signals. The confirmation analysis may utilize more time consuming, robust algorithms for detecting arrhythmias that may not be readily usable in real time and continuously during normal operation of the IMD <b>100</b>. The additional arrhythmia detection algorithms may be based solely upon analysis of pre-existing or new cardiac signals. The arrhythmia detection algorithms may be based solely upon pre-existing or new hemodynamic signals, or may be based on a combination of pre-existing and new cardiac and hemodynamic signals. The confirmation analysis may review cardiac and/or hemodynamic signals from other chambers of the heart (e.g., the left ventricle and left atrium) may collect and analyze new cardiac or hemodynamic signals and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Once the confirmation analysis is complete at <b>338</b>, it is determined at <b>340</b> whether the confirmation analysis has verified the arrhythmia or provided a negative result indicating that an arrhythmia does not exist.

When, at <b>340</b>, the confirmation analysis provides a negative result indicating that no arrhythmia is present, flow moves to <b>344</b> at which the stimulation therapy is aborted or terminated entirely without being delivered.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, the process <b>300</b> will be described in connection with a first type of lead failure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the second column <b>404</b> of the table <b>400</b> represents identification of a first type of lead failure using the process <b>300</b>. The first type of lead failure involves failure of an electrode that is used in only one of the first and second channels over which cardiac signals are sensed. For example, the first type of lead failure may be associated with the electrode used to sense cardiac signals on the integrated bipolar channel but not on the bipolar channel. As shown in rows <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> when failure type 1 occurs, the bipolar channel senses physiologic waveform <b>438</b> while the integrated bipolar channel senses non-physiologic waveform <b>440</b> that does not have a physiologic shape. As described below, based at least in part of these waveforms <b>438</b>, <b>440</b>, the process <b>300</b> identifies the lead failure as a first type of lead failure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At <b>302</b>, the waveforms <b>438</b>, <b>440</b> are sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels, as described above. At <b>304</b>, the cardiac rates of the waveforms <b>438</b>, <b>440</b> are compared with one another and are found to differ from one another. The difference in cardiac rates of the waveforms <b>438</b>, <b>440</b> indicates that at least one of the cardiac signals represents a potential lead failure.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At <b>312</b>, once the cardiac rates of the waveforms <b>438</b>, <b>440</b> are found to differ, the memory addresses, to which the cardiac signals (and hemodynamic signals) are stored, may be temporarily blocked to prevent overwriting with additional new cardiac and hemodynamic signals. For example, the memory <b>236</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may include a memory buffer that stores a predetermined time period of cardiac signals recently obtained over the channels. Another buffer may store a time period of hemodynamic signals. The memory may be &#x201c;frozen&#x201d; and prevented from storing additional cardiac and hemodynamic signals in order to preserve the cardiac signals obtained during the previous predetermined time period. Optionally, the content of the cardiac signal memory buffer may be moved to another section of memory for longer term storage, thereby permitting the memory buffer to continue to store new cardiac signals. Also, hemodynamic signals in the memory buffer may be moved to longer term memory when waveforms <b>438</b>, <b>440</b> are found to differ.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At <b>314</b>, the frozen cardiac signals sensed by the integrated bipolar channel over the previous predetermined time period are obtained from the memory. The frozen cardiac signals sensed using the integrated bipolar channel are represented by the cardiac signal waveform <b>440</b>. The waveform <b>440</b> is examined to determine if the waveform <b>440</b> is a physiologic or non-physiologic waveform. As described above, the cardiac signal waveform <b>440</b> may be classified as physiologic or non-physiologic by examining one or more physiologic indicators. The waveform <b>440</b> is found to have a non-physiologic waveform at <b>314</b>. The non-physiologic shape of the waveform <b>440</b> may indicate that a potential lead failure has occurred and that the potential lead failure is associated with an electrode used to obtain the cardiac signals over the integrated bipolar channel.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus, flow moves to <b>316</b>, where the frozen cardiac signals sensed by the bipolar channel over the previous predetermined time period are analyzed.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Thus, flow moves to <b>318</b>, where the process <b>300</b> declares the potential lead failure to be the first type of lead failure. If the waveform <b>438</b> of the bipolar channel is physiologic and the waveform <b>440</b> of the integrated bipolar channel is non-physiologic (as determined at <b>314</b>), the waveforms <b>438</b>, <b>440</b> may indicate that the potential lead failure is associated with an electrode that was used to obtain the non-physiologic waveforms <b>440</b>, but that was not used to obtain the physiologic waveforms <b>438</b>. In an embodiment where the bipolar channel is sensed using the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> and the RV ring electrode <b>124</b> and the integrated bipolar channel is sensed using the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> and the SVC coil electrode <b>128</b>, the non-physiologic shape of the waveform <b>440</b> may indicate that the potential lead failure is caused by or associated with the SVC coil electrode <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in rows <b>418</b>-<b>420</b>, when a type 1 failure occurs, the process <b>300</b> may notify an operator of the IMD <b>100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or physician of the existence of and the type of failure. For example, the IMD <b>100</b> may communicate with the external device <b>240</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to actuate an audible, visual and/or tactile alarm. The process also seeks to mitigate the identified lead failure. To do so, the lead coupled with the failed electrode may be replaced, as indicated in rows <b>422</b>, <b>426</b>. The process <b>300</b> may continue to apply bipolar pacing through the electrodes used to sense signals over the bipolar channel. The integrated bipolar channel may be disabled by the channel selection module <b>264</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to avoid sensing the erroneous signals using the electrode associated with the failure.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Optionally, at <b>318</b>, it may obtain a secondary indicator from the electrode associated with the lead failure.

If the impedance exceeds a predetermined impedance threshold, then the impedance may represent a secondary indicator to indicate a fracture in the electrode.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next at <b>319</b>, it is determined whether the cardiac rate of the bipolar (first) channel signals exceeds a predetermined rate threshold.

Similar to the first type of lead failure, the second type involves failure of an electrode that is used in only one of the two channels over which cardiac signals are sensed. For example, the second type of lead failure may be associated with the electrode used to sense cardiac signals on the bipolar channel, but not on the integrated bipolar channel.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At <b>302</b>, the waveforms <b>442</b>, <b>444</b> are sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels, as described above.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Returning to <b>320</b>, when the first channel is not physiologic, then at <b>322</b>, the process <b>300</b> declares the lead failure to be the second type of lead failure. For example, as the bipolar channel signals represent a non-physiologic waveform while the integrated bipolar channel signals represent a physiologic waveform, the process <b>300</b> determines that an electrode used to obtain the bipolar channel signals but not to obtain the integrated bipolar channel signals is associated with the lead failure. In an embodiment where the bipolar channel obtains signals using the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the RV ring electrode <b>124</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the integrated bipolar channel obtains signals using the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> and the SVC coil electrode <b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the process <b>300</b> declares the lead failure to be associated with the RV ring electrode <b>124</b>. The process <b>300</b> may verify the second type of lead failure by measuring, at <b>322</b>, a secondary electrode indicator such as an electrical impedance characteristic of the associated electrode, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in rows <b>418</b>-<b>428</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the process <b>300</b> at <b>322</b> may notify an operator of the IMD <b>100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or a physician of the existence and type of the failure. The IMD <b>100</b> may mitigate the second type of lead failure by continuing to operate while ignoring the signals obtained by the electrodes associated with the bipolar channel. For example, the IMD <b>100</b> may disable sensing over the bipolar channel. The process <b>300</b> may remedy the lead failure at least in part by directing the IMD <b>100</b> to switch from bipolar pacing to integrated bipolar pacing of the heart <b>102</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). For example, the process <b>300</b> may direct the IMD <b>100</b> to refrain from using the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> and RV ring electrode <b>124</b> to pace the heart <b>102</b> and instead use the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> and the SVC coil electrode <b>128</b> to pace the heart <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">After <b>322</b>, it is determined at <b>323</b> whether the signal over the second channel has a rate that exceeds a rate threshold. If not, flow returns to the start at B. If the second channel has a signal rate that exceeds the rate threshold, flow moves to <b>311</b> where therapy is suspended at least temporarily as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, the third type of failure is discussed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fourth column <b>408</b> of the table <b>400</b> represents identification of a third type of lead failure using the process <b>300</b>. In contrast to the first and second types of lead failure, the third type involves the failing electrode and is common to two or more of the channels over which cardiac signals are sensed. For example, the third type of lead failure may be associated with the electrode used to sense cardiac signals on the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At <b>302</b>, the waveforms <b>446</b>, <b>448</b> are sensed over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels, as described above. As shown in the rows <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, both the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels sense non-physiologic waveforms <b>446</b>, <b>448</b>. At <b>304</b>, the cardiac rates of the waveforms <b>446</b>, <b>448</b> are compared with one another and are found to differ from one another. The difference in rates of the waveforms <b>446</b>, <b>448</b> may indicate that at least one of the cardiac signals represents a potential lead failure. At <b>312</b>, the memory is frozen and prevented from storing additional hemodynamic and cardiac signals. At <b>314</b>, the integrated bipolar cardiac signals are examined to determine if the signals (e.g., the waveform <b>448</b>) represent a physiologic waveform. In the embodiment represented by the column <b>408</b>, the waveform <b>448</b> is found to have a non-physiologic waveform. At <b>316</b>, after the integrated bipolar channel signals are found to be non-physiologic (at <b>314</b>), the bipolar channel signals are examined to determine if the signals (e.g., the waveform <b>446</b>) are physiologic. In the embodiment represented by the column <b>408</b>, the waveform <b>446</b> is found to have a non-physiologic waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">At <b>324</b>, after the bipolar and integrated bipolar channel signals are determined to be non-physiologic at <b>314</b> and <b>316</b>, the bipolar and integrated bipolar channel signals are compared to determine if the signals are correlated with one another. For example, the signals may be compared to determine if the signals approximately match one another over a predetermined time period. One or more of the physiologic indicators described above may be used to determine if the bipolar and integrated bipolar channel signals are correlated with one another. If at least a predetermined number of the physiologic indicators for each of the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels are within a predetermined range or variance of one another, then the bipolar and integrated bipolar channel signals may be correlated with one another. In the embodiment shown in the fourth column <b>408</b>, the bipolar and integrated bipolar channel signals shown in the rows <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> are found to be correlated with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">At <b>324</b>, when the signals from the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels are not correlated with one another, the signals may not indicate that the potential lead failure is the third type of lead failure. Instead, the signals may indicate a different type of lead failure or that no lead failure has occurred. As a result, the process <b>300</b> may return to <b>302</b> where additional signals are obtained over the channels to determine if a potential lead failure exists or if the IMD <b>100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is operating in the &#x201c;no fault&#x201d; category described in column <b>402</b> of the table <b>400</b> and described above.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">At <b>324</b>, when the bipolar and integrated bipolar channel signals are found to be correlated with one another, at <b>326</b>, the process <b>300</b> identifies the potential lead failure as the third type of failure. For example, when both of the bipolar and integrated bipolar signals are found to be non-physiologic and correlated with one another, the electrode that is common to both the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels is identified as associated with the lead failure. In an embodiment where the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is used to sense cardiac signals on both the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels, the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> is associated with the lead failure. The process <b>300</b> may verify the lead failure by measuring an electrical impedance characteristic of the associated electrode, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An operator or physician may be notified of the existence and type of third type of lead failure. As shown in row <b>422</b> of the table <b>400</b>, the third type of lead failure may be mitigated by disabling the channels associated with the failed electrode. For example, the IMD <b>100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may ignore cardiac signals obtained over both the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels. As the electrode associated with the lead failure is used to obtain signals over both channels, the signals obtained over both channels are affected by the failed electrode. In order to avoid pacing or applying stimulation pulses based on signals obtained over a failed lead, both channels are ignored. The IMD <b>100</b> may avoid pacing the heart <b>102</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or applying stimulation pulses to the heart <b>102</b>, even if the cardiac rates of the signals obtained over the channels indicate a sufficiently high rate such that a stimulation pulse would otherwise be applied. As shown in row <b>426</b>, the lead <b>104</b>-<b>108</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) having the electrode associated with the lead failure may be replaced in order to remedy the lead failure. Alternatively, the IMD <b>100</b> may be reconfigured to use different combinations of electrodes to sense cardiac signals over a different channel. For example, if the RV tip electrode <b>122</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is declared to be the electrode associated with the lead failure, the IMD <b>100</b> may switch to sensing cardiac signals over a third channel different from the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels. The third channel may be sensed using the RV ring electrode <b>124</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the SVC coil electrode <b>128</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), or another combination of electrodes coupled with the failed lead or with another lead.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">After <b>326</b>, flow moves to <b>311</b>, where hemodynamic signals are collected and analyzed to confirm or reject arrhythmias as discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one embodiment, the third type of lead failure may be detected by the process <b>300</b> in a different manner. As described above in connection with the &#x201c;no fault&#x201d; operation of the IMD <b>100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), at <b>308</b>, the signals obtained over the bipolar and integrated bipolar channels are examined to determine if the signals have physiologic waveforms. If the waveforms do not have physiologic waveforms, the signals may indicate the third type of lead failure. For example, while the signals may have similar cardiac rates (determined at <b>304</b>) and the cardiac rates exceed a rate threshold (determined at <b>306</b>), the signals on both channels may be based on a lead failure involving an electrode common to both channels. In order to check for the third type of lead failure, at <b>324</b>, the signals are compared to determine if the signals are correlated as described above. Based on this additional check, the process <b>300</b> may declare that the signals are based on the third type of lead failure. For example, the third type of lead failure may be identified when both the bipolar and integrated bipolar channel signals are non-physiologic and correlated with one another</p>
