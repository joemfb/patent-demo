<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention provides a gaming system that can allow a game to be appropriately advanced even by an inexperienced dealer by way of navigating the dealer in game advancement, thereby allowing fraud to be avoided and cost to be reduced. An image input device, which captures images for displaying to players playing the game at a plurality of stations, captures an image of a side of a game portion on which the dealer is positioned to include card placement areas. Then, a controller performs image recognition processing of comparing image data of the card placement areas captured by the image input device with comparative image data stored in memory. Thereafter, in a case in which image recognition processing results in an image showing a card being included, the score of the card game is calculated based on recognition results of the images showing cards.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-151232, filed on Jun. 25, 2009, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a gaming system that navigates a dealer in game advancement while preventing fraud.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various table games are known conventionally, and among the table games, there exists a game genre called card games.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Among card games, for example, there is a game called baccarat as disclosed in the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 7,419,160 (hereinafter referred to as Patent Document 1). Here, baccarat is a game in which bets are made on any of a &#x201c;Player (player position)&#x201d;, &#x201c;Banker (banker position)&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Tie (draw)&#x201d; (however, there may be a case in which &#x201c;Tie&#x201d; is not a target for betting), which are the bet targets, and awards winnings, based on the bet amount that is bet, to a player having bet on a bet target of a winning side. In addition, in baccarat, cards are distributed to the &#x201c;player&#x201d; side and the &#x201c;banker&#x201d; side, and winnings are determined based on the cards thus distributed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Card games such as baccarat are established in casinos, and since a dealer, for casino games, advances the game, it is necessary for the dealer to be proficient in game advancement. However, for countries in which development of casinos has only started, there has been a problem in that there is a shortage of dealers proficient in game advancement.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, a system for advancing a game by reading information embedded in cards used for a card game, by means of an IC chip embedded therein or information printed thereon with special ink, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,334 (hereinafter referred to as Patent Document 2). In such a system, all cards require the IC chip or printing with the special ink, and therefore a manufacturing cost of the cards becomes high. Cards used in casinos are generally discarded unconditionally after used once or for a predetermined number of times in a game, in order to avoid fraud. This is for avoiding a numeral or a symbol of the card from being distinguished from a reverse face of the card placed face-down due to a flaw or a fold made during use, and for avoiding marking on the card by a malicious player. As a result, with a method of using an IC chip storing data to be read attached to the card, such as sealing an IC tag that can communicate in a contactless manner in the card and the like, a running cost becomes high.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, a system that is provided with a reading device in a card shoe that accommodates the cards used in the card game, and that reads information of cards dispensed from a card shoe has been disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009026700. (hereinafter referred to as Patent Document 3). In such a case, a UV reactive code is printed on the card itself, and the information of the card is read using a black-light sensor at an outlet opening of the card shoe; however, the cost of printing on the card is incurred, while a system related to the card shoe must be provided specially. The burden on the system due to adding components to constitute the system becomes large, and the failure rate may increase by becoming complicated, and thus the cost rising as a whole is a concern.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Meanwhile, card games generally have strict rules for order, method, position and the like in the distribution of cards. In addition, the timing and duration of betting are complexly defined for each game. In card games, the dealer's handling of cards based on the numeral and the symbol on the card is naturally important; however, the dealer's behavior before and during the distribution of cards is even more important for determining a result of a game.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, a dealer is required to strictly act during the distribution of cards, handling of bets, advancement of a game and the like; however, in a situation where the number of experienced dealers is insufficient, there is a need for a system allowing an inexperienced dealer to strictly advance a game.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention has an object of providing a gaming system that can allow a game to be appropriately advanced even by an inexperienced dealer by way of navigating the dealer in game advancement, thereby allowing fraud to be avoided and cost to be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In Step S<b>51</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> performs image data recognition processing based on image data captured by the camera <b>20</b>. This processing is performed in the CPU <b>81</b>, and first determines whether a card has been placed on any of the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b>. This determination compares, in a unit frame, image data captured in real-time by the camera <b>20</b> with standard image data having captured the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b> in a state in which no cards have been placed thereon. More specifically, for image data captured by the camera <b>20</b>, each area portion of the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b> is recognized, and each of these area portions is compared with each area portion of the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b> in the standard image data. Then, in a case in which there is an image showing a card in any of the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b> among the image data captured by the camera <b>20</b>, since this would differ from the standard image data, it is recognized that a card has been placed. Next, the value and classification of suit of the card thus positioned is recognized by way of pattern recognition. Then, this frame of image data thus recognized and information of the card thus recognized are associated with a value of the card number counter, and stored in a predetermined memory area of the RAM <b>83</b>. As a result, in a case in which the first card (card that is read first, and card that is placed on the card placement area <b>141</b>) is the 6 of diamonds, data containing &#x201c;1, diamonds, 6&#x201d; is stored in a predetermined memory area of the RAM <b>83</b>, for example. Then, these frames and information are used in the following steps. In addition, the frames of a state in which a card has been placed are temporarily stored in the RAM <b>83</b> as standard image data for when a next card has been placed, and employed in processing when the next card has been placed.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In Step S<b>52</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> determines whether a card has been placed at a predetermined position within a predetermined time period. More specifically, the CPU <b>81</b> determines whether a card is placed at a position designated in a game advancement program, based on a game advancement program stored in the ROM <b>82</b> and image data captured by the camera <b>20</b> (specifically, a frame of image data employed in Step S<b>51</b>). Furthermore, the CPU <b>81</b> verifies the image data received and standard image data of the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b> of a state in which no cards have been placed thereon, and in a case in which the image data thus received is different from the image data before the start of the game, and an image is included that shows a card at a position at which it should be placed in the game advancement program, the CPU <b>81</b> determines that a card has been placed. In the case of a YES determination, the CPU <b>81</b> advances the processing to Step S<b>55</b>, and in a case of a NO determination, advances the processing to Step S<b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In Step S<b>53</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> determines whether a predetermined time period has elapsed. More specifically, the CPU <b>81</b> determines whether a time measured by the timer <b>131</b> has passed a predetermined time period since the previous processing. Previous processing, for example, can exemplify processing that cuts off betting (for example, Step S<b>15</b> described above) or previous navigation processing (for example, Step S<b>34</b> described above). In the case of the predetermined time period having elapsed (in the case of YES in Step S<b>52</b>), Step S<b>54</b> is advanced to, and in the case of the predetermined time period not having elapsed (in the case of NO in Step S<b>52</b>), Step S<b>51</b> is returned to.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In Step S<b>54</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> performs warning notification to the dealer. More specifically, the CPU <b>81</b> displays on the dealer-used display <b>210</b> a warning indicating that a card has not been placed at a predetermined position. Placing the first card is described as an example. In this case, since the value of the card number counter is 1, a card is to be placed in the card placement area <b>141</b>. Accordingly, the CPU <b>81</b> illuminates the lamp <b>151</b>, which corresponds to the card placement area <b>141</b>, in red. In this way, even in a case where the first card has not been placed on the card placement area <b>141</b> within the predetermined time period, by changing from green and illuminating the lamp in red, the dealer can understand that a card must be placed on the card placement area <b>141</b>. In a case of the value of the card number counter being 2 to 6, one of the lamps <b>152</b> to <b>156</b> is illuminated in red. It should be noted that it is not limited to being illuminated in red, and may be configured so as to blink in red.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Here, an aspect of performing warning notification of a placement area of the first card is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a view showing a first card placement warning image. In the display area <b>210</b><i>a</i>, a warning of an incorrect position of the card is displayed. An image notifying a warning to the dealer that the first card should be placed in the card placement area <b>141</b> is displayed in the display area <b>210</b><i>b</i>. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the location corresponding to the card placement area <b>141</b> is shown to be illuminated in red. In addition, &#x201c;X&#x201d; is displayed in the card placement area <b>143</b>. This indicates that a card is not to be placed in the card placement area <b>143</b> since an image representing a card is present in the card placement area <b>143</b>. An image showing the result of a previous game is displayed on the display area <b>210</b><i>c</i>. The facts that the time in which betting is possible is 0, and that the betting period has ended are shown in the display area <b>210</b><i>d</i>. Here, for example, in a case where no cards have been placed at all, the warning displayed in the display area <b>210</b><i>a </i>can indicate that no cards have been placed at all, or that a card is to be placed in the card placement area <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, in Step S<b>55</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> determines whether the orientation in which the card has been placed is the correct orientation. More specifically, the CPU <b>81</b> determines whether an upper face of the card is a correct face, based on the game advancement program stored in the ROM <b>82</b> and the image data received from the camera <b>20</b>. In the present embodiment, the cards are set with all obverse faces as facing up. Therefore, the CPU <b>81</b> determines whether a face on which a numeral or a symbol of the card is marked is included in the image data. Alternatively, determination of whether or not a reverse face of the card is included in the image data received from the scanners <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>can be made. In the case of the orientation in which the card is placed being determined to be the correct orientation (in the case of YES in Step S<b>55</b>), the CPU <b>81</b> advances to Step S<b>57</b>, and in the case of being determined to not be the correct orientation (in the case of NO in Step S<b>55</b>), the CPU <b>81</b> advances to Step S<b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In Step S<b>56</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> performs warning display on the dealer-used display <b>210</b>. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a warning indicating that the obverse face of the card should be placed facing up is displayed in display portion <b>210</b><i>a</i>, for example, the card placement area corresponding on the screen (card placement area <b>141</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) is illuminated in red.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In Step S<b>58</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> compares the image data of a state in which a card is newly placed in a card placement area <b>141</b> to <b>146</b> with standard image data. More specifically, the CPU <b>81</b> compares an image contained among image data thus received and indicating a card that has been newly place in a card placement area <b>141</b> to <b>146</b> with standard image data of cards stored in the RAM <b>83</b>. Particularly, the CPU <b>81</b> recognizes image data received from the scanners <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>. In the present embodiment, since the card is placed face-up, the scanners <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>capture image data of a reverse face of the card, and sends the image data to the control unit <b>2</b>. First, the CPU <b>81</b> compares the reverse face of the card against the standard image data. A pattern on the reverse face of the card is the same for all the cards in a deck, and different between decks. Therefore, by identifying the pattern on the reverse face of the card, data for the obverse face thereof can be retrieved.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Next, the CPU <b>81</b> retrieves the standard image data for the obverse face of the card from the RAM <b>83</b>, and determines whether or not the image indicating the card recognized in Step S<b>51</b> shows the same card as the standard image data. The standard image data for the obverse face of the card is stored in the RAM <b>83</b> for all cards included in a deck. Therefore, the CPU <b>81</b> compares the standard image data of obverse faces retrieved by identifying the reverse faces with each of the images showing a card recognized in Step S<b>57</b>, and determines whether the same cards are respectively shown by pattern recognition. In the case of the card being the same as the image in the plurality of standard image data representing the card recognized in Step S<b>57</b> (in the case of YES in Step S<b>58</b>), the CPU <b>81</b> advances to Step S<b>60</b>, and in the case of being determined not to be the same card (in the case of NO in Step S<b>58</b>), the CPU <b>81</b> advances to Step <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In Step S<b>59</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> performs a warning display indicating that a card different from the standard image data has been placed. In this warning, a similar image to the warning display shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is displayed on the dealer-used display <b>210</b>. When this processing ends, the CPU <b>81</b> advances to Step S<b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The warning display displayed on the dealer-used display <b>210</b> in Step S<b>57</b> is explained hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The warning display shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows a case in which a warning has been performed during placement of a first card. A message indicating the fact that a different card has been placed is displayed on the upper side of the display area <b>210</b><i>b </i>in the display area <b>210</b><i>a</i>. This shows that a card not contained in the standard image data has been placed. In addition, in the display area <b>210</b><i>b</i>, an image warning a dealer that the first card should be placed in the card placement area <b>141</b>. This diagram shows that a location corresponding to the card placement area <b>141</b> is illuminated in red and the card placed in the area is the 4 of diamonds. Since the placement of cards has started, the present game is in progress. Therefore, in the display area <b>210</b><i>c</i>, an image showing a current score is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In Step S<b>60</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> adds 1 to a recognition counter stored in the RAM <b>83</b>. This recognition counter is a counter that counts a number of times the verification/warning processing (Step S<b>51</b> to Step S<b>59</b>) has been performed. In the present embodiment, Step S<b>51</b> to Step S<b>59</b> described above are performed a predetermined number of times. This allows for false recognition of a card to be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In Step S<b>61</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> determines whether the recognition counter is a predetermined value. This predetermined value can be arbitrarily set by a manager of a gaming facility to &#x201c;3&#x201d; or &#x201c;5&#x201d;, for example. In a case where the predetermined value is &#x201c;3&#x201d;, verification/warning processing will be performed 3 times. In addition, in the case of being the predetermined value, the recognition counter is set to 0, verification/warning processing is ended, and the processing advances to Step S<b>37</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0183" num="0182">An explanation of the present embodiment has been provided above. Although an explanation has been provided for the case of a baccarat game, the present invention is not limited thereto, and may be a card game such as poker or black jack, and may be a game other than a card game, for example, a dice game such as SICBO, or a roulette game.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In the present embodiment, although an instruction was made to a dealer so that an operation input button <b>214</b> is operated by displaying a bet end instructional image on the display area <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the dealer-used display <b>210</b>, it is not limited thereto, and a lamp may be provided at a location visible to the dealer (e.g., on the game portion <b>3</b> or the like) as an instructional device and instruction may be performed by illumination of the lamp, an LED luminous body may be provided in an operation input button <b>214</b> as an instructional device and instructions may be performed by illumination of the LED luminous body, or a device may be provided on the operation input button <b>214</b> as an instructional device that causes a physical change to occur in the button (e.g., raises the button).</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In particular, in SICBO or roulette, it is not necessary to output at instruction for the placement location of a card to the dealer, and game advancement is possible with only an operation input button; therefore, installation of a display can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In the present embodiment, image recognition processing for a predetermined frame among image data captured by the camera <b>20</b> is performed, each area of the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b> portion is compared with the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b> portion of the standard image data, and in the case of being different, recognition processing and warning processing are performed when a card has been placed on the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b>; however, it is not limited thereto. As the timing to perform recognition processing, for example, it may be configured such that, without acquiring standard image data in advance, a frame of image data at a certain moment is compared with the frame before this frame, and the difference therebetween is determined, and in a case in which there being a difference, recognition processing is performed. Since the frame of image data acquired based on a refresh rate of the camera <b>20</b> is compared with the frame immediately before, it is possible to perform image recognition processing in real-time by constantly applying the newest state thereof. For example, in a case in which a scratch or damage occurs within the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b>, since it constantly becomes different from the standard image data, there is a possibility for abnormal behavior to occur such as warning display appearing constantly. However, even in such a case, since the recognition processing is performed in a state in which this state has been reflected, it is possible to continue recognition processing without interrupting the processing.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In addition, it may be configured so that a sensor indicating that a card has been taken out is provided in the card shoe <b>22</b>, and image recognition processing is performed in response to the CPU <b>81</b> receiving a detection signal from the sensor indicating that a card has been drawn out. More specifically, the sensor is disposed at a front edge of an upper plate <b>226</b> of the card shoe <b>22</b>. This sensor uses a sensor of a photo-interrupter system disposed so that the light-emitting part and light-receiving part are opposed, for example. More specifically, the sensor is provided so that light generated by the luminous element of the light-emitting part is constantly incident on a light-receiving element of the light-receiving part, and a constant output current is output from the light-receiving element. When a card passes through here, since the light between the light-receiving element and light-emitting element is interrupted, there is no entrance of light into the light-receiving element, and the output current output by the light-receiving element decreases as well. It is possible to detect the drawing out of a card by way of the change in this output current. In this case, since it is necessary for the card to pass between the light-receiving part and the light-emitting part, it is preferred that either one of the light-emitting part or the light-receiving part is disposed so as to be embedded in the base portion <b>225</b>, and the other one is disposed at a position on a line extending from the upper plate <b>226</b>. Otherwise, an existing sensor or system such as detection by way of a switch that is depressed in response to a card passing therethrough or the like may be configured so as to be employed. As a result, it is possible to reduce the processing load on the control unit <b>2</b> since it is made such that the image recognition process is performed only when the game has started and a card has actually been placed on the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Alternatively, in a case in which a sensor is provided to the card shoe <b>22</b>, it may be configured so that a scanner is included in place of the sensor or in addition thereto, and a card drawn out from the card shoe <b>22</b> is scanned and information of the card (number value, pattern, etc.) is transmitted to the control unit <b>2</b>. In addition, in this case, it may be configured so that, in the verification/warning processing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, it may be determined whether the card drawn out from the card shoe <b>22</b> is the same as the card placed on the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b>, based on information of the card thus obtained by the scanner provided in the card shoe <b>22</b>. As a result, it is possible to prevent fraud such as switching the card during the card being placed on the card placement areas <b>141</b> to <b>146</b> from the card shoe <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In the present embodiment, a case is explained in which the controller of the present invention is configured with a CPU <b>81</b> provided to the main control portion <b>80</b> and the CPU <b>111</b> provided to the station <b>4</b>; however, the controller of the present invention may be configured with only one CPU.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Although an embodiment of the present invention has been explained above, it is merely exemplified as a specific example, and the present invention is not particularly limited thereto; specific configurations of each means and the like can be suitably modified in design. In addition, the effects described in the embodiment of the present invention are merely listed as the most preferred effects arising from the present invention, and the effects according to the present invention are not limited to those described in the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
