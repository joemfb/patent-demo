<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the ongoing development of photographic technology, illumination assemblies have become widely used in portable electronic devices to provide light to a keypad assembly or display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a typical illumination assembly <b>10</b> may include a light source <b>11</b> and a light guiding pole <b>12</b>. The light guiding pole <b>12</b> includes a first end <b>121</b>, an opposite second end <b>122</b> and a peripheral wall <b>123</b>. The light source <b>11</b> is arranged adjacent to the first end <b>121</b> and used to irradiate light. The peripheral wall <b>123</b> has a zigzag reflecting surface <b>124</b>. The light irradiated by the light source <b>11</b> penetrates into the light guiding pole <b>12</b> through the first end <b>121</b>, and emits out of the light guiding pole <b>12</b> through the second end <b>122</b> after being reflected many times by the zigzag reflecting surface <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the light guiding pole <b>12</b> can only transmit light linearly. In addition, the intensity of the emitted light weakens after many reflections.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show an exemplary illumination assembly <b>20</b> including a light source <b>21</b> and a light guiding pole <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The light source <b>21</b> may be a light emitting diode (LED) used to irradiate light. The light source <b>21</b> can be electrically mounted to a printed circuit board <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The light guiding pole <b>22</b> is generally L-shaped including a base board <b>23</b> and a main board <b>24</b>. The main board <b>24</b> protrudes from the base board <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The base board <b>23</b> includes a top surface <b>231</b> and a bottom surface <b>232</b>. A first optic member <b>2311</b> made of a film layer is attached (e.g., coated or printed) to the top surface <b>231</b>. The first optic member <b>2311</b> may be a convex lens.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The main board <b>24</b> is generally hollow and includes a first wall <b>241</b>, a second wall <b>242</b>, a third wall <b>243</b> and an incident end wall <b>244</b>. The first wall <b>241</b>, the second wall <b>242</b> and the third wall <b>243</b> enclose a semi-enclosed cavity <b>246</b> with an opening <b>245</b> adjacent to the first optic member <b>2311</b>. The incident end wall <b>244</b> has a rectangular receiving aperture <b>247</b> defined therein and an inclined separating wall <b>248</b> formed between the receiving aperture <b>247</b> and the cavity <b>246</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The separating wall <b>248</b> and the second wall <b>242</b> may be made of transparent light guiding materials whose refractive index is generally equal to the refractive index of the atmosphere. Therefore, the refraction of light between the atmosphere, the second wall <b>242</b>, and the separating wall <b>248</b> is greatly reduced or eliminated. A first surface <b>2481</b> facing the cavity <b>246</b> and an opposite second surface <b>2482</b> facing the receiving aperture <b>247</b>. A second optic member <b>249</b> made of a film layer is attached (e.g., coated or printed) to the second surface <b>2482</b>. The second optic member <b>249</b> may be a convex lens to transmit light from the light source <b>21</b> to the first optic member <b>2311</b>. Then the first optic member <b>2311</b> focuses the light to emit from the bottom surface of the base board <b>23</b>. The receiving aperture <b>247</b> receives the printed circuit board <b>25</b>, and the light source <b>21</b> is positioned in the receiving aperture <b>247</b> facing the second optic member <b>249</b>. A reflecting layer <b>2471</b> is attached (e.g., coated or printed) to the inner wall of the receiving aperture <b>247</b>. The reflecting layer <b>2471</b> may have a waved cross-section and be configured to reflect light back to the second optic member <b>249</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in use, most of the light irradiated by the light source <b>21</b> strikes on the second optic member <b>249</b> and the remainder of the light is reflected by the reflecting layer <b>2471</b> to the second optic member <b>249</b>. The light reflected to the second optic member <b>249</b> is further refracted by the second optic member <b>249</b> and the first optic member <b>2311</b> in sequence to emit from the bottom surface <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Some advantages of the present embodiment are as follows. The first optic member <b>2311</b> and the second optic member <b>249</b> change transmitting path of light. Thus, the illumination assembly <b>20</b> can change the transmitting direction of light. Furthermore, most light has a relatively short transmitting distance during the illumination assembly <b>20</b>, decreasing loss of light.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is to be understood, however, that even through numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of sections within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms, in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
