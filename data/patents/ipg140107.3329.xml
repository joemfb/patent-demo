<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to integrated circuits, and more particularly to the structure and formation methods of bump pad structures of integrated circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Integrated circuit (IC) chips are often electrically connected to package substrates in packaging assemblies to provide external signal exchange. A commonly used bonding scheme is flip-chip bonding. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a flip-chip bonding structure, wherein IC chip <b>100</b> is bonded onto package substrate <b>102</b> through bump balls <b>104</b>. It was commonly observed, however, that the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of IC chip <b>100</b> is significantly different from that of package substrate <b>102</b>. For example, the CTE of IC chip <b>100</b> may be about 3 ppm/&#xb0; C., while the CTE of package substrate <b>102</b> may be about 15 ppm/&#xb0; C. Due to the difference in CTEs, stresses are generated inside IC chip <b>100</b> and package substrate <b>102</b>, resulting in a warpage, as is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The warpage results in the crack of bump balls <b>104</b> and the delamination of low-k dielectric layers (not shown) in IC chip <b>100</b>. Currently, many processes use low-k and ultra low-k dielectric materials in inter-metal dielectric (IMD) layers to reduce RC delay and parasitic capacitances. The general trend in IMD designs is that the dielectric constants (k) of the IMD layers tend to decrease from low-k regime to ultra low-k regime. This means that the IMD layers, in which metal lines and vias are formed, are more mechanically fragile. Further, the IMD layers may delaminate when under the stress caused by the thermal expansion. The bump crack and delamination are particularly severe at the corners of IC chip <b>100</b>. Conventionally underfill is used to fill the space between IC chip <b>100</b> and bump balls <b>104</b> in order to protect bump balls <b>104</b>, although bump cracks and delamination were still observed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The making and using of the embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the embodiments provide many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A semiconductor chip may include a plurality of solder bumps, which are used to electrically connect the integrated circuits in the semiconductor chip to external circuits. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>3</b>C illustrate exemplary bump pad structures, on which bumps <b>42</b> are formed, in accordance with an embodiment. Throughout the description, the term &#x201c;bump pad structure&#x201d; refers to the structures, including UBM <b>40</b>, metal pad <b>38</b>, the underlying pads <b>56</b> and <b>60</b> (and additional supporting pads, if any, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3C</figref>), and the connecting vias.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view showing a portion of chip <b>20</b>, which includes substrate <b>30</b>, on which active circuit <b>32</b> is formed. Substrate <b>30</b> may be a semiconductor substrate formed of commonly used semiconductor materials, such as silicon, silicon germanium, or the like. Active circuit <b>32</b> may include complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, resistors, capacitors, and the like. Interconnect structure <b>33</b> is formed over active circuit <b>32</b> and is used to interconnect portions of active circuit <b>32</b>, and to connect active circuit <b>32</b> to bump <b>42</b>. Interconnect structure <b>33</b> includes a plurality of metallization layers comprising metal lines and vias (not shown) in a plurality of dielectric layers. The dielectric layers in interconnect structure <b>33</b> may be low-k dielectric layers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Passivation layers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are formed over interconnect structure <b>33</b>. Passivation layers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are commonly referred to in the art as being passivation-1 and passivation-2, respectively, and may be formed of materials, such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, un-doped silicate glass (USG), polyimide, and/or multi-layers thereof. Metal pad <b>38</b> may have a lower portion in passivation layer <b>34</b>. Further, metal pad <b>38</b> may have an upper portion level with a lower portion of passivation layer <b>36</b> and directly underlying an opening in an upper portion of passivation layer <b>36</b>. Metal pad <b>38</b> may comprise aluminum, and hence may also be referred to as aluminum pad <b>38</b>, although it may also be formed of, or include, other materials, such as copper, silver, gold, nickel, tungsten, alloys thereof, and/or multi-layers thereof. In an embodiment, metal pad <b>38</b> is formed of Al&#x2014;Cu. Metal pad <b>38</b> may be electrically connected to active circuit <b>32</b>, for example, through underlying interconnection structure <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An opening is formed in passivation layer <b>36</b>. Under-bump metallurgy (UBM) <b>40</b> fills the opening and contacts metal pad <b>38</b>. In an embodiment, UBM <b>40</b> is formed of a composite layer comprising a titanium layer, a copper layer, a nickel layer, or combinations thereof. In other embodiments, UBM <b>40</b> may include other metals, such as gold. UBM <b>40</b> may include a portion in passivation layer <b>36</b> and portions over passivation layer <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Bump <b>42</b> is formed over and electrically connected to, and possibly contacting, UBM <b>40</b>. Bump <b>42</b> may be formed of a eutectic solder, a lead-free solder, copper, copper-containing alloy, or the like. In an embodiment, bump <b>42</b> is formed of a solder material, a re-flow is performed on bump <b>42</b>, thus bump <b>42</b> has a spherical upper portion, with the size and the shape of the lower portion being defined by the size and the shape of UBM <b>40</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The metallization layers in interconnect structure <b>33</b> include a top metallization layer Mtop, which includes top dielectric layer <b>53</b>, and Mtop pad <b>52</b> in top dielectric layer <b>53</b>. Top dielectric layer <b>53</b> may be formed of un-doped silicate glass or low-k dielectric materials. Mtop pad <b>52</b> may either contact metal pad <b>38</b> directly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, or connected to metal pad <b>38</b> through multiple vias (not shown, similar to vias <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) that contacts both metal pad <b>38</b> and Mtop pad <b>52</b>. The bump pad structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is referred to as a single-solid pad structure since there is only a single metal pad, Mtop pad <b>52</b>, directly under metal pad <b>38</b>. Throughout the description, the metal pads that are directly under and connected to metal pad <b>38</b>, either directly or through a plurality of vias, are referred to as supporting metal pads. Accordingly, metal pads <b>52</b>, <b>56</b> and <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>) are supporting metal pads. It is realized that when a force is applied to metal pad <b>38</b>, the force will be imparted to Mtop pad <b>52</b> and underlying supporting metal pads, if any, and hence the likelihood of having bump cracking and low-k dielectric layers is reduced. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, no additional supporting metal pads are directly under Mtop pad <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates a double-solid pad structure. The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is similar to what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, except that there is an additional Mtop-<b>1</b> pad <b>56</b> directly under Mtop pad <b>52</b>. Mtop-<b>1</b> pad <b>56</b> is formed in metallization layer Mtop-<b>1</b>, which is immediately under top metallization layer Mtop. Mtop-<b>1</b> pad <b>56</b> and Mtop pad <b>52</b> are connected through a plurality of vias <b>54</b>. Mtop-<b>1</b> pad <b>56</b> and Mtop pad <b>52</b> may have significant portions overlapping each other. In an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, Mtop-<b>1</b> pad <b>56</b> and Mtop pad <b>52</b> may have a same size and a same shape, and may (or may not) fully overlap each other. It is realized that when a force is applied to metal pad <b>38</b>, the force will be imparted to Mtop-<b>1</b> pad <b>56</b> through Mtop pad <b>52</b>, and hence Mtop-<b>1</b> pad <b>56</b> also structurally supports metal pad <b>38</b>. No additional supporting metal pads are directly under metal pad <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates a triple-solid pad structure. The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> is similar to what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, except that there is an additional Mtop-<b>2</b> pad <b>60</b> directly under Mtop-<b>1</b> pad <b>56</b>. Mtop-<b>2</b> pad <b>60</b> is formed in metallization layer Mtop-<b>2</b>, which is immediately under metallization layer Mtop-<b>1</b>. Mtop-<b>1</b> pad <b>56</b> and Mtop-<b>2</b> pad <b>60</b> are connected through a plurality of vias <b>58</b>. Mtop-<b>1</b> pad <b>56</b>, Mtop pad <b>52</b>, and Mtop-<b>2</b> pad <b>60</b> may have significant portions overlapping each other, as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In an embodiment, metal pads <b>52</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>60</b> have a same size and a same shape, and may (or may not) fully overlap each other. No additional supporting metal pads are directly under metal pad <b>60</b> and connected to Mtop-<b>2</b> pad <b>60</b> through vias.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a top view of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, wherein the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and/or <b>3</b>C are taken along a plane crossing line <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B/<b>3</b>C-<b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B/<b>3</b>C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In alternative embodiments, one, two, or even three additional supporting metal pads may be formed directly under Mtop-<b>2</b> pad <b>60</b>, and structurally bonded to Mtop-<b>2</b> pad <b>60</b> through vias. One skilled in the art will realize the respective structures by applying the teaching provided in preceding paragraphs.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Simulations were made to study the node release energies (NREs) of bump pad structures as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>3</b>C. An NRE of a bump pad structure is equal to the force applied on the feature times the displacement of the bump pad structure. Greater NREs indicate greater displacements of the bump pad structure, and hence greater possibility of delamination and bump cracking The simulation results are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, wherein the Y-axis indicates the NREs, and the X-axis indicates the types of bump pad structures. The notation &#x201c;Aluminum pad only&#x201d; represents a structure not having Mtop pad <b>52</b> underlying metal pad <b>38</b>, while notations &#x201c;single-solid pad&#x201d; and &#x201c;double-solid pad&#x201d; represent the structures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, respectively. The simulation results have revealed that when the number of supporting metal pads increases, the NRE of the respective bump pad structure decreases, which means that the respective semiconductor chip suffers less from cracking and delamination, and hence is more reliable. It is noted that if the number of supporting metal pads further increases, the stress that may be applied to metal pad <b>38</b> and low-k dielectric layers are better distributed, and the respective semiconductor chip <b>20</b> will be more reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a top view of chip <b>20</b>, wherein a plurality of bump pad structures are illustrated. The bump pad structures are shown as small hollow circles and are shown as bump pad structures <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>200</b>-<b>3</b> (also refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 10</figref>). Bump pad structures <b>200</b>-<b>1</b> are single-solid pad structures and correspond to the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Bump pad structures <b>200</b>-<b>2</b> are double-solid pad structures and correspond to the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Bump pad structures <b>200</b>-<b>3</b> are triple-solid pad structures and correspond to the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Chip <b>20</b> includes four corners <b>202</b> and four sides <b>204</b>. The center of chip <b>20</b> is denoted as center <b>206</b>. In the corner-to-center directions (symbolized by arrows <b>208</b>), the stresses exerted on bump pad structures <b>200</b> decrease. Further, in the side-to-center directions (symbolized by arrows <b>210</b>), the stresses exerted on bump pad structures <b>200</b> also decrease. Accordingly, to improve the reliability of chip <b>20</b>, the bump pad structures with greater numbers of supporting metal pads may be used at locations (such as corners) suffering from greater stresses, while the bump pad structures with fewer numbers of supporting metal pads may be used at locations (such as the center of chip <b>20</b>) suffering from smaller stresses. The added supporting metal pads have the function of ameliorating stresses, for example, distributing the stresses to more layers and more features, so that the likelihood of excess stress being applied on metal pad <b>38</b> is reduced. It is appreciated that while the method of adding supporting metal pads is disclosed, other stress ameliorating structures are also within the contemplated scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a corner portion of chip <b>20</b>. In an embodiment, in the corner-to-center direction <b>208</b>, bump pad structures <b>200</b> are divided into corner-rows, with the corner-rows closer to the respective corner <b>202</b> having a greater number of supporting metal pads, while the corner-rows farther away from the respective corner <b>202</b> having a fewer number of supporting metal pads. In an exemplary embodiment, only the first corner-row (with only one bump pad structure <b>200</b>-<b>3</b>) has the triple-solid pad structure. The second corner-row (with two bump pad structure <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>) has the double-solid pad structure. The third corner-row (with three bump pad structure <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>) has the single-solid pad structure. Please note that bump pad structures denoted as &#x201c;<b>200</b>-<b>1</b>/<b>200</b>-<b>2</b>&#x201d; may be single-solid pads structures or double-solid pad structures due to the fact that they are in the first side-rows, as will be discussed in subsequent paragraphs. All other corner-rows that are closer to the center <b>206</b> of chip <b>20</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may have the single-solid pad structures. It is also realized that from the corner <b>202</b> to center <b>206</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of chip <b>20</b>, the desirable number of corner-rows of triple-solid pad structures and/or the number of corner-rows of double-solid pad structures may be greater than one. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there are two corner-rows of triple-solid pad structures <b>200</b>-<b>3</b>. However, it is still desirable that bump pad structures in the corner-rows closer to center <b>206</b> will not have a greater number of supporting metal pads than that in the corner-rows farther away from center <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is observed that the stresses applied to the bump pad structures <b>200</b> close to sides <b>204</b> of chip <b>20</b> are between the stresses applied to the bump pad structures <b>200</b> close to corner <b>202</b> and the stresses applied to the bump pad structures <b>200</b> close to center <b>206</b>. Therefore, in the side-to-center direction, bump pad structures <b>200</b> are divided into side-rows that are parallel to respective sides <b>204</b>, with the side-rows closer to the respective sides <b>204</b> having a greater number of supporting metal pads, while the side-rows farther away from the respective sides <b>204</b> having a fewer number of supporting metal pads. In an exemplary embodiment, only the first side-row has the double-solid pad structure. All other rows that are closer to center <b>206</b> of chip <b>20</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) than the first side-row may have single-solid pad structures. In alternative embodiments, the number of side-rows having double-solid pad structures may be greater than one, depending on the magnitude of the stresses. However, it is still desirable that bump pad structures in the side-rows closer to center <b>206</b> will not have a greater number of supporting metal pads than that in the side-rows farther away from center <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The stress applied to corners <b>202</b> of chip <b>20</b> depends on the size of chip <b>20</b> and the material (and hence the mechanical strength) of bump <b>42</b>. Accordingly, if chip <b>20</b> is small, fewer triple-solid pad structures may be used. Experiment results have revealed that if chip <b>20</b> has an area smaller than about 100 mm<sup>2</sup>, only one triple-solid pad structure is needed at each corner <b>202</b>. Since triple-solid pad structures have a greater area penalty than double-solid pad structures, and double-solid pad structures have a greater area penalty than single-solid pad structures, reducing the number of triple-solid pad structures and double-solid pad structures may reduce the area penalty. However, the reduction in the number of triple-solid pad structures and double-solid pad structures can only be achieved without sacrificing the reliability of chip <b>20</b>. An optimum number of triple-solid pad structures and an optimum number of double-solid pad structures thus need to be found.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> illustrate exemplary embodiments with different number of triple-solid pad structures at the corners. In both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, there is at least one triple-solid pad structure <b>200</b>-<b>3</b> at each corner <b>202</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, there is one side-row of double-solid pad structures <b>200</b>-<b>2</b> (shown as inside dotted rectangles <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>) along each side of chip <b>20</b>, wherein corner bump pads structures <b>200</b>-<b>3</b> are not considered as being in the side-rows throughout the description. All remaining pad structures in chip <b>20</b> are single-solid pad structures. An exemplary chip having three triple-solid pad structures <b>200</b>-<b>3</b> at each corner <b>202</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. There may be one side-row of double-solid pad structures <b>200</b>-<b>2</b> along each side of chip <b>20</b>, and one corner-row of double-solid pad structures <b>200</b>-<b>2</b> at each corner. All remaining pad structures in chip <b>20</b> are single-solid pad structures. If the area of chip <b>20</b> is between about 100 mm<sup>2 </sup>and about 225 mm<sup>2</sup>, there may be one triple-solid pad structure <b>200</b>-<b>3</b> at each corner <b>202</b> if bumps <b>42</b> are eutectic bumps (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), and there may be three triple-solid pad structure <b>200</b>-<b>3</b> at each corner <b>202</b> if bumps <b>42</b> are lead-free bumps (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). If the area of chip <b>20</b> is greater than about 225 mm<sup>2</sup>, there may be three triple-solid pad structure <b>200</b>-<b>3</b> at each corner <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) regardless whether bumps <b>42</b> are eutectic bumps or lead-free bumps. Further increasing the size of chip <b>20</b>, the desirable number of triple-solid pad structures and the desirable number of double-solid pad structures may also further increase.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The embodiments have several advantageous features. The integration of single-solid pad structures, double-solid pad structures, and triple-solid pad structures in a same chip significantly improves the reliability of the semiconductor chips. However, there are no additional process steps and manufacturing costs involved. The embodiments take into the consideration of the chip size and the bump material, so that optimum effects can be achieved with minimum chip-area penalty.</p>
