<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods and apparatus contemplate a system for securing imaging devices on a network by allowing a system administrator to apply different security protocols to specific functions of an imaging device. This allows a system administrator to customize the functions of the imaging device by restricting the particular functions to only those users who need them, as opposed to the global security policies currently required. The system uses a computer program product, including executable instructions, which can be stored on the imaging device itself, a network server, and/or some other device attached to the network. The computer program product can be installed directly from the manufacturer, through computer readable media, or by downloading. The product interfaces directly with the imaging device to determine what imaging functions are present and to set what security protocols are required to access those functions.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Generally, the present invention relates to imaging devices, such as laser printers, copy machines, scanners, fax machines, inkjet printers, all-in-ones, etc. Particularly, it relates to managing user security in conjunction with different functions of imaging devices. In one aspect, a network's system administrator can complete this process through a wizard. In another, existing security measures can be added to the system. Other noteworthy features include the ability to test the security measures and the ability to customize which individual functions of the imaging devices are protected by the different security protocols. Various computing environments are also disclosed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Security is an increasingly important element in twenty-first century office environments. This increased focus has lead to multiple security protocols for both transporting data securely and for forcing users of technological devices to identify themselves in some way for the purpose of authenticating or authorizing them to use the device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the imaging device industry, the first explorations into security largely involved requiring a password to change the imaging device's configuration. Later, protocols such as the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) were developed to allow control over the actions of any individual workstation on a network. The imaging device industry adopted many of these protocols for securing imaging device operation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, these protocols have been global in nature, as they provide blanket coverage for a device, either every function of an imaging device requires a particular security protocol or no function does. Additionally, these protocols often require information to be entered at the imaging device that many older imaging devices are not capable of providing, such as character entry. This has allowed many simpler security methods, such as Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) to survive, as many older imaging devices contained number pads. As a result, imaging devices are often either under-secured, with a global PIN number to protect every feature, or over-secured, requiring complex passwords for even basic functions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, a need exists in the art of imaging devices to customize the manner in which these devices can be secured, as both imaging devices and security protocols have grown more complex and provide more features than ever before. Administrators should be able to loosely secure basic functions of an imaging device while providing meaningful security for the more cost-sensitive functions of imaging devices. Naturally, any improvements along such lines should further contemplate good engineering practices, such as relative inexpensiveness, stability, ease of implementation, low complexity, unobtrusiveness, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above-mentioned and other problems become solved by applying the principles and teachings associated with the hereinafter-described method and apparatus for managing multiple security protocols and users for imaging devices. In a basic sense, system administrators are provided with an easy to use, single access point to create, edit, and test any number of security methods for any or all users of imaging devices on a particular computer network.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a representative embodiment, a computer program product (available as a download, on a computer readable media, as firmware, as prescribed functionality amongst chips, microprocessors, ASIC(s), etc.) is installed for use with an imaging device, which is connected to a computer network. In such instances, the imaging device also connects to a web server; including hosting the program product on either or both of the imaging device or server, and/or any other connected computing devices, such as a user workstation. An administrator for the computer network remotely accesses the program product through the network and configures any security protocols which are deemed necessary to protect the functions of the connected imaging device. Also, a graphical user interface is provided for the configuration of security protocols. Information necessary for a particular security protocol is entered, and then the imaging device is configured to operate with said protocol. Thereafter, network users use the functionality of the imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">During use, the computer program product receives requests for access to individual functions of the imaging device. It is then determined whether requested function requires authorization, and if so, what type. Gathering of information includes prompting the user at his or her workstation, prompting the user at the imaging device, or by any other conceivable method, depending on the function requested. Once the authorization information is secured, it is determined whether such allows the user to access a desired imaging function (such as color printing, single-sided printing, use of paper type, or any host of conceivable imaging functions well known or later developed in the art). In one aspect, this occurs by querying resident information of locally/remotely stored records or by requesting the assistance of another program to verify the authorization information. If the authorization information is valid, the desired imaging function is initiated. If not, an entirety of imaging is prevented or a host of default options are made available.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The imaging device includes a controller, such as a microprocessor(s), ASIC(s), and/or a variety of chips, discrete components, etc. With the computer program product installed on the imaging device's controller, the individual device's functions can be more efficiently managed. Various computing environments are also disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other embodiments, aspects, advantages, and features of the present invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reference to the following description of the invention and referenced drawings or by practice of the invention. The aspects, advantages, and features of the invention are realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities, procedures, and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Authorization requires a successful authentication, and then further restricts access based upon the group or other membership of the authenticated user. The security protocol maintains a list of group or other memberships for each user, and the security template maintains a list of groups, membership in one of which is necessary for access to a function protected by that template.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A security template is a method for protecting a function. A security template has, at the very least, a defined security protocol for authentication. A security template, in addition to the security protocol for authentication, may also define a security protocol for authorization, which would include both the type of security protocol and a list of groups to be used to restrict access.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the logical steps taken by a computer program product for an imaging device are given generically as <b>100</b>. A program, generically, is a series of computer executable instructions that can be made available through means such as a computer readable medium, such as a compact disc, or through download, and may reside in hardware, firmware or other computer devices. Also, an imaging device could be represented by a laser printer, copy machine, scanner, fax machine, inkjet printer, all-in-one (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), etc. or many other devices. Imaging functions would therefore include, but not be limited to, activities such as color printing, making multiple copies, sending a fax, scanning in color, watermarking, stapling, arranging color palettes, duplexing, or any other conceivable imaging function already well known or later developed in the art. In any event, a user then requests access to use one or more of these functions at step <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At step <b>120</b>, it is determined whether any authorization is required to undertake the imaging function. If no authorization is required, the logic proceeds to step <b>180</b> whereby the imaging function is executed or otherwise access is granted to the functionality requested by the user, as necessary. If, on the other hand, authorization is indeed required per a particular function or group of functions at step <b>120</b>, such as set forth per an enterprise policy, a configuration established by a system administrator, a configuration established by a workgroup of the enterprise, etc., a particular type of authorization is then determined at step <b>130</b>. For this, it is determined whether the user needs to enter a pin, a password, or other credential, whether they need to scan an employee card, a smart card, connect a certain memory device, etc., whether they need to cause entry of biometric information, such as scanning a fingerprint, retina, or the like, or entering some combination of the foregoing or other security or designated information. Regardless, step <b>140</b> contemplates the request of the authorization information and, upon user entry, it is received by the imaging device at step <b>150</b>. Types of user entry include, but are not limited to, entering information on an entry panel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) directly at the imaging device itself (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) or at the user's workstation, depending on how the program is configured. It may be also scanned via a reader, scanner, or other appropriate device that could be either connected or integrated with the imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In any event, step <b>160</b> contemplates the assessment of whether the authorization information is valid. As before, such can occur by querying locally/remotely stored records, including querying user credentials, user workgroups, enterprise policy, or the like, or by seeking assistance the program's internal records. In any event, if the information is not valid, logic dictates the prohibiting of imaging in any form or execution of a limited number of default rejections at step <b>170</b>. As contemplated herein, a default rejection is a process that the administrator sets for instances when a user fails to properly be authorized. Representatively, this includes, but is not limited to, re-prompting the user for authorization information, returning the user to the start screen, providing limited imaging function, such as black and white, less than 10 pages, no long distance faxing, or the like. Otherwise, logic proceeds to step <b>180</b> whereby full functionality is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C, certain methods for requesting authorization information from the user are shown per step <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> teaches prompting the user to enter authentication information at the imaging device, step <b>141</b>, most likely through a screen and keypad attached to the imaging device. This scenario would most commonly be used for functions such as copying or faxing documents. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, prompting of the user to enter authentication information occurs by way of a user's computer workstation, step <b>142</b>, as will be later described relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In this context, a user is representatively working on an application at their workstation and is trying to manipulate certain imaging functions, such as color palettes, and sends their print or imaging job to the imaging device from the application. Still alternatively, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows a more complicated option. That is, this option allows the user to access multiple functions while only logging-in once. For instance, when a user attempts to use a function of the imaging device, it is determined whether the user has recently been authorized, such as within an amount of time set by the device's administrator, step <b>143</b>. If so, the earlier authorization information remains valid and the imaging function is executed without requiring re-authorization, step <b>144</b>. If not, the user is again prompted for authorization information through steps <b>141</b> or <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, representative methods <b>160</b> are shown for determining whether information provided by the user is valid. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the authorization information provided by the user is checked against various internal records, step <b>161</b>. Depending upon whether it matches the internal records, step <b>162</b>, processing proceeds to either of steps <b>170</b> or <b>180</b> as before. This scenario is most likely used for simple security measures such as verifying PINs, passwords or other credentials. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the authorization information provided by the users is checked against various external sources, step <b>165</b>. Depending upon whether it matches the external sources, step <b>166</b>, processing proceeds to either of steps <b>170</b> or <b>180</b> as before. This scenario is most likely undertaken when the security protocol requires a central source for authorization information. Such security protocols include LDAP and Kerberos, FBI fingerprint verification, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a screenshot of one possible layout of an entry panel on an imaging device. This particular display utilizes a touch-screen to allow the user to enter numerals, letters, or symbols via keypad <b>420</b>. The information entered would appear in textbox <b>410</b>. This could be used at steps <b>140</b> and <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for prompting the user to enter authorization information.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagrammatic view of a stereotypical imaging device employed in enterprise level environments. Reference point <b>520</b> shows the possible location of a display device that could be used to enter authorization information. Point <b>510</b> shows the possible location of a keypad which could be used to enter information for the purpose of authorization or for other functions, such as selecting the number of copies to be made. The imaging device's controller is shown at point <b>530</b>. The controller controls the operation of the imaging device, and may contain computer memory for the purpose of storing software or firmware. In some instances of the invention, this is where the computer program product would be stored.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, and <b>6</b>C represent the logical steps taken to configure one embodiment of the computer program product, such as would likely be done by accessing a web page hosted by a web-server located with the imaging device, although other methods are possible. The flow chart begins at point <b>600</b>, where the administrator must determine whether or not to use groups. Groups, as used herein, are a form of security which allows users with similar characteristics to be given similar security privileges. It is often used because it is more efficient than setting the security privileges for each individual user. For example, all engineers may need access to print on legal sized paper; instead of setting each engineer to have access to perform this function, the system administrator could create a group which has access to printing on legal paper, and then put all the engineers into that group. Similarly, employees in a marketing department may have need of printing in full color, thus, a marketing group would consist of employees having full color access. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 13</figref> show both the Engineer and Marketing groups, and other groups.) Of course, skilled artisans can contemplate other groups, or workgroups. Using groups also reduces the risk of error as the security setting only has to be arranged once, and there is no risk of accidentally configuring a user with the wrong settings. Authentication, in contrast, is the process of using groups to determine if a user can access a function.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If groups are not chosen, the configuration proceeds to point <b>602</b>, where the administrator chooses one of the security protocols provided at point <b>610</b>. In this embodiment, these protocols could be changed by the addition or removal of specific modules, which contain the information about the security protocol, from the program. Once a protocol is chosen, the selection is validated, and possibly more information would be required, e.g., <b>612</b> (Adding users), <b>614</b> (back to setup, if invalid), <b>616</b> (enter changes and back to setup <b>618</b>). At point <b>620</b>, the administrator can perform a Test Login. From this point, there are three options: the login test is successful (point <b>632</b>), the login test failed (point <b>634</b>), or it was bypassed (point <b>622</b>). The administrator then has the option to set a few option features, such as setting a backup password. The only remaining step for non-group security is to set the specific functions which the security protocol will apply, shown at point <b>628</b>. At this step, the administrator can modify the security of all functions, and then view a summary of the new security protocol at point <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Back to the start at <b>600</b>, however, if the administrator had chosen to use a group security policy at point <b>602</b>, he would then have the option to use one source or multiple sources for the group credentials at point <b>604</b>. If a single source is chosen, logic proceeds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> through point <b>606</b>. At point <b>638</b>, the administrator is asked to choose a group protocol, and proceed to point <b>640</b>, where various setups are undertaken, e.g., LDAP, LDAP plus GSSAPI, a preexisting setup, etc. The computer program only lists those security protocols which are compatible with using groups. Once any necessary information is entered, e.g., <b>644</b> and <b>646</b>, the administrator will have reached point <b>648</b>, including an option of entering changes <b>650</b> and/or proceeding back to the setup <b>652</b>. The administrator can then proceed to point <b>660</b> with the option to test the group template for operability, e.g., steps <b>654</b>, <b>656</b>, <b>658</b>. From here, the administrator can create a backup password (point <b>662</b>) or move on to assigning the security protocol to specific functions of the imaging device (point <b>666</b>), before viewing a security summary (point <b>668</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Had the administrator chosen to use multiple sources for the group protocol at point <b>604</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>), he would have proceeded to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> through point <b>608</b>. Points <b>672</b> through <b>681</b> are essentially the same as points <b>638</b> through <b>652</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, except these steps deal with user authentication. This sets up the method used to determine if the user is who he says he is. These steps are repeated in points <b>684</b> through <b>689</b>, but for user authorization. Authorization then determines if the user has rights to access the requested function. Points <b>692</b> through <b>699</b> follow the same logic as points <b>654</b> through <b>668</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 14</figref> are a series of screenshots showing some steps of one implementation of the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, and <b>6</b>C, by clicking on links that advance the process from one page to the next. These particular screenshots are web pages. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the initial screen, <b>700</b>, allowing an administrator to set up a new security protocol, referred to here as &#x201c;building blocks.&#x201d; In order to select a security protocol, the system administrator must select any one of the listed security protocols, at point <b>710</b>. The administrator could also assemble a security template (point <b>720</b>) or apply a template to access controls (point <b>730</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows screen <b>800</b> for managing various instances of a chosen building block, in this case LDAP+GSSAPI, from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. An administrator can add a new instance of the protocol, at point <b>810</b>. If the administrator wants to edit an existing implementation of the security protocol, he can do so by selecting point <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows screen <b>900</b> for creating a new building block, specifically LDAP+GSSAPI. The administrator must enter the required information for the implementation of the protocol. In the instance shown, the administrator must enter a name (point <b>910</b>) and location (point <b>920</b>). Other options may also be required (point <b>930</b>). If groups are being used, as they are here, the group names may be entered as well (point <b>940</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows another screen, <b>1000</b>, for creating a new building block, this time for a simple password. Here, this instance of the protocol would be named at point <b>1010</b>. The password would be entered at point <b>1020</b>, and re-entered at <b>1030</b>. A preset administrator's password can be set to work with this instance at point <b>1040</b>. When the administrator is finished, button <b>1050</b> is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows screen <b>1100</b>, the first step of setting up group authorization, labeled here as a &#x201c;Security Template.&#x201d; The template's name is entered into textbox <b>1110</b>. The authentication setup can be selected from drop-down menu <b>1120</b>. If the administrator is satisfied with the information, he may click button <b>1130</b>. If he wants to finish the process later, he may select button <b>1140</b>, or press button <b>1150</b> to cancel the process.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows screen <b>1200</b>, the result of pressing the &#x201c;Add authorization&#x201d; button from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. It shows the name entered in textbox <b>1110</b> and the authentication setup chosen in drop-down menu <b>1120</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The administrator must choose the authorization setup from drop-down menu <b>1210</b>. This is done on a separate screen to minimize improper configurations, by allowing the system to choose which authorization setup options fit with authentication setup chosen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The administrator can then set the group at button <b>1220</b>. He could also choose to save the template to finish it at a later time (button <b>1230</b>) or cancel the process (button <b>1240</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a screen <b>1300</b> allowing the administrator to select which groups are authorized to access the imaging device. The administrator must select any necessary groups from list box <b>1310</b>. He can then save the template by selecting button <b>1320</b> or canceling the process by selecting button <b>1330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the screen <b>1400</b> for selecting which imaging functions require which security protocols. The administrator sees a list of functions which can be restricted (point <b>1410</b>). Each option has an associated drop-down menu containing the names of the security protocols which have been created, as well as the options to disable a feature completely and to apply no security protocol at all. Here, drop-down menu <b>1420</b> shows that a user can only access the security menus remotely if satisfying the &#x201c;UsersIn [Group] NOC&#x201d; setting. Meanwhile, drop-down menu <b>1430</b> shows that anyone may access the paper menu at the device. Drop-down menu <b>1440</b> shows that the function allowing the language to be changed has been completely disabled. Drop down menu <b>1450</b> shows that only a system administrator can lock the operator panel (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a typical network <b>1500</b>. There are several workstations (<b>1510</b>), as well as other devices (<b>1520</b>) connected to the network. In addition, there are two imaging devices connected to the network at point <b>1530</b>. Each imaging device also contains a controller (e.g., <b>530</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), shown at point <b>1540</b>. In the representative embodiment, the computer program product would be stored on firmware acting as the controller. The computer program could be installed on the controller using means including, but not limited to, installation when the imaging device was manufactured, by installing on a computer readable media through media reader <b>1550</b> on a workstation, or by downloading from the network <b>1560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With the foregoing in mind, skilled artisans will readily contemplate additional functionality. For example, information technology (IT) or other system administrator-type personnel of an enterprise may incorporate newly developed security methods such as biometric security into the computer program. They might also adapt the program to cover new functionality of imaging devices, which have yet to be developed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Certain advantages of the invention over the prior art should now be readily apparent. For example, an imaging device can now be secured more efficiently as particular functions can have an appropriate level of security directly applied, instead of dealing with a &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; security mentality. Also, the stated problems of the prior art are overcome by features of the invention that: 1) increase the flexibility of securing an imaging device by allowing different security protocols to protect different functions of an imaging device, or to disable those functions completely (as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>); 2) allows the use of group structures and other forms of security (as described, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, and <b>6</b>C); and/or 3) includes the ability to add new security protocols through updating the computer program.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Finally, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that still further embodiments are also possible without departing from the teachings of the present invention. This detailed description, and particularly the specific details of the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, is given primarily for clarity of understanding, and no unnecessary limitations are to be implied, for modifications will become obvious to those skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure and may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Relatively apparent modifications, of course, include combining the various features of one or more figures with the features of one or more of other figures. The present invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
