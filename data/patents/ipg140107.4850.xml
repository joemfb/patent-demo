<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Excess optical power in a waveguide device is appropriately terminated. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the waveguide device comprises a termination structure filled with a light blocking material for terminating light from the end section of a waveguide. This termination structure can be formed by forming a groove on an optical waveguide by removing the clad and core, and filling the inside of that groove with a material attenuating the intensity of the light (light blocking material). In this manner, light that enters into the termination structure is attenuated by the light blocking material, and influence on other optical devices as a crosstalk component can be suppressed. With such termination structure, not only the influence on optical devices integrated on the same substrate, but also the influence on other optical devices directly connected to that substrate can be suppressed.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an optical device using a waveguide on a substrate. More particularly, the present invention relates to terminating a waveguide, which is not connected to an input or output fiber, at an arbitrary location on the substrate, and attenuating the intensity of an optical signal propagating through such waveguide.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Due to the explosive growth of broadband communications in homes, network contents are increasingly diversified. Generated along with it, increased communication traffic and expanded communication services are pressing demands for larger capacity, higher speed and greater functionality of the backbone communication networks on a daily basis. In recent years, optical communication technologies have served an important role in meeting these demands. Further, in past optical networks, point-to-point type communication systems connecting between two points by optical to electrical and electrical to optical conversion signal processing have been a mainstream. However, in the future, it is essential to deploy mesh-type communication that connects multiple points using optical signals without conversion to electrical signals on all networks, including access networks, so that more diversified use of communication by each user can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A waveguide device is an example of components that perform an important role in this optical communication system. In applications of optical interference principle, various functions such as an optical signal splitting/coupling device, a wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing device, an interleave filter, an optical switch, a variable optical attenuator (VOA), and the like have been achieved. These devices are waveguide-type devices, so they have flexibility in design, and can easily be made on a large scale and with high integration. Not only that, since semiconductor component such as LSI manufacturing processes can be used, it is expected that these devices will be excellent for mass production. While various devices such as waveguides using semiconductors and polymer materials have been put to practical use, especially silica waveguides fabricated on a silicon substrate have properties such as low loss, stability and superior coupling with optical fibers, and are one of waveguide devices for which practical applications have been most advanced.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of schemes for an optical communication system node constructed using these waveguide devices is a reconfigurable add/drop multiplexing (ROADM) which is used for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) signal. This scheme has a function of sending all signals to adjacent nodes after transferring with a lower layer network only for arbitrary WDM channel signals in a node, and is mainly used as a scheme for configuring a ring network. The optical devices necessary for achieving this function include a wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing filter for multiplexing or demultiplexing WDM signal for each wavelength, an optical switch for switching a signal path, a VOA for adjusting optical intensity of a signal, an optical signal transmitter/receiver, an optical intensity monitor and the like, and in particular, a wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing filter, an optical switch and a VOA and the like can be achieved using waveguide devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, these waveguide devices have been integrated in a single module, making it possible to configure a highly functional optical device which realizes the major functions of a ROADM system, and deployments into actual network systems have actively been put forward. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is, as one example, a block diagram of a circuit integrated with wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing filters (<b>1404</b>, <b>1406</b>, <b>1416</b>), optical switches (<b>1408</b>-<b>1</b> to N), VOAs (<b>1410</b>-<b>1</b> to N), optical couplers (<b>1402</b>, <b>1412</b>-<b>1</b> to N) and photo detectors (PD) for monitoring (<b>1414</b>-<b>1</b> to N) as one module <b>1400</b>. According to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the WDM signal that enters the main path from the input (In) is first split by the tap optical coupler <b>1402</b>. Then, one of the split signals is separated into individual wavelength signals by a DEMUX filter <b>1404</b> for drop path and only the signals having the wavelength used by a lower-layer network is detected. The other signal is also separated into individual wavelength signals by a different DEMUX filter <b>1406</b>, and then passing through 2&#xd7;1 optical switches <b>1408</b>-<b>1</b> to N which select either the signals from Add path, transmitted from the lower-layer network, or the signals from the main path. In the 2&#xd7;1 optical switches, the signals from the Add path are selected only for the wavelengths that correspond to the wavelength signals detected earlier in the drop path. Furthermore, the signal level of each wavelength is adjusted by the VOA <b>1410</b>-<b>1</b> to N, and the output is monitored by means of the tap optical coupler <b>1412</b>-<b>1</b> to N and monitor PD <b>1414</b>-<b>1</b> to N connected thereafter, and fed back to control the attenuation at the VOA. The level-adjusted signal of each wavelength become a WDM signal through a wavelength multiplexing (MUX) filter <b>1416</b>, and then is going out from the output (out) of the main path.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a conventional technology, implementation of module is realized by connecting these individual optical devices each other via optical fiber in the module. However, in the future, in order to make a module more compact, larger scale and lower power consumption, further improvement in integration is a substantial challenge.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One of technologies that have been proposed to meet this requirement of improving integration is a multi-chip integration technology. This is a technology in which individual waveguide device substrates are directly connected together without using optical fibers, so that waveguide devices themselves can be smaller and the mounting area inside the module can be reduced. For example, in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the wavelength multiplexing and demultiplexing filters <b>1406</b>, <b>1416</b> are manufactured as one waveguide device substrate <b>1420</b>. Similarly, the optical switches <b>1408</b>-<b>1</b> to N, the VOAs <b>1410</b>-<b>1</b> to N, and the optical couplers <b>1412</b>-<b>1</b> to N are manufactured as one waveguide device substrate <b>1430</b>. Then, when connecting, the substrates are connected each other directly, not via optical fiber. In addition, the monitor PDs <b>1414</b>-<b>1</b> to N are not waveguide devices, but can be connected, not via optical fiber, to the monitor ports for the optical couplers <b>1412</b>-<b>1</b> to N, on the end surface of the wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing filter substrate <b>1420</b>, or the end surface of the optical switch substrate <b>1430</b>. With this technique, the length of optical fiber used in the module <b>1400</b> and the number of parts for connecting optical fiber to the substrates <b>1420</b>, <b>1430</b> can be eliminated, and as a result, the mounting area inside the module is reduced, improving integration of the devices. In this case, a VOA bears the function of adjusting the optical level of the passing optical signal by an attenuation operation and suppressing level deviation between the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The most basic configuration of a VOA using a waveguide device is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. This VOA <b>1500</b> is a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) type optical device, which comprises two directional couplers <b>1504</b> and <b>1508</b> for splitting or coupling an optical signal and arm waveguides <b>1506</b><i>a</i>, <b>1505</b><i>b</i>, with thin film heaters <b>1512</b><i>a</i>, <b>1512</b><i>b </i>being formed on the arm waveguides <b>1506</b><i>a</i>, <b>1506</b><i>b</i>. An incident optical signal from a port <b>1502</b><i>a </i>is split by the directional coupler <b>1504</b>, respectively propagating along the arm waveguides <b>1506</b><i>a </i>and <b>1506</b><i>b</i>, and combined again by the directional coupler <b>1508</b>. On this occasion, when power is supplied to one of the thin-film heaters <b>1512</b><i>a </i>and <b>1512</b><i>b </i>from an electrode pad <b>1516</b>, <b>1518</b>, a phase difference occurs between the arm waveguides <b>1506</b><i>a </i>and <b>1505</b><i>b</i>, and the intensity of the optical signal output from the port <b>1510</b><i>a </i>or <b>1510</b><i>b </i>changes according to the phase relationship in the directional coupler <b>1508</b>. When the phase difference is 0, the optical signal is output from port <b>1510</b><i>b </i>100%, and when the phase difference is 71, output from port <b>1510</b><i>a </i>100%. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, if this phase difference is adjusted by controlling the power supply to the thin-film heaters in analog fashion, the device can be used as a VOA. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> is a cross-sectional diagram at section line XVB-XVB in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. The optical waveguide is fabricated on a silicon substrate <b>1520</b> and composed of clad <b>1522</b> made of a silica glass and a rectangular shaped core <b>1524</b> covered thereby. On both sides of the arm waveguides, there are heat-insulating grooves <b>1514</b> formed by removing the clad along the waveguides using an etching technique, which can lower the electric power required for switching or attenuation. Now, based on the MZI interference principle, even when error occurs in the coupling rate due to manufacturing error of the optical couplers, in order to obtain a sufficient extinction ratio or optical attenuation, the path from port <b>1502</b><i>a </i>to port <b>1510</b><i>b</i>, or the path from port <b>1502</b><i>b </i>to port <b>1510</b><i>a </i>(cross path) is typically used as the main signal path. Furthermore, when taking into consideration the power consumption or the polarization dependency of thermo-optical effect, most typically the optical signal will be blocked, or driven to achieve the maximum attenuation, when the thin-film heaters <b>1512</b><i>a</i>, <b>1512</b><i>b </i>are applied with no power. For that, it is required that a predetermined suitable difference (optical path length difference) is given to effective optical distances in the arm waveguides <b>1506</b><i>a</i>, <b>1506</b><i>b </i>over which the optical signals propagate through the waveguides, that is, the optical path lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The optical attenuation operation in a VOA, having a MZI as the basic element and comprising two optical waveguides, not only attenuates the optical level of the main port (output waveguide connected to optical fiber or to other waveguide device), but also outputs the excess optical power (attenuated power) to other port (dummy port). For example, in a MZI-type VOA that uses a cross path as the main signal path, assuming port <b>1502</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> is an input, port <b>1510</b><i>b </i>becomes the main port and port <b>1510</b><i>a </i>becomes the dummy port. According to this conventional art, the excess optical power guided to the dummy port propagates to the output end surface of the waveguide device substrate and is generally emitted to the air directly.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, it becomes clear that a problem exists in the case of mounting using a multi-chip integration technique such as directly connecting the waveguide device substrate <b>1608</b> of the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG), monitor PD and the like to the waveguide device substrate including the VOA <b>1602</b> and tap optical coupler <b>1604</b>. In other words, a part of the excess optical power from the VOA <b>1602</b> emitted from the end surface of the waveguide device substrate <b>1606</b> is coupled with the waveguide <b>1610</b> led from the tap optical coupler <b>1604</b> located in a subsequent stage from the VOA <b>1602</b>, and as a result, causes branching ratio deviation or crosstalk, which degrades the circuit characteristics. In addition, this similarly causes various crosstalk to occur in the following AWG and monitor PD (not shown in the figure), which also causes degraded circuit characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, when implementing waveguide devices using a normal optical fiber connection instead of using a multi-chip integration technique, as the degree of integration increases, the density of optical waveguides on the end surfaces of the waveguide device substrate dramatically increases, which reveals a problem causing a crosstalk by the propagated excess optical power coupling with the main path, or the excess optical power emitted from the end surfaces coupling with optical fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, in waveguide devices, the appropriate termination treatment for the excess optical power has become a significant problem.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention is directed to terminate the excess optical power in a waveguide device at an arbitrary location on the substrate without emission, and to suppress crosstalk to optical fibers and other waveguide devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the present invention, an optical waveguide is terminated in a waveguide device by forming a groove at an arbitrary point on a substrate by removing clad and core and filling inside of that groove with a material (light blocking material) which attenuates intensity of light. This attenuates the light entering into the termination structure by the light blocking material, and can suppress the influence of becoming crosstalk component to other optical devices. Accordingly, the influence, not only on optical devices integrated in the same substrate, but also on other optical devices connected directly to that substrate, for example, the influence on other waveguide devices and optical receiving and emitting elements can be suppressed. Therefore, the invention is very effective in achieving a highly integrated optical device, and expected to significantly contribute to the development of large-capacity optical networks that require various control of optical signals.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Embodiments of the invention will be explained in detail below with reference to the drawings. In the examples below, an optical device will be described which uses silica single mode optical waveguides formed on a silicon substrate will be explained. This is because this configuration is stable and easy for integration, as well as has superior compatibility with silica optical fiber, so a low-loss optical device can be provided. However, the present invention is not limited to this configuration.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a waveguide device according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in the figure, this device <b>100</b> is configured as a wavelength multiplexing device with an optical level adjustment function (VMUX: VOA equipped MUX) in which a substrate <b>120</b> including VOAs <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N is connected to a substrate <b>130</b> including an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) <b>110</b>. This device is employed, for example, in a WDM system. In this configuration example, the VOAs <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N and tap optical couplers <b>106</b>-<b>1</b> to N are integrated in a single substrate <b>120</b>, and optical power monitor PDs <b>108</b> and AWG <b>110</b> are integrated in a separate single substrate <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a detailed circuit layout of the substrate <b>120</b> including VOAs <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N in this configuration example. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, to simplify the drawings, only thin-film heaters which drive the VOAs <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N are illustrated, and electric wirings for supplying power to the heaters, and heat insulating grooves (to be described later) are omitted. In order that the optical levels for a plurality of channels can be adjusted simultaneously, the VOAs <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N arranged in parallel comprise two stages of MZIs <b>202</b>-<b>1</b> to N, <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> to N connected in series, and the attenuation operation is performed by applying electric power to both MZIs. For the later stage in the VOAs <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N, wavelength independent couplers (WINCs) are connected as tap optical couplers <b>106</b>-<b>1</b> to N. In addition, the main ports <b>206</b><i>a </i>and tap ports <b>206</b><i>b </i>are extended to the end of the substrate to respectively connect to the AWG <b>110</b> and PDs <b>108</b> for monitoring the optical power level of each channel, integrated on a separate substrate <b>130</b>. The excess light guided from each of the MZIs <b>202</b>-<b>1</b> to N, <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> to N to each of the dummy ports <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> to N by the attenuation operation of the VOA <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N is guided over the extended line from the dummy port to termination structure <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> to N which comprises a groove formed by removing the clad layer and core section at an arbitrary location on the substrate and material (light blocking material) attenuating the optical intensity in the groove, and is attenuated and terminated to a level that is no longer a crosstalk or stray light to other circuits or channels.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The light blocking material used in this embodiment is a mixture of silicone resin as a base material and carbon black which is typically used as a light blocking material. The optical power of the light incident to the light blocking material is mainly attenuated by absorption by the carbon black.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The substrate <b>120</b> including these VOAs <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N is manufactured by a process as described below. A single-mode optical waveguide having a clad layer and an embedded core section formed on a 1 mm thick 6-inch diameter silicon substrate using silica glass is manufactured by a combination of a silica glass film deposition technique, which utilizes a flame hydrolysis reaction of a raw material gas such as SiCl<sub>4 </sub>or GeCl<sub>4</sub>, and a reactive ion etching technique. Then, electrodes for the thin-film heaters and for power supply were formed on the surface of the clad layer by vacuum deposition and patterning. The normal core dimension of the manufactured optical waveguide was 7 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;7 &#x3bc;m, and the relative refractive index difference &#x394; with the clad layer was 0.75%.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The VOA and WINC in this first embodiment use this kind of optical waveguides, and are formed by a combination of straight waveguides and curved waveguides. The thin-film heaters, formed on the surface of the clad layer as thermo-optic effect phase shifters, had a 0.1 &#x3bc;m thickness, 20 &#x3bc;m width and 2 mm length. In addition, heat insulating grooves were formed along the thin-film heaters and were structured to efficiently transfer the heat generated from the thin-film heaters to the cores of the optical waveguides. The grooves for the termination structures <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> to N which are connected to the dummy ports of the VOAs <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N were formed at the same time as the process for the heat insulating grooves. In this embodiment, the groove size was 100 &#x3bc;m width and 1 mm length. The depth of the grooves was below the core section. However, the depth may reach the substrate. The overall length of the optical circuit comprising VOAs <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N and WINCs <b>106</b>-<b>1</b> to N in this first embodiment, configured with MZIs as the basic elements, was 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The difference in the optical path length between the two arms of the MZI <b>202</b>-<b>1</b> to N, <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> to N constituting the VOA <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N is set to half-wave length of the propagating signal light, so that the signal light in the main path when power is not supplied to the VOA <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N is in a blocked state (maximum attenuation). In this embodiment, in order to process the WDM signal for each wavelength channel, the VOAs are arranged in parallel. However, for simplicity in design, the optical path length differences in all VOAs were unified to 0.75 &#x3bc;m, which is half the 1.55 &#x3bc;m, which is the center of the signal optical wavelength band of interest. However, it is noted here that in a more strict sense, the optical path length difference may be set for each VOA to correspond to the wavelength of propagating signal light.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">By continuously changing the electric power applied to the thin-film heaters, the VOA <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N can set an arbitrary attenuation amount. Further, it is often desired that the extinction ratio, which is the difference in power of the light signal at the main port between the zero attenuation (maximum light output) state and the maximum attenuation (blocked light output) state, normally be 50 dB or greater, and when configured with only a 1-stage MZI, a sufficient extinction ratio may not be obtained. Therefore, in this embodiment, it was configured with a 2-stage MZIs connected in series, and an extinction ratio of 55 dB or greater was obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this embodiment, when the VOA attenuation is a maximum, the excess amount of optical power guided to the dummy port becomes a maximum, and when termination is not performed adequately, crosstalk occurs in WINC at the following stage or in the AWG substrate <b>130</b> connected directly to the VOA substrate <b>120</b>, and has an adverse effect. In order to compare with the circuit of this embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> (referred to as sample 1), a circuit in which the waveguide ends at the position of the section line A-A&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> without any termination structure in the dummy ports <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> to N (referred to as sample 2), and a circuit in which only grooves <b>212</b>-<b>1</b> to N as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> are adopted without any light blocking material (referred to as sample 3) were also manufactured at the same time. For the manufactured sample in this embodiment, in order to observe the effect of suppressing crosstalk by the termination structures <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> to N of the dummy ports <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> to N, the amount of crosstalk in channels adjacent to the signal light propagating channel was measured in the maximum attenuation (light output blocked) state of the VOA.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For sample 2 in which no groove or light blocking material for termination is used in the dummy ports <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> to N, crosstalk having a level of about &#x2212;30 dB occurred at both the main ports <b>206</b><i>a </i>and tap ports <b>206</b><i>b </i>of the adjacent channels. This shows that the excess amount of optical power guided to the dummy ports <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> to N were all propagated in the clad mode at the end points of the dummy ports, and finally coupled with the waveguides of the adjacent channels and became crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Even in sample 3 in which only grooves <b>212</b>-<b>1</b> to N are adopted at the end of the dummy ports <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> to N without any light blocking material, crosstalk into the adjacent channels were large, and crosstalk of about &#x2212;40 dB, occurred at both the main ports <b>206</b><i>a </i>and the tap ports <b>206</b><i>b</i>. Although part of the optical power of the light emitted from the end surfaces of the waveguides in the grooves <b>212</b>-<b>1</b> to N is attenuated by reflection or scattering within the grooves, after propagated again as the clad mode, it can be seen that crosstalk has occurred as a result of coupling with adjacent waveguides.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">On the other hand, for sample 1 in which the dummy ports <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> to N are terminated by the grooves and light blocking material filled within the grooves, the crosstalk to the adjacent channels showed a value less than &#x2212;60 dB. It was confirmed that the excess optical power resulting from the light blocking of this invention was attenuated to a level that did not affect other circuits, and that suitable termination treatment was made.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the shape of the grooves of the termination structures <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> to N is such that the angle (&#x3b8;) of the incident plane to the groove with respect to the propagation direction of the terminated waveguide is 8 degrees. In this embodiment, the refractive index of the light blocking material, which is a mixture of silicone resin and carbon black, is nearly equivalent to that of silica glass, but taking into consideration the small refractive index difference, it was designed by adding an angle (&#x3b8;) such that the return loss of the VOA was not affected. Actually, the optimum angle (&#x3b8;) will be determined by taking into consideration the refractive index of the light blocking material, the placement space of the termination structures, and the processing precision of the grooves. When the return loss on the input side of the VOA <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N was measured on sample 1 manufactured according to this embodiment, a good characteristic of 50 dB or greater was confirmed.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a second embodiment of the present invention, having the same configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a light blocking material was used in the termination section of the dummy ports <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> to N of the VOAs <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N, which is a mixture of silicone resin as the base material and metal particulate powder which is also used as pigment. The optical power of the light incident to the light blocking material is mainly attenuated with light scattering by the metal particulate powder. The manufactured sample comprises silica based optical waveguides fabricated on a silicon substrate according to embodiment 1, and in order to prevent crosstalk coupling to adjacent optical waveguides, termination structures <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> to N are adopted introducing grooves and light blocking material. In this embodiment as well, the crosstalk to adjacent channels was &#x2212;60 dB or less.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Moreover, when taking into consideration the refractive indexes of the light blocking material and the optical waveguide, the angle (&#x3b8; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the incident planes to the grooves of the terminated waveguides is set to 15 degrees. In this case, the return loss on the input side of the VOA <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N showed a good characteristic of 50 dB or greater.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">in embodiment 3 of the present invention, the configuration is the same as that of embodiment 2, and the angle (&#x3b8; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the incident planes to the grooves of the terminated waveguides is set to Brewster's angle. The other configuration and the light blocking material are the same as those of embodiment 2. In this embodiment, Brewster's angle was calculated to be about 50 degrees. By setting the angle of the incident plane to the Brewster's angle, the polarized light component in the horizontal direction of the substrate all enter into the light blocking material, and part of the polarized light component in the vertical direction of the substrate are emitted into the waveguide substrate by reflection. In this manner, the effect of crosstalk due to emitted light is further reduced in all areas of the waveguide substrate. According to this embodiment, the crosstalk to adjacent channels was &#x2212;65 dB or less, and the reflection attenuation on the input side of the VOA <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N also became 55 dB or greater. Further, it is clear that this embodiment can also be applied to the configuration other than embedment <b>2</b>, such as embodiment 1. Therefore, depending on the placement space of the termination structures in the circuit, by setting the incident angle to the Brewster's angle as appropriate, more effective termination for the excess optical power can be achieved.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Embodiment 4 of the invention has the same configuration as embodiment 1, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the shape in the horizontal plane of a groove which terminates a dummy port <b>208</b> was formed by closed curves composed of only curved lines and straight lines connected smoothly without any apex points, and then light blocking material was introduced. The light blocking material used is a mixture of silicone resin and carbon black, and when manufacturing a sample, since the wall surface of the groove was formed smoothly, exfoliation of the light blocking material is difficult to occur, so long-term reliability was improved. In addition, the effect of reducing crosstalk was the same as in embodiment 1, with the crosstalk to adjacent channels being &#x2212;60 dB or fewer. In this embodiment as well, the angle of the incident plane to the grooves in the termination section was set to 8 degrees, so the reflection attenuation on the input side of the VOA <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N was 50 dB or greater.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Embodiment 5</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In embodiment 5 of the invention, the configuration is the same as in embodiment 1, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the shape of an optical waveguide in the termination section of a dummy pert <b>208</b> is a tapered shape. This was done for the purpose of reducing the power density of light entering into the light blocking material by expanding the mode field diameter of propagating light to be greater than that of a normal width optical waveguide in other locations. For example, in the case of attenuating the excess optical power of the VOA <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to N by the light blocking material absorbing light, because of conversion of the optical power to heat, the temperature of the light blocking material rises. When this happens, the higher the power density becomes, more rapid local temperature elevation occurs, so that the silicone resin, which is the base material of the light blocking material, may be damaged. Particularly, in an optical device in a node system such as ROADM, the rated input optical power may be 200 mW (+23 dBm) or greater, and thus it is expected that, in one channel, the maximum excess optical power (during shutdown) guided to the VOA dummy port <b>208</b> will be about 10 mW (+10 dBm). The elevated temperature in the light blocking material at that time may exceed 300 degrees depending on the incident mode field diameter, which exceeds the allowable temperature range of silicone resin.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this embodiment, for the two kinds of tapered shapes, the parabolic shape illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and the straight shape illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the taper length of each was 100 &#x3bc;m and the taper width (incident side of the termination structure) was 30 &#x3bc;m, a light blocking material was used, which was a mixture of silicone resin and carbon black, and when the resistance to input power was observed, it was found that the blocking material was not damaged due to an input power of 10 mW (+10 dBm) for either shapes. Specifically, near the light input section, the light blocking material was cut with a cross section vertical to the incident direction of the light, and visually inspected.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to this embodiment, it is clear to have sufficient resistance to high power, and to be applicable to node systems.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The taper length and width in this embodiment are only one example, and both values are determined according to the positional relationship and spacing of adjacent waveguides and other circuits, and are not limited to the values given in this embodiment. In other words, the taper length can be arbitrarily determined from several tens of &#x3bc;m to several mm. Moreover, even the taper width may be narrowed with respect to the normal optical waveguide width, so that the mode field diameter can be expanded. Therefore, from the aspect of expanding the mode field diameter as much as possible, the taper width can be arbitrarily set from 0 &#x3bc;m to 30 &#x3bc;l.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Moreover, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, even in the case where the shape of the waveguides at the termination section is taken to be a multi-mode interferometer, when the resistance to input power was similarly observed, it was confirmed that the light blocking material was not damaged for the shape with the interferometer length of 100 &#x3bc;m and the interferometer width of 30 &#x3bc;m, even at an input power of 10 mW (+10 dBm).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the case with any shape, from the aspect of expanding mode field diameter, the same effect was expected and sufficient effect was obtained in each.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Embodiment 6</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an embodiment 6 of the invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the terminated optical waveguide is arranged such that it is surrounded in the horizontal plane of the substrate by grooves and light blocking material. This ensures that the reflected light occurring at the termination section of an optical waveguide does not affect other circuits and the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the structure <b>710</b> surrounding the terminated optical waveguide is arranged in a way that, when the incident light <b>702</b> is terminated at the end point <b>704</b> of the optical waveguide, and part of it becomes reflected light <b>706</b> having a fixed width (indicated by the dotted lines in the figure) which propagates in the substrate, but that reflected light <b>706</b> is to be blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In embodiment 2 described above, since a mixture of a silicone resin and metal particulate powder was used as the light blocking material, a fixed amount of reflected light occurred due to the refractive index difference with the silica glass. However, by setting the angle of the incident plane with respect to the groove of the terminated optical waveguide to 15 degrees, most of the reflected light was emitted into the optical waveguide substrate without coupling with the terminated optical waveguide. In this case, even when the configuration of the termination structure with respect to the terminated optical waveguide is as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for example, the emitted reflected light reached the end surface of the substrate while incurring a certain amount of attenuation, and was emitted into the air without coupling with the input/output optical fiber, which did not cause any problem with the circuit characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">However, when integrating optical receiving parts such as a monitor PD on the end surface of a substrate or the top surface of a substrate in a waveguide device, provided with an optical waveguide termination structure in an arbitrary location, the reflected light may be received and detected as crosstalk, which can cause a problem with the circuit characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Therefore, a waveguide device having the termination structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> was manufactured, with a mixture of silicone resin and metal particulate powder as the light blocking material, and crosstalk was measured using a PD at various locations (end surface, top and bottom surfaces) of the substrate. The result shows that the crosstalk was &#x2212;60 dB or less at all locations with respect to light intensity input to the terminated waveguides. When comparing this with structure as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, for example, it may depend on the circuit configuration and the location, there was an improvement of crosstalk of 10 dB or greater in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the configuration of this embodiment, since the objective is to block reflected light, the size, location and shape may be arbitrarily determined as long as it does not affect the layout of other circuits, etc. In addition, terminating section of the optical waveguide does not have to be continuous with the blocking section for the reflected light. For example, the effect of the invention is the same even for a shape as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, for example, in which the structure <b>714</b> for blocking the reflected light is not geographically continuous with the termination structure <b>712</b> of the optical waveguide. In that case, the shape of each structure <b>712</b>, <b>714</b> may be formed by a closed curve composed of only smooth curves and straight lines with no apex points, and the material may be absorbing or scattering the light. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the waveguide has a tapered shape. However, a shape other than this may be employed.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Embodiment 7</heading>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> are diagrams illustrating the configuration of an embodiment 7 of the invention. In embodiment 5, it was described about the configuration which improves the resistance to high optical power input to the termination structure of a waveguide. However, when it is necessary to terminate optical power reaching the input power of several tens of mW, that resistance may not be sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Therefore, configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> can further improve the high power resistance. In this embodiment, the terminated optical waveguide <b>802</b> has a straight tapered structure in which the waveguide width becomes narrower toward the terminating end, and a groove shape <b>810</b> filled with light blocking material as illustrated in embodiment 6 is configured to surround the waveguide. Moreover, at the terminating location of the waveguide, the end point of the optical waveguide <b>802</b> and the termination structure <b>802</b> are connected via a gap by the clad layer having a distance L<b>1</b>. The distance L<b>1</b> is set such that the light emitted from the terminating end of the waveguide is sufficiently absorbed by the termination structure, and is set to a value of 1 mm or less, for example. In this case, the shape is configured such that the taper length L<b>2</b> was set to 500 and the spot size of the light propagating along the waveguide was rapidly changed by increasing the change rate of the waveguide width. Moreover, the distance L<b>1</b> between the terminating point of the waveguide and the termination structure was set to 750 &#x3bc;m, and the incident angle &#x3b8; of the light with respect to the termination structure was set to 15 degrees. The groove surrounding the terminated optical waveguide is shaped to gradually approach the optical waveguide at the section L<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, and is arranged closely such that in the straight tapered section, the distance from the center of the width of the optical waveguide to the groove is within a range from half the width of the waveguide (the groove comes in contact with the side wall of the waveguide core) to about the width of the waveguide, depending on manufacturing error and required attenuation. In this embodiment, the distance L<b>3</b> was set to 250 &#x3bc;m, and the distance from the center of the optical waveguide at the starting location of the straight taper to the groove was set to 7 &#x3bc;m, which is the same as the waveguide width.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A sample was manufactured according to the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, using the light blocking material with a mixture of silicone resin and carbon black, and when the resistance to input power was observed, it was confirmed that the light blocking material was not damaged with an input power of 50 mW (+17 dBm).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to the configuration of this embodiment, since light emission occurs due to the structure which converts the spot size rapidly at the straight taper, part of the optical power can be attenuated by the light blocking material surrounding the optical waveguide. Moreover, a large part of the optical power, of which the mode field is expanded by the taper, propagates over the optical waveguide. However, since the optical power enters into the termination structure via the gap by the clad layer at the terminating position, the optical power is further spread, and the sudden rise in temperature due to local light absorption inside the light blocking material can be mitigated.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the configuration of this embodiment, the return loss on the input side of the VOA was measured and found to be 55 dB or greater. Crosstalk measurement was also performed using a PD at various locations of the substrate and was &#x2212;60 dB or less at all locations with respect to the optical intensity input to the terminated optical waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In this embodiment, it is preferred that the taper of the optical waveguide is shaped with narrowing the waveguide width toward the terminating end. However, the width at the end can be arbitrarily set within a range that is narrower than the normal (other than the taper section) waveguide width. Moreover, for a straight tapered shape with narrowing width, by employing two different change rate of widths, shape with two stages of straight tapered sections being connected may be employed. It is within a scope of the present invention to use an optical waveguide taper having such shape.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Moreover, the distance of the gap by the clad layer between the end point of the optical waveguide and the termination structure is adjusted according to the placement space in the circuit and input optical power, and the appropriate range could be 1 mm or less. In other words, the distance is set so that the light emitted from the terminating end of the waveguide is sufficiently absorbed by the termination structure. Conversely, the distance in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> may be 0 mm. However, in that case, the optical power maybe input to the termination structure locally, so sufficient high-power resistance may not be obtained. However, for the purpose of terminating the optical waveguide and suppressing crosstalk, this can be achieved as long as the light blocking material is not damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, a high-power resistance of several tens of mW was confirmed. However, when the power is higher, for example in the case of 100 mW (+20 dB) input, depending on the type of light blocking material, the resistance was not adequate in some cases. Therefore, by using the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, further improvement was attained for the high-power resistance. That is to say, the groove <b>812</b> surrounding the terminated optical waveguide <b>804</b> is in contact with the side wall of the optical waveguide core for just an arbitrary distance L&#x2032;<b>4</b>, where this distance L&#x2032;<b>4</b> continues to the starting point of the straight taper of the optical waveguide <b>804</b>. In addition, the straight taper of this optical waveguide <b>804</b> is shaped such that the width narrows towards the end point. Moreover, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the end point of the optical waveguide <b>804</b> and the termination structure <b>812</b> are arranged with a gap by the clad layer. In this embodiment, the taper length L&#x2032;<b>2</b> was set to 500 &#x3bc;m, the distance L&#x2032;<b>1</b> of the gap was similarly set to 500 &#x3bc;m, and the width W&#x2032; of the section sandwiched between grooves contacting with the side wall of the optical waveguide was constant up to the termination section <b>812</b>. With this embodiment, from the instant that the grooves come in contact with the optical waveguide <b>804</b>, part of the propagating optical power is emitted into the grooves and attenuated, and after the field is expanded toward the termination structure, the remaining optical power is attenuated and terminated in the termination structure. In this way, compared with the configuration described for the preceding embodiments, the optical power can be attenuated more gradually. A sample was manufactured according to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, with a mixture of silicone resin and carbon black as the light blocking material, and when the resistance to input power was observed, it was confirmed that the light blocking material was not damaged with an input power of 100 mW (+20 dBm). In addition, the reflection attenuation on the input side was measured and found to be 55 dB or greater. In crosstalk measurement using PD at various locations on the substrate, the crosstalk was &#x2212;60 dB or less at all locations with respect to the optical intensity input to the terminated optical waveguide. In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the width W&#x2032; of the section sandwiched between grooves is constant. However, by making the shape such that the grooves come in contact with the side wall of the optical waveguide core even in the straight taper section, further improvement in the input power resistance may be attained. Moreover, in order to prevent deficient in the core pattern due to manufacturing error (position displacement, pattern shift) of the grooves in contact with the side wall of the core, a distance of about 1 to 5 &#x3bc;m between the grooves and the side wall may be provided by way of the clad layer as long as the propagation loss of the optical waveguide increases in the area near the grooves.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a diagram illustrating the configuration of a waveguide device according to an embodiment 8 of the invention. This device <b>900</b><i>a </i>constitutes a main functions of a ROADM system such that a waveguide device substrate <b>920</b><i>a </i>integrating a waveguide optical switch (not shown in the figure), VOA <b>902</b> and WINC <b>904</b> is directly connected with a waveguide device substrate <b>930</b> integrating an AWG and monitor PD.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this embodiment, the dummy port <b>906</b> of the VOA <b>902</b> is terminated with the termination structure <b>908</b><i>a </i>by the groove and light blocking material. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> a detailed description of the optical switch, AWG and monitor PD is omitted. However, the optical switch and AWG are both composed of the same optical waveguides as the VOA, and the monitor PD is connected to the end surface of the substrate. The optical switch has the function of the 2&#xd7;1 switch <b>1408</b>-<b>1</b> to N in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, and selects either the wavelength demultiplexed (DEMUX) optical signal path (main path) or the optical path (Add path) inserted (added) from a lower layer network. The optical level of the selected optical signal is adjusted by the VOA <b>902</b>, then the optical signal is coupled to the AWG for wavelength multiplexing (MUX) via the WINC <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In this embodiment, epoxy resin and carbon black were used as the light blocking material of the termination structure <b>908</b><i>a </i>which terminates the dummy port <b>906</b> of the VOA. The crosstalk in both the AWG and monitor PD connected to the subsequent stage of the WINC <b>904</b> was measured, and was both &#x2212;60 dB or less. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the angle of the incident plane of the optical waveguide with respect to the termination structure <b>908</b><i>a </i>is 0 degrees. However, in that case the measured return loss on the input side of the optical switch was 45 dB or greater. For comparison, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, when the angle of the incident plane with respect to the termination structure <b>908</b><i>b </i>was set to 8 degrees, the return loss became 50 dB or greater. In the case where the refractive index of the light blocking material (a mixed material) in embodiment 1 or this embodiment is close to that of silica glass, taking into consideration the size of the grooves in the horizontal plane of the substrate, a sufficient return loss characteristic is obtained even when the angle of the incident plane is 0 degrees. However, in the case where higher specifications are required, it may be necessary to adopt a configuration in which the reflected light is not coupled to the terminated optical waveguide, and a Brewster's angle or the like is most appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In either cases illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, when the shape of the grooves in the horizontal plane of the substrate is formed as a closed curve composed of curved and straight lines which are smoothly connected without any apex points, no exfoliation of the light blocking material from the wall surfaces of the grooves occurred, and long-term reliability was confirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the optical switch and VOA <b>902</b> are depicted as separate circuits, however, the function of the optical switch and VOA may be achieved simultaneously by using the same MZI, and the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is not intended to limit a configuration of the present invention. As an example of the configuration of an optical switch and VOA for ROADM, Patent Literature 1 and Non Patent Literature 1 can be referenced. According to Non Patent Literature 1, an optical switch on the through path side and an optical switch on the add path side each comprises MZIs directly connected in 2 stages. In this case, when one of the paths is selected, the optical level can also be adjusted at the same time by driving the 2-stage MZIs with continuous applied electric power. In that case, the dummy port led from each MZI can be terminated separately or collectively by the termination structures of the present invention comprising grooves and light blocking material, and thus prevent the excess optical power from affecting other circuits.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a diagram illustrating configuration of a waveguide device according to an embodiment 9 of the invention. Similar to embodiment 8, this device constitutes a major function of a ROADM system such that waveguide device substrate <b>1120</b> integrating a waveguide optical switch, a VOA <b>1102</b> and a WIUNC <b>1104</b> is directly connected with a waveguide device substrate <b>1130</b> integrating an AWG and monitor PD.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In this embodiment, the dummy port <b>1106</b> of the VOA <b>1102</b> is terminated with the termination structure <b>1108</b> by the groove and light blocking material, and the dummy port <b>1110</b> on the input side of the WINC <b>1104</b> is also terminated with the termination structure <b>1112</b> by the groove and light blocking material. In this embodiment, the light blocking material used was a silicone resin as base material mixed with metal particulate powder. In addition, the incident angle with respect to groove was (&#x3b8;=) 22.5 degrees in either cases. With this embodiment, not only crosstalk into other circuits by the excess optical power guided to the dummy port of the VOA by the attenuation operation can be suppressed, but also the influence on the coupling rate of a coupler can be suppressed when the crosstalk component caused by the connection loss occurred when another waveguide device or optical fiber is connected to the input section of the waveguide device substrate <b>1120</b>, and the crosstalk component caused by the excess loss occurred in the optical waveguide of the optical switch and VOA <b>1102</b> are coupled with the dummy port <b>1110</b> on the input side of the WINC. In conventional configuration in which no termination structure <b>1112</b> is present in the dummy port <b>1110</b> on the input side of the WINC, a several % of coupling ratio error may occur with respect to the set coupling ratio of the WINC due to the effect of crosstalk occurred in an optical fiber connection or in the optical switch and VOA <b>1102</b>, and thus a problem arises in feedback control by the monitor PD.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">With such background, when error in the set coupling ratio for the WINC under the configuration of the present invention was measured, the error in the coupling ratio was within &#xb1;0.5%, and it was confirmed that by the effect of this invention, the influence of crosstalk on the WINC was sufficiently suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Moreover, the effect of suppressing the crosstalk by the termination structure <b>1108</b> of the dummy port <b>1106</b> of the VOA <b>1102</b> was also confirmed, and in all locations the crosstalk was &#x2212;60 dB or less. Furthermore, the return loss on the input side of the optical switch was similarly 50 dB or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The termination of the dummy port on the input side in this embodiment is not limited to a WINC, and for any optical circuit with configuration of having a dummy port on the input side such as an optical switch, VOA, of which basic element is a MZI, similar effect can be achieved, as suppressing the influence of crosstalk by terminating the dummy port on the input side.</p>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Embodiment 10</heading>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In this embodiment, not in an optical switch and VOA described above, but in other waveguide devices, application of termination structure of an optical waveguide at any point on a substrate will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an example of an optical splitter. For example, as a means to achieve a 1&#xd7;6 splitter, configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is illustrated. In this case, based on a 1&#xd7;8 splitter <b>1200</b> as a basic configuration, by applying the termination structure <b>1204</b> of the present invention to two optical waveguides <b>1202</b> which are not used as output ports, crosstalk in the other output ports can be suppressed. In this embodiment, a 1&#xd7;6 splitter based on the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> was manufactured using optical waveguides fabricated using silica glass on a silicon substrate. For each output port (<b>1</b> to <b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) the optical spectrum was measured in the wavelength range 1300 nm to 1650 nm and the deviation of output power over the entire wavelength range between ports was a good characteristic of about 0.5 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> is an example of an AWG. For example, in an AWG <b>1302</b> having 1 input and N (N is a natural number) outputs, by terminating the optical waveguides on the output side per each certain interval of output ports using the termination structure <b>1304</b> of this invention, signal processing is possible in which optical signals for each of wavelength groups are separated, and wavelength group pairs are separated by one of ITU grid G<b>1</b> to G<b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>). In this example, an AWG substrate based on the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> was manufactured using polymer waveguides fabricated on a silicon substrate. The AWG <b>1302</b> of this embodiment is configured to separate wavelength groups, where each group has the eight wavelengths, into five wavelength groups, for one input waveguide, 44 optical waveguides are arranged on the output side, in which one optical waveguides is terminated to separate wavelength groups by every eight optical waveguides. Wavelengths sandwiched between two wavelength groups (wavelengths to be terminated) are four in total, and in each case, the crosstalk in all of the ports except the terminated ports was &#x2212;40 dB or less.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In embodiments 1 to 10 of the present invention, waveguide devices comprising silica glass and polymer material on a silicon substrate were described. However, the present invention is applicable to all waveguide type thermo optical circuits using other materials constituting the waveguide device, such as an ion diffusion type lithium niobate waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Moreover, for the grooves terminating the optical waveguides, the depth of the grooves was not particularly described. However, in a waveguide device using silica glass fabricated on a silicon substrate, for example, preferably the depth will reach the silicon substrate. However, the effect of the invention is obvious even when the depth is set arbitrarily as long as the manufacturing conditions, influence on other circuits and the like are taken into consideration; the depth is naturally required as a minimum to expose the core on the surface of the groove wall in the termination section of the optical waveguide, and other than this, in the configuration of the present invention, it is not limited to any specific depth.</p>
