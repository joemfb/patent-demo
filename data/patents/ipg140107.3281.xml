<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an epoxy resin composition for an optical semiconductor device which is used as a material for forming a reflector (reflection part) that reflects light emitted from, for example, an optical semiconductor element. The invention further relates to a lead frame for an optical semiconductor device and a substrate for an optical semiconductor device, obtained using the epoxy resin composition and relates to an optical semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional optical semiconductor devices including an optical semiconductor element mounted therein have a configuration including a metallic lead frame <b>1</b>, an optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> mounted thereon, and a reflector <b>3</b> for light reflection formed of a resin material so as to surround the periphery of the optical semiconductor element <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Then, a space including the optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> surrounded by the reflector <b>3</b> is encapsulated with a transparent resin such as a silicone resin. An electrode circuit (not shown) formed in the metallic lead frame <b>1</b> and the optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> are electrically connected with each other by a bonding wire <b>4</b> to be provided according to the need.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Now, an epoxy resin composition is used for encapsulating an optical semiconductor element such as a light emitting diode (LED). In particular, for epoxy resin compositions which are developed with a mind to the use in the surroundings of LED, a material including an aliphatic (alicyclic) hydrocarbon as a main structure is used as an epoxy resin capable of making the absorption in a visible light short wavelength region low (see Patent Document 1).

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0005">In the optical semiconductor devices as described above, it is known to add a filler as a method for decreasing a linear expansion coefficient. However, there is involved such a problem that if the content of the filler is increased, though the strength increases, the optical semiconductor device becomes brittle. In particular, since the epoxy resin including an aliphatic (alicyclic) hydrocarbon as a main structure, which is used in the above-referenced Patent Document 1, is relatively poor in toughness, if a large amount of the filler is added to the material of the above-referenced Patent Document 1, there is involved such a problem that the optical semiconductor device becomes remarkably brittle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0006">Under these circumstances, the invention has been made. An object of the invention is to provide an epoxy resin composition for an optical semiconductor device, which is able to satisfy both low linear expansion coefficient and strength; a lead frame for an optical semiconductor device and a substrate for an optical semiconductor device, obtained using the same; and an optical semiconductor device.</p>

In addition, not only the total content of the ingredient (C) and the ingredient (D) is regulated to from 69 to 94% by weight of the epoxy resin composition, but the content of the ingredient (E) is regulated to a value satisfying the surface coverage (from 1 to 190%) expressed by the foregoing numerical formula (1). Therefore, the surfaces of the white pigment [ingredient (C)] and the inorganic filler [ingredient (D)] are modified with the silane coupling agent [ingredient (E)], and an optical semiconductor device using this epoxy resin composition does not become brittle and is able to contrive to satisfy both low linear expansion coefficient and strength.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">Then, the epoxy resin composition of the invention becomes a material for forming a reflector that reflects light emitted from an optical semiconductor element. Therefore, in an optical semiconductor device having a reflector formed therein by using the foregoing epoxy resin composition, when the foregoing reflector is used, breakage or crack of the reflector to be caused during the fabrication of an LED package can be reduced or prevented from occurring, and hence, the optical semiconductor device can be mass-produced more inexpensively.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">The epoxy resin composition of the invention is obtained using an epoxy resin (ingredient (A)), a curing agent (ingredient (B)), a white pigment (ingredient (C)), an inorganic filler (ingredient (D)) and a silane coupling agent (ingredient (E)), and is usually used for an encapsulating material in a liquid or powdered form or in a tablet form obtained by tableting the powder. The epoxy resin composition of the invention is preferably used as a material for forming a reflector <b>3</b> of the optical semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">Most important characteristic features of the invention is that a total content of the white pigment (ingredient (C)) and the inorganic filler (ingredient (D)) is from 69 to 94% by weight of the whole of the epoxy resin composition; and that the silane coupling agent (ingredient (E)) is contained in an amount satisfying the foregoing numerical formula (1).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">First of all, each of the ingredients of the epoxy resin composition of the invention is described.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">Examples of the epoxy resin (ingredient (A)) which is used for the epoxy resin composition of the invention include bisphenol A type epoxy resins, bisphenol F type epoxy resins, novolac type epoxy resins such as phenol novolac type epoxy resins and cresol novolac type epoxy resins, alicyclic epoxy resins, nitrogen-containing ring epoxy resins such as triglycidyl isocyanurate resins and hydantoin type epoxy resins, hydrogenated bisphenol A type epoxy resins, aliphatic epoxy resins, glycidyl ether type epoxy resins, bisphenol S type epoxy resins, biphenyl type epoxy resins which are mainly used as the type giving cured resins with a low water absorption, dicyclic epoxy resins, and naphthalene type epoxy resins. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof. Of these, epoxy resins having an isocyanurate ring structure, such as triglycidyl isocyanurate resins, are preferable from the viewpoints of heat resistance and light resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">The epoxy resin (ingredient (A)) may be a solid or a liquid at ordinary temperature. However, in general, the epoxy resin to be used is preferably one having an average epoxy equivalent of from 90 to 1,000. In addition, in the case of a solid epoxy resin, an epoxy resin having a softening point of 160&#xb0; C. or less is preferable. When the epoxy equivalent is too low, there is a tendency that an epoxy resin composition cured material becomes brittle; whereas when the epoxy equivalent is too high, there is a tendency that a glass transition temperature (Tg) of an epoxy resin composition cured material becomes low.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">Examples of the curing agent (ingredient (B)) include acid anhydride curing agents, isocyanuric acid derivative curing agents, phenolic curing agents, amine curing agents, curing agents obtained by partially esterifying the foregoing acid anhydride curing agents with an alcohol, and carboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, and methylhexahydrophthalic acid. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof. Of these, acid anhydride curing agents are preferable from the viewpoints of heat resistance and light resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">Examples of the acid anhydride curing agent include phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, pyromellitic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, methylnadic anhydride, nadic anhydride, glutaric anhydride, methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride, and methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride. Of these, it is preferable to use phthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, or methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride. Furthermore, the acid anhydride curing agent is preferably an acid anhydride curing agent having a molecular weight of from about 140 to 200, and a colorless or pale yellow acid anhydride curing agent is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">In addition, examples of the isocyanuric acid derivative curing agent include 1,3,5-tris(1-carboxymethyl)isocyanurate, 1,3,5-tris(2-carboxyethyl)isocyanurate, 1,3,5-tris(3-carboxypropyl)isocyanurate, and 1,3-bis(2-carboxyethyl)isocyanurate.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">Here, a blending proportion of the epoxy resin (ingredient (A)) and the curing agent (ingredient (B)) is set such that an amount of an active group (an acid anhydride group or a carboxyl group) in the curing agent (ingredient (B)), which is capable of reacting with an epoxy group, is preferably from 0.5 to 1.5 equivalents, and especially preferably from 0.7 to 1.2 equivalents to one equivalent of epoxy group in the epoxy resin (ingredient (A)). When the amount of the active group is too low, there is a tendency that not only a curing rate of the epoxy resin composition becomes slow, but a glass transition temperature (Tg) of a cured material thereof becomes low; whereas when the amount of the active group is too high, there is a tendency that the moisture resistance is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">Next, examples of the white pigment (ingredient (C)) which is used in combination with the foregoing ingredient (A) and ingredient (B) include inorganic white pigments such as magnesium oxide, antimony oxide, titanium dioxide, zirconium oxide, zinc oxide, white lead, kaolin, alumina, calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, barium sulfate, zinc sulfate, and zinc sulfide. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof. Of these, it is preferable to use titanium dioxide from the viewpoint that an excellent light reflectivity is obtainable. It is especially preferable to use titanium dioxide having a rutile type crystal structure. Furthermore, from the viewpoints of flowability and light shielding properties, it is preferable to use titanium dioxide of a rutile type having an average particle diameter of from 0.05 to 2.0 &#x3bc;m. From the viewpoint of light reflecting properties, the average particle diameter thereof is especially preferably from 0.08 to 0.5 &#x3bc;m. Incidentally, the average particle diameter can be measured with, for example, a laser diffraction/scattering particle size distribution analyzer.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">Incidentally, a content of the white pigment (ingredient (C)) in the invention is set within a range as described later.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">Examples of the inorganic filler (ingredient (D)) which is used in combination with the foregoing ingredients (A) to (C) include a quartz glass powder, talc, silica powders such as a fused silica powder and a crystalline silica powder, an aluminum nitride powder, and a silicon nitride powder. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof. Of these, it is preferable to use a silica powder from the viewpoint of reducing the linear expansion coefficient, or the like. It is especially preferable to use a spherical fused silica powder from the viewpoints of high filling properties and high flowability. With respect to the particle diameter and particle diameter distribution of the inorganic filler (ingredient (D)), it is preferable to set the particle diameter and distribution thereof while taking into consideration a combination thereof with the particle diameter and particle diameter distribution of the white pigment (ingredient (C)) so as to minimize the occurrence of burrs and the like when the epoxy resin composition is molded by transfer molding or the like. Specifically, it is preferable to allow an average particle diameter of the inorganic filler (ingredient (D)) to fall within the range of from 5 to 60 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">In the invention, it is necessary that a total content of the foregoing white pigment (ingredient (C)) and inorganic filler (ingredient (D)) is from 69 to 94% by weight of the whole of the epoxy resin composition. The total content is preferably from 75 to 94% by weight, and especially preferably from 80 to 94% by weight. When the total content is too low, a flexural elastic modulus and a light reflectivity are inferior, and a reduction of the linear expansion coefficient is hardly achieved; whereas when the total content is too high, an epoxy resin composition is hardly fabricated by means of kneading or the like because of remarkable thickening.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">Here, a content of the white pigment (ingredient (C)) is preferably from 2 to 40% by weight, more preferably from 5 to 30% by weight, and especially preferably from 15 to 30% by weight of the whole of the epoxy resin composition. In addition, a content of the inorganic filler (ingredient (D)) is preferably a value obtained by subtracting the content of the white pigment (ingredient (C)) from the total content of the white pigment (ingredient (C)) and the inorganic filler (ingredient (D)).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">In the epoxy resin composition of the invention, a characteristic feature is that the silane coupling agent (ingredient (E)) is used in a specified proportion in combination with the foregoing ingredients (A) to (D). The silane coupling agent (ingredient (E)) is preferably a silane coupling agent represented by the following general formula (1) from the viewpoint that it is able to chemically react with the epoxy resin (ingredient (A)) without a particular inhibition reaction.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0064">A content of the silane coupling agent (ingredient (E)) is preferably from 0.01 to 2.4% by weight, and more preferably from 0.1 to 2.0% by weight of the whole of the epoxy resin composition.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">In the invention, the content (Z<sub>2</sub>) of the silane coupling agent (ingredient (E)) is regulated such that a surface coverage expressed by the following numerical formula (1) is from 1 to 190%, preferably from 5 to 170%, and more preferably from 10 to 150%. In the content in which the surface coverage is less than the lower limit, sufficient strength is not obtained; whereas in the content in which the surface coverage exceeds the upper limit, Tg of the epoxy resin composition is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">Incidentally, the surface coverage as referred to in the invention means a value expressed by the following numerical formula (1). In more detail, the surface coverage expresses a ratio of a specific surface area of the silane coupling agent (ingredient (E)) to a total of specific surface areas of the white pigment (ingredient (C)) and the inorganic filler (ingredient (D)).</p>

When the content of the curing accelerator (ingredient (F)) is too low, there is a concern that a sufficient curing acceleration effect is not obtained; whereas when the content of the curing accelerator (ingredient (F) is too high, there is a tendency that the obtained cured material causes discoloration.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">Examples of the flame retardant include metal hydroxide compounds such as magnesium hydroxide, bromine based flame retardants, nitrogen based flame retardants and phosphorus based flame retardants. Furthermore, a flame retardant aid such as antimony trioxide can be used, too.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">Examples of the modifier include glycols, silicones and alcohols.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">Examples of the antioxidant include hindered phenol based antioxidants, phosphorus based antioxidants, and sulfide based antioxidants. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof. Of these, it is preferable to use a hindered phenol based antioxidant from the standpoint of thermal discoloration resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">Examples of the defoaming agent include silicone based defoaming agents.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0082">The epoxy resin composition of the invention can be, for example, manufactured in the following manner. That is, the foregoing ingredients (A) to (E) and optionally, the curing accelerator (ingredient (F)) and furthermore, the foregoing various additives to be blended according to the need are properly blended. Thereafter, these ingredients are kneaded and melt mixed using a kneader, followed by pulverization. There can be thus manufactured an epoxy resin composition in a powdered form.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">In the epoxy resin composition of the invention, it is preferable that a cured material thereof has the following flexural characteristics. That is, a flexural strength thereof is preferably 60 MPa or more, especially preferably 80 MPa or more, and most preferably 100 MPa or more; and a flexural elastic modulus thereof is preferably 10 GPa or more, especially preferably 15 GPa or more, and most preferably 20 GPa or more.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">The foregoing flexural strength and flexural elastic modulus are, for example, measured in the following manner. That is, a cured material of an epoxy resin composition having a thickness of 4 mm is manufactured under prescribed curing conditions, for example, molding at 175&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes and subsequent curing at 175&#xb0; C. for 2 hours to fabricate a test piece (cured material). The flexural strength and the flexural elastic modulus of this cured material can be measured with an analyzer (for example, AG-500, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation) at ordinary temperature (20&#xb0; C.&#xb1;15&#xb0; C.) according to JIS-K7171.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085">In addition, in the cure material of the epoxy resin composition of the invention, a linear expansion coefficient in a temperature region of the glass transition temperature (Tg) or less is preferably 28 ppm/K or less, especially preferably 25 ppm/K or less, and most preferably 20 ppm/K or less.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0086">The foregoing linear expansion coefficient is, for example, measured in the following manner. That is, a cured material of an epoxy resin composition having a thickness of 5 mm is manufactured under prescribed curing conditions, for example, molding at 175&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes and subsequent curing at 175&#xb0; C. for 3 hours to fabricate a test piece (cured material). The linear expansion coefficient of this cured material can be measured with an analyzer (for example, TMA-50, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation) at a temperature elevation rate of 2&#xb0; C./min.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">In addition, in the cure material of the epoxy resin composition of the invention, a light reflectivity is preferably 80% or more, and especially preferably 85% or more in a wavelength range of from 430 to 800 nm. Incidentally, an upper limit thereof is usually 100%.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">The foregoing light reflectivity is, for example, measured in the following manner. That is, a cured material of an epoxy resin composition having a thickness of 1 mm is fabricated under prescribed curing conditions, for example, molding at 150&#xb0; C. for 4 minutes and subsequent curing at 150&#xb0; C. for 5 hours. The light reflectivity of this cured material at a wavelength within the foregoing range can be measured with a spectrophotometer (for example, a spectrophotometer V-670, manufactured by JASCO Corporation) at room temperature (20&#xb0; C.&#xb1;15&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089">The optical semiconductor device using the epoxy resin composition of the invention is, for example, manufactured in the following manner. That is, a metallic lead frame is disposed within a die of a transfer molding machine, and a reflector is formed using the epoxy resin composition by transfer molding. In this way, a metallic lead frame for an optical semiconductor device in which the reflector is formed in a state of surrounding the periphery of an optical semiconductor element mounting region is formed. Subsequently, an optical semiconductor element is mounted in the optical semiconductor element mounting region on the metallic lead frame, which is located in the inside of the reflector, and wire bonding is performed according to the need. There is thus fabricated an optical semiconductor device as a unit equipped with a metallic lead frame <b>1</b> in which a reflector <b>3</b> is formed in a state of surrounding the periphery of an optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> to be mounted; and the optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> mounted on the metallic lead frame <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. An electrode circuit (not shown) formed on the metallic lead frame <b>1</b> and the optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> are electrically connected with each other by a bonding wire <b>4</b>. In the foregoing optical semiconductor device, a region which is located in the inside of the reflector <b>3</b> including the optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> is encapsulated with a silicone resin or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">Furthermore, other configurations of the optical semiconductor device are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In an optical semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a reflector <b>3</b><i>a </i>is formed on only one surface of a metallic lead frame <b>1</b><i>a </i>(or a substrate) on which an optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> is mounted, and the metallic lead frame <b>1</b><i>a </i>(or the substrate) is exposed on the rear surface side. In addition, an optical semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has substantially the same configuration as that of the optical semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; however, a reflector <b>3</b> is also formed on a metallic lead frame <b>1</b> at the periphery of an optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> in the inner region of the reflector <b>3</b>. Then, an optical semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has substantially the same configuration as that of the optical semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>; however, a reflector <b>3</b><i>a </i>is also formed on a metallic lead frame <b>1</b><i>a </i>(or a substrate) at the periphery of an optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> in the inner region of the reflector <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Incidentally, in the configurations of the optical semiconductor devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the same parts as those in the optical semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are designated by the same numerals and signs.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">Incidentally, in the invention, in the optical semiconductor devices shown in the foregoing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, various substrates may be used in place of the metallic lead frame <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Examples of the various substrates include organic substrates, inorganic substrates and flexible printed substrates. Then, in the metallic lead frames <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the optical semiconductor devices shown in the foregoing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the various substrates, an electrode circuit (not shown) is formed on the surface thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0104">Each of the foregoing epoxy resin compositions was cured under prescribed curding conditions (conditions: molding at 175&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes and subsequent curing at 175&#xb0; C. for 3 hours) to fabricate a test piece having a thickness of 4 mm, a width of 10 mm, and a length of 80 mm. This test piece (cured material) was subjected to a flexural test (for flexural strength and flexural elastic modulus) according to JIS-K7171:2008. Incidentally, AG-500, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation was used as an analyzer, and the measurement was performed at ordinary temperature (20&#xb0; C.).

Incidentally, a spectrophotometer V-670, manufactured by JASCO Corporation was used as an analyzer, and the light reflectivity at a wavelength of 450 nm was measured at room temperature (25&#xb0; C.). Incidentally, it is preferable that the light reflectivity is 80% or more.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107">It was confirmed from the results of the foregoing tables that in all of the test pieces of the Examples, not only the total content of the ingredient (C) and the ingredient (D) is regulated to the prescribed range, but the content of the silane coupling agent is regulated such that the surface coverage falls within the prescribed range, and therefore, not only a favorable light reflectivity is revealed, but both low linear expansion coefficient and strength can be contrived to be satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">On the other hand, in the test piece of Comparative Example 1, the flexural strength was inferior because the silane coupling agent was not blended.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">In the test piece of Comparative Example 2, the epoxy resin composition was not cured because the content of the silane coupling agent was so high that the surface coverage was too high.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0110">In the test piece of Comparative Example 3, since the total content of the ingredient (C) and the ingredient (D) was too high, kneading became difficult due to remarkable thickening, and the epoxy resin composition could not be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0111">In the test piece of Comparative Example 4, since the total content of the ingredient (C) and the ingredient (D) was too low, the flexural elastic modulus was low, and the linear expansion coefficient was also high.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0112">Next, the epoxy resin composition in a finely powdered form as the test piece of each of the foregoing Examples was used to manufacture an optical semiconductor light emitting device having the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. That is, a lead frame <b>1</b> made 20 of Alloy 42 (plated with Ag) was charged in a transfer molding machine, and transfer molding (molding conditions: molding at 175&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes and subsequent curing at 175&#xb0; C. for 2 hours) was performed. There was thus prepared the optical semiconductor light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in which a reflector <b>3</b>, a concave formed in the reflector <b>3</b>, and a metallic lead frame <b>1</b> provided within the concave were manufactured, 25 an optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> (size: 0.3 mm&#xd7;0.3 mm) was mounted within the concave, and an electrode circuit formed on the metallic lead frame <b>1</b> and the optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> were electrically connected with each other by a bonding wire <b>4</b>. Finally, a liquid silicone encapsulating agent was poured and cured to manufacture an optical semiconductor light emitting device as a unit equipped with the reflector <b>3</b>, the concave formed in the reflector <b>3</b>, the metallic lead frame <b>1</b> provided within the concave, and the optical semiconductor element <b>2</b> mounted on the metallic lead frame <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. There was thus obtained an optical semiconductor light emitting device having no problem.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0114">Incidentally, the present application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-169178 filed on Aug. 2, 2011, and the contents are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
