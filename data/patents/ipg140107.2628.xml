<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A processor die often requires capacitative power sources to respond to transient loads generated during operation. Capacitors are provided to answer the transient load requirements of the die. A thin-film capacitor (TFC) is typically a dielectric disposed between two electrodes, and which was manufactured by laser drilling. Laser drilling is costly, time consuming, and subjects the structures of the TFC to significant uneven heat transients. High dielectric-constant (high-k) thin-film capacitors (TFCs) must be laser drilled or chemically etched after sintering to provide electrical contacts. These processes can affect the chemistry of the sintered high-k dielectrics. The laser drilling can create a non-uniform laser heat zone, or the etching chemistry can alter the high-k dielectric at and near the etch edge.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During conventional laser-drill processing through a sintered thin-film capacitor (TFC) dielectric layer to form a contact corridor, the extreme heat transient of the laser beam causes a heat-altered region at the cutting edge of the laser drill. The laser-drilled edge is subjected to an extreme heat transient because of the laser-drilling process, but opposite from the cut edge, the sintered TFC dielectric can remain unchanged from the sintering process. The conventional laser-drill process can cause the laser-drilled edge to change physically or chemically compared to the region that is distant from the laser-drilled edge. For example the laser-drilled edge can embrittle in comparison to the region that is distant from the laser-drilled edge. Thus, the heat-altered morphology of the laser-drilled edge can exhibit embrittlement signs caused in a sintered dielectric. The embrittlement can be determined by physical probing among other techniques. The laser-drilled edge can also have changed chemical qualities due to lost or altered materials caused by the extreme heat transient. Thus, the heat-altered morphology of the laser-drilled edge can exhibit chemical depletion signs in a sintered dielectric. The changed chemical qualities can be determined by microscopic techniques such as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or ionic-coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. And due to the extreme heat transient of the laser-drilling process, the laser-drilled edge can even have incorporated volatilized stray materials into the matrix of the TFC dielectric in comparison to the distant region. Thus, the heat-altered morphology of the laser-drilled edge can exhibit chemical addition signs in a sintered dielectric. The changed chemical qualities can be determined by microscopic techniques such as by SEM or ICP analysis.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following description includes terms, such as upper, lower, first, second, etc., that are used for descriptive purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting. The embodiments of a device or article described herein can be manufactured, used, or shipped in a number of positions and orientations. The terms &#x201c;die&#x201d; and &#x201c;chip&#x201d; generally refer to the physical object that is the basic workpiece that is transformed by various process operations into the desired integrated circuit device. A die is usually singulated from a wafer, and wafers may be made of semiconducting, non-semiconducting, or combinations of semiconducting and non-semiconducting materials. A board is typically a resin-impregnated fiberglass structure that acts as a mounting substrate for the die.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reference will now be made to the drawings wherein like structures will be provided with like reference designations. In order to show the structure and process embodiments most clearly, the drawings included herein are diagrammatic representations of embodiments. Thus, the actual appearance of the fabricated structures, for example in a photomicrograph, may appear different while still incorporating the essential structures of embodiments. Moreover, the drawings show only the structures necessary to understand the embodiments. Additional structures known in the art have not been included to maintain the clarity of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a cross-section elevation of a thin-film capacitor (TFC) assembly <b>100</b> during processing according to an embodiment. The TFC assembly <b>100</b> at this processing instant includes a first electrode <b>110</b> with an upper surface <b>112</b> and a lower surface <b>114</b>. A mask <b>116</b> is patterned above the first electrode <b>110</b> upon the upper surface <b>112</b>. In an embodiment, the mask <b>116</b> is susceptible to swelling and peeling during processing. In an embodiment, the mask <b>116</b> is liquid soluble such that a lift-off process is useful to remove it. In an embodiment, the mask <b>116</b> is vapor swellable such that a lift-off process is useful to remove it.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-section elevation of the thin-film capacitor assembly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> after further processing according to an embodiment. The TFC assembly <b>101</b> exhibits a green dielectric film <b>118</b> that is disposed upon the upper surface <b>112</b> of the first electrode <b>110</b> as well as upon the mask <b>116</b>. In an embodiment, the green dielectric film <b>118</b> is a ceramic powder suspension film <b>118</b> that is resting upon the upper surface <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, the mask <b>116</b> includes a first thickness <b>120</b> and the green dielectric film <b>118</b> includes a second thickness <b>122</b>. In an embodiment, the first thickness <b>120</b> is greater than the second thickness <b>122</b>. In this embodiment because the mask first thickness <b>120</b> is greater than the green dielectric film second thickness <b>122</b>, the mask <b>116</b> shows an exposed flank <b>124</b> that is susceptible to liquid or vapor insurgency for lift-off processing. In an embodiment, the first thickness <b>120</b> is about the same as the second thickness <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment, the green dielectric film <b>118</b> includes a sol-gel solution of a titanate compound. In an embodiment, the green dielectric film <b>118</b> includes a sol-gel solution of a barium titanate compound. In an embodiment, the green dielectric film <b>118</b> includes a sol-gel solution of a strontium titanate compound. In an embodiment, the green dielectric film <b>118</b> includes a sol-gel solution of a barium-strontium titanate (BST) compound as a principal presence. &#x201c;Principal presence&#x201d; may mean the green dielectric film <b>118</b> will include about 100% of the titanate ceramic after sintering. It may also mean the green dielectric film <b>118</b> in a majority of BST. It may also mean the green dielectric film <b>118</b> is the dielectric material is less than 50%, but is the most prevalent dielectric material, from about 34% BST to about 49% BST if at least two other dielectrics are present for example. In an embodiment, any other ceramic dielectric is used as the green dielectric film <b>118</b>, which is suitable for use as a TFC dielectric. In an embodiment, the second heating process is properly called annealing instead of sintering. In this embodiment, the first-cured dielectric film <b>118</b> is heated such that only fluid loss occurs, and the chemical nature thereof is not materially changed. Because specific applications may use sintering as defined or annealing as defined, for the purposes of disclosed and claimed embodiments, the terms sintering and annealing will be used synonymously.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preparation of a sol-gel film <b>118</b> according to an embodiment includes blending titanium alkoxide and a strontium inorganic salt with methoxyelthanol and ethylene glycol. In an embodiment, preparation of a sol-gel film <b>118</b> according to an embodiment includes blending titanium alkoxide and a barium inorganic salt with methoxyelthanol and ethylene glycol. In an embodiment, preparation of a sol-gel film <b>118</b> according to an embodiment includes blending titanium alkoxide with a barium inorganic salt and a strontium inorganic salt, and with methoxyelthanol and ethylene glycol.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, application of the green dielectric film <b>118</b> to the first electrode <b>110</b> and the mask <b>116</b> is carried out by orthogonally spraying onto the exposed surfaces. In an embodiment, application thereof is carried out by spinning on a sol-gel liquid. In an embodiment, application thereof is carried out by dipping the first electrode <b>110</b> into a solution of a dielectric precursor liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, a two-heating process is carried out. It is referred to as first curing, followed by second sintering. More generally, the process embodiment is referred to as first heating, followed by second heating. After application of the green dielectric film <b>118</b> to the first electrode <b>110</b> and the mask <b>116</b>, a first curing process is carried out to partially stabilize the green dielectric film <b>118</b>. In an embodiment, curing is carried out by heating the green dielectric film <b>118</b> sufficient to cause it to become non-flowable at room temperature. In an embodiment, the green dielectric film <b>118</b> has a thickness in a range from about 0.5 micrometer (&#x3bc;m) to about 30 &#x3bc;m. Thus, the non-flowable characteristic of the green dielectric film <b>118</b> is related to the thickness thereof and the resultant viscosity thereof after the first curing process.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment, the first curing is carried out in a temperature range from abut 50&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C. and for sufficient time to cause the green dielectric film <b>118</b> to become non-flowable at room temperature. First curing also allows the green dielectric film <b>118</b> to become non-flowable at room temperature, but it also retains significant porosity in the first cured stage to allow for easier removal from selected areas.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a cross-section elevation of the thin-film capacitor assembly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> after further processing according to an embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the TFC assembly <b>102</b> is illustrated during a lift-off process that is under way. The lift-off process causes the mask <b>117</b> (<b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) to swell and/or lift. The green dielectric film <b>118</b>, where it was patterned upon the first electrode <b>110</b> and not upon the mask <b>117</b>, remains adherent to the first electrode <b>110</b>. The green dielectric film <b>119</b> that was patterned upon the mask <b>117</b> also is in the process of being lifted off by virtue of the peeling and/or swelling mask <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">After removal of the green dielectric film <b>119</b> that was in contact with the mask <b>117</b>, the TFC assembly <b>102</b> is further processed by heating the green dielectric film <b>118</b> that remains to achieve a sintering thereof. In an embodiment, curing of the green dielectric film <b>118</b> includes at least some oxidation such that it is referred to as a calcining process. In an embodiment, sintering is carried out in a temperature range from about 700&#xb0; C. to about 900&#xb0; C. In order to protect the first electrode <b>110</b> from oxidation, a non-reactive atmosphere is provided during sintering. In an embodiment, a non-reactive atmosphere includes a non-reactive gas such as argon. In an embodiment, a non-reactive atmosphere includes a non-oxidizing gas such as nitrogen. In an embodiment, a non-reactive atmosphere includes a vacuum. In an embodiment, a non-reactive atmosphere includes a reduced atmospheric pressure such as in the 0.1 atmospheres (atm) range and lower, and a non-reactive gas such as argon. In an embodiment, a non-reactive atmosphere includes a reduced atmospheric pressure such as in the 0.01 atm range and lower, and a non-reactive gas such as argon.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, because of the dimensions of the structures in the TFC assemblies of this disclosure, sintering of the green dielectric film <b>118</b> achieves a substantially uniform heat-altered morphology of what has become a TFC dielectric layer <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One parameter to monitor during sintering is the ratio of internal resistance to heat transfer of the green dielectric film <b>118</b>, to the external resistance to heat transfer. The Biot modulus, known in heat-transfer technology, is a measure of the ratio of the internal resistance to the external resistance. In an embodiment, the internal resistance to heat transfer is minimized by evaluation of the Biot modulus in the Z-direction. Heat curing such as sintering therefore imposes a substantially uniform heat load upon the green dielectric film <b>118</b>, such that as the first-cured dielectric film <b>118</b> is fully sintered, there exists a substantially uniform heat-altered morphology along any characteristic dimension in any direction, particularly in the X- and Y-directions. The Y-direction is into and out of the plane of the FIG.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> is a cross-section elevation of the thin-film capacitor assembly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> after further processing according to an embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the TFC assembly <b>103</b> is depicted schematically. A second electrode <b>126</b> has been assembled to the TFC dielectric film <b>118</b> and to the first electrode <b>110</b>. The TFC assembly <b>103</b> also includes a lower dielectric layer <b>128</b> and an upper dielectric layer <b>130</b>, which protect the first electrode <b>110</b> and the second electrode <b>126</b>, respectively. Further to the structure of the TFC assembly <b>103</b> are a first electrode contact <b>132</b> that contacts the first electrode <b>110</b>, and a second electrode contact <b>134</b> that contacts the second electrode <b>126</b>. The first electrode contact <b>132</b> and the second electrode contact <b>134</b> are formed in respective contact corridors that can be formed without extreme heat transients, such as laser drilling because of the process embodiments. The operative capacitor subsection of the TFC assembly <b>103</b> can also be referred to as a TFC assembly <b>136</b>, which includes at least the first electrode <b>110</b>, the TFC dielectric film <b>118</b>, and the second electrode <b>126</b>. The TFC assembly <b>136</b> is disposed upon a substrate <b>138</b>.

The TFC assembly <b>200</b> is depicted as being &#x201c;peeled&#x201d; to lay open a plan view, and &#x201c;cut&#x201d; to expose part of a TFC dielectric layer. The TFC assembly <b>200</b> includes a first electrode <b>210</b> and two occurrences of a TFC dielectric film <b>222</b>. The first electrode <b>210</b> also shows a contact-corridor footprint <b>242</b> that amounts to a spacing dimension <b>244</b> that is depicted between the two occurrences of the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A characteristic dimension <b>246</b> of the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b> is depicted. The characteristic dimension <b>246</b> is selected to be any measuring line that can be laid across the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b> at a longest orthogonal configuration. The characteristic dimension <b>246</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is depicted as traversing the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b> along the X-axis. Because of the thin nature of the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b>, which thickness is defined along the minor axis, the characteristic dimension is not selected to be in the minor axis. For example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the minor axis of the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b> is in the Z-direction, which is into and out of the plane of the FIG.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment for chip-scale packaging of microelectronic dice, the characteristic dimension <b>246</b> for the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b> is in a range from about 100 micrometer (&#x3bc;m) to about 350 &#x3bc;m, and it can be along either of the X- or Y-axes.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">During conventional laser-drill processing through a sintered TFC dielectric layer to form a contact corridor, an edge region <b>248</b> is heat altered in comparison to a rear region <b>250</b> of the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b>. The edge region <b>248</b> is subjected to an extreme heat transient because of the laser-drilling process, but the rear region <b>250</b> has the benefit of both the edge region <b>248</b> and the first electrode <b>210</b> as heat sinks to resist the extreme heat transient. The conventional laser-drill process can cause the edge region <b>248</b> morphology to change compared to the rear region <b>250</b>. For example the edge region <b>248</b> morphology can embrittle in comparison to the rear region <b>250</b>. The edge region <b>248</b> morphology can also have changed chemical qualities due to lost or altered materials caused by the heat transient. And due to the extreme heat transient of the laser-drilling process, the edge region <b>248</b> morphology can even have incorporated volatilized stray materials into the matrix of the edge region <b>248</b> in comparison to the rear region <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an embodiment, because of sintering a completed positive pattern, the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b> occurs, and the heat-altered morphology of the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b> is substantially uniform along the direction defined by the characteristic dimension <b>246</b>. This substantially uniform heat-altered morphology exhibits a known quality of the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b> at any location. Whether it is an edge region <b>248</b> or a rear region <b>248</b> of the TFC dielectric film <b>222</b>, the heat-altered morphology is substantially uniform.
