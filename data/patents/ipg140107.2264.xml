<heading id="h-0004" level="1">A. Background Regarding Squalamine</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The discovery of squalamine, a water soluble compound, the structure of which is shown below, was reported by Michael Zasloff in 1993 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,192,756). Squalamine was discovered in various tissues of the dogfish shark (<i>Squalus acanthias</i>) in a search for antibacterial agents. The most abundant source of squalamine is in the livers of <i>Squalus acanthias</i>, though it is found in other sources, such as lampreys (Yun et al., &#x201c;Identification of Squalamine in the Plasma Membrane of White Blood Cells in the Sea Lamprey,&#x201d; <i>Petromyzon marinus,&#x201d; J. Lipid Res., </i>48(12): 2579-2586 (2007)).</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chemically squalamine presented a structure never before seen in nature that being a bile acid coupled to a polyamine (spermidine); i.e., a steroid chemically linked to a polyamine. The chemical structure of squalamine, also known as 3 beta-N-1-(N-[3-(4-aminobutyl)]-1,3-diaminopropane)-7 alpha,24 zeta-dihydroxy-5 alpha-cholestane 24-sulfate, has been determined by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy and NMR. Squalamine is a cationic steroid characterized by a condensation of an anionic bile salt intermediate with spermidine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Squalamine and structurally related aminosterols, such as Aminosterol 1436, have potentially valuable applications in the treatment and or prevention of disease (Sills, Williams et al. 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,430; Ahima, Patel et al. 2002; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,596,712; 6,962,909; Connolly, Desai et al. 2006). Aminosterol 1436, also known as MSI 1436, is chemically known as (3beta-N-1(spermine)-7alpha, 24R-dihydroxy-5alpha-cholestane 24-sulfate). The structure of Aminosterol 1436 is shown below.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">1. Known Activities of Squalamine and Aminosterol 1436</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Numerous studies later demonstrated that squalamine exhibits potent antibacterial activity in vitro (Salmi, Loncle et al. 2008). Subsequently, squalamine was discovered to exhibit antiangiogenic activity in vitro and upon administration to animals (Sills, Williams et al. 1998; Yin, Gentili et al. 2002). As a consequence, squalamine has been evaluated in disease states known to be associated with pathological neovascularization, such as cancer (Sills, Williams et al. 1998; Schiller and Bittner 1999; Bhargava, Marshall et al. 2001; Williams, Weitman et al. 2001; Hao, Hammond et al. 2003; Herbst, Hammond et al. 2003; Sokoloff, Rinker-Schaeffer et al. 2004), and vascular disorders of the eye, including macular degeneration (US2007/10504A1 2007), retinopathy of prematurity (Higgins, Sanders et al. 2000; Higgins, Yan et al. 2004; US2007/10504A1 2007), corneal neovascularization (Genaidy, Kazi et al. 2002) and diabetic retinopathy (US2007/10504A1).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, Ahima (2002) teaches that Aminosterol 1436 decreases body weight, specifically fat, by suppressing feeding and preventing the reduction in energy expenditure, hormonal changes, and patterns of neuropeptide expression normally associated with weight loss. This reference concludes that Aminosterol 1436 acts in the brain to regulate food intake and energy expenditure, likely through suppression of orexigenic hypothalamic pathways.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The utility of squalamine as an anti-infective has been demonstrated in vitro against bacteria and fungi (Moore, Wehrli et al. 1993; Rao, Shinnar et al. 2000; Salmi, Loncle et al. 2008). Squalamine is a cationic amphipathic substance exhibiting an affinity for membranes composed of anionic phospholipids (Selinsky, Zhou et al. 1998; Selinsky, Smith et al. 2000). Like other such agents, including magainin and other cationic antimicrobial peptides, squalamine is believed to exert antimicrobial action by interacting electrostatically with the membranes of target microorganisms, which generally display anionic phospholipids on the membrane surface exposed to the environment, subsequently disturbing their functional integrity, and causing death of the targeted microbe (Sills, Williams et al. 1998; Zasloff 2002; Salmi, Loncle et al. 2008).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To date, squalamine has not been reported to display efficacy as an anti-infective in a living animal. In no published patent application or issued patent has such evidence been reported (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,192,756; 5,637,691; 5,721,226; 5,733,899; 5,763,430; 5,792,635; 5,795,885; 5,840,740; 5,840,936; 5,847,172; 5,856,535; 5,874,597; 5,994,336; 6,017,906; 6,143,738; 6,147,060; 6,388,108; 6,596,712; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0261508A1 2005; U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,909; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0166950A1 2006; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0183928A1 2006; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/10504A1 2007).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Recent studies have revealed that squalamine is inactivated by the concentrations of ionized calcium and magnesium present in mammalian blood, preventing squalamine from exerting its antimicrobial activity in the setting of systemic bacterial, fungal, or protozoan infections (Salmi, Loncle et al. 2008).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Most studies of mechanism of squalamine have focused on the effects of squalamine on properties of the endothelial cell. The compound has been shown to inhibit many downstream effects stimulated by diverse growth-factors (VEGF, thrombin, FGF) including cellular proliferation, cellular migration, vascular tube formation, sodium-proton anti-porter activation. (Sills et al., &#x201c;Squalamine inhibits angiogenesis and solid tumor growth in vivo and perturbs embryonic vasculature,&#x201d; Cancer Res 58, 2784-92 (1998); Li et al., &#x201c;Squalamine and cisplatin block angiogenesis and growth of human ovarian cancer cells with or without HER-2 gene overexpression,&#x201d; Oncogene 21, 2805-14 (2002); Akhter et al., &#x201c;Squalamine, a novel cationic steroid, specifically inhibits the brush-border Na+/H+ exchanger isoform NHE3,&#x201d; Am J Physiol 276, C136-44 (1999); and Williams et al., &#x201c;Squalamine treatment of human tumors in nu/nu mice enhances platinum-based chemotherapies,&#x201d; Clin Cancer Res 7, 724-33 (2001)).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">No mention of squalamine's use as a systemic antimicrobial agent, for example, appears in a recent patent application (U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/10504A1), which describes a favored salt form of squalamine for therapeutic administration, and which addresses the utility of squalamine as a systemic agent in the treatment of disorders of neovascularization and cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To date, no published data describe or support the efficacy of squalamine in treating or preventing a systemic viral infection in an animal. It has been reported in a patent application that squalamine could inhibit the infectivity of HIV and HSV in tissue culture (WO96/08270). However, it was not reported at that time, nor until the invention disclosed herein, that squalamine could exhibit antiviral activity when administered systemically to an animal. In the experiments described in WO96/08270, squalamine was conceived as a component of a topical agent to be used as a &#x201c;chemical condom&#x201d;, acting as a microbicide, and capable of rapidly inactivating HIV or HSV on contact by disrupting the outermost membranous envelopes of the viruses. Thus, the antiviral properties of squalamine observed in vitro were believed to result from direct disruption of the viral membrane, via a mechanism analogous to that proposed for its antibacterial activity. The potential use of squalamine for the topical prevention of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV, Herpes simplex, and <i>Neisseria gonorrhea </i>was presented at the 1995 ICAAC conference (MacDonald 1995). Thus, squalamine was proposed to have utility as an advanced form of &#x201c;disinfectant,&#x201d; to be applied to a mucosal surface in some formulation and thereby prevent viable virus from gaining access to the epithelial surfaces of the genitourinary tract.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Squalamine has been shown to inhibit a specific isoform of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger (&#x201c;NHE-3&#x201d;), a protein that plays a role in numerous cellular processes that involve the control of intracellular hydrogen ions (Akhter, Nath et al. 1999). As a consequence of this activity, it was proposed that squalamine might find utility in treating diseases, including viral infections, where NHE3 played a critical role, and where its inhibition (by squalamine) could be effected (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,909). It has been proposed that squalamine could be used to treat viral infections should it be known that a specific virus infected a target cell expressing an NHE sensitive to inhibition (NHE-3 in the case of squalamine), and that the specific NHE played a critical role in the cellular homeostasis of that cell type, and that the virus in question naturally infected that cell type in the course of a disease process (U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,909). To date, however, no example of an NHE-3 dependent viral infection has been reported in the literature, nor has any known NHE-3 inhibitor been shown to exhibit antiviral activity in an animal, including squalamine. Furthermore the viruses demonstrated to be inactivated in vitro by squalamine, namely HIV and HSV (WO96/08270) are now known to infect cells via a pathway that is &#x201c;pH independent&#x201d;, in the sense that inhibitors of pH homeostasis do not influence infectivity (Pelkmans and Helenius 2003).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">1436 is an aminosterol, isolated from the dogfish shark, structurally related to squalamine (U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,936; Rao, Shinnar et al. 2000). Aminosterol 1436 exhibits antiviral activity against HIV in tissue culture (U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,430) via a mechanism proposed to involve inhibition of a lymphocyte-specific NHE by 1436, resulting in suppression of cytokine responsiveness, and subsequent depression of the capacity of the lymphocyte to support HIV replication (U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,430). Aminosterol 1436, however, has an additional pharmacological property, not shared with squalamine, namely potent appetite suppression and promotion of dose-dependent weight loss (U.S. Pat. No. 6,143,738; Zasloff, Williams et al. 2001; Ahima, Patel et al. 2002). Administration of Aminosterol 1436 to animals at doses that would achieve tissue concentrations of Aminosterol 1436 speculated to exert an antiviral benefit cause profound weight loss and suppression of food intake and death due to starvation (Zasloff, Williams et al. 2001; Ahima, Patel et al. 2002).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Recent patents have been issued describing squalamine like compounds with potent antibacterial activity, but no mention is made of their utility as antiviral agents (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,834,453; 6,017,906). Indeed, the potential value of squalamine and its analogs as systemic agents has been questioned due to the extensive binding to albumin exhibited by these compounds (U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,453).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Squalamine in its intravenous form, squalamine lactate, is in the process of being tested as a treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a rare disease where connective tissue will ossify when damaged. (Genesis, A., &#x201c;Squalamine trial for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva initiated&#x201d;, <i>Angiogenesis Weekly, </i>8:45 (2002).) Squalamine is also undergoing trials for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (stage I/IIA) as well as general phase I pharmacokinetic studies. (Herbst et al., &#x201c;A Phase I/IIA Trial of Continuous Five-Day Infusion of Squalamine Lactate (MSI-1256F) Plus Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 1&#x201d;, <i>Clinical Cancer Research, </i>9:4108-4115 (2003); Hao et al., &#x201c;A Phase I and Pharmacokinetic Study of Squalamine, an Aminosterol Angiogenesis Inhibitor&#x201d;, <i>Clin Cancer Res., </i>9(7): 2465-2471 (2003).) In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration granted squalamine Fast Track status for approval for treatment of age-related macular degeneration. (CATE: California Assistive Technology Exchange&#x201d;, California Assistive Technology Exchange, http://cate.ca.gov/index.cfm?a=Resources&#x26;p=News&#x26;article=176, Retrieved 2009 Mar. 31.) However, Genaera Corporation discontinued trials for the use of squalamine in treating prostate cancer and wet age-related macular degeneration in 2007. (&#x201c;PROSTATE CANCER; Genaera Discontinues LOMUCIN in Cystic Fibrosis and Squalamine in Prostate Cancer Studies&#x201d;, <i>Drug Week</i>, pp. 251. 2007 Jul. 20; &#x201c;Reports describe the most recent news from Genaera Corporation&#x201d;. <i>Biotech Business Week</i>, pp. 1540 (2007 Sep. 17).) Squalamine is also marketed under the brand name Squalamax&#x2122; as a dietary supplement, though it has not been approved as a drug inthis form and thus cannot make therapeutic claims. Squalamax&#x2122; is an unfractionated extract of shark liver, containing innumerable uncharacterized substances in addition to squalamine, itself present below 0.01% of the total weight of the extract. (&#x201c;Cyber Warning Letter&#x201d;, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (2002 May 6), http://www.fda.gov/CDER/warn/cyber/2002/CFSANnuGen.htm; Retrieved 2009 Mar. 31.) Moreover, the dietary supplement form of squalamine is not pharmaceutical grade squalamine, which requires significantly greater manufacturing efforts.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">By 2006, over 300 patients had received squalamine in doses ranging from 6-700 mg/m2/day by iv administration, in three Phase I and nine Phase II studies (Hao et al., &#x201c;A Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of squalamine, an aminosterol angiogenesis inhibitor,&#x201d; Clin Cancer Res 9, 2465-71 (2003); Herbst et al., &#x201c;A phase I/IIA trial of continuous five-day infusion of squalamine lactate (MSI-1256F) plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer,&#x201d; Clin Cancer Res 9, 4108-15 (2003); Bhargava et al., &#x201c;A phase I and pharmacokinetic study of squalamine, a novel antiangiogenic agent, in patients with advanced cancers,&#x201d; Clin Cancer Res 7, 3912-9 (2001); and Connolly et al., &#x201c;Squalamine lactate for exudative age-related macular degeneration,&#x201d; Ophthalmol Clin North Am 19, 381-91, vi (2006). The studies showed that the compound exhibited an acceptable safety profile and evidence of efficacy in these early trials. For example, in the context of recommending the study of squalamine for treating certain cancers, Bhargava et al. (2001) evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and pharmacokinetics of squalamine lactate when given as a 120-h continuous i.v. infusion every two weeks. The reference concludes that the best tolerated dose rate of squalamine lactate when administered as a 120-h continuous i.v. infusion was 192 mg/m(2)/day; however, patients without prior exposure to squalamine appeared to tolerate a dose rate of 384 mg/m(2)/day without DLT. In 2006 development of squalamine was halted for economic/strategic reasons by Genaera, and has remained in a dormant stage since.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">2. Toxicity of Current Squalamine and Aminosterol 1436 Formulations</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Squalamine and Aminosterol 1436 are fundamentally detergents and can as a consequence disrupt the membranes of normal healthy cells (Moore, Wehrli et al. 1993). This property impacts on the utility of squalamine and Aminosterol 1436. Squalamine and related aminosterols are generally administered at daily doses of between 25-700 mg to a human subject (Bhargava, Marshall et al. 2001; Hao, Hammond et al. 2003; Herbst, Hammond et al. 2003; U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,909; Connolly, Desai et al. 2006). When solutions of squalamine or related aminosterols are administered to animals or humans, the concentrations of the active compound must be adjusted to minimize the damaging effects of the aminosterol on the tissues that will experience the initially high concentrations generally administered. For example, Hao et al. (2003) describes toxicities associated with escalating dosages of squalamine. Hepatotoxicity, characterized by brief, asymptomatic elevations in transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia, was the principal dose-limiting toxicity of squalamine. At 700 mg/m(2)/day, two of three patients developed grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia, which precluded further dose escalation. At 500 mg/m(2)/day, one of seven patients experienced dose-limiting grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia and grade 3 neurosensory changes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Typically, squalamine or Aminosterol 1436 is administered intravenously at concentrations no greater than 1 mg/ml (Herbst, Hammond et al. 2003), (Hao, Hammond et al. 2003; US2007/10504A1 2007), (Connolly, Desai et al. 2006). Higher concentrations cause vascular inflammation due to damage to the endothelial lining of the veins into which the compound is administered. Indeed, the intravenous administration of squalamine lactate to human subjects via peripheral vein at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was associated with infusion site tissue damage, requiring the use of a more dilute solution in subsequent studies (0.25 mg/ml). (Connolly, Desai et al. 2006). Furthermore, administration of either squalamine or Aminosterol 1436 via subcutaneous or intramuscular routes would require use of significantly higher concentrations of drug to deliver the daily dose (between 25-700 mg) in a volume appropriate for these modes of local administration (1-5 ml per dosing, or between 25 mg/ml and 140 mg/ml). Because of the local tissue destruction that would be caused by the administration of these concentrations of drug, subcutaneous or intramuscular dosing of squalamine and related aminosterols to date has not been possible.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">There is a need in the art for new formulations of squalamine and squalamine derivatives which that can be administered without causing local tissue damage. The present invention addresses the problem by providing new formulations of squalamine and squalamine derivatives, such as Aminosterol 1436.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention relates to compositions comprising at least one salt of an aminosterol, such as squalamine, in which the salt is an inorganic phosphate, polyphosphate, or an organic phosphate monoester. The compositions, when administered in vivo, reduce the local membrane damaging properties of squalamine and other aminosterols when administered in doses required to achieve therapeutic or disease preventative benefits. The compositions of the invention can comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In various embodiments of the invention, the aminosterol is administered as a weakly water soluble salt of inorganic phosphate to an animal or human. The aminosterol can be administered as a weakly water soluble salt of inorganic pyrophosphate to an animal or human. In yet another embodiment, the aminosterol can be administered as a weakly water soluble salt of an inorganic polyphosphate, where the number of phosphates can range from 3 (tripolyphosphate) to several hundred. In another embodiment, the aminosterol can be administered as a weakly water soluble salt of an organic phosphate, including glycerol 2 phosphates, or any organic phosphate that can form a weakly water soluble salt with an aminosterol.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment of the invention, the compositions of the invention comprising at least one poorly soluble phosphate salt of an aminosterol such as squalamine or a derivative thereof can be administered to achieve a therapeutic benefit, by both reducing the free concentration of the aminosterol liberated by the dissolving suspension, and by slowing down the rate of entry of the administered dose of the aminosterol as a result of the slow rate of dissolution of the suspension, creating a sustained release effect.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment, the phosphate salt of an aminosterol such as squalamine or a derivative thereof can be produced as a salt form, purified, and subsequently administered as a suspension. In another embodiment, a suspension can be created from a solution of a soluble salt of an aminosterol such as squalamine or a derivative thereof by addition of sufficient phosphate to fully titrate the aminosterol. In another embodiment the phosphate can be a polyphosphate, such as pyrophosphate. In another embodiment, the chain of phosphates can be three or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The aminosterol in the compositions of the invention can be squalamine, a squalamine isomer, or a derivative of squalamine. In addition, the aminosterol can be Aminosterol 1436. In yet another embodiment, any sterol having an attached polyamine, such that the molecule has a net positive charge of at least +1 created by the polyamine.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">The present invention relates to aminosterol phosphate compositions, such as compositions of squalamine or derivatives thereof, which produce a reduction in local tissue damage present upon injectable (e.g., IM, SC or IV) administration of prior art aminosterol compositions. In the compositions of the invention, the aminosterol, such as squalamine or a derivative thereof, is formulated as a phosphate salt. Unlike squalamine, which is has a solubility in water exceeding 100 mg/ml, the solubility of squalamine phosphate salts in water is over 1000 fold lower, e.g., about 40 &#x3bc;g/ml, and about 1 &#x3bc;g/ml at plasma (and tissue) phosphate concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">The compositions of the invention can also provide a controlled release of the aminosterol. For example, injection of 1 ml of a solution of squalamine lactate at 1 mg/ml (the commonly used salt) will expose tissues in the micro-environment of the administered dose to instantaneous squalamine concentrations of 1 mg/ml, which will gradually decrease as the compound diffuses from the site into either local tissues or into the vascular system. From the literature, concentrations of squalamine in excess of 100 &#x3bc;g/ml damage tissue and cellular membranes by non-specific detergent like effects, with the effect growing more intense as the concentration rises (Moore, Wehrli et al. 1993). In contrast, injection of 1 mg of a suspension of squalamine phosphate at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, will expose local tissues to a steady state concentration of squalamine no greater than 1 &#x3bc;g/ml, a concentration below that which causes non-specific membrane disruption. Because of the weakly soluble nature of the squalamine phosphate salt, the free concentration of squalamine in the micro-environment of the suspension is independent of the amount introduced into the site. Hence the aminosterol phosphate compositions of the invention provide a means of administering an aminosterol, such as squalamine, in a slowly releasing format that naturally controls free concentrations of the aminosterol, based solely on the solubility of squalamine phosphate in the environment of the dissolving suspension.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0069">U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,909, for &#x201c;Treatment of neovascularization disorders with squalamine&#x201d; to Zasloff et al., discloses various aminosterols, the disclosure of which is specifically incorporated by reference. Any aminosterol known in the art, including those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,909, can be used in this invention, as long as the aminosterol carries a net positive charge of at least +1 created by a polyamine moiety.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0070">In one embodiment, the invention can be applied to a formulation of Aminosterol 1436 (Zasloff, Williams et al. 2001) as an insoluble salt of phosphate, polyphosphate, or an organic phosphate ester. In another embodiment, the aminosterol can be composed of a sterol nucleus to which a polyamine is chemically linked, displaying a net positive charge of at least +1. The invention can be embodied in a formulation comprising a suspension or as a tablet for oral administration. As an oral formulation, squalamine sulfate would slowly dissolve in the gastrointestinal tract, and not subject the lining of the intestine to high local concentrations that would otherwise irritate or damage the organ. Similarly, delivery via inhalation or nebularization would provide similar benefits. Fine particles would gradually dissolve in the airway, releasing squalamine into the lungs at non-toxic local concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0071">An example of an aminosterol useful in the compositions of the invention includes squalamine. A variant or derivative of squalamine useful in the compositions of the invention may have one or more chemical modification which do not modify the therapeutic characteristics of squalamine. A &#x201c;variant&#x201d; or &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; of squalamine is a molecule in which modifications well known in the art of medicinal chemistry to &#x201c;mimic&#x201d; the original spatial and charge characteristics of a portion of the original structure have been introduced to improve the therapeutic characteristics of squalamine. In general, such modifications are introduced to influence metabolism and biodistribution. Examples of such variants or derivatives include, but are not limited to, (1) substitutions of the sulfate by a sulfonate, phosphate, carboxylate, or other anionic moiety chosen to circumvent metabolic removal of the sulfate moiety and oxidation of the cholesterol side chain; (2) replacement of an hydroxyl group by a non-metabolizable polar substituent, such as a fluorine atom, to prevent its metabolic oxidation or conjugation; and (3) substitution of various ring hydrogen atoms to prevent oxidative or reductive metabolism of the steroid ring system. As used herein, the term &#x201c;squalamine&#x201d; is intended to encompass squalamine and variants or derivatives thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">III. Striking insolubility of squalamine in the presence of inorganic phosphate and polyphosphate, but not in other common inorganic anions</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0072">The solubility of various squalamine salts was examined to establish a salt form that was partially soluble in water, as described in Examples 1-3, below. These examples also determined whether an organic phosphate ester could complex with squalamine to generate a weakly soluble salt. Certain organic phosphate esters, such as glycerol-2-phosphate appear to form weakly soluble salts with squalamine, while others such as Glucose-6-phosphate do not. This difference is likely due to the degree of steric hindrance imposed by the organic moiety on electrostatic interactions between the cationic amino groups of the polyamine tail of squalamine and the anionic oxygens of the phosphate. The results of Example 1 presented below showed that the insolubility of squalamine in the presence of phosphate, pyrophosphate and polyphosphate is not observed with other common anions. (&#x201c;Turbidity&#x201d; in Table 1 corresponds to insolubility, as insolubility of the salt form was scored by the change in the solution from clear/transparent to turbid/cloudy.)</p>

It is well known in the art of drug formulation that depot administration of a poorly soluble suspension of drug exhibits a more sustained release of a drug into the blood stream than does the administration of a solution of that drug delivered to the same anatomic location (i.e., a subcutaneous or intramuscular site). The rate of dissolution of the particles of drug that comprise the suspension is profoundly influenced by the molecular structure and physical form (particle size, crystallinity, etc) of the drug particles. In the present invention, a given weight of an aminosterol phosphate, such as squalamine phosphate, dispersed into smaller particles will dissolve and hence distribute more rapidly than a dispersion of larger particles. The difference in dispersal time reflects the relationship between total particle surface area and particle size: the smaller the particle size the greater the surface area a given weight of an aminosterol phosphate, such as squalamine phosphate. In addition, the density of the particle (reflecting its molecular structure) can be modified to alter its dissolution properties. Thus, highly organized dense crystalline particles would be expected to dissolve more slowly than amorphous less dense forms of the phosphate salt, under identical conditions of solubilization.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0076">The size of the particles of squalamine phosphate used for dose administration can be controlled by a variety of methods known in the field of formulation science. For example, an aminosterol phosphate powder, such as squalamine powder, can be milled to a specific mean particle size. Alternatively, a suspension of an aminosterol phosphate, such as squalamine phosphate, with a specific distribution can be generated in situ by addition of a phosphate solution to a soluble solution of an aminosterol salt (e.g., a squalamine salt). In general, particle size can be controlled by varying the molar ratio of phosphate relative to the aminosterol phosphate (e.g., squalamine) present in solution; varying the temperature under which the phosphate salt form is being prepared; altering the viscosity of solution through addition of various carbohydrates in various concentrations; and through physical agitation (mechanical or sonication) during or after preparation of the suspension.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0077">The molecular structure of the particle can be easily controlled, for example, by adjusting the relative molar ratios of phosphate to squalamine, as described in Examples 7 and 8, creating particles of either amorphous or crystalline structure.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0078">A. Pharmaceutical Carriers</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0079">While it is possible for an aminosterol phosphate composition to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation, together with one or more acceptable carriers. The carrier(s) must be &#x201c;acceptable&#x201d; in the sense of being compatible with the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) and not deleterious to the recipients thereof. Typically, the carriers will be water or saline which will be sterile and pyrogen free. Squalamine or a derivative thereof is particularly well suited to formulation in aqueous carriers such as sterile pyrogen free water, saline or other isotonic solutions because of their extended shelf-life in solution. For instance, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated well in advance in aqueous form, for instance, weeks or months or longer time periods before being dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0080">Generally, the formulations are prepared by contacting the aminosterol, e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof, uniformly and intimately with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. Then, if necessary, the product is shaped into the desired formulation. Preferably, the carrier is a parenteral carrier, more preferably a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water, saline, Ringer's solution, and dextrose solution. Non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful herein, as well as liposomes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0081">The carrier suitably comprises minor amounts of additives such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Such materials are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, succinate, acetic acid, and other organic acids or their salts; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten residues) polypeptides, e.g., polyarginine or tripeptides; proteins, such as gelatin, serum albumin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids, such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, manose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as polysorbates, poloxamers, or PEG.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0082">In instances where aerosol administration is appropriate, the aminosterol, e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof, can be formulated as aerosols using standard procedures. The term &#x201c;aerosol&#x201d; includes any gas-borne suspended phase of an aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) which is capable of being inhaled into the bronchioles or nasal passages, and includes dry powder and aqueous aerosol, and pulmonary and nasal aerosols. Specifically, aerosol includes a gas-born suspension of droplets of an aminosterol, as may be produced in a metered dose inhaler or nebulizer, or in a mist sprayer. Aerosol also includes a dry powder composition of a composition of the invention suspended in air or other carrier gas, which may be delivered by insufflation from an inhaler device, for example. See Ganderton &#x26; Jones, <i>Drug Delivery to the Respiratory Tract </i>(Ellis Horwood, 1987); Gonda, <i>Critical Reviews in therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, </i>6:273-313 (1990); and Raeburn et al., <i>Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods, </i>27:143-159 (1992).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0083">B. Dosage Forms</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0084">The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Any pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form may be employed in the methods of the invention. For example, the composition can be formulated: (a) for administration selected from the group consisting of oral,-pulmonary, rectal, colonic, parenteral, intracisternal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, nebulization, inhalation, ocular, otic, local, buccal, nasal, and topical administration; (b) into a dosage form selected from the group consisting of liquid dispersions, gels, aerosols, ointments, creams, lyophilized formulations, tablets, capsules; (c) into a dosage form selected from the group consisting of controlled release formulations, fast melt formulations, delayed release formulations, extended release formulations, pulsatile release formulations, and mixed immediate release and controlled release formulations; or (d) any combination of (a), (b), and (c).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0085">An exemplary dosage form is an orally administered dosage form, such as a tablet or capsule. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) with the carrier that constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0086">1. Exemplary Dosage Forms</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0087">Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation appropriate for the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampules, vials or syringes, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (Lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0088">Formulations or compositions of the invention may be packaged together with, or included in a kit with, instructions or a package insert. For instance, such instructions or package inserts may address recommended storage conditions, such as time, temperature and light, taking into account the shelf-life of the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof). Such instructions or package inserts may also address the particular advantages of the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof), such as the ease of storage for formulations that may require use in the field, outside of controlled hospital, clinic or office conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0089">The aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) composition can also be included in nutraceuticals. For instance, the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) composition may be administered in natural products, including milk or milk product obtained from a transgenic mammal which expresses alpha-fetoprotein fusion protein. Such compositions can also include plant or plant products obtained from a transgenic plant which expresses the aminosterol. The aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) can also be provided in powder or tablet form, with or without other known additives, carriers, fillers and diluents. Exemplary nutraceuticals are described in Scott Hegenhart, <i>Food Product Design</i>, December 1993.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0090">The aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) composition will be formulated and dosed in a fashion consistent with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient (especially the side effects of treatment with the aminosterol alone), the site of delivery, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to practitioners. The &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0091">As a general proposition, the total pharmaceutically effective amount of the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.1 mg/kg/day to 20 mg/kg/day of patient body weight, although, as noted above, this will be subject to therapeutic discretion. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed. The length of treatment needed to observe changes and the interval following treatment for responses to occur appears to vary depending on the desired effect.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0092">&#x201c;Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; refers to a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any. The term &#x201c;parenteral&#x201d; as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous, transdermal, and intraarticular injection and infusion.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0093">The aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) is also suitably administered by sustained-release systems. Examples of sustained-release aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) compositions are administered orally, rectally, parenterally, intracistemally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, gels, drops or transdermal patch), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray. &#x201c;Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; refers to a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. The term &#x201c;parenteral&#x201d; as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion. Additional examples of sustained-release compositions include suitable polymeric materials (such as, for example, semi-permeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or mirocapsules), suitable hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, and sparingly soluble derivatives (such as, for example, a sparingly soluble salt).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0094">Sustained-release matrices include polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., <i>Biopolymers, </i>22:547-556 (1983)), poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (Langer et al., <i>J. Biomed. Mater. Res., </i>15:167-277 (1981), and Langer, <i>Chem. Tech., </i>12:98-105 (1982)), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., Id.) or poly-D-(&#x2212;)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0095">Sustained-release aminosterols (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) also include liposomally entrapped aminosterol (see generally, Langer, <i>Science, </i>249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al., in <i>Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer</i>, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), pp. 317-327 and 353-365 (Liss, N.Y., 1989). Liposomes comprising the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) are prepared by methods known per se: DE 3,218,121; Epstein et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci</i>. (USA), 82:3688-3692 (1985); Hwang et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci</i>. (USA), 77:40304034 (1980); EP 52,322; EP 36,676; EP 88,046; EP 143,949; EP 142,641; Japanese Pat. Appl. 83-118008; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and EP 102,324. Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamellar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol. percent cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal therapeutic.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0096">In yet an additional embodiment, the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) is delivered by way of a pump (see Langer, supra; Sefton, <i>CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng., </i>14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., <i>Surgery, </i>88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., <i>N. Engl. J. Med., </i>321:574 (1989)).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0097">Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (<i>Science </i>249:1527-1533 (1990)).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0098">For parenteral administration, in one embodiment, the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) composition is formulated generally by mixing it at the desired degree of purity, in a unit dosage injectable form (solution, suspension, or emulsion), with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i.e., one that is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. For example, the formulation preferably does not include oxidizing agents and other compounds that are known to be deleterious to the therapeutic.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0099">Any pharmaceutical used for therapeutic administration can be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes (e.g., 0.2 micron membranes). The aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) generally is placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0100">The aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) ordinarily will be stored in unit or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampoules or vials, as an aqueous solution or as a lyophilized formulation for reconstitution. As an example of a lyophilized formulation, 10-ml vials are filled with 5 ml of sterile-filtered 1% (w/v) aqueous squalamine or a derivative thereof solution, and the resulting mixture is lyophilized. The infusion solution is prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized squalamine or a derivative thereof using bacteriostatic Water-for-Injection. In this embodiment, for example, a measured amount of a solution of a phosphate salt can then be added to the aqueous solution of squalamine or a derivative thereof to create the phosphate formulation disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0101">The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) composition including containers filled with an appropriate amount of a phosphate, either as a powder, to be dissolved, or as a sterile solution. Associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration. In addition, the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) may be employed in conjunction with other therapeutic compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0102">2. Other Pharmaceutical Excipients</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0103">Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may also comprise one or more binding agents, filling agents, lubricating agents, suspending agents, sweeteners, flavoring agents, preservatives, buffers, wetting agents, disintegrants, effervescent agents, and other excipients. Such excipients are known in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0106">Examples of sweeteners may include any natural or artificial sweetener, such as sucrose, xylitol, sodium saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame, and acesulfame. Examples of flavoring agents are MAGNASWEET&#xae; (trademark of MAFCO) (trade name needed), bubble gum flavor, and fruit flavors, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0107">Examples of preservatives include potassium sorbate, methylparaben, propylparaben, benzoic acid and its salts, other esters of parahydroxybenzoic acid such as butylparaben, alcohols such as ethyl or benzyl alcohol, phenolic compounds such as phenol, or quaternary compounds such as benzalkonium chloride.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0108">Suitable diluents include pharmaceutically acceptable inert fillers, such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, dibasic calcium phosphate, saccharides, and/or mixtures of any of the foregoing. Examples of diluents include microcrystalline cellulose, such as Aviccl&#xae; AVICEL&#xae; PH101 (trade name needed), and AVICEL&#xae; PH102 (trade name needed); lactose such as lactose monohydrate, lactose anhydrous, and PHARMATOSE&#xae; DCL21 (trade name needed); dibasic calcium phosphate such as EMCOMPRESS&#xae; (trade name needed); mannitol; starch; sorbitol; sucrose; andglucose.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0110">Examples of effervescent agents include effervescent couples such as an organic acid and a carbonate or bicarbonate. Suitable organic acids include, for example, citric, tartaric, malic, fumaric, adipic, succinic, and alginic acids and anhydrides and acid salts. Suitable carbonates and bicarbonates include, for example, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, magnesium carbonate, sodium glycine carbonate, L-lysine carbonate, and arginine carbonate. Alternatively, only the sodium bicarbonate component of the effervescent couple may be present.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0111">3. Dosages</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0112">Examples of dosages of aminosterols such as squalamine tolerated by humans are well known in the art. For example, Hao et al., (2003). &#x201c;A Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of squalamine, an aminosterol angiogenesis inhibitor.&#x201d; Clin Cancer Res 9(7): 2465-71, describes exemplary dosages for a 5-day continuous i.v. infusion every 3 weeks for treating advanced solid malignancies. Dose levels ranging from 6 to 700 mg/m(2)/day. Hepatotoxicity, characterized by brief, asymptomatic elevations in transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia, was the principal dose-limiting toxicity of squalamine. At 700 mg/m(2)/day, two of three patients developed grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia, which precluded further dose escalation. At 500 mg/m(2)/day, one of seven patients experienced dose-limiting grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia and grade 3 neurosensory changes, which resolved soon after treatment. Squalamine pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional. At 500 mg/m(2)/day, the mean (percentage coefficient of variation) clearance, half-life, and volume of distribution of squalamine were 2.67 liters/h/m(2) (85%), 9.46 h (81%), and 36.84 liters/m(2) (124%), respectively, and steady-state concentrations [20.08 micro g/ml (13%)] were well above those that inhibit angiogenesis in preclinical models. The study concluded that at a dose of 500 mg/m(2)/day, squalamine is well tolerated.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0113">In addition, Herbst et al., (2003). &#x201c;A phase I/IIA trial of continuous five-day infusion of squalamine lactate (MSI-1256F) plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&#x201d; Clin Cancer Res 9(11): 4108-15, also describes exemplary therapeutic dosage of squalamine. This reference describes a Phase I/IIA study designed to assess the safety, clinical response, and pharmacokinetics of squalamine when administered as a 5-day continuous infusion in conjunction with standard chemotherapy every 3 weeks in patients with stage IIIB (pleural effusion) or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Patients with chemotherapy-naive non-small cell lung cancer were treated with escalating doses of squalamine in combination with standard doses of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Paclitaxel and carboplatin were administered on day 1, followed by squalamine as a continuous infusion on days 1-5, every 21 days. The starting dose of squalamine was 100 mg/m(2)/day and escalated to 400 mg/m(2)/day; two of three patients at 400 mg/m(2)/day had dose-limiting toxicity that included grade 3/4 arthralgia, myalgia, and neutropenia. On the basis of safety and toxicity, 300 mg/m(2)/day was selected as the Phase II dose of squalamine in this combination regimen. The combination of squalamine given continuously daily for 5 days, with paclitaxel and carboplatin given on day 1, was well tolerated.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0114">C. Adjuvants</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0115">The aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) may be administered alone or in combination with one or more adjuvants. For example, for antiviral applications, an adjuvant is a substance that indirectly enhances the therapeutic activity of the aminosterol by stimulating the antiviral arm of the innate and/or the adaptive immune system. Adjuvants that may be administered with the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) include, but are not limited to, cytokines and/or interleukins (such as IL2, IL3, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8, IL-9, IL10, IL-11, IL12, IL13, IL-14, IL15, IIL16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-19, IL-20, IL-21, anti-CD40, CD40L, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta), Lipid A, including monophosphoryl lipid A, bacterial products, endotoxins, cholesterol, fatty acids, aliphatic amines, paraffinic and vegetable oils, threonyl derivative, and muramyl dipeptide, alum, alum plus deoxycholate (ImmunoAg), MTP-PE (Biocine Corp.), QS21 (Genentech, Inc.), BCG (e.g., THERACYS&#xae;), MPL and nonviable preparations of <i>Corynebacterium parvum</i>. In a specific embodiment, aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) is administered in combination with alum. In another specific embodiment, aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) is administered in combination with QS-21. Further adjuvants that may be administered with the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) include, but are not limited to, Monophosphoryl lipid immunomodulator, AdjuVax 100a, QS-21, QS-18, CRL1005, Aluminum salts, MF-59, and Virosomal adjuvant technology.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0116">D. Vaccines</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0117">Vaccines that may be administered with the aminosterol (e.g., squalamine or a derivative thereof) include any antigen capable of eliciting an immune response. The vaccine may be comprised of either live or inactivated virus. Exemplary vaccines include, but are not limited to, vaccines directed toward protection against MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), polio, varicella, tetanus/diptheria, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, <i>Haemophilus influenzae </i>B, whooping cough, pneumonia, influenza, Lyme's Disease, rotavirus, cholera, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, poliomyelitis, rabies, typhoid fever, pertussis, PA-toxin (e.g., anthrax), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2), Avian Flu antigen (e.g., H5N1; avian influenza virus A/FPV/Rostock/34 (H7N1) (FPV)), cancer, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and tuberculosis. Useful antigens include but are not limited to viral, prion, bacterial, parasitic, mycotic, etc. antigens.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0118">Combinations may be administered either concomitantly, e.g., as an admixture, separately but simultaneously or concurrently; or sequentially. In addition, as used herein &#x201c;combination administration&#x201d; includes compounds which are attached to the squalamine or a derivative thereof. This also includes presentations in which the combined agents are administered together as a therapeutic mixture, and also procedures in which the combined agents are administered separately but simultaneously, e.g., as through separate intravenous lines into the same individual. Administration &#x201c;in combination&#x201d; further includes the separate administration of one of the compounds or agents given first, followed by the second.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0119">E. Combination Therapy</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0120">The aminosterol phosphate compositions of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents. As noted above, the aminosterol phosphate compositions of the invention are useful in treating and/or preventing: (1) viral infections, (2) antimicrobial infections, including but not limited to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial infections, fungal infections, and protozoan infections; (3) disease states known to be associated with pathological neovascularization, such as cancer, due to squalamine's anti-angiogenic properties; (4) vascular disorders of the eye, including macular degeneration, such as age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, corneal neovascularization, diabetic retinopathy; (5) weight loss or weight management, dose-dependent weight loss; (6) diseases, including viral infections, where sodium-hydrogen exchanger (&#x201c;NHE-3&#x201d;) plays a critical role, and where its inhibition (by squalamine) could be effected; and (7) treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a rare disease where connective tissue will ossify when damaged. Thus, any active agent known to be useful in treating these conditions can be used in conjunction with the aminosterol phosphate compositions of the invention. For example, in methods of treating a microbial infection, the aminosterol phosphate compositions of the invention can be co-administered or combined with an antibiotic. For treating a viral infection, the aminosterol phosphate compositions of the invention can be co-administered or combined with an antiviral agent, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0121">For example, the aminosterol phosphate compositions may be administered in combination compounds including but not limited to, chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, conventional immunotherapeutic agents, antiviral agents, and/or therapeutic treatments described below. Combinations may be administered either concomitantly, e.g., as an admixture, separately but simultaneously or concurrently; or sequentially. This includes presentations in which the combined agents are administered together as a therapeutic mixture, and also procedures in which the combined agents are administered separately but simultaneously, e.g., as through separate intravenous lines into the same individual. Administration &#x201c;in combination&#x201d; further includes the separate administration of one of the compounds or agents given first, followed by the second.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0122">1. Anti-Viral Agents</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0123">For example, aminosterol phosphate compositions of the invention can be combined with conventional antiviral therapies for treating and preventing viral infections. For example, the aminosterol phosphate compositions of the invention can be combined with any known antiviral agent.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0124">Designing safe and effective antiviral drugs is difficult, because viruses use the host's cells to replicate. This makes it difficult to find targets for the drug that would interfere with the virus without harming the host organism's cells. Almost all anti-microbials, including anti-virals, are subject to drug resistance as the pathogens mutate over time, becoming less susceptible to the treatment. For instance, a recent study published in Nature Biotechnology emphasized the urgent need for augmentation of oseltamivir (TAMIFLU&#xae;) stockpiles with additional antiviral drugs including zanamivir (RELENZA&#xae;) based on an evaluation of the performance of these drugs in the scenario that the 2009 H1N1 &#x2018;Swine Flu&#x2019; neuraminidase (NA) were to acquire the TAMIFLU&#xae; resistance (His274Tyr) mutation which is currently wide-spread in seasonal H1N1 strains.

<p id="p-0148" num="0155">A. Treating Viral Infections</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0156">The present invention is directed to methods of treating and/or preventing viral infections comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an aminosterol phosphate composition to a subject in need. A &#x201c;subject in need&#x201d; is a human or animal at risk of a viral infection, or which has contracted a viral infection. As noted above, this method encompasses using an aminosterol phosphate composition in combination with conventional antiviral treatments to treat viral infections.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0157">The viral infection to be treated or prevented can be caused by any virus, including but not limited to, &#x201c;African Swine Fever Viruses,&#x201d; Arbovirus, Adenoviridae, Arenaviridae, Arterivirus, Astroviridae, Baculoviridae, Bimaviridae, Birnaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Caliciviridae, Caulimoviridae, Circoviridae, Coronaviridae, Cystoviridae, Dengue, EBV, HIV, Deltaviridae, Filviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Hepadnaviridae (Hepatitis), Herpesviridae (such as, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex, Herpes Zoster), Iridoviridae, Mononegavirus (e.g., Paramyxoviridae, Morbillivirus, Rhabdoviridae), Myoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae (e.g., Influenza A, Influenza B, and parainfluenza), Papiloma virus, Papovaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Prions, Parvoviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Picornaviridae (e.g. Rhinovirus, Poliovirus), Poxyiridae (such as Smallpox or Vaccinia), Potyviridae, Reoviridae (e.g., Rotavirus), Retroviridae (HTLV-I, HTLV-II, Lentivirus), Rhabdoviridae, Tectiviridae, Togaviridae (e.g., Rubivirus), or any combination thereof. In another embodiment of the invention, the viral infection is caused by a virus selected from the group consisting of herpes, pox, papilloma, corona, influenza, hepatitis, sendai, sindbis, vaccinia viruses, west nile, hanta, or viruses which cause the common cold. In another embodiment of the invention, the condition to be treated is selected from the group consisting of AIDS, viral meningitis, Dengue, EBV, hepatitis, and any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0158">For example, the results of Example 14 below demonstrate the successful treatment of animals infected with Yellow Fever. These results demonstrate that squalamine can be utilized as an effective systemic antiviral therapy in already established viral infection when administered in the squalamine phosphate formulation disclosed in this application. Because of the similarity in the properties shared by the flavivirus family, in addition to Yellow Fever, squalamine could be used to treat infections caused other members of the Flaviviridae including: Dengue, Hepatitis C, West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis, Tick borne Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Murray Valley Encephalitis, Kyasanur Fever, and any novel as yet undiscovered virus classified as a member of the Flaviviridae. Similarly, the results of Example 16 demonstrate that squalamine systemically administered by either the intraperitoneal or subcutaneous routes, utilizing the phosphate formulation disclosed in this application, to an animal can effectively treat CMV infection and reduce viral titers to undetectable levels. Hence, squalamine can exhibit antiviral activity systemically against both RNA and DNA viruses. The results of Example 16 also demonstrate that squalamine is active against a member of the Herpes Virus family, and supports its use in infections caused by other members of the Herpes family, including Human cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex 1, Herpes Simplex 2, Epstein Barr Virus, Varicella Zoster Virus, Roseolovirus (HHV6 and HHV7), Kaposi's Sarcoma Associated Herpes Virus, Cercopithecine herpesvirus-1, Murine gammaherpesvirus-68, the Bovine Herpesviridae, the Canine Herpesviridae, the Equine Herpesviridae, the Feline Herpesviridae, the Duck Herpesviridae, the Chicken Herpesviridae, the Turkey Herpesviridae, Porcine Herpesviridae and any as yet undiscovered virus subsequently classified as a member of the Herpesviridae. Moreover, the results of Example 16 further demonstrate that, by virtue of the measured reduction in viral titers within the spleen, squalamine administered systemically can effectively render virally resistant the cells of the spleen that support CMV infection, which include macrophages. This result supports the use of squalamine in the treatment of all viral diseases in which the macrophage is subject to infection.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0159">Additionally, the results of Example 17 demonstrate the activity of squalamine in treating an infection caused by a member of the Alphavirus family and supports its use in the treatment infection caused by other members of this family, including: Aura virus, Barmah Forest virus, Bebaru virus, Cabassou virus, Chikungunya virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Everglades virus, Fort Morgan virus, Getah virus, Highlands J virus Mayaro virus, Middelburg virus, Mosso das Pedras virus (78V3531, Mucambo virus, Ndumu virus, O'nyong-nyong virus, Pixuna virus, Rio Negro virus, Ross River virus, Salmon pancreas disease virus, Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus, Southern elephant seal virus, Tonate virus, Trocara virus, Una virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Whataroa virus, as well as any as yet undiscovered virus subsequently classified as a member of the Alpaviridae. Similarly, the results of Example 18 demonstrate that squalamine has direct antiviral activity against Dengue, a non-enveloped RNA virus of the flavivirus family. Because of the similarity in the properties shared by the flavivirus family, in addition to Yellow Fever and Dengue, squalamine would be expected to be active against Hepatitis C, West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis, Tick borne Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Murray Valley Encephalitis, Kyasanur Fever, and any novel as yet undiscovered virus classified as a member of the Flaviviridae.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0160">Moreover, the results of Example 19 demonstrate that squalamine can exert antiviral activity against a human Hepatitis B virus infection of human liver. The experiment demonstrates that squalamine can inhibit the early phase of infection as well as the production of virus of cells already infected. These data support the use of squalamine for the treatment of acute and chronic viral hepatitis caused by Hepatitis B. In addition, the results of Example 20 demonstrate that squalamine can exert antiviral activity against a human Hepatitis Delta virus infection of human liver. These data support the use of squalamine for the treatment of acute and chronic viral hepatitis caused by Hepatitis Delta virus. Since Hepatitis B and D frequently co-infect the same individual, these data would support use of squalamine for the treatment of both infections concurrently. The results of Example 20 also demonstrate that squalamine inhibits the replication of both Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis D virus in primary human hepatocytes, two viruses that differ in their structure, mode of entry, and replicative biology, a result anticipated by the proposed antiviral mechanism of squalamine. These results strongly suggest that squalamine should be effective against other viral infections of the human liver caused by the common Hepatitis viruses: Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis E, Hepatitis F and Hepatitis G, and any other viral infection of the hepatocyte.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0161">Finally, the results of Example 21 demonstrate that squalamine inhibited HIV infection by about 50% at a concentration of 30 &#x3bc;g/ml compared with vehicle alone, with no evidence of toxicity apparent. At 20 &#x3bc;g/ml inhibition of about 20% was observed. These data support the use of squalamine for the treatment of HIV and other retroviral infections. In addition these data demonstrate that squalamine can block the infectivity of enveloped viruses that enter cells via a pH independent fusion process. Thus, these data support the use of squalamine in the treatment of viral infections caused by viruses such as the retroviridae and the paramyxoviridae, including: Newcastle disease virus, Hendravirus, Nipah virus, measles virus, Rinderpest virus, Canine distemper virus, Sendai virus, Human parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4, mumps virus, Menangle virus, Tioman virus, Tuhokovirus 1,2,3, Human respiratory syncytial virus, avian pneumovirus, human metapneumovirus; viruses such as the picornaviridae, including: Human enterovirus A,B,C,D, Human rhinovirus A,B,C, Encephalomyocarditis virus, Theilovirus, Foot and mouth virus, Equine rhinitis A virus, Bovine Rhinitis B virus, Hepatitis A virus, Human Parechovirus, Ljungan virus, Aichi virus, Teschovirus, Sapeloviris, Senecavirus, Tremovirus, Aviheptovirus; viruses such as the rotoviridae, including: rotavirus A,B,C,D,E; viruses such as the papovaviridae.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0162">In another embodiment of the invention, the condition to be treated is a chronic disease suspected to be of viral origin. For example, the condition to be treated can be multiple sclerosis, Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathies, Kawaski disease, aplastic anemia, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0163">In another embodiment of the invention, combination methods of treating or preventing a viral infection are described. The combination methods comprise: (1) administering a therapeutically effective amount of squalamine, a derivative, a squalamine isomer or prodrug, or a pharmaceutically equivalent salt thereof to a subject in need; and (2) administering a conventional antiviral drug. The squalamine composition and conventional antiviral drug can be administered sequentially or simultaneously. If squalamine or a conventional antiviral drug are administered sequentially, either squalamine or the conventional antiviral drug can be administered first.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0164">1. Aminosterol's Proposed Mechanism for Treating and Preventing Viral Infections</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0165">To date, a hypothesis that explains the diversity of the aminosterol squalamine's effects has not been reported. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the inventor believes that squalamine exerts its effects by interrupting a key step in the pathways involved in actin dynamics, which it achieves by an unprecedented mechanism. Squalamine does so by integrating in the cellular membrane, profoundly altering the overall charge of that membrane, and causing displacement of key proteins bound to the membrane through electrostatic interactions and required for actin remodeling to occur. Thus, upon entry into a cell, squalamine profoundly alters the behavior of the circuitry involved in control of the actin cytoskeleton. Most viruses must exert control over the actin cytoskeleton to gain entry into the cell they target. This alteration by squalamine effectively &#x201c;closes the door&#x201d; to viral entry into the cell. This is because a substance that interrupts the actin remodeling circuitry of a target cell utilized by a virus for infection makes the cell &#x201c;resistant&#x201d; so long as the disruptive effects persist.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0166">The basic mechanism of action of squalamine should be operative in any cell into which squalamine can gain entry. Thus, squalamine can prevent viral infection of any cell into which squalamine can gain entry. Moreover, because of the broad tissue distribution of squalamine, the compound can alter the virulence of a virus by interfering with its infectivity of any number of tissues in the animal, a &#x201c;whole animal&#x201d; effect that might be missed in a simple cellular screen. Indeed, squalamine represents a class of antiviral that achieves its therapeutic effect by creating a state of viral resistance within the treated animal, rather than by directly targeting a viral enzyme or protein. During this period of squalamine resistance, viral particles, unable to infect tissues, would be cleared and destroyed by the cellular mechanisms that are normally engaged to dispose of particles of their size and composition (i.e., phagocytic destruction by neutrophils, macrophages, and the reticuloendothelial system). Furthermore, as a consequence of the mechanism proposed for the antiviral activity of squalamine, which involves inhibition of cellular circuitry used by viruses to remodel the actin cytoskeleton to permit invasion, squalamine would be expected to exhibit a very broad spectrum of activity, covering viruses of all classes, regardless of their genome composition (RNA vs DNA viruses).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0167">In the case of squalamine, the &#x201c;resistance&#x201d; state should last as long as the compound persists in circulation, that being several hours. Based on the known pharmacokinetics of squalamine in rodents, dogs and humans, following administration the compound should rapidly gain entry to a wide range of cells, remain in intracellular sites for between minutes to hours, and eventually traffic out of the cell, unmetabolized, re-entering the circulation, to then be transported into the hepatocyte via its basolateral surface, passage through the cell and subsequently transported from the apical surface of the hepatocyte into the biliary tract.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> show the physical changes in cell structure upon exposure to squalamine. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a picture of a cell before exposure to squalamine. The net negative charge at the cell surface is clearly depicted. After exposure to squalamine, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, squalamine integrates into the cellular membrane, profoundly altering the overall charge of that membrane, and causing displacement of key proteins bound to the membrane through electrostatic interactions and required for actin remodeling to occur. It is this change in the cell structure which inhibits viral infection of the cell. Specifically, viruses seek the negatively charged cell surface as a &#x201c;gateway&#x201d; to the cell for infection. Squalamine effectively closes the gateway by changing the charge and structure of the cell membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0169">Lack of Resistance: Antiviral drug resistance is a significant problem encountered with treating and preventing viral infections. Antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that the antiviral drug is less effective in treating or preventing illnesses caused by the virus. Virally encoded drug resistance has been documented against nearly all compounds with antiviral activity. Drug resistance is defined as a reduced susceptibility to a drug in a laboratory culture system and is expressed as an altered IC<sub>50 </sub>or IC<sub>90 </sub>(drug concentration required to inhibit viral growth by 50% or 90% respectively). This is termed the phenotype. This phenotype is determined by specific mutations in the viral genome (the genotype), which leads to alterations in the viral target protein (for example, HIV reverse transcriptase) or the viral drug activator (for example, herpes simplex thymidine kinase). The high rate of replication of some viruses determines that many of these genetic variants will already exist in untreated infected people. This is consequent on an inherent error rate of viral polymerases, especially for RNA viruses such as HIV and influenza, which replicate the viral genome. A wide range of viral variants, including those with mutations associated with drug resistance, will therefore be present. This collection of variants in one person is termed the viral quasispecies, with the &#x201c;fittest&#x201d; virus representing the majority population. The use of an antiviral drug will provide a selective pressure for the preferential growth of variants with a reduced susceptibility to drugs in accordance with Darwinian evolutionary principles. The emergent drug resistant virus will be the fittest in the presence of drug. Some drug resistant viruses, however, seem not to replicate as well as wild type virus (in the absence of drug). In some cases, multiple mutations are required for the development of high level resistance, and insufficient suppression of viral replication by antiviral drugs will predispose to their sequential acquisition.

<p id="p-0163" num="0170">In contrast to traditional antiviral therapies, viruses are not expected to develop resistance to squalamine. This is because unlike conventional antiviral therapies, squalamine does not act upon a single mechanism by which a virus infects a cell. Rather, squalamine changes the cell structure for a period of time during which the virus cannot infect the cell. In contrast, certain anti-HIV drugs target the CD4 receptor and other antiviral drugs target inhibition of replication. Viral variants can circumvent each of these targeted antiviral therapies. In one embodiment of the invention, squalamine does not demonstrate an altered IC<sub>50 </sub>or IC<sub>90 </sub>(drug concentration required to inhibit viral growth by 50% or 90% respectively) over time. In other embodiments of the invention, squalamine demonstrates an IC<sub>50 </sub>or IC<sub>90 </sub>which does not increase by more than 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 25%, or 30% over time. In other embodiments of the invention, the time period over which the change in IC<sub>50 </sub>or IC<sub>90 </sub>(or lack thereof) is measured is 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month, 1.5 months, 2 months, 2.5 months, 3 months, 3.5 months, 4 months, 4.5 months, 5 months, 5.5 months, 6 months, 6.5 months, 7 months, 7.5 months, 8 months, 8.5 months, 9 months, 9.5 months, 10 months, 10.5 months, 11 months, 11.5 months, 12 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years, 2.5 years, 3 years, 3.5 years, 4 years, 4.5 years, or 5 years.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0171">Toxicity: Conventional antiviral agents are generally designed to target viral specific enzymes, such as RNA and DNA polymerases, proteases, or glycosidases; and as a consequence the drug inhibits the activity of the viral enzyme to a far greater extent than it does to analogous human enzymes, required for normal cellular functioning. In many instances toxicity develops as a consequence of the residual activity of the agent towards the analogous enzymes of the host. The experience collected to date involving the administration of squalamine to humans suggests that the compound has an acceptable therapeutic index, a property that further enhances the utility of the invention disclosed herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0182" num="0189">This example evaluated whether an organic phosphate ester could complex with squalamine to generate a weakly soluble salt. Certain organic phosphate esters, such as glycerol-2-phosphate appear to form weakly soluble salts with squalamine, while others such as Glucose-6-phosphate do not. This difference is likely due to the degree of steric hindrance imposed by the organic moiety on electrostatic interactions between the cationic amino groups of the polyamine tail of squalamine and the anionic oxygens of the phosphate.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0190">To determine the approximate molar ratios of squalamine and phosphate that comprise the weakly soluble salt, 50 mg of squalamine (&#x201c;active&#x201d;) (80 micromoles) lyophilized in vials was dissolved in 3 ml of water. Sodium phosphate (1M, pH 7.7) was added to each vial to 10 mM, 25 mM, 35 mM, and 50 mM, corresponding to 30, 75, 105, and 150 micromoles Phosphate. Samples containing 30 and 75 micromoles of phosphate were milky and turbid, while those containing 105 and 150 formed heavy flocculent precipitates. Thus, the poorly soluble complex formed between 75 and 105 micromoles of phosphate.</p>

<p id="p-0201" num="0208">Plasma concentrations of inorganic phosphate in man and other mammals are about 1 mM. Since a comparable concentration of free inorganic phosphate would be expected within the extravascular compartment of human tissues, such as muscle or subcutaneous tissue, which are the sites of administration of a suspension of squalamine phosphate, it can predicted by these principles of solubility that the free concentration of squalamine in the immediate vicinity of a dissolving suspension of squalamine phosphate, in the setting of human or mammalian tissue, would be about 1.0 micrograms/ml. This amount is well below the concentration of free squalamine that causes non-specific membrane damage.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0209">Furthermore, administering squalamine phosphate as a suspension in a phosphate containing solution will necessarily reduce the rate of dissolution of the administered squalamine phosphate and reduce the free concentration of squalamine inversely with the concentration of phosphate present in that formulation. Hence, both the rate of dissolution of the suspension and the free concentration of squalamine emanating from the suspended squalamine phosphate can be reduced by increasing the phosphate concentration of the solution used to suspend the squalamine phosphate.</p>

<heading id="h-0031" level="1">Example 11</heading>
<p id="p-0203" num="0210">A study was conducted in hamsters to demonstrate the reduction in toxicity associated with the disclosed invention of squalamine phosphate as a preferred salt form for administration of squalamine.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0211">Squalamine was administrated subcutaneously to Syrian hamsters (about 110 grams) at a total daily dose of 60, 30, or 15 mg/kg/d for once daily for seven days. In one cohort, squalamine lactate was administered at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 5% dextrose. In the other group, the 10 mg/ml squalamine lactate solution in 5% dextrose was adjusted to 50 mM sodium phosphate by the addition of 1M sodium phosphate, creating a turbid suspension, that was used for dosing.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0212">Immediately following subcutaneous administration, animals receiving the squalamine lactate solution exhibited signs of physical discomfort. In contrast, the responses of the animals to administration of squalamine phosphate were identical to those observed following administration of the vehicle buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate in 5% dextrose).</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0213">As evident in the results shown in Table 3, below, subcutaneous dosing of squalamine lactate at a concentration of 10 mg/ml caused severe soft tissue lesions at the sites of administration, as recorded 7 days post injection.

<heading id="h-0032" level="1">Subcutaneous Administration of Squalamine Phosphate in Man is Associated with Markedly Reduced Pain and Local Irritation as Compared to Comparable Dosing of a Solution of Squalamine Lactate</heading>
<heading id="h-0033" level="1">Example 12</heading>
<p id="p-0208" num="0215">A 10 mg/ml solution of squalamine lactate was prepared in 5% dextrose. A squalamine phosphate suspension was prepared by adjusting the 10 mg/ml squalamine lactate solution to 50 mM phosphate by addition of 1M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. 0.1 ml of each preparation was then separately injected into the subcutaneous space between the thumb and second finger of a healthy human subject with a syringe bearing a 26 gauge needle. Within seconds of injection of the squalamine lactate solution, the subject experienced an intense stinging sensation not unlike an insect sting. This sensation persisted for about 20 minutes. Over the course of the following 24 hours the site became tender, swollen, and visibly red. These signs and symptoms persisted for about 1 week, gradually diminishing in intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0216">In contrast, injection of the squalamine phosphate suspension was associated with no pain other than that produced by the needle prick. The site remained free of visible signs of irritation, save for a slight swelling that persisted for about 1 week.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0217">Thus, it is clear that administration of squalamine as a phosphate salt is associated with significantly less local toxicity upon subcutaneous delivery into a human subject as compared to administration of a non-salt form of squalamine, such as squalamine lactate.</p>

<p id="p-0211" num="0218">The purpose of this example was to determine if squalamine administered in phosphate suspension in vivo retained the efficacy observed with non-phosphate based squalamine formulations. The evaluation was demonstrated in a hamster model of yellow fever.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0219">Materials and Methods</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0220">Animals: Female Syrian golden hamsters with an average weight of 110 g were used after a quarantine period of greater than 48 h. Animals were randomly assigned to cages and individually marked with eartags.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0221">Facilities: Experiments were conducted in the biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) animal suite at the Utah State University Laboratory Animal Research Center (LARC). All personnel continue to receive special training on blood-borne pathogen handling by this university's Environmental Health and Safety Office. Standard operating procedures for BSL-3 were used.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0222">Test article: Squalamine was prepared in a 5% dextrose solution (D5W), adjusted to a concentration of 10 mg/ml to yield &#x201c;squalamine lactate solution,&#x201d; and then adjusted to 50 mM sodium phosphate by addition of 1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, to yield &#x201c;squalamine phosphate suspension.&#x201d; Ribavirin was provided by ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, Calif.), and was prepared in sterile saline. Compounds in solution were prepared just prior to initial administration and stored at 4&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0223">Virus: Jimenez, a hamster-adapted YFV strain, was obtained as a generous gift from Robert B. Tesh (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Tex.). The virus was inoculated into 5 adult female hamsters. The livers of the infected hamsters were removed 3 days post virus injection, and homogenized in a 2&#xd7; volume of sterile PBS. This liver homogenate had a titer of 10<sup>6.0 </sup>50% cell cultures infectious doses/ml (CCID<sub>50</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0224">Experimental design: Hamsters were randomly assigned to groups, with 10 included in each and 20 placebo-treated controls. A 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>dilution (10<sup>2.0 </sup>CCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) of the virus was prepared in minimal essential media. Hamsters were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.1 ml of the diluted virus (10 CCID<sub>50</sub>/animal). Squalamine was administrated subcutaneously at a total daily dose of 15 mg/kg/day given qd beginning &#x2212;24 h and ending on 6 days post inoculation. Ribavirin was administered i.p. at a dose of 50 mg/kg/d administered bid X 7 days beginning &#x2212;4 h. Mortality was observed daily for 21 days, and weight was recorded on 0, 3, and 6 dpi. Evaluation of squalamine lactate and squalamine phosphate were conducted as 2 independent complete studies, utilizing placebos and positive controls.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0225">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, animals receiving squalamine phosphate achieved about 70% survival by day 12 vs 35% for placebo.

<p id="p-0221" num="0228">The purpose of this example was to evaluate the effectiveness of the squalamine phosphate formulation, administered subcutaneously, in treating a viral infection, such as Yellow Fever, in a head-to-head comparison with ribavirin, over a comparable dosing schedule. Ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue that is effective in the hamster model when administered via an optimized dosing schedule. Ribavirin is used as an antiviral therapeutic in humans, mainly for the treatment of Hepatitis C, in conjunction with Interferon-&#x3b1;.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0229">Experimental design: Hamsters were randomly assigned to groups, with 10 included in each and 20 placebo-treated controls. A 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>dilution (10<sup>2.0 </sup>CCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) of the virus was prepared in minimal essential media. Hamsters were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.1 ml of the diluted virus (10 CCID<sub>50</sub>/animal). Squalamine phosphate suspension was prepared by first dissolving 50 mg squalamine lactate into 3 ml of 5% dextrose, followed by the addition of 2 ml 40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The suspension was left to &#x201c;organize&#x201d; for several minutes and then was administrated subcutaneously (s.c.) at a total daily dose 15 mg/kg/d, given once a day (qd) beginning 24 h before introduction of virus and ending on 6 days post infection (dpi). Ribavirin was administered intraperitonealy (i.p.) at doses of 3. 2, 10, or 32 mg/kg/d administered once daily beginning 24 h before introduction of virus and ending on 6 days post infection (dpi). Mortality was observed daily for 21 days, and weight was recorded on 0, 3, and 6 dpi.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0230">Statistical analysis: Survival data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon log-rank survival analysis and all other statistical analyses were done using one-way ANOVA using a Bonferroni group comparison (Prism 5, GraphPad Software, Inc).</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0231">Results: Treatment with the squalamine phosphate formulation resulted in 70% survival compared with 15% of animals receiving vehicle alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). About 40% of the animals receiving ribavirin at the highest dose (32 mg/kg/day) survived, while those receiving lower doses fared no better than the placebo-treated cohort.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0232">These results illustrate the effectiveness of the squalamine phosphate formulation, the effectiveness of squalamine as an antiviral agent, and demonstrate that its antiviral activity in an animal is comparable to a well-studied antiviral agent currently in use as a human therapeutic drug against another flavivirus, Hepatitis C.</p>
<heading id="h-0037" level="1">Example 15</heading>
<p id="p-0226" num="0233">The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the efficacy of squalamine systemically administered as a phosphate formulation as an antiviral treatment in a setting where the viral infection, such as Yellow Fever, has already been established.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0234">Experimental design: Hamsters were randomly assigned to three groups, with 10 included in each and 20 placebo-treated controls. A 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>dilution (10<sup>2.0 </sup>CCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) of the virus was prepared in minimal essential media. Hamsters were injected into the peritoneum (i.p.) with 0.1 ml of the diluted virus (10 CCID<sub>50</sub>/animal). The squalamine phosphate formulation was prepared as described in example 14. Squalamine phosphate was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) at a total daily dose 15 mg/kg/d, given once a day (qd) beginning 24 h after introduction of virus and ending on 8 days post infection (dpi), 30 mg/kg/d, given once a day (qd) beginning 24 h after introduction of virus and ending on 8 days post infection (dpi), and 30 mg/kg/d, given once a day (qd) beginning 48 h after introduction of virus and ending on 9 days post infection (dpi). Mortality was observed daily for 21 days, and weight was recorded on 0, 3, and 6 dpi.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0235">Statistical analysis: Survival data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon log-rank survival analysis and all other statistical analyses were done using one-way ANOVA using a Bonferroni group comparison (Prism 5, GraphPad Software, Inc).</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0236">Results: (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) Whereas 100% of animals untreated died of Yellow Fever by day 11 post-infection, 60% of animals treated at 1 dpi with 15 mg/kg/day (s.c.) squalamine for 8 days survived and appeared to be cured as measured by continued survival through day 21. Similarly, 60% of animals treated at 1 dpi with 30 mg/kg/day appeared to have been cured as indicated by survival through day 21. Treatment remained effective even when dosing began on 2 dpi, with 40% of animals cured, when treated with squalamine at 30 mg/kg/day (s.c.) for 9 days.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0237">The results of this example demonstrate that squalamine can be utilized as an effective systemic antiviral therapy in already established viral infection when administered in the squalamine phosphate formulation disclosed in this application. Because of the similarity in the properties shared by the flavivirus family, in addition to Yellow Fever, squalamine could be used to treat infections caused other members of the Flaviviridae including: Dengue, Hepatitis C, West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis, Tick borne Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Murray Valley Encephalitis, Kyasanur Fever, and any novel as yet undiscovered virus classified as a member of the Flaviviridae.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0238">Yellow fever virus utilizes a pH dependent entry pathway to initiate infection. Based on the mechanism of action of squalamine and the efficacy of squalamine in the treatment of an established infection caused by Yellow fever, squalamine could be considered for the treatment of other infections caused by viruses that utilize a pH dependent entry pathway such as members of the Orthomyxoviridae including: Influenza A, B, C, Isavirus, Thogotovirus; members of the Rhabdomyoviridae, including: Vesiculovirus, Lyssavirus, Cytorhabdovirus, Nucleorhabdovirus, Novirhabdovirus; members of the Adenoviridae including: all Human Adenovirus types (1-55) and species (A-G,), Atadenovirus, Avidenovirus, Icthadenovirus, Mastadenovirus, Siadenovirus; members of the Parvoviridae; members of the Filoviridae; members of the Iridoviridae; and the Rubella virus.</p>
<heading id="h-0038" level="1">Example 16</heading>
<p id="p-0232" num="0239">The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the efficacy in an animal of systemically administered squalamine in the phosphate formulation disclosed in this application against a DNA virus. In this example mice have been infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a virus similar to CMV that infects humans.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0240">Experimental design: In this experiment mice were treated 24 hours prior to infection and treatment continued daily for 6 days post infection. Animals were sacrificed on days 3, 7, and 14, organs were harvested, and virus content determined by a standard viral plaque assay. 54 male Balb/c mice were inoculated into the peritoneum (i.p.) with 0.1 ml of a virulent strain of MCMV following a published protocol (Cavanaugh, Deng et al. 2003). 18 animals received 5% dextrose i.p., and served as controls; 18 received 10 mg/kg/day of squalamine i.p., as a 1 mg/ml solution in 5% dextrose; 18 received 10 mg/kg/day of squalamine phosphate prepared as described in Example 14. subcutaneously. On days 3, 7, and 14, 6 animals from each dosing cohort were randomly selected, euthanized and viral titers determined from the liver, spleen, lung, and submaxillary gland.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0241">Statistical analysis: Statistical analyses were done using one-way ANOVA using a Bonferroni group comparison or via Student's T test (Prism 5, GraphPad Software, Inc).</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0242">Results: (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) At day 3 a greater than 10-fold reduction in viral growth was observed in liver, spleen, and lung in animals that had received squalamine via the i.p. route, with little effect observed in the salivary gland. Between day 3 and 7, viral titers in spleen and liver fell about 10-fold in all groups, with the viral titers in the s.c. and i.p. groups significantly lower than in the control cohort; in contrast, viral titers increased between days 3 and 7 in the lungs and salivary glands, with no significant differences observed between groups. By day 14, 8 days after squalamine had stopped, virus was undetectable in the liver and spleen of animals that had received squalamine i.p., and was significantly reduced in the s.c. treatment group compared with controls. A trend toward reduction in viral titers in lung compared with control was observed in the i.p. treatment group.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0243">The results of this example demonstrate that squalamine systemically administered by either the intraperitoneal or subcutaneous routes, utilizing the phosphate formulation disclosed in this application, to an animal can effectively treat CMV infection and reduce viral titers to undetectable levels. Hence, squalamine can exhibit antiviral activity systemically against both RNA and DNA viruses.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0244">This experiment also demonstrates that squalamine is active against a member of the Herpes Virus family, and supports its use in infections caused by other members of the Herpes family, including Human cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex 1, Herpes Simplex 2, Epstein Barr Virus, Varicella Zoster Virus, Roseolovirus (HHV6 and HHV7), Kaposi's Sarcoma Associated Herpes Virus, Cercopithecine herpesvirus-1, Murine gammaherpesvirus-68, the Bovine Herpesviridae, the Canine Herpesviridae, the Equine Herpesviridae, the Feline Herpesviridae, the Duck Herpesviridae, the Chicken Herpesviridae, the Turkey Herpesviridae, Porcine Herpesviridae and any as yet undiscovered virus subsequently classified as a member of the Herpesviridae.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0245">This experiment also demonstrates, by virtue of the measured reduction in viral titers within the spleen, that squalamine administered systemically can effectively render virally resistant the cells of the spleen that support CMV infection, which include macrophages. This result supports the use of squalamine in the treatment of all viral diseases in which the macrophage is subject to infection.</p>
<heading id="h-0039" level="1">Example 17</heading>
<p id="p-0239" num="0246">The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the efficacy of systemically administered squalamine as the phosphate formulation against the Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus, an RNA virus of the alphavirus family.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0247">Experimental design: In this experiment hamsters (Syrian golden) were treated with either 5% dextrose (n=10, each species) or 10 mg/kg/day s.c. squalamine phosphate formulation (n=10), beginning 24 hours prior to infection with EEEV, administered s.c., following a published protocol (Paessler, Aguilar et al. 2004). Squalamine phosphate was prepared as described in Example 14. Treatments continued for 6 days after infection. Plasma viral titers were measured, along with body weights and survival.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0248">Statistical analysis: Survival data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon log-rank survival analysis and all other statistical analyses were done using one-way ANOVA using a Bonferroni group comparison, or via Student's T test (Prism 5, GraphPad Software, Inc).</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0249">Results: Squalamine administration as the phosphate formulation extended survival in the hamster cohort (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). At the end of treatment, 6/10 hamsters receiving squalamine were still alive, compared with 0/10 receiving vehicle. Concentration in the bloodstream of the hamster were determined (the mice were not studied since squalamine was ineffective). Plasma concentrations of virus were lower by about 100 fold in hamsters that had received squalamine compared with vehicle over the first 3 days post infection, confirming that squalamine has antiviral activity in an animal, likely the cause of improved survival (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). We assume that a more pronounced effect on viremia would be observed with administration of higher squalamine doses.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0250">The results of this example demonstrate that squalamine can effectively reduce the concentration of virus in an animal when administered systemically as the phosphate formulation disclosed in this application This experiment also demonstrates the activity of squalamine in treating an infection caused by a member of the Alphavirus family and supports its use in the treatment infection caused by other members of this family, including: Aura virus, Barmah Forest virus, Bebaru virus, Cabassou virus, Chikungunya virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Everglades virus, Fort Morgan virus, Getah virus, Highlands J virus Mayaro virus, Middelburg virus, Mosso das Pedras virus (78V3531, Mucambo virus, Ndumu virus, O'nyong-nyong virus, Pixuna virus, Rio Negro virus, Ross River virus, Salmon pancreas disease virus, Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus, Southern elephant seal virus, Tonate virus, Trocara virus, Una virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Whataroa virus, as well as any as yet undiscovered virus subsequently classified as a member of the Alpaviridae.</p>
<heading id="h-0040" level="1">Example 18</heading>
<p id="p-0244" num="0251">The purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate the antiviral effects of squalamine against Dengue. Dengue is a flavivirus, related to Yellow Fever Virus, and human Hepatitis C virus. The study was conducted in cell culture and utilized as substrate for infection a well studied line of human endothelial cells (HMEC-1) anticipated to be responsive to squalamine based on squalamine's known activity against endothelial cells.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0252">Experimental design: Cells were grown on uncoated glass cover-slips following a published protocol (Zamudio-Meza, Castillo-Alvarez et al. 2009). The cells were pretreated with squalamine for 2 hr at 37&#xb0; C. prior to viral exposure; virus (multiplicity of infection of 3) remained in contact with cells for 30 minutes at 4&#xb0; C., followed by 90 minutes at 37&#xb0; C. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium lacking virus and squalamine and maintained at 37&#xb0; C. for 48 hrs. Cells were fixed and processed for immunohistochemical detection of viral E protein. Viral E protein expression was used to monitor the early stages of infection.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0253">Results: Viral infection was markedly diminished at concentrations of about 40 &#x3bc;g/ml (80%), with almost 100% inhibition at 60 &#x3bc;g/ml and higher (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Cell viability was not diminished at the effective squalamine concentrations, based on morphology and appearance under phase contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0254">This experiment demonstrates that squalamine has direct antiviral activity against Dengue, a non-enveloped RNA virus of the flavivirus family. Because of the similarity in the properties shared by the flavivirus family, in addition to Yellow Fever and Dengue, squalamine would be expected to be active against Hepatitis C, West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis, Tick borne Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Murray Valley Encephalitis, Kyasanur Fever, and any novel as yet undiscovered virus classified as a member of the Flaviviridae.</p>
<heading id="h-0041" level="1">Example 19</heading>
<p id="p-0248" num="0255">The purpose of this experiment was to determine the antiviral activity of squalamine against human Hepatitis B virus. The experiment was conducted in vitro, using primary human hepatocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0256">Experimental design: Primary human hepatocytes were established in a 96 well microtiter plate. Squalamine was then added at concentrations of 2, 6 or 20 &#x3bc;g/ml followed by an inoculum of Hep B virus, and then in culture for 16 hours, after which fresh medium was introduced, and the cells maintained in culture for 14 days. In a second experiment, squalamine at 6 or 20 &#x3bc;g/ml was added to the cells at 24 hours post inoculation for a 16 hour exposure, followed by removal of medium, replacement with fresh medium, and continued culture for 14 days. Viral growth was measured by PCR using viral specific primers and normalized to the total RNA extracted from each corresponding well.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0257">Results: Squalamine effectively inhibited HepB viral replication in human primary hepatocytes when added either during the initial exposure of virus to the cells, or at 24 hours. At a concentration of 20 &#x3bc;g/ml squalamine inhibited viral production by 83% when added during initial stages of infection, and by 64% when added at 24 hours; at a concentration of 6 &#x3bc;g/ml squalamine inhibited viral production by 54% when added at the onset of infection, and by 30% when added at 24 hours; squalamine at 2 &#x3bc;g/ml, added only at the outset of infection, inhibited production by 14%.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0258">The experiment demonstrates that squalamine can exert antiviral activity against a human Hepatitis B virus infection of human liver. The experiment demonstrates that squalamine can inhibit the early phase of infection as well as the production of virus of cells already infected. These data support the use of squalamine for the treatment of acute and chronic viral hepatitis caused by Hepatitis B.</p>
<heading id="h-0042" level="1">Example 20</heading>
<p id="p-0252" num="0259">The purpose of this experiment was to determine the antiviral activity of squalamine against human Hepatitis Delta virus. HDV is a small circular RNA virus that causes hepatitis by itself or in conjunction with Hepatitis B virus. The experiment was conducted in vitro, using primary human hepatocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0260">Experimental design: Primary human hepatocytes were established in a 96 well microtiter plate. Squalamine was then added at concentrations of 20 or 60 &#x3bc;g/ml followed by an inoculum of Hep D virus, and then in culture for 3 hours, after which fresh medium was introduced, and the cells maintained in culture for 7 days. Viral growth was measured by PCR using viral specific primers and normalized to the total RNA extracted from each corresponding well.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0261">Results: Squalamine effectively inhibited Hepatitis Delta viral replication in human primary hepatocytes when added during the initial exposure of virus to the cells. At a concentration of 20 &#x3bc;g/ml squalamine inhibited viral production by 90% when added during initial stages of infection. The 60 &#x3bc;g/ml concentration proved to be cytotoxic in vitro.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0262">The experiment demonstrates that squalamine can exert antiviral activity against a human Hepatitis Delta virus infection of human liver. These data support the use of squalamine for the treatment of acute and chronic viral hepatitis caused by Hepatitis Delta virus. Since Hepatitis B and D frequently co-infect the same individual, these data would support use of squalamine for the treatment of both infections concurrently.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0263">Squalamine inhibits the replication of both Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis D virus in primary human hepatocytes, two viruses that differ in their structure, mode of entry, and replicative biology, a result anticipated by the proposed antiviral mechanism of squalamine. These results strongly suggest that squalamine should be effective against other viral infections of the human liver caused by the common Hepatitis viruses: Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis E, Hepatitis F and Hepatitis G, and any other viral infection of the hepatocyte.</p>
<heading id="h-0043" level="1">Example 21</heading>
<p id="p-0257" num="0264">The purpose of this experiment was to determine the antiviral activity of squalamine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0265">Experimental design: A line of HeLa cells is utilized that expresses the receptors and co-receptors required for the binding and entry of HIV, namely CXCR4, CD4 and CCR5. The HeLa line also has a luciferase reporter gene driven by the HIV-LTR so if infection occurs luciferase is expressed (Harmon, Campbell et al.). The amount of luciferase made is measured and serves as a measure of infection. The cells are plated and infected in the presence or absence of the squalamine. A strain of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that contains HIV genes required to activate the luciferase gene is utilized as a toxicity control, and should infect the cells equally well with or without the squalamine (unless squalamine also inhibits the infectivity of VSV). Once the cells are infected they incubate for at least 1 day (in the presence of the drug). The virus and drug are removed from the cells and then the cells are lysed with PBS+0.2% TritonX-100. Luciferase assays are done on the lysates to measure the level of infection.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0266">Results: Squalamine inhibited HIV infection by about 50% at a concentration of 30 &#x3bc;g/ml compared with vehicle alone, with no evidence of toxicity apparent. At 20 &#x3bc;g/ml inhibition of about 20% was observed.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0267">These data support the use of squalamine for the treatment of HIV and other retroviral infections. In addition these data demonstrate that squalamine can block the infectivity of enveloped viruses that enter cells via a pH independent fusion process. Thus, these data support the use of squalamine in the treatment of viral infections caused by viruses such as the retroviridae and the paramyxoviridae, including: Newcastle disease virus, Hendravirus, Nipah virus, measles virus, Rinderpest virus, Canine distemper virus, Sendai virus, Human parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4, mumps virus, Menangle virus, Tioman virus, Tuhokovirus 1,2,3, Human respiratory syncytial virus, avian pneumovirus, human metapneumovirus; viruses such as the picornaviridae, including: Human enterovirus A,B,C,D, Human rhinovirus A,B,C, Encephalomyocarditis virus, Theilovirus, Foot and mouth virus, Equine rhinitis A virus, Bovine Rhinitis B virus, Hepatitis A virus, Human Parechovirus, Ljungan virus, Aichi virus, Teschovirus, Sapeloviris, Senecavirus, Tremovirus, Aviheptovirus; viruses such as the rotoviridae, including: rotavirus A, B, C, D, E; viruses such as the papovaviridae.</p>

<heading id="h-0045" level="1">Example 22</heading>
<p id="p-0261" num="0268">100 mg of squalamine lactate (0.16 mmol) was dissolved in 1 ml water. 0.32 mmol of a 1M solution of glycrol-2-phosphate in water was added. A heavy precipitate formed. 0.5 volume of ethanol was added to begin the washing of the precipitate, and the precipitate was spun down. On microscopic examination the suspension consisted of needle-like crystals of about 0.5 microns in diameter, and varying in length from 1-100 microns. The precipitate was washed in absolute ethanol and dried as described in Example 4.</p>
<heading id="h-0046" level="1">Preparation of the Phosphate Salt of Other Aminosterols: Aminosterol 1436</heading>
<heading id="h-0047" level="1">Example 23</heading>
<p id="p-0262" num="0269">100 mg of Aminosterol 1436 lactate (0.16 mmol) was dissolved in 1 ml water. 0.48 mmol of a 1M sodium phosphate solution in water (pH 7.4) is added. A heavy precipitate formed. 0.5 volume of ethanol was added to begin the washing of the precipitate, and the precipitate was spun down. The precipitate was washed in absolute ethanol and dried.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0270">Since the salt is an electrostatic complex between the polyamine moiety and phosphate, any aminosterol containing a net positive charge due to the presence of free polyamine nitrogen can be transformed into a weakly soluble salt as disclosed in this invention. Thus, the invention is broadly applicable to squalamine and squalamine derivatives, as disclosed herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0048" level="1">Favorable and Unanticipated Solubility of the Disclosed Aminosterol Phosphate Suspension in the Presence of Serum Albumin</heading>
<heading id="h-0049" level="1">Example 24</heading>
<p id="p-0264" num="0271">A property of the squalamine phosphate formulation that is not evident is its rapid dissolution in the presence of serum albumin. This property can be demonstrated as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0272">Two solutions are prepared, one consisting of 0.9% NaCl, the other 0.9% NaCl with 30 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (the approximate concentration of albumin in human blood). 10 ml of each solution are added to separate test tubes. Into each solution a squalamine phosphate suspension (10 mg/ml, prepared as in Example 14) is added dropwise. Addition of the squalamine phosphate suspension to the test tube containing 0.9% NaCl yields a cloudy suspension, proportionally diluted by the larger volume. In contrast, addition of the squalamine phosphate suspension to the test tube containing 0.9% and serum albumin rapidly clarified to yield a clear solution, and remained clear even as the concentration of squalamine phosphate reached 1 mg/ml. Clarification takes place within several seconds following mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0273">This phenomenon can readily be explained as a consequence of the affinity of squalamine (and the other aminosterols) for serum albumin, and the resulting displacement of the equilibrium (consisting of the system of albumin, squalamine and phosphate) in favor of albumin bound squalamine. Thus, as a particle of squalamine phosphate dissociates into free squalamine and phosphate, the free squalamine molecule is bound by an albumin molecule, preventing its re-capture by a phosphate molecule. The concentration of free squalamine in this system will never exceed that established by the solubility properties expected for squalamine phosphate.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0274">The magnitude of the affinity of squalamine for serum albumin insures that the squalamine phosphate suspension will fully dissolve after parenteral administration, rather than remain particulate, even when dosed intravenously.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0275">The solubility properties of the aminosterol phosphate salts disclosed herein are uniquely poised in magnitude to provide utility as therapeutic formulations, sufficiently soluble to dissolve to achieve a therapeutic effect, but sufficiently insoluble to limit the free concentration of the aminosterol within a non-cytotoxic range.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0276">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the methods and compositions of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention, provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
