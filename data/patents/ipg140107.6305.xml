<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus and method for restricting the functions of a device are provided. A restriction monitoring system includes a communication system that provides a location-limited communication channel that detects whether a device entering a perimeter is in an area for device inspection, a server that provides a credential and a security policy to the device and receives a report on whether the device violates the security policy through the location-limited communication channel, and an alarm system which triggers a security alarm when the device violates the security policy.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methods and apparatuses consistent with the present invention relate to device function restricting methods and systems in specific perimeters. More particularly, the present invention relates to a device function restricting method and system in specific perimeters for preventing a user from unauthorized use of a device and information leakage, such as, if the user carries a device having a camera function and a memory function in specific perimeters where security is required, the system transmits a credential and a security policy to the device through a perimeter restriction channel and thus restricts a portion of the device functions based on the credential and the security policy.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, mobile devices such as mobile phones, personal data assistants (PDAs), and the like have become common. Most people use such mobile devices in order to communicate with other people through transferring media such as voice and images, video, and text image. Such activities through mobile devices are very useful for generating added value for users.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there are some places where the functions of such mobile devices should be restricted when such mobile devices are used. First, there are restricted areas for information security where information leakage must be prevented, such as in government agencies, military agencies, business agencies, and the like, where the handling of sensitive resources such as documents, prototype, and the like may occur. Second, there are restricted areas for moral purposes zoned for preventing the violation of others' privacy by use of certain features of a mobile device, such as photographing others in public shower facilities or for keeping individual activities such as enjoying shows in a concert hall or reading books in a library away from others' disturbance. Third, there are radioactive substance restriction areas zoned for protecting sensing equipment of airplanes and the like from interference caused by electromagnetic fields emitted from a mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meantime, some technologies use a device carrier to prohibit certain functions of a device in restricted perimeters. In this technology, classification is made into non-technical restrictions and technical limitations. The non-technical restrictions are applied differently from normal restrictions according to administrative, legal, ethical regulations, or the like, and a user can easily compromise with non-technical restrictions. In the case of the technical limitations, the technical limitations are directly or indirectly applied in diverse ways. For example, the interface unit of a device such as a camera, a wired interface unit, or the like is sealed with evidence tamper tape in order for the interface unit to be disabled. In addition, the use of a device is restrained by generation of artificial interference signals as wireless jamming signals. In addition, a survival system such as a camera and a sensor is used to monitor how the user follows the security policy. In addition, it has the use of the device removed by a request of the device carrier in order for some functions to be abandoned before the user enters a restriction (or referred to as location-limited) area.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, current technical limitations have a problem of hardly providing reliable blocking. Only the removal of mobile devices and the monitoring of mobile device users can effectively solve the problem. However, the removal activities of mobile devices from users can give rise to an additional physical problem. That is, the users may need their mobile devices for daily telephone calls to their homes, business meeting adjustments, or legitimate activities such as private communications.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, special technologies are required which temporarily disable some functions of a mobile device in specific perimeters.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view for schematically showing a configuration of a device function restricting system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The device function restricting system according to the present invention includes a monitoring system <b>110</b> and a device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The monitoring system <b>110</b> is located within a perimeter <b>101</b>, and provides a credential and a security policy to the device <b>120</b> to restrict some functions of the device <b>120</b>, and takes back the credential and the security policy from the device <b>120</b> upon repeal of the restriction of some functions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If the device <b>120</b> enters the perimeter <b>101</b> where security is required, the device <b>120</b> becomes imposed with restriction of some functions through communications with the monitoring system <b>110</b>. The device <b>120</b> can be a mobile communication terminal or a PDA, for example, which communicates via mobile communication networks.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The perimeter <b>101</b> has at least one entrance and one exit which are controlled by the monitoring system <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The monitoring system <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, has a configuration including a server <b>111</b>, alarm system <b>112</b>, and communication system <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The server <b>111</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, has a configuration including a processor <b>310</b>, system memory <b>320</b>, and input-output (I/O) system <b>330</b>. The server <b>111</b> executes software loaded in the system memory <b>320</b> and controlled by the processor <b>310</b>. The system memory <b>320</b> has a database containing a server policy <b>321</b> for using device resources, a server credential <b>322</b> generated for the device, and a reference state <b>323</b> of the device that has entered the perimeter. The server credential <b>322</b> contains a key, random challenge, or the like. The I/O system <b>330</b> performs data transmissions and receptions.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The alarm system <b>112</b> is used by the server <b>111</b> in order to report monitoring states different from a usual state to users of the monitoring system <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The communication system <b>113</b> supports communication processing through a location-limited communication channel between the server <b>111</b> and the device <b>120</b>, and has a configuration including a location-limited communication subsystem <b>201</b> and other communication subsystems <b>202</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If the device <b>120</b> is a mobile communication terminal, the location-limited communication channel is separated from a main communication link such as a mobile communication network, and has special security features against data transmissions beyond a short radio wave propagation distance.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The location-limited communication channel supports demonstrative identification, i.e., identification based on physical situations such as approach of a physical device. The best supporting communication technologies have inherent physical limitations on transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, the location-limited communication channel disables attackers from transmitting through the channel, or at least supports authenticity to transmit activities which are not detected by permitted participants.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The location-limited communication channel supporting demonstrative identification and authenticity includes, for example, a contact channel, infrared channel, near-field signaling across the body channel, sound and ultrasound channel, optical image exchange channel, short range wireless channel such as Zigbee and Bluetooth, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The location-limited communication subsystem <b>201</b> reports the monitoring state of the area for device inspection <b>130</b> to the server <b>111</b>. The location-limited communication channel is effective in the area for device inspection <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The other communication subsystems <b>202</b> provide other communication channels such as a wireless link, wired link, optical link, and the like, in order to transmit information between the server <b>111</b> and the device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Meantime, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the device <b>120</b> has a configuration including a processor <b>410</b>, system memory <b>420</b>, and I/O system <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The device <b>120</b> executes control software <b>421</b> loaded on the system memory <b>420</b> and controlled by the processor <b>410</b>. Further, the processor <b>410</b> can read other software out of the system memory <b>420</b> and execute pieces of software in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The system memory <b>420</b> of the device <b>120</b> contains a security policy <b>423</b> for using device resources, device credential <b>422</b> for a device, reference state <b>424</b> of a device that has entered a perimeter, and current state <b>425</b> of a device moved out of a perimeter. Further, the system memory <b>420</b> contains control software <b>421</b> that applies the device policy <b>423</b> to the device resources.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The I/O system <b>430</b> supports communications between the device <b>120</b> and the server <b>111</b>, and has a location-limited communication subsystem <b>431</b> and other communication subsystems <b>432</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the device resources are categorized into source resources <b>510</b> and sink resources <b>520</b>. The device resources <b>510</b> and <b>520</b> include hardware resources <b>511</b> and software resources <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The source resources <b>510</b> calculate information inside a device. For example, camera software calculates images, communication software sends information from a device to outside, and a user interface calculates input information.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The sink resources <b>520</b> consume the information acquired by the source resources <b>510</b>. For example, the main body of an external device receives information from the device, and the storage medium in the device stores the information.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, description will be made on the operations of the device function restricting system configured as above.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart for showing processing procedures of a device function restricting method.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The present invention operates the device <b>120</b> in three phases to detect unauthenticated usages of device functions.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first phase is a state of the device entering a perimeter, the second phase is a state of the device locating in the perimeter, and the third phase is a state of the device existing in an area for inspection within the perimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the first phase, the device <b>120</b> enters an area for device inspection <b>130</b>. At this time, the monitoring function of the device is in the enabled state (S<b>601</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The communication system <b>113</b> of the monitoring system <b>110</b> detects the existence of the device <b>120</b> in the area for device inspection <b>130</b>, and reports the result of detection to the server <b>111</b>. The server <b>111</b> generates a server credential <b>322</b>, stores the server credential in a database, and transmits the server credential <b>322</b> to the device <b>120</b> through the location-limited communication channel (S<b>602</b>). For example, the transmitted credential is not limited to the credential transmitted through a infrared channel, the images displayed on an optical output device such as a monitor, television set, or the like, modulated sound or ultrasound, local wireless link, and so on, including the location-limited communication channel.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Meantime, the device <b>120</b> receives the server credential <b>322</b> transmitted by the server <b>111</b> (S<b>603</b>). Next, the device <b>120</b> calculates an acknowledgement, using the server credential <b>322</b>, and transmits the calculated acknowledgement to the server <b>111</b> (S<b>604</b>). The acknowledgement calculations include credential processing, information addition, and calculations of encryption hash function such as SHA-1 or MD5. The device <b>120</b> transmits the acknowledgement to the server <b>111</b>. All the communications started from the step S<b>604</b> between the device <b>120</b> and the server <b>111</b> are performed through the location-limited communication channel or other communication channels.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The server <b>111</b> uses the server credential <b>322</b> generated in the step S<b>602</b> in order to calculate a local acknowledgement, and matches the local acknowledgement to the acknowledgement received from the device <b>120</b> (S<b>605</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the local acknowledgement is not matched to the received acknowledgement, the server <b>111</b> deletes the server credential <b>322</b> for the device stored in the database, and triggers a security alarm through the alarm system <b>112</b> (S<b>606</b>). The security alarm indicates that the device <b>120</b> has not received a valid server credential <b>422</b> from the server <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">However, if the local acknowledgement is matched to the received acknowledgement, the server <b>111</b> selects the device policy <b>423</b> for the device <b>120</b>, and transmits the selected device policy <b>423</b> to the device <b>120</b> (S<b>607</b>). The server <b>111</b> and the device <b>120</b> that have performed the step S<b>607</b> use the credential for information transformation security therebetween through a communication channel.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The device <b>120</b> receives the device policy <b>423</b> from the server <b>111</b>, and applies the device policy <b>423</b> to the source resources <b>510</b> through the control software <b>421</b> (S<b>608</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The application of the device policy <b>423</b> is that the control software <b>421</b> calculates a reference state <b>424</b> of the device <b>120</b> using the information on the state <b>530</b>, and transmits the calculated reference state <b>424</b> to the server <b>111</b> (S<b>609</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The reference state <b>424</b> of the device <b>120</b> shows such a state of the device <b>120</b> that the device policy <b>423</b> uses the source resources <b>510</b> to which all the device policy <b>423</b> is applied. For example, the calculations of such a state are to calculate a memory check code using a device integrity check technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The server <b>111</b> receives the reference state <b>424</b> from the device <b>120</b>, and registers the reference state <b>424</b> in the database (S<b>610</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, the device <b>120</b> and the server <b>111</b> enter the second phase.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The server <b>111</b> in this state waits for the device <b>120</b> existing in the perimeter <b>101</b> (S<b>611</b>), and the device processor <b>410</b> in the device <b>120</b> controls the use of source resources <b>510</b> through the control software <b>421</b> (S<b>612</b>). The control software <b>421</b> detects the use of the source resources <b>510</b>, and reports the content change of the state <b>530</b>. The state <b>530</b> reflects the response of the control software <b>421</b> to the fact that the source resources <b>510</b> have been used. Then, all the unauthenticated usages of the device <b>120</b> are recorded according to the change of the state <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Additionally, a variant of the control software <b>421</b> can transform the information from the source resources <b>510</b> before the variant is sent to the sink resources <b>520</b>. Special transformation of the information is defined according to the device policy <b>423</b>, and the transformation of the information from the source resources <b>510</b> is specified according to the device policy <b>423</b> as noticed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The sink resources <b>520</b> are provided in a transformed form. The examples including such transformations are not limited to the encryption with other information, substitution, information deletion (which does not provide any information to the source resources <b>520</b>), and the like. Then, the information is transformed from the source resources <b>510</b> to the sink resources <b>520</b> by the control software <b>421</b>, and the information leakage of the device <b>120</b> in the perimeter is prevented by the sink resource <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The device <b>120</b> and the server <b>111</b> stay in the second phase until the device <b>120</b> does not exist in the perimeter <b>101</b>. If the device <b>120</b> moves from the perimeter <b>101</b> to the area for device inspection <b>130</b>, the server <b>111</b> and the device <b>120</b> enter the third phase.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the third phase, the device <b>120</b> sends the device credential <b>422</b> to the server <b>111</b> (S<b>613</b>). The server <b>111</b> receives the device credential <b>422</b> from the device <b>120</b>, searches for the server credential <b>322</b> stored in the step S<b>602</b>, and matches the device credential <b>422</b> to the stored server credential <b>322</b> (S<b>614</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the two credentials are not matched, the server <b>111</b> triggers the security alarm through the alarm system <b>112</b> (S<b>615</b>). The security alarm indicates that the device <b>120</b> has provided a failed credential <b>422</b> to the server <b>111</b>. However, if the two credentials are matched, the server waits for a device execution state <b>425</b> from the device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The device <b>120</b> calculates the device execution state <b>425</b>, using the information on the state <b>530</b>, and transmits the calculated device execution state <b>425</b> to the server <b>111</b> (S<b>616</b>). The device <b>120</b> uses a simple method to calculate the device execution state <b>425</b> as in the step S<b>609</b>. If the device violates the device policy <b>423</b>, the control software <b>421</b> changes the state <b>530</b>. Then, the calculation result of the device execution state <b>425</b> becomes different from the initial reference state <b>424</b> calculated when the device <b>120</b> does not violate the device policy <b>423</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The server <b>111</b> searches the database for the reference state <b>323</b> of the device <b>120</b> which has been stored in step S<b>610</b>, and matches the device execution state <b>425</b> to the reference state <b>323</b>. If the two states are not matched, the server <b>111</b> triggers a security alarm through the alarm system <b>112</b> (S<b>618</b>). The security alarm indicates that the device <b>120</b> has been used in the unauthenticated manner, violating the device policy <b>423</b>.</p>
