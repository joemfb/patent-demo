The present invention can be worn as a visor, or it can be opened up and wrapped over the top of the head to form the shape of a more traditional hat.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Headgear such as hats, caps and bandanas are necessary in sunny weather to protect a user from the deleterious effects of excessive sunlight. The number of types and styles of headgear available is nearly unlimited, yet there is always room for a new style of headgear that embodies the user's style preferences while offering protection from the sun.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention joins together a conventional visor bill and a conventional piece of cloth in an unconventional manner to create an unconventional type of headgear. The present invention is comprised of a visor bill attached to a square piece of cloth along the cloth's diagonal and slightly below the cloth's center. The present invention can be worn like a visor, or can be opened up and wrapped over the top of the head to look like a more traditional hat.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 2,859,448 is for &#x201c;Article of Headwear&#x201d; issued to Gaichel on Apr. 30, 1956. Gaichel employs a visor in combination with a scarf in order to &#x201c;provide a head covering for holding the hair in place and also a sun shield for protecting the face and eyes of the wearer.&#x201d; Unlike the present invention, Gaichel employs a visor that clips to a scarf by means of gripping members so that a user may alternate what scarves are used in conjunction with the visor, whereas the present invention envisions a section of cloth that is stitched or otherwise permanently attached to the visor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,127 is for &#x201c;Combined Bandana and Visor Headwear&#x201d; issued to Bezanis on Aug. 6, 1996. Bezanis has as one of its objectives &#x201c;to provide an article of headwear which provides the aesthetic appeal of a bandana with the functional advantages of a baseball type cap.&#x201d; Bezanis is described as &#x201c;a visor brim in the form of a bill, a self-supporting upstanding crown, and a triangular bandana cloth,&#x201d; and as basically comprising &#x201c;a visor brim, a crown, and a bandana cloth.&#x201d; Bezanis differs from the present invention, in that Bezanis employs a visor, a crown piece, and a bandana attached to the crown piece, whereas the present invention is a visor and cloth, with the cloth stitched to the visor itself.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Design Pat. No. Des. 419,750 is for a &#x201c;Combined Sun Visor and Bandana&#x201d; issued to Bazin on Feb. 1, 2000. Bazin &#x201c;consists of a sun visor, and more particularly, to the combination of a sun visor and bandana or other style of headband, and an attachment mechanism for releasably securing the bandana to the visor.&#x201d; Unlike the present invention, Bazin's bandana is detachable from the visor, whereas the present invention envisions a piece of cloth that is stitched or otherwise permanently attached to the visor.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention is a visored cloth headgear. A conventional visor bill (<b>10</b>) is inserted into a pocket-shaped visor bill cover (<b>20</b>) (herein referred to as &#x201c;visor bill cover&#x201d;) which is then stitched to a main headgear cloth (<b>30</b>) (herein referred to as &#x201c;cloth&#x201d;) along the diagonal and slightly below the center of the cloth (<b>30</b>). The present invention can be worn like a visor, or it can be opened up and wrapped over the top of the head to look like a more traditional hat.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The materials and components mentioned in the figures below are as follows: a conventional plastic visor bill (<b>10</b>) with an approximate thickness of 5 millimeters; a cloth (<b>30</b>), sized two feet by two feet; a visor bill cover (<b>20</b>) into which the visor bill (<b>10</b>) is inserted and stitched; a top lip (<b>63</b>) and bottom lip (<b>66</b>) of cloth material on the visor bill cover (<b>20</b>); a slit (<b>67</b>) on the cloth (<b>30</b>) that is the point of attachment for the visor bill cover (<b>20</b>); stitching (<b>40</b>) made by conventional thread; a first style (<b>96</b>), a second style (<b>97</b>), and a third style (<b>98</b>) of the present invention; and a tie (<b>85</b>) formed from the cloth (<b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart showing the initial steps of constructing the present invention. A conventional logo or pattern is pre-printed or embroidered on the visor bill cover and cloth of the present invention (<b>100</b>). Stitching is placed along the edges of the visor bill cover and cloth to prevent unraveling (<b>110</b>). The visor bill is trimmed to a curved shape with two arcs (<b>120</b>), and the visor bill cover is shaped leaving an extra inch or so around its edges (<b>130</b>). The shape of the visor bill is then traced onto the visor bill cover in order to make guidelines for stitching (<b>140</b>), and a stitched edge is made to form a front radius (<b>150</b>). Excess material is trimmed off the stitched edge of the visor bill cover (<b>160</b>), which is then turned inside out (<b>170</b>) in order to receive the insertion of the visor bill (<b>180</b>). The open end of the visor bill cover is then stitched so as to enclose the visor bill, with a top lip and a bottom lip of cloth material left remaining at the edge of the visor bill cover (<b>190</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates step (<b>190</b>) of the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The visor bill cover (<b>20</b>) is stitched to hold the visor bill (<b>10</b>) (shown in silhouette), with a top lip (<b>63</b>) and a bottom lip (<b>66</b>) of cloth material left remaining on the visor bill cover (<b>20</b>). The stitching (<b>40</b>) is visible where the visor bill cover (<b>20</b>) was stitched to enclose the visor bill (<b>10</b>) (shown in silhouette).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a continuation of the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, showing the concluding steps of constructing the present invention. The cloth is turned on a 45 degree angle to form a diamond shape (<b>200</b>) and a first imaginary line is drawn along the diagonal of the cloth from its rightmost point to its leftmost point (<b>210</b>). One inch below this first imaginary line, a second imaginary line is drawn parallel to it from edge to edge of the cloth (<b>220</b>). On this second imaginary line, a slit is cut that is the length of the visor bill cover (<b>230</b>). The top lip of material on the visor bill cover is stitched to the top portion of the slit (<b>240</b>), and the bottom lip of material on the visor bill cover is stitched to the bottom portion of the slit (<b>250</b>), so that the visor bill cover is attached to the cloth offset from the center of the cloth. The present invention can now be formed into three styles, a first style, a second style and a third style. Preliminary to forming these styles, the cloth is folded so that it is divided into uppermost and lowermost triangles that are laid on top of each other, with the visor bill cover attached to the lower edge of each of the triangles. (One of the triangles will be larger than the other because the visor bill cover is attached to the cloth one inch off center.) (<b>270</b>) Descriptions of the forming of the three styles are as follows. The first style is created by folding both the uppermost and lowermost triangles in one inch to 1&#xbd; inch wide folds from the tops of the triangles down to the lower edges where the visor bill cover is attached (<b>280</b>). The folded material is then wrapped around the user's head and tied in the back like a bandana (<b>290</b>). (This style is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.) The second style is created by folding only the lowermost triangle in one inch to 1&#xbd; inch wide folds from the top point of the lowermost triangle down to the lower edge where the visor bill cover is attached (<b>300</b>). The folded material is then wrapped around the user's head, with the uppermost triangle pushed over the user's head, and tied in the back like a bandana (<b>310</b>). (This style is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.) The third style is created by folding only the uppermost triangle in one inch to 1&#xbd; inch wide folds from the top point of the uppermost triangle down to the lower edge where the visor bill cover is attached (<b>320</b>). The folded material is then wrapped around the user's head, with the lowermost triangle pushed up underneath the folded material and over the user's head, and tied in the back like a bandana (<b>330</b>). (This style is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.)</p>

The visor bill cover (<b>20</b>) is shown attached to the cloth (<b>30</b>) by means of stitching (<b>40</b>) that attaches the bottom lip (<b>66</b>) of cloth material on the visor bill cover (<b>20</b>) to the cloth (<b>30</b>) at the bottom portion of the slit (<b>67</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates step (<b>290</b>) of the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, showing an illustration of the present invention formed in its first style (<b>96</b>). In the first style (<b>96</b>), the uppermost and lowermost triangles of the cloth (<b>30</b>) are folded and wrapped around the user's head, and secured into a tie (<b>85</b>) at the back of the user's head, leaving the top portion of the user's head exposed. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is the visor bill cover (<b>20</b>) attached to the cloth (<b>30</b>).</p>
