<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to microscale fluid handling devices and systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and system for controlling liquid flow in a microchannel by the introduction of a gas bubble to a microfluidic system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the chemical, biomedical, bioscience and pharmaceutical industries, it has become increasingly desirable to perform large numbers of chemical operations, such as reactions, separations and subsequent detection steps, in a highly parallel fashion. The high throughput synthesis, screening and analysis of (bio)chemical compounds, enables the economic discovery of new drugs and drug candidates, and the implementation of sophisticated medical diagnostic equipment. Of key importance for the improvement of the chemical operations required in these applications are an increased speed, enhanced reproducibility, decreased consumption of expensive samples and reagents, and the reduction of waste materials.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Microfluidic devices and systems provide improved methods of performing chemical, biochemical and biological analysis and synthesis. Microfluidic devices and systems allow for the performance of multi-step, multi-species chemical operations in chip-based micro chemical analysis systems. Chip-based microfluidic systems generally comprise conventional &#x2018;microfluidic&#x2019; elements, particularly capable of handling and analyzing chemical and biological specimens. Typically, the term microfluidic in the art refers to systems or devices having a network of processing nodes, chambers and reservoirs connected by channels, in which the channels have typical cross-sectional dimensions in the range between about 1.0 &#x3bc;m and about 500 &#x3bc;m. In the art, channels having these cross-sectional dimensions are referred to as &#x2018;microchannels&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">By performing the chemical operations in a microfluidic system, potentially a number of the above-mentioned desirable improvements can be realized. Downscaling dimensions allows for diffusional processes, such as heating, cooling and passive transport of species (diffusional mass-transport), to proceed faster. One example is the thermal processing of liquids, which is typically a required step in chemical synthesis and analysis. In comparison with the heating and cooling of liquids in beakers as performed in a conventional laboratory setting, the thermal processing of liquids is accelerated in a microchannel due to reduced diffusional distances. Another example of the efficiency of microfluidic systems is the mixing of dissolved species in a liquid, a process that is also diffusion limited. Downscaling the typical dimensions of the mixing chamber thereby reduces the typical distance to be overcome by diffusional mass-transport, and consequently results in a reduction of mixing times. Like thermal processing, the mixing of dissolved chemical species, such as reagents, with a sample or precursors for a synthesis step, is an operation that is required in virtually all chemical synthesis and analysis processes. Therefore, the ability to reduce the time involved in mixing provides significant advantages to most chemical synthesis and analysis processes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another aspect of the reduction of dimensions is the reduction of required volumes of sample, reagents, precursors and other often very expensive chemical substances. Milliliter-sized systems typically require milliliter volumes of these substances, while microliter sized microfluidic systems only require microliters volumes. The ability to perform these processes using smaller volumes results in significant cost savings, allowing the economic operation of chemical synthesis and analysis operations. As a consequence of the reduced volume requirement, the amount of chemical waste produced during the chemical operations is correspondingly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In microfluidic systems, regulation of minute fluid flows through a microchannel is of prime importance, as the processes performed in these systems highly depend on the delivery and movement of various liquids such as sample and reagents. A flow control device may be used to regulate the flow of liquid through a microchannel. Regulation includes control of flow rate, impeding of flow, switching of flows between various input channels and output channels as well as volumetric dosing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 6,062,681 describes a bubble valve for a liquid flow channel in which the flow of a liquid is controlled by the generation of a gas bubble in the channel using a heater placed in the liquid. As the heater is activated, a bubble is formed which can be enlarged or reduced in size by increasing or decreasing, respectively, the temperature of the heater. The described system presents a number of disadvantages, namely, the required power to operate the valve and the inherent requirement that liquid in the channel be heated upon passing the valve. Even small increases in liquid temperature, by only a couple of degrees, can have disastrous effects on the highly heat sensitive biochemical substances present in the liquids to be controlled in many microfluidic systems. In addition, the required on-chip electric circuitry for the heater increases the complexity of the described valve and consequently results in unacceptably high costs, particularly if the fluidic system employing the bubble valve only used for a single application.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other valves in the prior art use electrochemical means to produce a bubble in a liquid.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a bubble valve for controlling, regulating or varying fluid flow through a microfluidic system. The bubble valve regulates fluid flow through a channel using an externally operated mechanical or pneumatic actuator. The actuator causes a deflection of a fluid meniscus into the interior of the channel to regulate liquid flow. The actuator may mechanically force a gas bubble into a fluid carrying microchannel to inhibit liquid flow or to cause liquid flow by applying a sufficiently high pressure to the meniscus. The bubble valve effectively controls the flow of liquids in microfluidic systems, without heating the fluid and without complex on-chip circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The microfluidic system includes a microchannel and a sealed, gas-filled reservoir positioned adjacent to and connected to the microchannel. The gas filled reservoir has a movable wall and a meniscus formed by a liquid in the microchannel that forms an interface between the reservoir and the microchannel interior. The meniscus may form a portion of the side wall of the microchannel. An external mechanical actuator may be used to deflect the movable wall of the reservoir. As the movable wall is deflected, the volume of the reservoir decreases and the gas pressure inside the reservoir increases, causing the meniscus to deflect into the microchannel, thereby modifying the cross-sectional area of the microchannel and consequently varying the flow of liquid through the channel. The increased pressure in the reservoir pushes gas from the reservoir into the microchannel. The gas may result in a local gas bubble being forced into the microchannel from the gas-filled reservoir. The resulting gas bubble occupies a portion of the cross-section of the channel, allowing liquid flow through the channel to be effectively controlled by controlling the size of the gas bubble via the external actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The meniscus may comprise a virtual wall formed in a side wall of the microchannel. The virtual wall is a meniscus formed by a liquid in the microchannel that fills an aperture formed in the side wall of the microchannel and essentially replaces the removed portion of the side wall without affecting the properties of liquid flow through the channel. A gas bubble can be forced into the channel by applying a gas pressure at the opening using an external pneumatic actuator. The gas pressure forces the meniscus inside the channel, which varies the flow of liquid through the channel interior.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one embodiment, the microchannel includes a hydrophobic patch spanning the width of the microchannel at the location where the gas bubble is introduced to enhanced on-off switching of the bubble valve. The hydrophobic patch anchors the bubble in a particular location in the microchannel. If the introduced gas bubble covers the whole area of the patch, the bubble is effectively retained by capillary forces and blocks any liquid flow up to a certain pressure difference, depending on the level of hydrophobicity of the patch.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Alternatively or in combination with a hydrophobic patch, the microchannel can be locally shaped into a cavity for receiving and anchoring the gas bubble. By providing an appropriate cavity, the bubble can be kept in place during operation, reducing the risk that the gas bubble is carried away with the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one aspect of the invention, a microfluidic device is provided. The microfluidic device comprises a microchannel having an interior bounded by a side wall and a valve for regulating the flow of fluid through the microchannel. The valve comprises a gas-filled reservoir, a fluid meniscus interfacing the reservoir and the interior and an actuator for varying the volume of the reservoir to increase an internal pressure of the reservoir to vary the flow of liquid through the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect, a microfluidic device is provided, comprising a first plate having a groove formed therein defining a microchannel, a second plate for enclosing the microchannel and a flexible membrane. The second plate is bonded to the first plate and has an aperture adjacent to the groove sized and dimensioned to form a meniscus when the microchannel is filled with a liquid. The aperture defines a reservoir adjacent to the microchannel, wherein the meniscus forms an interface between the microchannel and the reservoir. The flexible membrane is bonded to the second plate to seal the reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another aspect, a method of making a bubble valve is provided, the method comprises providing a microchannel having an interior bounded by a side wall, an aperture formed in the side wall and a valve chamber adjacent to the aperture in communication with the interior, filling the microchannel with a liquid to form a meniscus of the liquid in the aperture, whereby the step of filling traps a gas in the valve chamber and providing an actuator for increasing the pressure in the valve chamber to deflect the meniscus into the interior.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to yet another aspect, a method of making a bubble valve is provided. The method comprises providing a microchannel having an interior bounded by a side wall, an aperture formed in the side wall and a valve chamber adjacent to the aperture in communication with the interior, filling the microchannel with a liquid to form a meniscus of the liquid in the aperture and applying and sealing an actuator comprising a chamber to a top surface of the microchannel to form a gas-filled chamber adjacent to the meniscus. The actuator varies the pressure in the gas-filled chamber to deflect the meniscus into the interior, thereby regulating fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to still another aspect, a microfluidic device is provided comprising a microchannel having an interior bounded by a side wall, a bubble valve for creating and injecting a bubble into the microchannel interior to regulate fluid flow through the microchannel and a hydrophobic patch for retaining the bubble in a predetermined position in the microchannel interior.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to yet another aspect a bubble valve in a particle sorting device for separating particles having a predetermined characteristic from particles not having a predetermined characteristic is provided. The bubble valve comprises a gas-filled reservoir, a side channel in communication with a channel through which a stream of particles in a carrier fluid passes, wherein the carrier fluid forms a meniscus in the side channel adjacent to the gas-filled reservoir and an actuator for deflecting the meniscus to create a pressure pulse to selectively deflect a particle having the predetermined characteristic from the stream of particles.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to still another aspect, a method of varying an electrical resistance in a microchannel is provided. The method comprises generating a bubble and injecting the bubble into a liquid in the microchannel, whereby the bubble varies the electrical resistance of the microchannel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to yet another aspect, an electrophoretic system is provided, comprising an electrokinetically operated microchannel, a sample well for providing an sample to the microchannel, a voltage source and a bubble valve for injecting a bubble into the microchannel to vary the electrical resistance of the microchannel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a final aspect of the invention, an electrokinetic column to column switch is provided, comprising a first electrokinetically operated microchannel, a second electrokinetically operated microchannel in communication with the first electrokinetically operated microchannel and a bubble valve for selectively blocking flow from the first electrokinetically operated microchannel to the second electrokinetically operated microchannel by selectively injecting a bubble into a microchannel.</p>

The illustrative microfluidic system <b>100</b> comprises a substrate <b>101</b> having one or more microchannels <b>21</b> disposed therein. The microchannels transport fluid through the microfluidic system <b>100</b> for processing, handling, and/or performing any suitable operation on a liquid sample. As used herein, the term &#x201c;microfluidic&#x201d; refers to a system or device for handling, processing, ejecting and/or analyzing a fluid sample including at least one channel having microscale dimensions. The term &#x201c;channel&#x201d; as used herein refers to a pathway formed in or through a medium that allows for movement of fluids, such as liquids and gases. The term &#x201c;microchannel&#x201d; refers to a channel preferably formed in a microfluidic system or device having cross-sectional dimensions in the range between about 1.0 &#x3bc;m and about 500 &#x3bc;m, preferably between about 25 &#x3bc;m and about 250 &#x3bc;m and most preferably between about 50 &#x3bc;m and about 100 &#x3bc;m. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine an appropriate volume and length of the microchannel. The ranges are intended to include the above-recited values as upper or lower limits. The microchannel can have any selected shape or arrangement, examples of which include a linear or non-linear configuration and a U-shaped configuration. The microfluidic system <b>100</b> may comprise any suitable number of microchannels <b>21</b> for transporting fluids through the microfluidic system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The microfluidic system <b>100</b> includes a bubble valve <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-8</figref><i>c </i>for controlling liquid flow through a microchannel of the system. According to the illustrative embodiment, the microchannel is defined by a side wall having any suitable shape enclosing at least a portion of the interior of the channel. The bubble valve may be formed by a gas-filled reservoir positioned adjacent to the microchannel including a meniscus that forms the interface between the reservoir and the microchannel interior. The meniscus may form a portion of the side wall of the microchannel. The bubble valve includes an actuator for modifying the pressure in the reservoir to deflect the meniscus into the channel interior, thereby modifying the cross-sectional area of the microchannel and consequently varying the flow of liquid through the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to an alternate embodiment, the bubble valve is formed by a meniscus in a separate side channel that communicates with and intersects a microchannel through which a liquid to be controlled flows. One skilled in the art will recognize that the meniscus can be located at any location relative to the microchannel through which liquid flows.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The gas-filled reservoir may be formed when filling the microchannel having an aperture in a side wall and a reservoir formed adjacent to the aperture. An empty microchannel may be filled with liquid, forming the meniscus in the aperture, which traps the gas that forms the gas bubble and forms a gas pocket in the reservoir adjacent to the meniscus. The creation of the gas pocket on filling provides a sterile gas bubble and reduces contaminants in the system. Alternatively, the air pocket may be created by introducing a gas to the reservoir after filling of the microchannel.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exploded view of an embodiment of an illustrative bubble valve <b>10</b> of the present invention. The microfluidic system may be formed by a plurality of stacked layers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the illustrative microfluidic system <b>100</b> includes a first plate <b>20</b> in which a groove defining the microchannel <b>21</b> is provided. A hydrophobic patch <b>22</b> may be applied to an inner wall of the microchannel <b>21</b>. A second plate <b>30</b> for enclosing the microchannel is bonded to the first plate <b>20</b> and includes an aperture <b>31</b>. A third plate <b>40</b> is bonded on top of second plate <b>30</b> to close and seal the stacked structure. The aperture <b>31</b> of the intermediate second plate <b>30</b> defines a void in the system adjacent to the microchannel <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrates the assembled bubble valve <b>10</b>. As shown, the stacked first plate <b>20</b>, second plate <b>30</b> and third plate <b>40</b> define a closed, gas filled gas reservoir <b>70</b>, which can be actuated with a displacement actuator <b>50</b>. According to the illustrative embodiment, the aperture <b>31</b> defining the reservoir <b>70</b> comprises a main body <b>31</b><i>a </i>and a slot <b>31</b><i>b </i>extending from the main body <b>31</b><i>a</i>. When the microfluidic system <b>10</b> is assembled, the slot <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the aperture <b>31</b> defines a gap in the side wall of the microchannel <b>21</b> that provides access to and communicates with the interior of the microchannel <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The bubble valve <b>10</b> operates to control the flow of liquid through the microchannel <b>21</b>. A meniscus is formed in the aperture <b>31</b>, which interfaces with and separates the microchannel interior from the reservoir <b>70</b>. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-8</figref><i>c</i>, the meniscus is formed by a liquid filling the microchannel in the slot <b>31</b><i>b</i>. One skilled in the art will recognize that other suitable devices may be used to form the meniscus. The liquid in the slot <b>31</b><i>b </i>is retained in the microchannel by capillary forces. The actuator <b>50</b> deflects the upper wall of the reservoir, defined by plate <b>40</b>, which decreases the volume of the reservoir <b>70</b>. The actuator <b>50</b> may comprise any suitable device for deflecting the wall, such as an electromagnetic actuator or a piezoelectric element. The plate <b>40</b> may comprises a flexible membrane. The decreased volume consequently increases the pressure of the reservoir <b>70</b> and causes the meniscus <b>80</b> to deflect into the channel interior to create a constriction in the channel, thereby impeding fluid flow or pushing fluid away from the meniscus. If a sufficient pressure is applied to the meniscus, the actuator generates and enlarges a bubble in the liquid of the microchannel, which blocks fluid flow. The hydrophobic patch <b>22</b> provides an anchor for the bubble and retains the bubble at a selected location in the microchannel.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">After the microchannel is filled with a liquid <b>60</b>, the bubble valve <b>10</b> is ready for operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>illustrate the operation of the bubble valve according to the teachings of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>shows the bubble valve in an &#x2018;open&#x2019; state. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c</i>, the meniscus between the reservoir and the interior of the microchannel is defined by the meniscus <b>80</b>, formed by the liquid <b>60</b> in the slot <b>31</b><i>b </i>in the second plate <b>30</b>. In the &#x2018;open&#x2019; state, liquid flows freely through the microchannel <b>21</b> and the valve does not impose any additional flow resistance in the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The slot <b>31</b><i>b </i>may be sized and dimensioned to form a &#x201c;virtual wall&#x201d; in the microchannel. As used herein, &#x201c;virtual wall&#x201d; refers to the meniscus <b>80</b> formed by the first liquid <b>60</b> in the aperture formed in the side wall of the microchannel <b>20</b>, which essentially replaces the removed portion of the side wall without affecting the properties of the microchannel. The meniscus surface can be, although not required, substantially co-planar with the wall of the microchannel in which the meniscus is formed. The word &#x201c;virtual&#x201d; is chosen to express the effect that the overall liquid flow through the microchannel <b>21</b> of the microfluidic system <b>100</b> is not influenced by the virtual wall, i.e. the flow of liquid in the microfluidic system having a virtual wall is substantially identical to the flow of liquid through an identical microfluidic system in which no virtual wall is present. One of ordinary skill will recognize that the meniscus may be convex or concave, depending on the appropriate system pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the actuator <b>50</b> is actuated, the bubble valve <b>10</b> switches to a &#x201c;pinched&#x201d; state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, to inhibit fluid flow through the channel interior. In the &#x2018;pinched&#x2019; state, the actuator <b>50</b> deflects the top of the gas reservoir <b>70</b> for a certain fraction, increasing the pressure in the reservoir <b>70</b> and forcing the meniscus <b>80</b> down into the channel <b>21</b>. The deflection of the meniscus locally reduces the cross-section of the channel <b>21</b> and introduces an additional flow resistance to the liquid flow. The degree of reduction in the liquid flow through the microchannel corresponds to the amplitude, frequency and duration of the displacement of the meniscus <b>80</b>, which are controllable by the actuator <b>50</b>. One skilled in the art will recognize that any suitable means for varying the pressure within the reservoir <b>70</b> may be used to deflect the meniscus <b>80</b>, thereby regulating fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the actuator is fully actuated, the bubble valve <b>10</b> is switched to a closed state, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>. As shown, in the closed state, the meniscus <b>80</b> deflects fully to form and introduce a gas bubble <b>81</b> into the microchannel <b>21</b>. The gas bubble <b>81</b> is retained by the hydrophobic patch <b>22</b> formed in the channel wall opposite the slot <b>31</b><i>b</i>. As a result, the liquid flow in the channel is substantially blocked. By reducing the pressure on the meniscus <b>80</b>, the bubble valve <b>10</b> can be brought from the &#x2018;closed&#x2019; state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>via the &#x2018;pinched&#x2019; state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>back to the &#x2018;open&#x2019; state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to one embodiment, the bubble valve <b>10</b> may be used as a check valve for regulating pressure in the microchannel. When the pressure in the microchannel exceeds a maximum breaking pressure, the bubble collapses, opening the valve and allowing fluid to flow through the channel, thereby reducing the pressure in the microchannel. The breaking pressure depends on the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic patch <b>22</b>, as well as the geometry of the microchannel.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Alternatively or in combination with the hydrophobic patch <b>22</b>, the microchannel <b>21</b> can be locally shaped into a cavity for receiving and anchoring the gas bubble <b>81</b>. By providing an appropriate cavity, the bubble can be kept in place during operation, reducing the risk that the gas bubble is carried away with the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref><i>c</i>, the actuator <b>50</b> is integrated in the microfluidic chip <b>100</b>. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that an external, reusable actuator may also be used to control formation of a gas bubble in the microchannel.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of a microfluidic system <b>100</b>&#x2032; including a bubble valve <b>10</b>&#x2032; having an external actuator <b>90</b> according to the teachings of the invention. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the microfluidic system <b>100</b>&#x2032; includes a first plate <b>200</b> including a groove defining the microchannel <b>210</b> and a second plate <b>300</b> bonded to the first plate <b>200</b> for enclosing the microchannel <b>210</b> and in which a virtual wall opening <b>32</b> is formed. The virtual wall opening <b>32</b> is sized and dimensioned to form a &#x201c;virtual wall&#x201d; when the microchannel <b>210</b> is filled with a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Upon filling of the microchannel <b>21</b> with a liquid, a virtual wall <b>32</b><i>a </i>is formed in virtual wall opening <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>c</i>, the microfluidic system further includes an external actuator, illustrated as pressurizer <b>90</b>, pressed and sealed onto the top of the second plate <b>300</b> to form a tight seal. The external pressurizer <b>90</b> defines a sealed pressurizing chamber <b>92</b> adjacent to the virtual wall <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The pressurizer varies the pressure within the pressurizing chamber <b>92</b> to control liquid flow through the microchannel <b>210</b> by modifying the position of the virtual wall. The pressurizer <b>90</b> may include a source of pressurized gas (not shown) and a gas inlet <b>91</b> to allow a gas pressure to be applied to the virtual wall <b>32</b><i>a </i>in order to move the virtual wall. The pressurizer may alternatively include a flexible wall that deflects to vary the volume of the chamber <b>92</b> upon activation of an actuator, such as a piezoelectric element or electromagnetic actuator.</p>

As shown, when the microchannel <b>210</b> is filled with liquid <b>600</b>, a virtual wall <b>32</b><i>a</i>, defined by a meniscus <b>800</b>, is formed within the virtual wall opening <b>32</b>. The meniscus essentially replaces the absent portion of the side wall of the microchannel and allows liquid to flow through the channel interior unimpeded and uninfluenced by the virtual wall.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b </i>depicts the &#x2018;pinched&#x2019; state of the bubble valve, when the pressurizer <b>90</b> is activated. As shown, activation of the pressurizer <b>90</b> increases the internal pressure within the pressurizing chamber <b>92</b>. The increased pressure moves the meniscus <b>800</b> down the channel height and into the microchannel interior, thereby regulating liquid flow. The pressurized controls the level of the internal pressure in order to control the amount of deflection of the meniscus and therefore the rate of fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">To switch the valve to a &#x2018;closed&#x2019; state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>c</i>, the pressurizer <b>90</b> applies a large pressure that is sufficient to form and introduce a gas bubble <b>810</b> into the channel <b>210</b>. The hydrophobic patch <b>220</b> retains the gas bubble <b>810</b> in place. As a result, the liquid flow in the channel is blocked up to a &#x2018;breaking pressure&#x2019;, which depends on the hydrophobicity of hydrophobic patch <b>220</b>. A higher hydrophobicity results in a larger breaking pressure. By reducing the pressure on the meniscus <b>800</b> the bubble valve <b>10</b>&#x2032; can be brought from the &#x2018;closed&#x2019; state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>c </i>via the &#x2018;pinched&#x2019; state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b </i>back to the &#x2018;open&#x2019; state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a. </i></p>

Regulation of the bubble valve <b>10</b><i>a </i>regulates the electric current through the associated electrokinetically operated microchannel <b>115</b><i>a</i>. The pinching of the liquid in the electrokinetically operated microchannel <b>115</b><i>a </i>by a bubble valve will result in an increased electrical resistance in the microchannel <b>115</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the migration of charged species and electro-osmotic flow in the electrokinetically operated microchannel <b>115</b><i>a </i>can be regulated.

The channel system comprises a first supply duct <b>162</b> for introducing a stream of particles and a second supply duct <b>164</b> for supplying a carrier liquid. The first supply duct <b>162</b> ends in a nozzle, and a stream of particles is introduced into the flow of carrier liquid. The first supply duct <b>162</b> and the second supply duct <b>164</b> enter a measurement duct <b>166</b>, which branches into a first branch <b>172</b><i>a </i>and a second branch <b>172</b><i>b </i>at a branch point <b>171</b>. A measurement region <b>182</b><i>a </i>is defined in the measurement duct <b>166</b> and is associated with a detector <b>182</b><i>b </i>to sense a predetermined characteristic of particles in the measurement region <b>182</b><i>a</i>. Two opposed bubble valves <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>are positioned in communication with the measurement duct <b>166</b> and are spaced opposite each other. The bubble valves <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>communicate with the measurement duct <b>166</b> through a pair of opposed side passages <b>174</b><i>a </i>and <b>174</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Liquid is allowed to partly fill these side passages <b>174</b><i>a </i>and <b>174</b><i>b </i>to form a meniscus <b>175</b> therein. An external actuator <b>176</b> is also provided for actuating the bubble valves <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, which momentarily causes a flow disturbance in the duct to deflect the flow therein when activated by the actuator <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In a suspension introduced by the first supply duct <b>162</b>, two types of particles can be distinguished, normal particles <b>180</b><i>a </i>and particles of interest <b>180</b><i>b</i>. The flow rates in both branches <b>172</b><i>a </i>and <b>172</b><i>b </i>are adjusted so that the stream of particles normally flows through the second branch <b>172</b><i>b</i>. Upon sensing the predetermined characteristic in the particles in the measurement region <b>182</b><i>a</i>, the detector <b>182</b><i>b </i>raises a signal. The external actuator <b>176</b> activates the bubble valves <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>when signaled by the detector <b>182</b><i>b </i>in response to sensing the predetermined characteristic, to create a flow disturbance in the measurement duct <b>166</b> between the sideway passages <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, to deflect the particle having the predetermined characteristic so that it flows down the first branch duct <b>172</b><i>a </i>rather than the second branch duct <b>172</b><i>b</i>. The detector communicates with the actuator <b>176</b>, so that when the detector <b>182</b><i>b </i>senses a predetermined characteristic in a particle, the actuator activates the first bubble valve <b>10</b><i>a </i>to cause pressure variations in the reservoir <b>70</b> of the first bubble valve. The activation of the first bubble valves causes a transient pressure variation in the first side passage <b>174</b><i>a</i>. The second side passage <b>174</b><i>b </i>and the second bubble valve <b>10</b><i>b </i>absorb the transient pressure variations in the measurement duct <b>166</b> induced via the actuator <b>176</b>. Basically, the reservoir <b>70</b><i>b </i>of the second bubble valve <b>10</b><i>b </i>is a chamber having a resilient wall or contains a compressible fluid such as a gas. The resilient properties allow the flow of liquid from the measurement duct into the second side passage <b>174</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref><i>a</i>-<b>17</b><i>c </i>illustrate the operation of the particle sorting system <b>160</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref><i>a</i>, the detector raises a signal to activate the actuator. Upon activation of the actuator, the pressure within the reservoir of the first bubble valve <b>10</b><i>a </i>is increased, causing a transient discharge of liquid from the first side passage <b>174</b><i>a </i>as indicated by the arrow. The sudden pressure increase caused at this point in the duct causes liquid to flow into the second side passage <b>174</b><i>b </i>because of the resilient properties of the reservoir of the second bubble valve <b>10</b><i>b</i>. This movement of liquid into the second side passage <b>174</b><i>b </i>is indicated with an arrow. Resultingly, as can be seen in the figure, the flow through the duct is deflected causing the selected particle of interest <b>178</b><i>b </i>located between the first side passage <b>174</b><i>a </i>and the second side passage <b>174</b><i>b </i>to be shifted perpendicular to its flow direction in the normal state. The flow resistances to the measurement duct <b>166</b>, the first branch <b>172</b><i>a </i>and the second branch <b>172</b><i>b </i>is chosen so that the preferred direction of the flow to and from the first side passage <b>174</b><i>a </i>and the second side passage <b>174</b><i>b </i>has an appreciable component perpendicular to the normal flow through the measurement duct <b>166</b>. This goal can for instance be reached by the first branch <b>172</b><i>a </i>and the second branch <b>172</b><i>b </i>so that their resistances to flow is large in comparison with the flow resistances of the first side passage <b>174</b><i>a </i>and the second side passage <b>174</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref><i>b </i>shows the particle sorting system <b>160</b> during the relief of the first bubble valve reservoir when the particle of interest <b>178</b><i>b </i>has left the volume between the first side passage <b>174</b><i>a </i>and the second side passage <b>174</b><i>b</i>. The actuator <b>176</b> is deactivated, causing the pressure inside the reservoir to return to the normal pressure. During this relief phase there is a negative pressure difference between the two reservoirs of the bubble valves, causing a liquid flow through the first side passage <b>174</b><i>a </i>and the second side passage <b>174</b><i>b </i>opposite to the liquid flow shown in the previous figure and is indicated by the arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref><i>c </i>shows the particle sorting system <b>160</b> after completion of the switching sequence. The pressures inside the reservoirs of the bubble valves has been equalized so the flow through the measurement duct <b>166</b> is normalized. As the particle of interest <b>178</b><i>b </i>has been displaced radially, it will flow into the first branch <b>172</b><i>a </i>as was the objective of the switching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to yet another embodiment, the cross-sectional dimensions of a microchannel including a bubble valve according to the teachings of the present invention may be varied locally to affect the pressure within the microchannel interior. For example, the microchannel may be narrowed or widened at certain locations to increase or decrease the capillary forces acting on a fluid in the microchannel interior. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine a suitable cross-sectional dimension to achieve a desired pressure within the microchannel interior.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The bubble valve of the present invention may be implemented in a variety of microfluidic devices used for many applications. In a particular application, the bubble valve is implemented in a flow-cytometer based instrument for sorting or physically separating particles of interest from a sample or for measuring selected physical and chemical characteristics of cells or particles in suspension as they travel past a particular site. The bubble valve may also be employed in devices for sequencing or manipulating DNA, medical diagnostic instruments, devices for drug discovery, chemical analysis and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The present invention provides an improved system and method for regulating fluid flow in a microchannel for a variety of applications. The bubble valve of the present invention is easy to operate and control, simple to manufacture and economical. In addition, the bubble valve does not adversely affect the liquid in the microchannel. The bubble valve effectively controls the flow of liquids in microfluidic systems, without heating the fluid and without complex on-chip circuitry.</p>
