<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates generally to an improved data processing apparatus and method and more specifically to mechanisms for frequency domain layout decomposition in double patterning lithography.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Optical lithography is a crucial step in semiconductor manufacturing. The basic principle of optical lithography is quite similar to that of chemistry-based photography. The images of the patterned photo-mask are projected through the high-precision optical system onto the wafer surface, which is coated with a layer of light-sensitive chemical compound, e.g. photo-resist. The patterns are then formed on the wafer surface after complex chemical reactions and follow-on manufacturing steps, such as development, post-exposure bake, and wet or dry etching.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multiple patterning is a class of technologies developed for photolithography to enhance the feature density. The simplest case of multiple patterning is double patterning, where a conventional lithography process is enhanced to produce double the expected number of features. Double exposure is a sequence of two separate exposures of the same photoresist layer using two different photomasks. This technique is commonly used for patterns in the same layer which have incompatible densities or pitches. In one important case, the two exposures may each consist of lines which are oriented in one or the other of two usually perpendicular directions. This allows the decomposition of two-dimensional patterns into two one-dimensional patterns which are easier to print.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Double pattern lithography (DPL) is an effective technique to improve resolution. DPL theoretically doubles resolution through pitch splitting such that effective pitch of the layout for each patterning step is halved. DPL involves two separate exposure and etch/freeze steps (litho-etch-litho-etch or litho-freeze-litho-etch). DPL is expected to be needed for 20 nm technology and is one of the best candidate solutions for scaling to 14 nm technology and beyond.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For one-dimensional patterns at minimum pitch, layout decomposition for double patterning is trivial. Decomposition is very complex for more complicated two-dimensional patterns. DPL layout decomposition solutions typically cast layout decomposition as a graph coloring problem where two features less than a certain minimum spacing must be assigned different colors. DPL decomposition is very challenging to implement at the hill-chip level, particularly when stitch insertion is considered. A stitch insertion in a polygon during decomposition indicates that one part of the polygon will be printed in the first patterning step while the remaining part of the polygon will be printed using second patterning, with the two parts joining together at the stitch location. Stitches can help in removing decomposition conflicts but they can potentially break a polygon into multiple pieces. All possible stitch insertion locations must be explicitly considered in the graph during coloring.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">DPL may provide wafer-level frequency doubling. In a diffraction limited optical system, the objective lens acts as a low pass filter with a spatial cutoff frequency determined by NA/&#x3bb;, which are properties of the optical system. NA is numerical aperture of the objective lens and &#x3bb; is the wavelength of the light. Double patterning can essentially provide wafer-level frequency doubling through two exposures. If the fundamental cut-off frequency of each exposure is f<sub>c</sub>, double patterning can theoretically achieve 2f<sub>c </sub>spatial frequency resolution. An ideal decomposition should split a target such that the spatial frequency in each layout is below the cut-off frequency of the system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one illustrative embodiment, a method, in a data processing system, is provided for layout decomposition in double patterning lithography. The method comprises receiving a target layout for performing a multiple patterning photolithographic process to form an integrated circuit design, determining a spatial cut-off frequency or low pass filter function of individual exposure in the multiple patterning photolithographic process, generating a first frequency domain representation of decomposed layout and a second frequency domain representation of decomposed layout for performing the multiple patterning photolithographic process based on the single exposure cut-off frequency or low pass filter function, converting the first frequency domain representation and the second frequency domain representation into a spatial domain target for first exposure and a spatial domain target for second exposure respectively, and performing the multiple patterning photolithographic process using the first spatial domain exposure target and the second spatial domain exposure target.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The illustrative embodiments provide a mechanism for frequency domain layout decomposition in double pattern lithography (DPL). The Fourier transform of a layout represents the spatial frequency terms present in the layout. The mechanism models decomposed patterns for two exposures as a function of the corresponding Fourier coefficients. For each exposure, the mechanism sets the corresponding Fourier coefficients to zero for spatial frequency terms greater than the cut-off frequency of the optical system. The mechanism then optimizes non-zero Fourier coefficients for the two exposures to decompose the original target. The mechanism provides frequency domain optimization instead of conventional spatial domain decomposition methods, which naturally leads to optics-aware decomposition and stitch insertion in arbitrary two dimensional patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates pitch split double patterning flow in accordance with an example embodiment. The flow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represents a litho-etch-litho-etch, or LELE, technique. The flow begins with a sub-resolution layout, which is the target design to be achieved. The flow makes a first exposure, performs an etch, makes a second exposure, and performs a final etch. Ideally, the final result should resemble the sub-resolution layout.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating simple one-dimensional patterns at minimum pitch in accordance with an example embodiment. With the patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, decomposition is trivial with alternating shapes appearing in separate exposures. Decomposition can become complex for more complicated two dimensional patterns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating decomposition of layout with two-dimensional patterns. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, shape <b>302</b> cannot be placed in one exposure, resulting in a &#x201c;graph coloring&#x201d; problem because two features less than a certain minimum spacing must be assigned different colors (exposures). With these complex shapes, double patterning lithography is very challenging to implement at the full-chip level, particularly when stitch insertion is to be considered. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a stitch can break a polygon&#x2014;in this case shape <b>302</b>&#x2014;into multiple pieces. A stitch is where the pieces meet and overlap joining the two pieces into a single shape. All possible stitch locations must be explicitly considered in the graph for layout decomposition.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates wafer-level frequency doubting using double patterning lithography in accordance with an example embodiment. In a diffraction limited optical system, the objective lens acts as a low pass filter with a spatial cut-off frequency determined by NA/&#x3bb;. Double patterning can essentially provide wafer-level frequency doubling through two exposures. Consider an original pattern <b>402</b> with a spatial frequency of 2f, which is greater than the cut-off frequency, f<sub>c </sub>of single exposure optical system. Using double patterning, one decomposes the original pattern <b>402</b> into two patterns <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> each having a frequency of f, which is less than f<sub>c</sub>. This decomposition method ensures that each of the decomposed patterns in printable by the optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a simple case, the cut-off frequency depends on NA and &#x3bb;. The cut-off frequency can also depend on other parameters of the optical system besides &#x3bb; and NA. Furthermore instead of a hard cut-off frequency, an example embodiment may use a continuous low pass filtering function that performs two-dimensional frequency domain filtering; the parameters of this function can also be obtained from the properties of the optical system. The cut-off frequency or low pass filtering function parameters may also depend on various computational steps used for mask optimization such as Optical Proximity Correction (OPC).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">While the description refers to double patterning lithography for simplicity, the illustrative embodiments apply to multiple patterning lithography having more than two exposures as well.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with the illustrative embodiments, a mechanism is provided for Fourier coefficient optimization (FCO) for layout decomposition in double patterning lithography (DPL). The Fourier transform M(u,v) of a layout m(x,y) represents the spatial frequency terms present in the layout. The mechanism models decomposed patterns for two exposures as functions of the corresponding Fourier coefficients. For each exposure, the mechanism sets the corresponding Fourier coefficients to zero for spatial frequency terms greater than the cut-off frequency of the optical system. The mechanism then optimizes the non-zero Fourier coefficients for the two exposures to decompose the original target.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The Fourier transform M(u,v) of the layout m(x,y) represents the coherent field distribution in the Fraunhofer diffraction plane. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts an example of discrete diffraction orders and band-limited filtering provided by objective lens aperture in an optical lithography system in accordance with the illustrative embodiments. The lens aperture collects certain diffraction orders within the pupil. The pupil function P(u,v) is band limited based on the cut-off frequency resulting the loss of image information due to loss of higher diffraction orders. The pupil function P(u,v) can be expressed as follows:</p>

The optimization problem for double patterning layout decomposition is to find two band-limited diffraction patterns, which when combined after inverse Fourier transform (IFT) produce the original spatial domain target layout.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Thus, the illustrative embodiments provide mechanisms for frequency domain layout decomposition in double pattern lithography (DPL). The Fourier transform of a layout represents the spatial frequency terms present in the layout. The mechanism models decomposed patterns for two exposures as a function of the corresponding Fourier coefficients. For each exposure, the mechanism sets the corresponding Fourier coefficients to zero for spatial frequency terms greater than the cut-off frequency of the optical system. The mechanism then optimizes non-zero Fourier coefficients for the two exposures to decompose the original target. The mechanism provides frequency domain optimization instead of conventional spatial domain methods, which naturally leads to optics-aware decomposition and stitch insertion in arbitrary two dimensional patterns.</p>
