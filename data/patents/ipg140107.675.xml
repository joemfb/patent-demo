<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to exhaust treatment systems, and more particularly to a system and method for determining an age of and controlling a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Internal combustion engines combine air and fuel to create an air/fuel (A/F) mixture that is combusted within a plurality of cylinders. The combustion of the A/F mixture drives pistons which rotatably turn a crankshaft generating drive torque. Specifically, air may be drawn into the cylinders and compressed using the pistons. Fuel may then be combined with (i.e., injected into) the compressed air causing the pressurized A/F mixture to combust (e.g., a compression ignition, or CI engine). For example, CI engines include diesel engines.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Exhaust gas produced during combustion may be expelled from the cylinders into an exhaust manifold. The exhaust gas may include carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC). The exhaust gas may also include nitrogen oxides (NOx) due to the higher combustion temperatures of CI engines compared to spark ignition (SI) engines. An exhaust treatment system may treat the exhaust gas to remove CO, HC, and/or NOx. For example, the exhaust treatment system may include, but is not limited to, at least one of an oxidation catalyst (OC), a particulate matter (PM) filter, a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system, NOx absorbers/adsorbers, and catalytic converters.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the SCR process, a dosing agent is injected into the exhaust gas by a dosing system. For example, the dosing agent may be pure anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, or urea. The dosing agent includes a reductant (e.g., ammonia, or NH<sub>3</sub>) that reacts with the NOx in the exhaust gas. Specifically, the reductant mixes with the NOx in the exhaust gas and the mixture may be absorbed onto the SCR catalyst. The SCR catalyst may then break down the absorbed mixture forming water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O) and nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>). The SCR process, therefore, may significantly reduce NOx emissions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An exhaust treatment system for exhaust gas produced by an engine includes a condition control module, a load determination module, and an age determination module. The condition control module decreases a load on a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst below a predetermined load threshold and increases exhaust gas temperature (EGT) to a predetermined temperature. The load determination module increases injection of a dosing agent into the exhaust gas and determines a load on the SCR catalyst when dosing agent is detected downstream from the SCR catalyst. The age determination module determines an age of the SCR catalyst based the determined load and predetermined loads for first and second SCR catalysts, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method includes decreasing a load on a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst below a predetermined load threshold, increasing exhaust gas temperature (EGT) to a predetermined temperature, increasing injection of a dosing agent into exhaust gas produced by an engine, determining a load on the SCR catalyst when dosing agent is detected downstream from the SCR catalyst, and determining an age of the SCR catalyst based the determined load and predetermined loads for first and second SCR catalysts, respectively.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, the term module refers to an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory including one or more software or firmware programs, and/or a combinational logic circuit that provides the described functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Compression ignition (CI) engine systems (e.g., diesel engine systems) may include exhaust treatment systems that remove nitrogen oxides (NOx) from exhaust gas. Specifically, the exhaust treatment systems for CI engines may include an oxidation catalyst (OC) located before (i.e., upstream from) a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst. The SCR catalyst, on the other hand, may be located upstream from a particulate matter (PM) filter. The OC oxidizes carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) to form carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O). The PM filter removes PM from the exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The PM filter may remove PM from the exhaust gas until the PM filter is saturated. In other words, the saturation condition may correspond to when the PM filter is full of PM (e.g., soot), after which a regeneration cycle may begin. The regeneration cycle may introduce HC into the exhaust gas (e.g., via post-combustion fuel injection or auxiliary HC injection). The HC in the exhaust gas may be catalyzed by the OC in an exothermic reaction that generates heat and increases exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The increased EGT at the outlet of the OC (i.e., at the inlet of the PM) may burn and/or breakdown the PM trapped in the PM filter, thus &#x201c;regenerating&#x201d; the PM filter.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The SCR catalyst, on the other hand, removes NOx from the exhaust gas. More specifically, the SCR catalyst, in conjunction with a dosing agent (e.g., urea), breaks down the NOx in the exhaust gas into nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O). Conventional control systems, therefore, control the SCR process by controlling injection of the dosing agent. The SCR catalyst, however, may decrease in efficiency over time. In other words, the SCR catalyst may &#x201c;age.&#x201d; Therefore, different amounts of dosing agent may be required based on the age of the SCR catalyst to prevent decreased efficiency of the SCR catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Accordingly, a system and method are presented that determine an age of an SCR catalyst and control the SCR catalyst based on the determined age. More specifically, the system and method may determine a load on the SCR catalyst during a period when a load on the SCR catalyst is relatively low (e.g., below a predetermined load threshold). For example, the period may include passive regeneration of a PM filter or active EGT control via fuel injectors (e.g., post-combustion fuel injection) and/or an auxiliary HC injector (e.g., auxiliary HC injection).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates relationships between dosing agent load on an SCR catalyst and EGT. A vertical axis (A) indicates SCR catalyst load and a horizontal axis (B) indicates exhaust gas temperature (e.g., in degrees Celsius, or &#xb0; C.). For example, a dashed horizontal line (C) may represent an SCR catalyst load of zero and a solid vertical line (D) may represent a peak load temperature. Curves E and F represent EGT versus load relationships a new SCR catalyst and an aged SCR catalyst, respectively. As shown, the dosing agent load storage capacity on both the new and aged SCR catalysts decreases as EGT increases. Additionally, an EGT range (G) may represent regeneration of a PM filter. In any EGT range where there is a difference between the dosing agent load storage capacity on new and aged SCR catalysts, the difference in load storage capacity may be used to determine the age of the SCR catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In other words, during the period when EGT is in the desired range (e.g., a temperature range at which the load storage capacity of new and aged SCR catalysts differ), the system and method may increase dosing injection until dosing agent (e.g., NH<sub>3</sub>) is detected by a downstream NOx sensor (&#x201c;slip&#x201d;). The system and method may then determine the load on the SCR catalyst based on a difference between the amount of dosing agent injected when the slip was detected and the amount of dosing agent (e.g., NH<sub>3</sub>) detected by the downstream NOx sensor. For example, dosing agent (e.g., NH<sub>3</sub>) may be detected as NOx by the downstream NOx sensor due to cross-sensitivity of NOx sensors. The system and method may then determine the age of the SCR catalyst based on the determined load and predetermined loads for first and second SCR catalysts. For example, the first and second SCR catalysts may include new (e.g., 100% life) and aged (e.g., 50% life) SCR catalysts, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The system and method may then control injection of the dosing agent based on the determined age of the SCR catalyst. More specifically, the system and method may increase an amount of dosing agent injected based on the determined age of the SCR catalyst. For example, the determined age of the SCR catalyst may include an aging factor for adjusting injection of the dosing agent. Thus, for example only, the system and method may inject a corrected amount of dosing agent that includes a product of a desired amount of dosing agent and an aging factor. Moreover, the system and method may determine whether the SCR catalyst has failed based on the age (or aging factor).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an engine system <b>10</b> includes an engine <b>12</b>. For example, the engine <b>12</b> may be a CI engine (e.g., a diesel engine). The engine <b>12</b>, however, may also be a different type of engine (e.g., a homogeneous charge compression ignition, or HCCI engine). The engine <b>12</b> draws air into an intake manifold <b>14</b> through an inlet system <b>16</b> that may be regulated by a throttle <b>18</b>. For example, the throttle <b>18</b> may be electronically controlled (i.e., electronic throttle control, or ETC). Additionally, for example, the engine <b>12</b> may be unthrottled.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Air from the intake manifold <b>14</b> is distributed into a plurality of cylinders <b>20</b>. While six cylinders are shown, it can be appreciated that the engine <b>12</b> may include other numbers of cylinders. Fuel injectors <b>22</b> may inject fuel directly into the cylinders <b>20</b> (i.e., direct fuel injection). Alternatively, however, the fuel injectors <b>22</b> may inject fuel via intake ports of the cylinders <b>20</b> (i.e., port fuel injection). The fuel injectors <b>22</b> may also inject fuel into the cylinders <b>20</b> after combustion of the NF mixture (i.e., post-combustion injection) to introduce hydrocarbons (HC) into exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Pistons (not shown) compress and combust the A/F mixture within the cylinders <b>20</b>. The pistons drive an engine crankshaft (not shown) during a power stroke to produce drive torque. In one embodiment, the cylinders <b>20</b> may include spark plugs (not shown) (e.g., for spark assist in an HCCI engine). An engine speed sensor <b>24</b> measures a rotational speed of the engine crankshaft (not shown). For example, the engine speed sensor <b>24</b> may measure the rotational speed in revolutions per minute, or RPM.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Exhaust gas resulting from combustion is expelled into an exhaust manifold <b>26</b>. The exhaust gas may then be treated by an exhaust treatment system and/or recirculated to the intake manifold <b>14</b> via an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system <b>48</b>. An exhaust mass air flow (EMAF) sensor <b>28</b> may measure a flow rate of exhaust gas into the exhaust treatment system <b>30</b>. The exhaust treatment system <b>30</b> may include an auxiliary injector <b>32</b>, an OC <b>34</b>, an SCR catalyst <b>36</b>, and a PM filter <b>38</b>. The auxiliary injector <b>32</b> may selectively inject HC (e.g., fuel) into the exhaust gas. For example, the auxiliary injector <b>32</b> may inject HC into the exhaust gas to increase the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) for regeneration of the PM filter <b>38</b>. As previously described, however, the fuel injectors <b>22</b> may perform post-combustion injection to introduce HC into the exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The OC <b>34</b> oxidizes CO and HC to form CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O. The SCR catalyst <b>36</b> (in conjunction with a dosing agent, such as urea) removes NOx from the exhaust gas. The PM filter <b>38</b> removes PM from the exhaust gas before the exhaust gas is released into the atmosphere. The exhaust treatment system <b>30</b> may further include a dosing injector <b>40</b>, a dosing agent (DA) tank <b>42</b>, a NOx sensor <b>44</b>, and a temperature sensor <b>46</b>. While one NOx sensor <b>44</b> and one temperature sensor <b>46</b> are shown, the exhaust treatment system may include other numbers of NOx and/or temperature sensors. For example, additional NOx and/or temperature sensors may be implemented upstream of (i.e., before) the SCR catalyst <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A control module <b>60</b> communicates with and/or controls various components of the engine system <b>10</b>. Specifically, the control module <b>60</b> may receive signals from the engine speed sensor <b>24</b>, the EMAF sensor <b>28</b>, the NOx sensor <b>44</b>, and the temperature sensor <b>46</b>. The control module <b>60</b> may communicate with the PM filter <b>38</b> to determine when a regeneration cycle is required. Alternatively, the control module <b>60</b> may determine that regeneration of the PM filter <b>38</b> is required based on other parameters and/or modeling. For example, the control module <b>60</b> may determine that regeneration of the PM filter <b>38</b> is required when exhaust flow (e.g., measured by the EMAF sensor <b>28</b>) is less than a predetermined exhaust flow threshold (i.e., the PM filter <b>38</b> is restricted).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The control module <b>60</b> may also control the throttle <b>18</b> (if the engine <b>12</b> is throttled), the fuel injectors <b>22</b>, spark plugs (not shown) (if implemented, such as in an HCCI engine), the auxiliary injector <b>32</b>, and an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve <b>52</b> (discussed in more detail below). More specifically, the control module <b>60</b> may actuate the fuel injectors <b>22</b> (e.g., post-combustion injection) and/or the auxiliary injector <b>32</b> to control EGT and thus may control regeneration of the PM filter <b>38</b>. The control module <b>60</b> may also implement the system and/or method of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The engine system <b>10</b> may further include an EGR system <b>48</b>. The EGR system <b>48</b> includes the EGR valve <b>52</b> and an EGR line <b>50</b>. The EGR system <b>48</b> may introduce a portion of exhaust gas from the exhaust manifold <b>26</b> into the intake manifold <b>14</b>. The EGR valve <b>52</b> may be mounted on the intake manifold <b>14</b>. The EGR line <b>50</b> may extend from the exhaust manifold <b>26</b> to the EGR valve <b>52</b>, providing communication between the exhaust manifold <b>26</b> and the EGR valve <b>52</b>. As previously described, the control module <b>60</b> may actuate the EGR valve <b>52</b> to control an amount of exhaust gas introduced into the intake manifold <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The engine <b>12</b> may also include a turbocharger <b>54</b>. The turbocharger <b>54</b> may be driven by the exhaust gas received through a turbine inlet. For example only, the turbocharger <b>54</b> may include a variable nozzle turbine (VNT). The turbocharger <b>54</b> increases airflow into the intake manifold <b>14</b> to cause an increase in intake MAP (i.e., manifold absolute pressure, or boost pressure). The control module <b>60</b> may actuate the turbocharger <b>54</b> to selectively restrict the flow of the exhaust gas, thereby controlling the boost pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the control module <b>60</b> is shown in more detail. The control module <b>60</b> may include a condition control module <b>80</b>, a load determination module <b>84</b>, an age determination module <b>88</b>, and an SCR control module <b>92</b>. The control module <b>60</b> may also include memory (not shown) for storing measured and/or determined parameters. For example, the memory (not shown) may include non-volatile memory (NVM).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The condition control module <b>80</b> may control the exhaust treatment system <b>30</b> to decrease the load on the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> below a predetermined load threshold. Specifically, the condition control module <b>80</b> may either passively or actively increase EGT to decrease the load on the SCR catalyst <b>36</b>. For example, the low load may improve speed and/or accuracy of the load determination method of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The condition control module <b>80</b> may passively control EGT by waiting for a regeneration cycle of the PM filter <b>38</b>. The EGT during a typical regeneration cycle of the PM filter <b>38</b> may decrease the load on the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> below the predetermined load threshold. For example, a predetermined EGT may correspond to a load that is less than the predetermined load threshold. In other words, the condition control module <b>80</b> may monitor the EGT (e.g., via temperature sensor <b>46</b>) to determine when EGT is sufficiently high (and thus the load is sufficiently low). The condition control module <b>80</b> may also introduce a new temperature set point at the end of the regeneration cycle (e.g., greater than a highest EGT during the regeneration cycle).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Alternatively, the condition control module <b>80</b> may actively control EGT. For example, the active control of the EGT may be similar to a regeneration cycle of the PM filter <b>38</b>. In other words, the condition control module <b>80</b> may actuate the fuel injectors <b>22</b> and/or the auxiliary injector <b>32</b> to inject HC into the exhaust gas and increase the EGT. For example, the condition control module <b>80</b> may monitor EGT feedback (e.g., via temperature sensor <b>46</b> to determine when the stop injection of HC (e.g., fuel) into the exhaust gas. Moreover, the condition control module <b>80</b> may increase EGT to the new temperature set point (e.g., a predetermined temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates EGT control during an exemplary determination of the load on the SCR catalyst. A vertical axis <b>100</b> indicates EGT (e.g., in &#xb0; C.) and a horizontal axis <b>102</b> indicates time. For example, temperature set points <b>104</b>-<b>110</b> may be associated with a conventional regeneration cycle of the PM filter <b>38</b>. Thus, regeneration of the PM filter <b>38</b> may be completed at <b>114</b>. An evaluation window <b>112</b> may include a new temperature set point having known SCR loads for both new and aged (e.g., 50% life) SCR catalysts. The new temperature set point may be within a temperature band <b>116</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the new temperature set point may be actively commanded via auxiliary HC injection and/or post-combustion fuel injection (as previously described).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the condition control module <b>80</b> may then generate a status signal to notify the load determination module <b>84</b> that the load on of the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> is less than the predetermined load threshold. For example, the condition control module <b>80</b> may generate the status signal when the EGT (e.g., measured by temperature sensor <b>46</b>) is greater than or equal to a predetermined temperature threshold. The load determination module <b>84</b> may wait for the load on the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> to decrease below the predetermined load threshold before determining the load on the SCR catalyst <b>36</b>. For example, the status signal may be generated when EGT increases above a predetermined temperature threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The load determination module <b>84</b> may then determine the load on the SCR catalyst <b>36</b>. More specifically, the load determination module <b>84</b> may increase injection of the dosing agent into the exhaust gas (e.g., via dosing injector <b>40</b>) until slip (e.g., NH<sub>3</sub>) is detected downstream of the SCR catalyst <b>36</b>. In other words, the NOx sensor <b>44</b> may be cross-sensitive to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and thus may detect dosing agent as NOx downstream of the SCR catalyst <b>36</b>. The load determination module <b>84</b> may then determine the load on the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> based on the amounts of dosing agent injected and detected (i.e., slip). For example, the load may include a difference between the amount of dosing agent injected (e.g., via dosing injector <b>40</b>) when the slip was detected and the amount of dosing agent detected downstream of the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> (e.g., at NOx sensor <b>44</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates SCR load and downstream NOx sensor measurements during an exemplary determination of the load on an SCR catalyst.

A vertical axis <b>120</b> indicates EGR (e.g., in &#xb0; C.) and a horizontal axis <b>122</b> indicates time. Curves <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> represent accumulated load on the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> and measured downstream NOx (e.g., measured NH3 using the NOx sensor <b>44</b>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As previously described, injection of the dosing agent may be increased (e.g., at an injection rate &#x3b1;&#x3e;1) until slip is detected at <b>128</b> using the downstream NOx sensor <b>44</b>. When the slip Is detected at <b>128</b>, the load on the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> may be detected at <b>130</b>. A first period (b) indicates a period between a full SCR load at <b>132</b> and the detection of slip at <b>128</b>. A second period (&#x201c;a&#x201d;) indicates a period between the detection of slip at <b>128</b> and the determined load <b>134</b> on the SCR catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the age determination module <b>88</b> communicates with the load determination module <b>84</b>. For example, the age determination module <b>88</b> may receive the determined load on the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> from the load determination module <b>84</b>. The age determination module <b>88</b> may determine an age of the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> based on the determined load of the SCR catalyst <b>36</b>. More specifically, the age determination module <b>88</b> may determine the age of the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> based on the determined load and a plurality of predetermined relationships between load and EGT. For example, the plurality of predetermined relationships may include first and second relationships corresponding to a new SCR catalyst and an aged (e.g., 50% life) SCR catalyst, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the aging factor may be determined based on the first and second periods b and a, respectively. More specifically, the aging factor may be determined as follows:

In other words, the aging factor may be approximately one (i.e., no aging) when the second period a is relatively short compared to the first period b.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the SCR control module <b>92</b> communicates with the age determination module <b>88</b>.

The SCR control module <b>92</b> may control operation of the SCR catalyst <b>36</b>. More specifically, the SCR control module <b>92</b> may control injection of the dosing agent into the exhaust gas to improve performance of the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> (e.g., decrease emissions such as due to HC slip). For example, the SCR control module <b>92</b> may generate a control signal that controls the dosing injector <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a method for determining the age of the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> and controlling the SCR catalyst <b>36</b> begins at <b>150</b>.

For example, the control module <b>60</b> may passively decrease the load by waiting for a regeneration cycle of the PM filter <b>38</b>. Alternatively, for example, the control module <b>60</b> may actively decrease the load by increasing EGT above a predetermined temperature threshold via post-combustion fuel injection (e.g., fuel injectors <b>22</b>) and/or auxiliary HC injection (e.g., auxiliary injector <b>32</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At <b>154</b>, the control module <b>60</b> may increase the EGT to a new temperature set point that has known loads for both new and aged (e.g., 50% life) SCR catalysts.

At <b>158</b>, the control module <b>60</b> may increase injection of the dosing agent (e.g., via dosing injector <b>40</b>). At <b>162</b>, the control module <b>60</b> determines whether slip is detected (e.g., dosing agent at the downstream NOx sensor <b>44</b>).</p>
