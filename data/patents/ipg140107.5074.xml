<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure relates to a wireless communication method and apparatus. More particularly, the disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for simultaneous communication utilizing multiple wireless communication systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wireless communication devices generally operate in either licensed radio frequency (RF) bands or unlicensed RF bands. Wide area network (WAN) providers generally acquire licenses to operate wireless communication systems in one or more of a plurality of licensed RF bands. These systems employ methods that allow multiple accesses by mobile stations on a common band of frequency channels. These systems generally operate in licensed RF bands. Other systems operate in unlicensed RF bands. Systems that operate in licensed RF bands have control over the transmissions in the licensed frequencies and channels. This allows the operator to ensure reliability of data, and in particular, control information used for control channels and link maintenance and establishment. Systems that operate in unlicensed RF band do not have this control and data transmission errors may occur as a result of uncoordinated transmissions by different users and service providers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One access technique for WAN is frequency division multiple access (FDMA), which allows multiple access by assigning the mobile stations to different frequency channels within the RF band. Some of these systems employ frequency hopping, wherein data is transmitted to and from the intended mobile station while periodically changing the frequency channel. The periodic channel frequency hopping occurs on a regular time interval, e.g., a frame. Coordinated frequency hopping systems use predetermined hopping patterns, or hop-sets, where the hop-sets are coordinated between all mobile stations to ensure that the signals to and from two or more mobile stations do not occur simultaneously on the same frequency channel. Uncoordinated frequency hopping does not coordinate the hop-set between mobile stations resulting in the periodic occurrence of simultaneous signal transmission on the same frequency. Such simultaneous transmissions are referred to as channel collisions. Data reception errors occurring during a channel collision are referred to as data collisions. Uncoordinated frequency hopping within this type of system is generally not used as the channel collisions and resultant data collisions may occur. The FCC has prohibited coordinated frequency hopping within the Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands in order to avoid spectrum aggregation by a single type of service. Systems such as Bluetooth and 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), for example, operate within the ISM bands.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another type of WAN is a code division multiple access (CDMA) system, Global System for Communications (GSM), or a Wide Area CDMA (WCDMA) system. These systems utilize different codes for differing users to allow multiple access to prevent collision between signals of different mobile station users.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Systems, such as 802.11 WLANs, generally have very high data rates when compared to systems that operate within a licensed RF band. However, the likelihood of collisions with respect to data and control signals in 802.11 WLANs is higher when compared to WANs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With an increasing demand for improved wireless communication devices, there remains a continuing need in the art for a method and apparatus that prevents collision between signals of different mobile stations while allowing for high data rate transfer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A wireless communication method for a mobile station may include receiving a first control signal for a first communication session via a wide area network, and receiving a data signal for the first communication session via a first wireless local area network. The mobile station may also receive voice signals for a second communication session via the wide area network or the first wireless local area network. In one embodiment, the mobile station may also receive a second control signal for the first communication session via the first wireless local area network. In another embodiment, the wireless communication method may further include receiving voice signals for a second communication session via a second wireless local area network. The wide area network performs a handoff operation of the mobile station from the first wireless local area network to the second wireless local area network.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A wireless communication method at a base station of a wide area network is disclosed. A first control signal is received, at the base station of the wide area network, for a communication session between a wireless local area network and a mobile station. The base station of the wide area network then transmits a second control signal for the communication session between the wireless local area network and the mobile station. The second control signal may be transmitted to a network management system, which subsequently transmits commands responsive to the second control signal to the wireless local area network. In one embodiment, the first or second control signal is used to adjust transmission power, code rate or bandwidth between the wireless local area network and the mobile station.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The mobile station is capable of simultaneous communication with a wide area network and a wireless local area network. The mobile station may have a first control unit configured to process control information from the wireless local area network during a communication session, a second control unit to process control information from the wide area network during the communication session, a processing device configured to generate signaling and packet processing, and a GPS device configured to provide position location information. The second control unit may be configured to receive control and voice signals from the wide area network. The first control unit may be configured to receive control, data and voice signals from the wireless local area network.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One embodiment provides a machine-readable medium embodying instructions that may be performed by one or more processors. The machine-readable medium may include instructions for processing a first control signal for a first communication session received via a wide area network and instructions for processing a data signal for the first communication session received via a first wireless local area network. The machine-readable medium may include instructions for processing voice signals for a second communication session received via the wide area network, the first wireless local area network and/or a second wireless local area network. The machine-readable medium may also include instructions for processing a second control signal for the first communication session received via the first wireless local area network.</p>
