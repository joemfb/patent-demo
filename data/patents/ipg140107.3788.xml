<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-157114, filed Jul. 1, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a liquid crystal display panel and a touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A liquid crystal display panel having a touch panel function is known (e.g., Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2007-95044 and Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2007-58070).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The conventional liquid crystal display panel having the touch panel function has the following configuration: Electrodes are provided on opposite surfaces of first and second substrates arranged across a liquid crystal layer. These electrodes serve to form pixels for controlling the alignment of liquid crystal molecules by the application of a voltage and thereby controlling the transmission of light. X-coordinate detection lines and Y-coordinate detection lines are provided on the surface of the first substrate in accordance with regions between the pixels. The X-coordinate detection lines serve to detect coordinates of a touched point in an X direction intersecting with a Y direction. The Y-coordinate detection lines serve to detect coordinates of the touched point in the Y direction. Coordinate detection electrodes are provided between one or both of the X-coordinate detection line and Y-coordinate detection line and the pixel electrode adjacent thereto. These coordinate detection electrodes are provided to be connected to each of the X-coordinate detection lines and each of the Y-coordinate detection lines. Contact portions are provided on the surface of the second substrate to face the coordinate detection electrodes. These contact portions flexibly deform and come into contact with the coordinate detection electrodes when the outer surface of the liquid crystal panel is touched.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the conventional liquid crystal display panel having the touch panel function, since arrangement space for the coordinate detection electrodes must be allocated between one or both of the X-coordinate detection lines and the Y-coordinate detection lines and each pixel electrode, each pixel electrode adjacent to the arrangement portion of the contact electrodes must be formed to be greatly apart from the coordinate detection lines. Thus, an area of each pixel electrode adjacent to the arrangement portion of the contact electrodes is considerably small, thereby greatly reducing an aperture ratio of a pixel corresponding to this pixel electrode.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a liquid crystal display panel and a liquid crystal display panel in which each pixel electrode adjacent to the arrangement portions of the coordinate detection electrodes can be formed with a sufficient area, so that a reduction in aperture ratio of a pixel corresponding to this pixel electrode is decreased.</p>

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">It is to be noted that, in the second embodiment, the two X coordinate detection lines <b>19</b> that are adjacent to each other form one set to be connected with the source electrode <b>12</b> of each X coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>a </i>in accordance with each set and the two Y coordinate detection lines <b>20</b> that are adjacent to each other form one set to be connected with the source electrode <b>12</b> of each Y coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>b </i>in accordance with each set. The present invention is not restricted thereto, any other number, e.g., three to five X coordinate detection lines <b>19</b> may form one set to be connected with the source electrode <b>12</b> of each X coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>a </i>in accordance with each set, and three to five Y coordinate detection lines <b>20</b> that are adjacent to each other may form one set to be connected with the source electrode <b>12</b> of each Y coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>b </i>in accordance with each set. Based on this configuration, an arrangement space of the X coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the Y coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>b </i>assured in the region other than the screen area can be further reduced, thereby further alleviating an increase in size of the liquid crystal display panel caused due to provision of each X coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>a </i>and each Y coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>b. </i></p>

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">A liquid crystal display panel according to a third embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref> has a configuration that the drain electrode <b>13</b> of each X coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>13</b> of each Y coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>b </i>are connected with a common output line <b>21</b> for both X coordinate detection and Y coordinate detection and this common output line <b>21</b> outputs a serial data signal that alternately includes an X coordinate and a Y coordinate in a cycle synchronized with a selection period of respective scanning lines <b>14</b> in the liquid crystal display panel according to the second embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0152">According to the third embodiment, since the output line from which the serial data signal is output is the single common output line <b>21</b> for both X coordinate detection and Y coordinate detection alone, an arrangement space of the X coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the Y coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>b </i>assured in a region other than a screen area <b>2</b> can be further reduced to be smaller than the second embodiment, thereby alleviating an increase in size of the liquid crystal display panel caused due to provision of each X coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>a </i>and each Y coordinate detection TFT <b>6</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Moreover, according to the third embodiment, since providing the single comparator <b>42</b> for both X coordinate detection and Y coordinate detection alone can suffice as the comparator provided in the external circuits, the external circuits can be further simplified as compared with the second embodiment.</p>
