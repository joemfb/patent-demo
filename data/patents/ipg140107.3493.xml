<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national phase application based on PCT/EP2007/063091, filed Nov. 30, 2007, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of electricity supply apparatuses. In particular, the present invention relates to an electricity supply apparatus of an industrial site, in particular (but not exclusively) a telecommunication site. Further, the present invention relates to a method for supplying such an industrial site.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A telecommunication network typically comprises a plurality of telecommunication sites distributed over the coverage area of the telecommunication network. Typically, each telecommunication site comprises a plurality of electrical and electronic apparatuses, such as:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0004">telecommunication apparatuses (e.g. switches, routers, etc.);</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0005">auxiliary apparatuses which perform functions allowing the telecommunication apparatuses to operate (e.g. cable pressurizers, conditioners for keeping constant the temperature of the telecommunication apparatuses, etc.); and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0006">other electrical apparatuses (e.g. air conditioners and heating systems for the offices, elevators, computers, lighting systems, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0007">The telecommunication apparatuses typically have a substantially constant electricity consumption, they require to be supplied with a DC current at a nominal voltage of 48 V, and their electricity supply can not undergo interruptions longer than few tens of milliseconds. On the other hand, auxiliary apparatuses and the other electrical apparatuses have an electricity consumption which significantly varies according to the seasons, the day of the week (either working day or holiday), and the time of the day.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0008">Each telecommunication site is typically supplied by an electricity supply apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0009">An electricity supply apparatus typically comprises a mains-generator switch, an energy station and one or more batteries. The mains-generator switch has two input lines which are connected to a mains and, optionally, to a generator, respectively, and an output line. The mains-generator switch is switchable between a normal operational status, wherein it draws an AC current from the mains, and a failure status (e.g. when a black-out occurs in the mains), wherein it can draw an AC current from the generator. The mains-generator switch then outputs the drawn AC current through its output line, which distributes it to the apparatuses of the telecommunication site.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">In particular, the AC current is distributed partially to the energy station and partially to the auxiliary apparatuses and the other electrical apparatuses. The energy station, which substantially comprises a number of rectifiers, converts the AC current in a DC current at a nominal voltage of 48 V. The conversion performed by the energy station typically implies a conversion loss. However, for simplicity, in the following description it is assumed that the conversion efficiency of the energy station is substantially equal to 1, i.e. the conversion loss is substantially negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0011">In a first status, either the mains or the generator are able to supply a theoretically unlimited amount of current. If the batteries are substantially fully charged, the whole current supplied by the energy station is absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses. If the batteries are only partially charged, the current supplied by the energy station is absorbed partially by the telecommunication apparatuses and partially by the batteries, which then recharge. In any case, in this first status, the amount of current that the energy station draws from the mains (or the generator) through the mains-generator switch only depends on the current absorbed by the loads (i.e. the telecommunication apparatuses and, if only partially charged, the batteries).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0012">In a second status, e.g. due to a failure or a black-out, both the mains and the generator are able to supply a limited amount of current which is lower than the current required by the telecommunication apparatuses. In some cases, neither the mains nor the generator are able to provide any current at all. In this second status, the telecommunication apparatuses start to fully or partially draw the required current from the batteries, which then start to discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">The above described electricity supply apparatus may be used to supply not only a telecommunication site but, more generally, any industrial site having electrical and/or electronic apparatuses which, similarly to the above telecommunication apparatuses, have a substantially constant electricity consumption, require to be supplied with a DC current at a given nominal voltage, and whose electricity supply can not undergo interruptions longer than few tens of milliseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0014">Typically, the price of the electrical energy varies according to the day of the week and the time of the day. Therefore, the overall cost of the electrical energy drawn by an industrial site during a day is:</p>

wherein pi is the price per hour of the electrical energy during the i<sup>th </sup>hour of the day and qi is the amount of electrical energy drawn by the industrial site during the i<sup>th </sup>hour of the day. Typically, the price per hour of the electrical energy varies on a supply-demand basis, i.e. it is lower during the night (i.e. when the electrical energy demand is lower) and it is higher during the day (i.e. when the electrical energy demand is higher).

<p id="p-0014" num="0016">U.S. Pat. No. 6,885,115 discloses a system and a power supply control method capable of having a peak shift function without deteriorating the essential function of an apparatus. The power supply system comprises a secondary battery for supplying power to a load circuit, a power receiving unit for receiving power externally provided to the load circuit, a switch for selectively supplying the power of the secondary battery or the power externally provided to the load circuit, and a controller for instructing the switch to stop the supply of the power externally provided to the load circuit for a predetermined time zone. By using the second battery, which is capable of storing the electric energy to the extent to show the essential function, it is possible to add the peak shift function to an apparatus. More specifically, by typically stopping or reducing power supply from a commercial power source while receiving the power necessary for operations of an apparatus from a built in battery, it is possible to realize peak shift.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0017">U.S. Pat. No. 6,522,031 discloses a large scale, capacitor-based electrical energy storage and distribution system capable of effectuating load-levelling during periods of peak demand on a utility. A capacitor or multitude of capacitors may be charged with electrical energy produced by the utility during periods of low demand, such as the evening hours, and discharged during periods of high electrical energy consumption to help reduce demand on the utility. One or more capacitors may be located at a consumer's residence or business for providing at least a portion of the consumer's electrical power requirements. Alternatively, a farm of capacitors may be provided at or near a utility, or at or near a location experiencing high demand, such that electrical energy stored in the capacitors can be discharged into the utility's distribution grid to increase the amount of electrical energy available for use.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0019">The Applicant has noticed that the above solutions disadvantageously do not allow to optimise the batteries usage.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0020">In particular, the above solutions disadvantageously could damage the batteries, since the conditions according to which discharge and recharge operations are performed (i.e. the recharge current, the discharge current, the minimum charge level and the maximum charge level) are determined only according to a peak shift function (in U.S. Pat. No. 6,885,115) or a function effectuating load-levelling during periods of peak demand on a utility (in U.S. Pat. No. 6,522,031). In addition, the above solutions do not allow to maximize the energy storage efficiency of the batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0021">Accordingly, the Applicant has tackled the problem of providing an electricity supply apparatus of an industrial site (in particular, but not exclusively, a telecommunication site), which allows to minimize the amount of current drawn from the mains when the price per hour of the electrical energy is higher by using batteries, which batteries are then recharged when the price per hour of the electrical energy is lower, while optimising the batteries usage (in particular, by minimizing the risk of damaging the batteries and maximizing the energy storage efficiency of the batteries).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0022">The Applicant has perceived that the above known external limitation technique may be applied to the above disclosed electricity supply apparatus for regulating the current drawn by the energy station so that the amount of current drawn from the mains when the price per hour of the electrical energy is higher is minimized and, at the same time, the batteries usage is optimised.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows an electricity supply apparatus ESA for supplying electricity to an industrial site which comprises a load which requires to be supplied by an energy station.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0083">By way of example, it is assumed that the industrial site is a telecommunication site TS comprising telecommunication apparatuses TA (i.e. the above load) and electrical apparatuses EA, in turn comprising auxiliary apparatuses which perform functions allowing the telecommunication apparatuses to operate and/or other electrical apparatuses (such as air conditioners and heating systems for the offices, elevators, computers, lightning system, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0084">The electricity supply apparatus ESA preferably comprises a mains-generator switch SW, an energy station ES, a battery B, a control device CD and three probes p(i), p(ii) and p(iii). Even though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> only shows a single battery B, the apparatus ESA may comprise any number of batteries, which are preferably connected the one to the other according to a parallel configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0085">The mains-generator SW has a first input line connected to a mains Ms and a second input line connected to a generator G. Further, the mains-generator switch SW has an output line which is connected both to the energy station ES and to the electrical apparatuses EA. The energy station ES in turn has an output line. The battery B and the telecommunication apparatuses TA are connected to the output line of the energy station ES according to a parallel configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0086">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the current supplied by the mains-generator switch SW through the output line (i.e. the overall current drawn by the telecommunication site TS) is indicated as I<b>1</b>, the current drawn by the energy station ES is indicated as I<b>2</b>, the current absorbed by the battery B is indicated as I<b>3</b> and the current absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses is indicated as I<b>4</b>. For simplicity, it is assumed that the conversion efficiency of the energy station ES is substantially equal to 1, i.e. I<b>2</b>=I<b>3</b>+I<b>4</b>. Further, it is assumed that when the current I<b>3</b> has negative values, it indicates a current flowing in a direction opposite to that indicated by the arrow I<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, i.e. it indicates a current supplied by the battery B.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0087">Preferably, the probe p(i) is placed on the output line of the mains-generator switch SW, and it is suitable to provide a measurement m(i) of the current I<b>1</b> and/or of a further parameter associated to the current I<b>1</b> and to provide the measurement m(i) to the control device CD. Preferably, the further parameter is the active power that the telecommunication site TS draws from the mains Ms or the generator G. Preferably, the probe p(i) provides the measurement m(i) in a continuous way or in a periodic way.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0088">Preferably, the probe p(ii) is placed on the input line of the energy station ES, and it is suitable to provide a measurement m(ii) of the current I<b>2</b> and/or of a further parameter associated to the current I<b>2</b> and to provide the measurement m(ii) to the control device CD. Preferably, the further parameter is the voltage of the current I<b>2</b>. Preferably, the probe p(ii) provides the measurement m(ii) in a continuous way or in a periodic way.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0089">Preferably, the probe p(iii) is placed on the line connecting the battery B to the energy station ES and to the telecommunication apparatuses TA, and it is suitable to provide a measurement m(iii) of the current I<b>3</b> and to provide the measurement m(iii) to the control device CD. Preferably, the probe p(iii) provides the measurement m(iii) in a continuous way or a periodic way.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0090">Optionally, the electricity supply apparatus ESA may also comprise a fourth probe (which is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) located at the input of the telecommunication apparatuses TA, which is suitable to provide a measurement of the current I<b>4</b> absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses TA. Preferably, this fourth probe is provided only if the current I<b>4</b> absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses TA is not constant. However, in the following it is assumed that the current I<b>4</b> absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses I<b>4</b> has a substantially constant value equal to I<b>4</b>*. Accordingly, the fourth probe could not be required.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0091">The control device CD is connected to the probes p(i), p(ii) and p(iii) for receiving the measurements m(i), m(ii) and m(iii), respectively. Further, the control device CD is configured for receiving a load reduction signal S. The load reduction signal S may be transmitted to the control device CD either by an electrical transmission system operator e.g. through the mains Ms, or by the manager of the telecommunication site TS for reducing the current that the telecommunication site TS may draw from the mains Ms to a target value.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0092">Further, the control device CD is connected to the energy station ES for providing it with a control signal Vc. Preferably, the control signal Vc is a voltage signal having e.g. an amplitude A included between 0 and 12 V. Alternatively, the control signal Vc may be either a current signal or a digital signal.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0093">Preferably, the energy station ES is configured to implement the above mentioned external limitation technique. In other words, the energy station ES is configured to receive the control signal Vc from the control device CD, and to reduce the current I<b>2</b> drawn from the mains Ms or the generator G through the switch SW by an amount proportional to the amplitude A of the control signal Vc. Accordingly, when the amplitude A of the control signal Vc is equal to 0, the current I<b>2</b> is not limited, i.e. it exclusively depends on the current absorbed by the loads supplied by the energy station ES (i.e. the telecommunication apparatuses TA and, possibly, the battery B). When the amplitude A of the control signal Vc is increased, the energy station ES reduces the current I<b>2</b>. In particular, preferably, when the amplitude A of the control signal Vc is increased to its maximum value Amax (i.e. 10 or 12 V), the energy station ES preferably reduces the current I<b>2</b> to a predefined value 12*, independently of the current required by the loads supplied by energy station ES (i.e. the telecommunication apparatuses TA and, possibly, the battery B).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows in further detail the structure of the control device CD. Preferably, the control device CD has a first input in-a suitable to receive the load reduction signal S. Further, the control device CD has three further inputs in-b, in-c and in-d which are suitable to receive the measurements m(i), m(ii) and m(iii) from the probes p(i), p(ii) and p(iii), respectively. Further, the control device CD has an output out-a connected to the energy station ES for providing the control signal Vc to the energy station ES.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart showing in further detail the operation of classifying each hour of a day as a peak hour, an off-peak hour or a neutral hour, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Preferably, such an operation is performed once per day, in order to take into account daily variations of the electrical energy price.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0108">During a first step <b>30</b>, the control device CD calculates a number N of peak hours of the day. Preferably, the number N is calculated according to the battery information InfoB stored in the database DB. In particular, the battery information InfoB preferably comprise, inter alia, an optimum charge level BCLopt of the battery B (which may be equal e.g. to 80%), a minimum charge level BCLmin of the battery B (which may be equal e.g. to 30%) and an optimum discharge current I<b>3</b>opt&#x2212; of the battery B. Preferably, the optimum charge level BCLopt is the maximum charge level allowing the battery B to store energy with a storage efficiency higher than a predetermined threshold. Besides, preferably, the minimum charge level BCLmin is the minimum charge level allowing the battery B to supply current to the telecommunication apparatuses TA for a predetermined time period, in case the energy station ES stops drawing current from the mains Ms and from the generator G. Preferably, the control device CD calculates the number N of peak hours of the day as the number of hours required to discharge the battery B from its optimum charge level BCLopt to its minimum charge level BCLmin with a discharge current equal to the optimum discharge current I<b>3</b>opt&#x2212;.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0109">During a second step <b>31</b>, the control device CD preferably uploads a price table PT and stores it in its database DB. Preferably, the price table PT comprises 24 rows, and each row comprises an hour of the day and the price per hour of the electrical energy during that hour. Possibly, the price table PT is provided by an authority (e.g. a national authority) distributing the electrical energy through the mains Ms.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0110">During a successive step <b>32</b>, the processor CPU reads the price table PT and sorts the rows according to an increasing or decreasing order of the price per hour. In the following description, it is assumed by way of example that the rows of the price table PT are sorted according to a decreasing order of the price per hour. Accordingly, the first row of the sorted price table PT corresponds to the hour having the highest price per hour, while the last row corresponds to the hour having the lowest price per hour.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0111">During a subsequent step <b>33</b>, the processor CPU selects the first N rows of the sorted price table PT, and stores them in a peak hour table PHT.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0112">Then, during a subsequent step <b>34</b>, the processor CPU calculates a number M of off-peak hours of the day. Preferably, also the number M is calculated according to the battery information InfoB stored in the database DB. In particular, the battery information InfoB preferably comprise, inter alia, an optimum recharge current I<b>3</b>opt+ of the battery B. Preferably, the control device CD calculates the number M of off-peak hours of the day as the number of hours required to recharge the battery B from its minimum charge level BCLmin to its optimum charge level BCLopt with a recharge current equal to the optimum recharge current I<b>3</b>opt+.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0113">Then, during a subsequent step <b>35</b>, the processor CPU selects the last M rows of the sorted price table PT, and stores them in an off-peak hour table OPHT.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0114">Then, during a subsequent step <b>36</b>, the processor CPU selects the remaining 24-N-M rows of the sorted price table PT, and stores them in a neutral hour table NHT.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0115">Preferably, the number of off-peak hours of a day (and therefore also the number of neutral hours of a day) depends on the day of the week. For instance, as shown in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the number M to be used from Monday to Saturday may be calculated as explained above, while on Sunday a further number M&#x2032; of off-peak hours may be calculated (step <b>34</b>&#x2032;). Preferably, further number M&#x2032; is higher than the number M. Preferably, also the further number M&#x2032; is calculated according to the battery information InfoB stored in the database DB. In particular, the battery information InfoB preferably comprise, inter alia, a maximum charge level BCLmax of the battery B. Preferably, the control device CD calculates the further number M&#x2032; of off-peak hours of the day as the number of hours required to recharge the battery B from its minimum charge level BCLmin to its maximum charge level BCLmax with a recharge current equal to the optimum recharge current I<b>3</b>opt+.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0116">Then, during a subsequent step <b>35</b>&#x2032;, the processor CPU selects the last M&#x2032; rows of the sorted price table PT, and stores them in a Sunday off-peak hour table S-OPHT.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0117">Then, during a subsequent step <b>36</b>&#x2032;, the processor CPU selects the remaining 24-N-M&#x2032; rows of the sorted price table PT, and stores them in a Sunday neutral hour table S-NHT.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0118">Therefore, the price information InfoP stored in the database DB comprise the peak hour table PHT, the off-peak hour table OPHT, the neutral hour table NHT, the Sunday off-peak hour table S-OPHT and the Sunday neutral hour table S-NHT.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0119">According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, the control device CD is configured to control the energy station ES by taking into account whether the present time is a peak hour, an off-peak hour or a neutral hour, as it will be now described in detail by referring to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0120">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is assumed that the control device CD is not receiving any load reduction signal S, i.e. the telecommunication site TS may draw a theoretically unlimited amount of current from the mains Ms. The generator G is inactive. Further, it is assumed that the telecommunication site TS is located either in Europe or in North America, where Sunday is the weekly holyday.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0121">By referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the control device CD is activated, it firstly checks the day of the week (step <b>40</b>). If the day of the week is from Monday to Saturday, the control device CD preferably retrieves from its database DB the peak hour table PHT, the off-peak hour table OPHT and the neutral hour table NHT. Otherwise, if the day of the week is Sunday, the control device CD preferably retrieves from its database DB the peak hour table PHT, the Sunday off-peak hour table S-OPHT and the Sunday neutral hour table S-NHT.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0122">Then, during a step <b>41</b>, the control device CD preferably compares the clock signal cs generated by the clock module CK indicating the present time with the tables PHT, OPHT and NHT (or PTH, S-OPHT and S-NHT, if it is Sunday), thus determining whether the present time corresponds to a peak hour, an off-peak hour or a neutral hour. Preferably, step <b>41</b> is repeated once every period T. The period T preferably has a predefined duration, which may be equal e.g. to a some seconds .</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0123">Firstly, it is assumed that the present time corresponds to a neutral hour. During the neutral hours the energy station ES is preferably controlled so that the telecommunication apparatuses TA draw the current I<b>4</b>* only from the mains Ms (or from the generator G, if there is a blackout) and so that recharge of the battery B is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0124">In particular, the control device CD checks the battery charge level BCL of the battery B according to the measurement m(ii) of the current I<b>3</b> provided by the probe p(ii), and compares it with the maximum charge level BCLmax (step <b>42</b>). Preferably, step <b>42</b> is repeated every T&#x2032; seconds, T&#x2032; being preferably lower than the duration of the period T. For instance, T&#x2032; is equal to 5 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0125">When the battery charge level BCL is equal to the maximum charge level BCLmax, the control device CD preferably keeps the energy station ES in a floating mode (step <b>43</b>) by suitably regulating the amplitude A of the control signal Vc, as it will be described in further detail herein after. When the energy station ES is in its floating mode, the current I<b>2</b> which the energy station ES draws from the mains Ms is not limited, and therefore it is determined by the current I<b>4</b>* absorbed only by the telecommunication apparatuses TA (since the battery B does not absorb any current). At the end of the period T, the control device CD performs again step <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0126">Otherwise, when the battery charge level BCL is lower than the maximum charge level BCLmax, the control device CD preferably keeps the energy station ES in a no-recharge mode (step <b>44</b>) by suitably regulating the amplitude A of the control signal Vc, as it will be described in further detail herein after. When the energy station ES is in its no-recharge mode, the current I<b>2</b> which the energy station ES draws from the mains Ms is limited so that it is kept equal to the current I<b>4</b>* absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses TA, thus preventing the battery B to absorb any current I<b>3</b>, and therefore preventing the battery B from increasing its battery charge level BCL. At the end of the period T, the control device CD performs again step <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0127">It is now assumed that the present time corresponds to a peak hour.

<p id="p-0097" num="0129">When the battery charge level BCL is lower than the minimum charge level BCLmin, the control device CD preferably keeps the energy station ES in the no-recharge mode (step <b>46</b>) by suitably regulating the amplitude A of the control signal Vc, as it will be described in further detail herein after. As mentioned above, when the energy station ES is in its no-recharge mode, the current I<b>2</b> which the energy station ES draws from the mains Ms is limited so that it is kept equal to the current I<b>4</b>* absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses TA, thus preventing the battery B to absorb any current I<b>3</b> and therefore preventing the battery B from increasing its battery charge level BCL.

<p id="p-0098" num="0130">Otherwise, when the battery charge level BCL is higher than the minimum charge level BCLmin, the control device CD preferably keeps the energy station ES in a limited-drawing mode (step <b>47</b>) by suitably regulating the amplitude A of the control signal Vc, as it will be described in further detail herein after. When the energy station ES is in its limited-drawing mode, the current I<b>2</b> which the energy station ES draws from the mains Ms is decreased, so that the telecommunication apparatuses TA start drawing at least part of the current I<b>4</b>* from the battery B.

When the energy station ES is in its recharge mode, the current I<b>2</b> which the energy station ES draws from the mains Ms is increased, so that it can be absorbed partially by the telecommunication apparatuses TA and partially by the battery B. The battery B then increases its charge level BCL. At the end of the period T, the control device CD performs again step <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0135">According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, if the control device CD receives a load reduction signal S indicating that the current that the telecommunication site TS may draw from the mains Ms has to be reduced to a target value, the control device CD preferably performs the following operation, independently of whether the present time corresponds to a peak hour, an off-peak hour or a neutral hour. Firstly, it preferably checks whether the battery charge level BCL is higher than the minimum battery charge level BCLmin. In the affirmative, the control device CD preferably keeps the energy station ES in the above mentioned limited-drawing mode, so that the telecommunication apparatuses TS start drawing current from the battery B. In the negative, the control device CD preferably switches on the generator G and switches status of the mains-generator switch SW, so that the telecommunication site TS may start drawing current from the generator G. In this situation, the control device CD preferably brings the energy station in the above mentioned no-recharge mode. In this way, the current drawn by the energy station ES from the generator G is supplied only to the telecommunication apparatuses TA, thus postponing the recharge of the battery B to an off-peak hour during which the normal operation of the mains Ms will be restored.</p>

If, otherwise, the current I<b>2</b> fulfils the condition ii) before the current I<b>3</b> fulfils the condition i), the telecommunication apparatuses TA draw a current I<b>2</b>* from the energy station ES and a current I<b>4</b>*&#x2212;I<b>2</b>* from the battery B.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0151">From t<b>62</b> to the end of the period T, the amplitude A is preferably kept constant to the value A62, so that the currents I<b>2</b> and I<b>3</b> are kept substantially constant, and the battery charge level BCL continues to decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0152">If, before the end of the period T, the battery charge level BCL reaches the minimum battery charge level BCLmin (this case is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>), the control device CD preferably forces the energy station ES into its no-recharge mode by decreasing the amplitude A of the control signal Vc, so that the current I<b>2</b> increases again. Preferably, the amplitude A of the control signal Vc is increased until the current I<b>2</b> is again equal to the current I<b>4</b>* absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses TA. Therefore, the telecommunication apparatuses TA draw again the current I<b>4</b>* only from the energy station ES, while the battery B neither supplies nor draws any current (I3=0), thus keeping its battery charge level BCL constant.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0153">By referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, the operation of the electricity supply apparatus ESA during the above steps <b>49</b> and <b>50</b>, respectively, will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0154">Each of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b </i>show the battery charge level BCL (graph (a)), the current I<b>3</b> absorbed by the battery B (graph (b)), the amplitude A of the control signal Vc (graph (c)) and the current I<b>2</b> drawn by the energy station ES from the mains Ms (or from the generator G, if there is a blackout) (graph (d)) versus time, during a period T. The graphs of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b </i>are not in scale. By referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, graph (a) shows that when the battery charge level</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0155">BCL is equal to the maximum charge level BCLmax (for instance 100%), the battery B does not absorb any current, i.e. 13=0, as shown by graph (b). Accordingly, the current I<b>2</b> that the energy station ES draws from the mains Ms is equal to the current I<b>4</b>* absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses TA (as mentioned above, it is assumed that the conversion efficiency of the energy station ES is equal to 1). At the beginning of the period T (i.e. at the time t<b>0</b>), when the control device CD realizes that the present time corresponds to an off-peak hour and the battery charge level BCL is equal to the maximum charge level BCLmax, it preferably keeps the amplitude A of the control signal Vc equal to 0, so that the current I<b>2</b> is not limited (floating mode). The amplitude A is preferably kept equal to 0 until the end of the period T, as shown in graph (c).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0156">By referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>, it is assumed that, before the period T, the energy station ES is in its no-recharge mode, for instance because it is a peak hour and the battery charge level BCL of the battery B is lower than the minimum charge level BCLmin (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>). In this no-recharge mode, as explained above, the control device CD keeps the amplitude A of the control signal Vc substantially constant to a value A70 such that the current I<b>2</b> that the energy station ES draws from the mains Ms is equal to the current I<b>4</b>* absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses TA and the current I<b>3</b> absorbed by the battery B is equal to zero, so that the battery charge level BCL is substantially constant. At the beginning of the period T (i.e. at the time t<b>0</b>), when the control device CD realizes that the present time corresponds to an off-peak hour and the battery charge level BCL is lower than the maximum battery charge level BCLmax, it preferably starts to decrease the amplitude A of the control signal Vc, so that the current I<b>2</b> starts increasing. Even though in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b </i>the amplitude A gradually decreases in a substantially linear way, this is merely exemplary. Indeed, the amplitude A may be gradually decreased in other ways, such as exponential, parabolic and so on. Further, the amplitude A may be varied step-by-step.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0157">Accordingly, since the telecommunication apparatuses TA always absorb the current I<b>4</b>*, the current supplied by the energy station ES and which is not absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses TA is absorbed by the battery B, which then starts recharging (recharge mode). Preferably, the control device CD decreases the amplitude A until a time t<b>7</b>, wherein it reaches a value A71 lower than A70, which is also preferably comprised between 0 and Amax. Preferably, the value A71 is such that the current I<b>3</b> absorbed by the battery B is equal to the optimum recharge current I<b>3</b>opt+, i.e. until the current I<b>2</b> is equal to I4*+(I<b>3</b>opt+). From t<b>7</b> until the end of the period T, the control device DC keeps the amplitude A of the control signal Vc constant to the value A71, so that the current is kept equal to I<b>3</b>opt+ and the current I<b>2</b> is kept equal to I<b>4</b>*+(I<b>3</b>opt+) thus increasing the battery charge level BCL. If, before the end of the period T, the battery charge level BCL reaches the maximum charge level BCLmax (this case is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>), the control device CD preferably forces the energy station ES into its floating mode by decreasing the amplitude A of the control signal Vc to zero. Therefore, the current I<b>2</b> gradually stops being limited and, since the battery B does not absorb any current (I<b>3</b>=0), I<b>2</b> is determined only by the current I<b>4</b>* absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses TA.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0158">If, before the end of the period T, the battery charge level BCL reaches the optimum battery charge level BCLopt (this case is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>), the control device CD preferably may force the energy station ES into its no-recharge mode by decreasing the amplitude A of the control signal Vc until I<b>2</b> is equal to I<b>4</b>*, so that the battery B stops absorbing current (I<b>3</b>=0) even if it is not fully charged.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0159">Therefore, advantageously, thanks to the fact that the current I<b>2</b> that the energy station ES draws from the mains Ms is varied by varying the amplitude A both according to the price information InfoP and according to the battery information InfoB, the current drawn by the electricity supply apparatus ESA during the peak hours can be minimized, while allowing to discharge and recharge the battery B according to the optimum operating conditions of the battery B. Indeed, advantageously, during the off-peak hours, the amplitude A of the control signal Vc may be adjusted until the current I<b>3</b> that the battery B absorbs from the energy station ES is equal to the optimum recharge current I<b>3</b>opt+. By further adjusting the amplitude A, it is also possible to prevent the battery B from being recharged above its optimum charge level BCLopt. Besides, during the peak hours, the amplitude A of the control signal Vc may be adjusted until the current I<b>3</b> that the battery B supplies to the telecommunication apparatuses TA is equal to the optimum discharge current I<b>3</b>opt&#x2212;. By further adjusting the amplitude A it is also possible to prevent the battery B from being discharged below its minimum value. In other words, discharge and recharge of the battery B may be performed in a controlled way, by adapting the behaviour of the energy station ES in order to allow the battery B to operate in its optimum conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0160">This advantageously allows to maximize the storage efficiency of the battery and to reduce aging of the battery due to repeated discharge and recharge operations.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0161">Further, when the battery B is replaced with a battery of another type, new battery information InfoB may be uploaded in the database DB of the electricity supply apparatus ESA. The processor CPU will advantageously use such new battery information InfoB for adapting the behaviour of the energy station ES so that discharge and recharge are always performed under optimum conditions of the new battery.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0162">Further, advantageously, thanks to the fact that the current I<b>2</b> that the energy station ES drawn from the mains Ms is gradually varied (either in a continuous way as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>, <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, or step-by-step) by gradually varying the amplitude A of the control signal Vc, surges that could damage the battery B or the apparatuses TA and EA are avoided. Indeed, the gradual increase or decrease of the amplitude A of the control signal Vc allows to provide smooth transients between the various modes (floating, no-recharge, recharge or limited-drawing) of the electricity station ES, thus gradually varying both the current I<b>4</b> absorbed by the telecommunication apparatuses TA and the current I<b>3</b> absorbed by the battery B.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0163">Although in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the control device CD is configured to control a single energy station ES, according to other embodiments not shown in the drawings a single control device CD may control more than one energy station ES. To this purpose, for each electrical station the control device comprises separated inputs for collecting the measurements m(i), m(ii), m(iii) and a separate output for providing a respective control signal Vc. This advantageously allows the control device CD to control each energy stations ES in an independent way. For instance, during an off-peak hour, a first energy station may be kept in its floating mode since its batteries are completely charged, while a second energy station may be kept in its recharge mode since its batteries are not completely charged.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0164">In addition to the above functions, the control device is preferably configured to perform also the following operations.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0165">First of all, when the generator G is activated (e.g. during a blackout), the control device CD preferably varies the amplitude A of the control signal Vc in order to optimise its efficiency either by reducing the current I<b>1</b> drawn from the generator G (and therefore supplying the telecommunication apparatuses TA at least partially by means of the battery B) or by increasing the current I<b>1</b> both for supplying the telecommunication apparatuses TA and for recharging the battery B.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0166">Besides, the control device CD may be operated in order to implement an external limitation function similar to the above mentioned known external limitation technique. However, differently from the known external limitation technique, which only provides for two fixed thresholds of maximum currents which can be drawn either from the mains Ms or from the generator G, the external limitation function implemented by the control device CD according to embodiments of the present invention advantageously allows to vary the thresholds. In other words, a number of thresholds may be provides, wherein the number of thresholds and the value of each threshold can be adjusted according to the day of the week, the hour of the day, etc.</p>
