<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to surgical devices and methods for severing and sealing blood vessels and, in particular, to an endoscopic tissue welder.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Endoscopic harvesting of vessels is well known in the surgical field and has been the subject of a great deal of recent technological advancement. Typically, the harvested vessel is used for bypass or as a shunt around an artery that has diminished flow from stenosis or other anomaly, such as a Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) procedure. Often in CABG, a saphenous vein from the patient's leg is harvested for subsequent use in the surgery. Other vessels, such as the radial artery, can also be harvested and used in this manner. Vessel harvesting involves liberating the vessel from surrounding tissue and transecting smaller side branches, cauterizing, tying or ligating the vessel at a proximal site and a distal site, and then transecting the vessel at both sites before it is removed from the body.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known endoscopic methods and devices for performing vessel harvesting are discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,176,895 to Chin, et al., U.S. Pat. No. Re 36,043 to Knighton, U.S. Pat. No. 6,406,425 to Chin, et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,471,638 to Chang, et al., all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, various devices and methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,895,353 to Lunsford, et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,173 to Chin, et al., and pending patent application Ser. No. 10/602,490 entitled &#x201c;Apparatus and Method for Integrated Vessel Ligator and Transector&#x201d; are also expressly incorporated herein by reference. Also, commercial vessel harvesting systems sold under the tradename VASOVIEW&#xae; Uniport Plus and VASOVIEW&#xae; 5 are available from Guidant Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif..</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Numerous instruments are known which coagulate, seal, join, or cut tissue, and which are suitable, for example, for severing a target vessel from surrounding side branches and securing the separated ends to stanch bleeding. Such devices typically comprise a pair of tweezers, jaws or forceps that grasp onto and hold tissue therebetween. The devices may operate with a heating element in contact with the tissue, with an ultrasonic heater that employs frictional heating of the tissue, or with a mono- or bi-polar electrode heating system that passes current through the tissue such that the tissue is heated by virtue of its own electrical resistance. The devices heat the tissue to temperatures such that the tissue is either &#x201c;cut&#x201d; or &#x201c;sealed&#x201d;, as follows. When tissue is heated in excess of 100&#xb0; Celsius, the tissue disposed between the tweezers, jaws or forceps will be broken down and is thus, &#x201c;cut&#x201d;. However, when the tissue is heated to temperatures between 50&#xb0; to 90&#xb0; Celsius, the tissue will instead simply &#x201c;seal&#x201d; or &#x201c;weld&#x201d; to adjacent tissue. In the context of the present application, the term &#x201c;tissue welding&#x201d; refers to procedures that cause otherwise separated tissue to be sealed, coagulated, fused, welded or otherwise joined together. Numerous devices employing the same general principle of controlled application of a combination of heat and pressure can be used to join or &#x201c;weld&#x201d; adjacent tissues to produce a junction of tissues or an anastomosis of tubular tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Monopolar and bipolar probes, forceps or scissors use high frequency electrical current that passes through the tissue to be coagulated. The current passing through the tissue causes the tissue to be heated, resulting in coagulation of tissue proteins. In the monopolar variety of these instruments, the current leaves the electrode and after passing through the tissue, returns to the generator by means of a &#x201c;ground plate&#x201d; which is attached or connected to a distant part of the patient's body. In a bipolar version of such an electro-surgical instrument, the electric current passes between two electrodes with the tissue being placed or held between the two electrodes as in the &#x201c;Kleppinger bipolar forceps&#x201d; used for occlusion of Fallopian tubes. There are many examples of such monopolar and bipolar instruments commercially available today from companies including Valley Lab, Cabot, Meditron, Wolf, Storz and others worldwide.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A new development in this area is the &#x201c;Tripolar&#x201d; instrument marketed by Cabot and Circon-ACMI which incorporates a mechanical cutting element in addition to monopolar coagulating electrodes. A similar combined sealing and mechanical cutting device may also be known as a tissue &#x201c;bisector,&#x201d; which merges the terms bipolar cautery and dissector. One tissue bisector is packaged for sale as an element of the VASOVIEW&#xae; Uniport Plus and VASOVIEW&#xae; 5 vessel harvesting systems by Guidant Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In ultrasonic tissue heaters, a very high frequency (ultrasonic) vibrating element or rod is held in contact with the tissue. The rapid vibrations generate heat causing the proteins in the tissue to become coagulated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Conductive tissue welders usually include jaws that clamp tissue therebetween, one or both of which are resistively heated. In this type of instrument, no electrical current passes through the tissue, as is the case for monopolar or bipolar cautery. Some tissue welders also perform a severing function without a mechanical knife. For example, the Thermal Ligating Shears made by Starion Instruments of Saratoga, Calif. is a, hand activated instrument that utilizes thermal welding to simultaneously seal and divide soft tissue during laparoscopic general surgery procedures. The Starion device uses a heating element at the tip of one of a pair of facing jaws combined with pressure to denature the protein molecules within the tissue. The denatured proteins bond together, forming an amorphous mass of protein, and fusing tissue layers together. The procedure can be used to fuse vessels closed. More highly focused heat may be applied in the center of the tissue within the jaws of the instrument, causing the tissue or vessel to divide, thus resulting in two sealed ends. A description of the Starion device is provided at www.starioninstruments.com.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Despite accepted means for severing and securing vessels, such as in a vessel harvesting procedure, there remains a need for an improved device that increases the operating efficiency of the device and ensures the least amount of trauma to surrounding tissue while simultaneously providing repeatable secure sealing of the severed vessel ends.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides designs of tissue severing/sealing devices that control the pressure applied to tissue between the distal jaws to avoid crushing an improved the severing and welding process.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the present invention includes a surgical apparatus for welding and severing tissue comprising first and second relatively movable elongated jaws having facing surfaces. The first and second relatively movable jaws attach to a distal end of an elongated shaft, and at least one heating element is provided on the facing surface of one of the first or second jaws. A control handle connects to the elongated shaft, and a control actuator alternately separates and brings together the facing surfaces of the elongated jaws. Finally, a force-limiting mechanism interposed between the control actuator and the jaws regulates the magnitude of closing force of the jaws to between about 1-3 lbs (0.45-1.36 kg) to ensure the heating element effectively welds and severs tissue held within the facing surfaces of the closed elongated jaws. In an alternative arrangement, the force-limiting mechanism regulates the magnitude of closing force of the jaws so that the heating element effectively welds and severs tissue held within the facing surfaces of the closed elongated jaws within a time frame of 5 seconds or less. In a preferred embodiment, a second heating element is provided on the facing surface of one of the first or second jaws, wherein the first heating element is adapted to weld tissue and the second heating element is adapted to sever tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Desirably, a control rod extends from the control handle to the distal end of the elongated shaft and connects to translate movement of the control actuator into movement of the jaws. In one configuration, the force-limiting mechanism comprising a spring mounted coaxially on the control rod. The spring may be located within the elongated shaft, and may even be formed by a portion of the control rod such as a helical laser cut within a tubular control rod. In addition, a second spring may mount coaxially on the control rod and be arranged such that deformation of the first and second springs does not occur simultaneously upon closing of the jaws. In a second configuration, the force-limiting mechanism comprises a spring located within the control handle. For example, the control actuator may comprise a toggle journalled to pivot in two directions and accordingly displace the control rod in opposite directions, wherein the spring is arranged to affect relative movement of the toggle and the control rod in one direction of pivot of the toggle. Alternatively, the force-limiting mechanism includes a ball-detent structure arranged to decouple (or clutch) relative movement of the toggle and the control rod in one direction of pivot of the toggle at a predetermined reaction force transmitted through the control rod from closing of the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with an alternative configuration, the force-limiting mechanism comprises an elastic member incorporated within the jaws. For example, the elastic member may be bi-metallic springs adapted to change shape at elevated temperatures. Or, the elastic member may be a compliant layer on at least one of the jaws. In another arrangement, the elastic member comprises a spring positioned between the proximal ends of two jaws which permits the proximal ends to separate at a predetermined force impeding further closing movement of the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the jaws are mounted in parallel on the end of the elongated shaft, wherein the apparatus further includes structure for maintaining the parallelism of the jaws during opening and closing thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another aspect of the invention is a surgical method of severing a target tissue while welding the severed ends. The method first includes providing a surgical apparatus for welding tissue including a pair of jaws having facing surfaces adapted to open and close upon the target tissue, at least one of the jaws including an electrically-resistive heating element on its facing surface. The jaws are closed upon a target tissue, and the magnitude of closing force of the jaws is limited to a value calibrated to ensure the heating element effectively severs and welds tissue held within the facing surfaces of the jaws within a time frame of about 5 seconds or less. The first heating element is energized to form a welded region in the target tissue and sever the target tissue within the welded region. Preferably, the step of limiting the magnitude of closing force of the jaws comprises regulating the magnitude of closing force of the jaws to between about 1-3 lbs (0.45-1.36 kg). In addition, a second resistive heating element for severing tissue may be provided on the facing surface of one of the first or second jaws, the method including electrically energizing the second heating element to sever the target tissue within the welded region.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method may also include maintaining parallelism between the jaws during the step of closing the jaws upon target tissue. Desirably, the surgical apparatus further includes a control handle having a control actuator for opening and closing the jaws. In one embodiment, the structure between the control actuator and the jaws completely decouples relative movement of the control actuator and the jaws at a predetermined closing force. In this case, the method includes closing the jaws until the predetermined closing force has been reached so that movement of the jaws is decoupled from further movement of the control actuator. Alternatively, the structure between the control actuator and the jaws influences relative movement of the control actuator and the jaws at a predetermined closing force. In the latter instance, the method includes closing the jaws until the predetermined closing force has been reached so that the closing force applied by the jaws on the target tissue remains constant even with further movement of the control actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another desirable aspect of the present invention is a surgical apparatus for welding tissue comprising an elongated shaft having a means for cauterizing tissue attached to a distal end thereof, the shaft having an internal channel along its length for passage of gas. A control handle connects to the elongated shaft, and a passive filter mounts within the control handle to intercept gas passing in a proximal direction through the channel of the elongated shaft so as to filter the gas before it is released to the interior of the control handle or the environment. The means for cauterizing tissue may comprise a pair of jaws for closing on tissue, and preferably one of the jaws has an electrically-resistive heating element thereon. In a preferred embodiment, the elongated shaft has at least one port formed therein within the control handle open to the internal channel, and wherein the passive filter comprises a hollow permeable member arranged around the elongated shaft at the port. The passive filter may comprise a tubular member sealed at both ends around the elongated shaft and having an enlarged hollow cavity therein adjacent to which the port vents. The apparatus also incorporate means for insufflating a body cavity such that a positive pressure within the body cavity forces gas in a proximal direction through the internal channel of the elongated shaft.</p>

A control rod extends from the control handle to the distal end of the elongated shaft and connects to translate movement of the control actuator into movement of the jaws. Finally, an electromotive actuator interposed between the control actuator and the jaws displaces the control rod.</p>

The relatively movable jaws attach to a distal end of an elongated shaft, and at least one heating element is provided on the facing surface of one of the jaws. A control handle connects to the elongated shaft and a control actuator mounts on the handle for alternately separating and bringing together the facing surfaces of the elongated jaws. Additionally, a compliant layer on one of the elongated jaws deforms upon jaw closing and limits the magnitude of closing force of the jaws. In one configuration, the compliant layer is provided as a middle layer on one of the jaws with a rigid tissue contacting plate to the inside of the jaw that contacts tissue. Upon jaw closing, the compliant middle layer compresses to a greater extent at its proximal end such that the rigid tissue contacting plate floats on the jaw and helps even out clamping pressure on the tissue. In an alternative configuration, the compliant layer comprises a tissue contacting surface of one of the jaws, and the opposite jaw includes a heating element that projects inward from that jaw, wherein the compliant layer conforms to the shape of the heating element on the opposite jaw when the jaws are closed.</p>

The control actuator includes a cam slot that receives a member connected to the control rod, the cam slot being shaped to displace the control rod at a non-linear rate. Preferably, the cam slot is shaped such that as the jaws begin to come together their rate of closure decreases, and as the jaws begin to open their rate of separation increases.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to one aspect of the present invention devices and methods for sealing, or coagulating, and severing tissue during surgery are provided. The instruments incorporate means for controllably heating tissue while simultaneously applying a definite and controllable amount of pressure to the tissue being heated. Because of the combined application of heat and pressure, tissue proteins will become coagulated and blood vessels within the tissue will be sealed shut, achieving hemostasis. Optimal sealing or coagulating tissue means producing a strong and durable seal or coagulation or anastomosis with a minimal amount of collateral tissue damage.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">One aspect of the present invention includes a method and system for the surgical treatment of biological tissue, wherein thermal energy and pressure are applied simultaneously, substantially simultaneously, consecutively, or alternatively, over a time such that tissue proteins are denatured and the tissue will adhere or join to itself or to other tissues, for the purpose of coagulating bleeding, sealing tissue, joining tissue and cutting tissue. The minimum amount of heat or thermal energy needed to accomplish these goals is expended, so as to minimize thermal damage to tissue adjacent to the treated site.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The devices of the invention may also incorporate means for cutting, or severing the tissue. &#x201c;Severing&#x201d; includes dissecting or tissue division, tissue disruption or separation, plane development, or definition, or mobilization of tissue structures in combination with a coagulation, or hemostasis or sealing of blood vessels or other tissue structures such as lymphatics, or tissue joining. Severing can be achieved by use of amounts of heat greater than the amount required to coagulate the tissues, yet a minimum amount of energy is used with the least amount of unwanted tissue necrosis. In conjunction with some aspect of the invention, severing can be achieved by other mechanical, ultrasonic, or electronic means, including, but not limited to, shearing action, laser energy, and RF, or a combination of two or more of the above. For example, a blade may be passed through the coagulated tissue while the tissue is being held in the jaws of the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The present invention desirably provides a tissue welder that can be incorporated as a component of an integrated vessel harvesting system, such as is disclosed in application Ser. No. 10/951,426, filed Sep. 28, 2004, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. The vessel harvesting system is especially useful in minimally invasive endoscopic harvesting of blood vessels, including harvesting of internal thoracic artery, or vessels of the extremities along the radial artery in the arm for use in coronary artery bypass grafting, and the saphenous vein in the leg for use in both coronary artery bypass grafting and peripheral artery bypass. In this context, the tissue welder performs both a severing and securing/welding function in separating side branches from the target vessel that is being harvested. It should be understood, however, that various aspects of the tissue welder described herein may be utilized in conjunction with other surgical systems for coagulating and/or dissecting tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The exemplary embodiment of the tissue welder of the present invention comprises a so-called &#x201c;welding and severing device&#x201d; that is used to close off and separate side branches from a primary vessel being harvested, and also possibly to sever the primary vessel. However, the device is disclosed herein are suitable for welding and severing tissue in general not just vessels. In its broadest sense, the term tissue welding and severing device refers to any and all devices that accomplish a single function or any combination of the functions of welding, ligating, cauterizing, coagulating and/or sealing, and severing or transecting target tissue. For example, electrocautery tools such as bipolar scissors (or other plural electrode-based devices), monopolar devices, tissue bisectors, or other such devices provide these functions alone or in conjunction with an integral blade or cutter. Other similar devices using various acceptable sources of energy for sealing the tissue (for example, RF, microwave, laser, ultrasound, direct thermal energy, etc.) are also within the scope of the present invention. Each device that acts on tissue to either weld or sever it will be termed an energy applicator. The welding and severing device could be a single tool or a combination of plurality of separate tools each having its own function useful in tissue severing, or more specifically in vessel harvesting.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Parenthetically, it is important to note that, while each of the various aspects of the present invention may be used to advantage in combination with the other aspects, each is believed to also be of patentable significance when used alone with otherwise conventional systems and techniques. Thus, the tissue welding devices and methods may be implemented using heating and control structures other than those disclosed herein, and in the context of systems other than those for vessel harvesting. Furthermore, various aspects of the tissue welder disclosed herein may be utilized with other welding and severing devices, such as bipolar scissors or tissue bisectors. Similarly, certain aspects of the coagulation function of the tissue welder may be combined with a mechanical cutter to provide the severing function.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Finally, it should be understood that the exemplary and/or alternative tissue welders and features described herein have numerous applications in addition to vessel harvesting. For example, a tissue welder may be utilized in gastric bypass surgery to resect and close a portion of the stomach. Similarly, volume reduction of the lungs in patients with emphysema can also be accomplished with the devices disclosed herein. Bowel resection is another potential application. Other surgical procedures include: femoral popliteal bypass; severing/ligating epigastric arteries for gastric reflux disease; fallopian tube ligation; vasectomies; severing/ligating arteries, veins, and bile ducts in gallbladder removal surgery; and nephrectomies where the ureters leading to the kidney are transected and ligated.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> illustrate a modular handle unit <b>20</b> of an exemplary vessel harvesting system comprising a mating handle base <b>22</b> and handle sled <b>24</b>. The handle base <b>22</b> includes a distal flange <b>26</b> secured to an elongated cannula <b>28</b>. The cannula <b>28</b> is sized to extend into a body cavity and provides a channel for various vessel harvesting tools. The handle sled <b>24</b> includes structure for mating with the handle base <b>22</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Various modular handle units and vessel harvesting systems are illustrated and described in aforementioned application Ser. No. 10/951,426, filed Sep. 28, 2004.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, the handle sled <b>24</b> provides an adapter for multipurpose handle bases common to a number of vessel harvesting systems, such that a tissue welding and severing device <b>30</b> of the present invention may be used for vessel harvesting within the system. Specifically, the handle sled or adapter <b>24</b> provides a port <b>32</b> leading to an internal angled channel <b>34</b> through which the elongated shaft <b>36</b> of the welding and severing device <b>30</b> may extend. The handle base <b>22</b> and handle sled <b>24</b> couple such that the elongated shaft <b>36</b> is guided through the distal flange <b>26</b> and harvesting cannula <b>28</b>. The final assembly as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows that some of the movement controls for the harvesting tools are located on the handle unit <b>20</b>, while rotation of the welding and severing device <b>30</b> is accomplished by manipulating the entire handle <b>38</b> relative to the sled <b>24</b> with a second hand.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> also illustrates an enlarged distal end of the cannula <b>28</b> through which a distal end of the tissue severing/welding device <b>30</b> projects. The device <b>30</b> comprises a pair of relatively movable elongated jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> on its distal end, which are shown open. Preferably, a mechanism within the handle <b>38</b> includes an actuator <b>44</b> for opening and closing the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. The jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are elongated generally in a proximal-distal direction such that they are much longer in that direction than in either orthogonal or transverse axis.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">It should be understood that the term &#x201c;jaw&#x201d; refers to a member that may be brought together with another similar member or other structure such that jaw-facing surfaces on both members are brought into contact or close proximity. A jaw may be provided on a clamp, tweezers, forceps, or similar grasping tools. The jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are mounted such that their proximal ends are journalled about common or different but closely spaced pivots and their distal ends open and close. Of course, the jaws may be mounted for parallel movement instead of in a pivoting action. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a &#x201c;hot&#x201d; jaw and a &#x201c;cold&#x201d; jaw, the difference being that only one jaw is actively heated. It should be emphasized, however, that certain aspects of the present invention are applicable to different jaw configurations, such as both being &#x201c;hot&#x201d; jaws, or both being &#x201c;cold&#x201d; jaws with a separate source of heat.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In a preferred embodiment, the first jaw <b>40</b> comprises a &#x201c;hot&#x201d; jaw, while the second jaw <b>42</b> is a &#x201c;cold&#x201d; jaw. The term &#x201c;hot&#x201d; refers to the presence of at least one active heating element thereon, while a &#x201c;cold&#x201d; jaw provides no active heating (but may become hot from indirect heating by the other jaw). In the illustrated embodiment, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the first or &#x201c;hot&#x201d; jaw <b>40</b> includes a first heating element <b>46</b> for welding tissue and a second heating element <b>48</b> for severing tissue. The first heating element <b>46</b> is adapted to heat up to a first temperature upon application of current therethrough, while the second heating element <b>48</b> is adapted to heat up to a second temperature upon application of current therethrough which is greater than the first temperature. Conventional understanding is that when vascular tissue is heated in excess of 100&#xb0; C., the tissue will be broken down and is thus, &#x201c;cut&#x201d;. However, when vascular tissue is heated to temperatures between 50 to 90&#xb0; C., the tissue will instead simply &#x201c;seal&#x201d; or &#x201c;weld&#x201d; to adjacent tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Various means are described herein for ensuring that the first heating element <b>46</b> heats up to within a welding temperature zone but not to a cutting temperature threshold, while the second heating element <b>48</b> heats up past the welding temperature zone into the cutting temperature zone. For example, the relative electrical resistance values of the first and second heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> may be such that they heat up to different temperatures. Alternatively, the materials used may be the same, but the first and second heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> may be shaped in a manner that causes their differential heating. Still further, the current passed through the two heating elements may be unequal.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> also basically illustrates a preferred configuration of the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and a distal end of the shaft <b>36</b> extending through a distal end of the elongated cannula <b>28</b>. In particular, the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are arranged to pivot apart about a common axis, represented by pivot pin <b>50</b>. An exemplary mechanism for opening and closing the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> will be described in detail below. Each of the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> includes an inner jaw member of rigid material and a boot <b>52</b><i>a, </i><b>52</b><i>b </i>(as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) surrounding the inner jaw member that is made of the material that resists tissue adhesions during operation of the device. In one embodiment, the inner jaw members are made of stainless steel, but other materials that provide less of a heat sink may be used. Preferably, the boots <b>52</b><i>a, </i><b>52</b><i>b </i>are made of a heat-resistant silicone rubber. The boots <b>52</b><i>a, </i><b>52</b><i>b </i>also provide some thermal insulation around the inner jaw members to reduce heat losses thereto. The first and second heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are arranged external to the boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>on the first jaw <b>40</b>, in particular on a surface of the jaw that faces the other jaw.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> provide a number of assembled, exploded, and other partial views of the distal end of an exemplary tissue welding and severing device <b>30</b> of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>, the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are shown closed at the distal end of the welding and severing device <b>30</b>. The device <b>30</b> includes a generally tubular distal tip <b>54</b> that fits on the end of the device shaft <b>36</b> and houses a mechanism (described below) for opening and closing the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. Both jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> exhibit a shallow curvature along their lengths such that their jaw-facing surfaces contact along a curved line. In a preferred embodiment, the entire distal assembly of the device <b>30</b> including the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> is sized to fit through a 5 mm diameter port, thus enabling use in minimally invasive surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> preferably incorporate a multiple heater welding system on a &#x201c;hot&#x201d; jaw <b>40</b>. At a minimum, at least two heating element are provided, with one heating element adapted to sever tissue and a second heating element adapted to weld or coagulate tissue. In an exemplary embodiment, the jaw <b>40</b> incorporates a &#x201c;tri-heater&#x201d; arrangement with one heating element for cutting and two heating elements for welding disposed on either side of the cutter. Desirably, the heating elements extend longitudinally from a proximal to a distal end of the jaw <b>40</b>, with the cutter generally centrally located and the two welders symmetrically located on either side.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> illustrate the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> in their open configuration. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the first heating element <b>46</b> is preferably bifurcated into two welding members separated laterally, with a single second heating element <b>48</b> provided therebetween. The bifurcated welding members of the first heating element <b>46</b> each provide a weld region within the tissue, while the second heating element <b>48</b> cuts the tissue within the weld region. Technically, therefore, the hot jaw <b>40</b> includes three heating elements: a central cutting element and two adjacent welding elements. Although the exemplary embodiment combines the two adjacent welding elements in a single piece, they could easily be constructed separately. As mentioned above, one or both jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> include inner jaw members surrounded by a boot <b>52</b><i>a, </i><b>52</b><i>b. </i>The boot <b>52</b><i>b </i>around the second jaw <b>42</b> is preferably provided with a series of lateral serrations <b>60</b> that facilitate gripping and prevent slipping of the tissue when clamped between the jaws. Because of the presence of the first and second heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> on the exterior of the boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>on the first jaw <b>40</b>, no serrations are necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the components of the distal end of the device <b>30</b> exploded, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> best illustrate the specific shapes and subassembly of the first and second heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, and how they mount on and cooperate with the first jaw <b>40</b>. The inner jaw member <b>62</b> (seen isolated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8H</figref>) of the first or &#x201c;hot&#x201d; jaw <b>40</b> comprises an elongated and curved distal portion <b>64</b> and a proximal pivot housing <b>66</b>, including through holes for pivotal movement with respect to the other jaw. More specifically, the proximal pivot housing <b>66</b> of the inner jaw member <b>62</b> includes a large circular through hole <b>67</b> and an angled slot <b>68</b>, both formed in an outer wall section <b>69</b>. A pair of sidewalls <b>70</b> upstanding from the outer wall section <b>69</b> provide a space on the inner side of the pivot housing <b>66</b> within which electrical wires and a pivot mechanism are received, as explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The first heating element <b>46</b> comprises a proximal crimp <b>72</b> and flange <b>73</b>. Two elongated welding members <b>74</b> extend from the proximal crimp and flange in a distal direction and curl back upon themselves to terminate at a common barb <b>75</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). The elongated welding members <b>74</b> preferably comprise thin, rectangular strips each having a lateral width W that extend in parallel across a spaced distance S. Because the welding members <b>74</b> are connected at their proximal ends by the crimp <b>72</b> and flange <b>73</b> structure, and at their distal ends by the common barb <b>75</b>, they define a bifurcated portion of the first heating element <b>46</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the first heating element <b>46</b> comprises a single, homogeneous piece of metal (e.g., stainless steel) that has been formed into the illustrated shape by stamping, bending, machining, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The second heating element <b>48</b> extends between and in parallel with the spaced welding members <b>74</b> and is separated therefrom by air gaps. The heating element <b>48</b> also extends in a distal direction the same length as the welding member <b>74</b> and curls back upon itself to terminate at a connection end <b>76</b> adjacent the barb <b>75</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). The connection end <b>76</b> and barb <b>75</b> are electrically connected using a resistance or spot weld, for example. In the context of the present application, the term &#x201c;resistance weld&#x201d; used to describe the joint between two mechanical parts encompasses all suitable varieties of such joints, including for example, spot welds, laser welds, soldered joints, brazed joints, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As seen in the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the heating element <b>48</b> may comprise an elongated wire or rod, and the connection end <b>76</b> may be formed by a separate U-shaped coupling <b>77</b> forming a series extension thereon. The second heating element <b>48</b> has a raised profile relative to the first heating element <b>46</b> in a direction toward the second jaw <b>42</b>. This enhances the differential ability of the second heating element <b>48</b> to cut through tissue while the first heating element <b>46</b> welds. Furthermore, the strip-like welding members <b>74</b> of the first heating element <b>46</b> each have flat jaw-facing surfaces, while the second heating element <b>48</b> defines a cylindrical jaw-facing surface having a lateral width smaller than that of either welding member.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">An exemplary first heating element <b>46</b> is seen isolated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9E</figref>. These illustrations show a heating element <b>46</b> that is slightly different than the one shown in preceding figures, although either may be used with good results. The difference is in the distal end which exhibits a flange <b>78</b> that is bent, for example, at 90&#xb0; instead of curling back into the barb <b>75</b> toward the proximal end. The flange <b>78</b> is forked to define a generally semi-circular opening <b>80</b> that receives the second heating element <b>48</b>. Although not shown, in this version the second heating element <b>48</b> curls 180&#xb0; into the opening <b>80</b> and is secured in electrical contact therewith using a resistance weld, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Now with specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, the heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are shown having conductor wires attached thereto to form a series circuit. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 7A</figref>, a pair of insulated conductor wires <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> form part of a circuit path through the heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. The first conductor wire <b>82</b> is in electrical communication with the first heating element <b>46</b> by virtue of a resistance weld at the proximal crimp <b>72</b>, while the second conductor wire <b>84</b> is in electrical communication with the second heating element <b>48</b>. An insulated sleeve around the second conductor wire <b>84</b> extends through an aperture formed in the flange <b>73</b> of the first heating element <b>46</b>. The barb <b>75</b> and connection end <b>76</b> are electrically connected such that the first and second heating element <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> define a current loop all along the length of the jaw <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Current through the conductors <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> therefore passes in series through the first and second heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. Current through the two heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> remains separated to the common distal end thereof, and in particular to the resistance weld between the barb <b>75</b> and connection end <b>76</b>. Because of the bifurcation of the first heating element <b>46</b> into the separate welding members <b>74</b>, each of the welding members <b>74</b> conducts in parallel approximately half of the current that passes through the second heating element <b>48</b>. It should be understood, therefore, that if the heating elements are identical in shape and material, each welding member <b>74</b> would heat up to a temperature less than that which the second heating element <b>48</b> attains because of the split current. This differential helps ensure that the first heating element <b>46</b> reaches the welding zone temperatures, while the second heating element <b>48</b> reaches temperatures within the cutting zone. In the illustrated embodiment, the separate welding members <b>74</b> each have a wider profile (i.e., larger surface area) facing the tissue in a plane transverse to the direction of elongation of the jaw <b>40</b> than does the second heating element <b>48</b>. This structural difference in conjunction with the lower current and thus lower temperature helps facilitate a welding action on the tissue as opposed to a cutting action, in contrast to the central heating element <b>48</b> which is both narrower and hotter (and raised up higher).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Advantageously, however, the second heating element <b>48</b> is constructed so as to have a higher electrical resistance than either of the welding members <b>74</b>, and therefore even more of the already larger current dissipates as heat. This combined phenomena of higher current and higher resistance causes the second heating element <b>48</b> to heat up to a cutting temperature zone, while the first heating of the <b>46</b> only reaches temperatures in the tissue welding zone. In a preferred embodiment, the first heating element <b>46</b> is made of a suitable conductive metal such as 301 stainless steel, while the second heating element <b>48</b> comprises a tube of rigid material with filler having a higher magnitude of electrical resistance than the tube, the combination having an electrical resistance greater than stainless steel. In one specific embodiment, the tube is made of a nickel-chromium alloy such as INCONEL 625 and is filled with an electrically insulating but thermally conductive ceramic such as magnesium oxide (MgO) powder. Consequently, a greater current density passes through the hollow tube than if it were solid, and therefore the material reaches a higher temperature at any given current. Additionally, the inner thermally conductive ceramic does not unduly restrict conductive heat flow through the element <b>48</b>. Preferably, the second heating element <b>48</b> has a relatively high resistance of about 0.2 Ohms, and the entire system of the first and second heating elements has an average resistance of about 0.72 Ohms, and preferably less than 0.8 Ohms.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">It is important to understand that the present invention contemplates at least one cutting element and at least one welding element, electrically connected in series or not. For example, the illustrated embodiment may be modified by utilizing two current paths, one for the first (welding) heating element <b>46</b> and one for the second (cutting) heating element <b>48</b>. Alternatively, one cutting element and a single (i.e., not bifurcated) welding element may be provided on the hot jaw, both forming a part of a common current path. Finally, the same arrangement can be utilized with separate current paths. Moreover, as mentioned above, the cutting element may be provided on one jaw while the welding element is provided on the opposite jaw. In each of these alternative configurations, the common denominator is that upon application of a common or separate currents, the cutting element reaches a higher temperature than the welding element.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10H</figref> show a number of views of an exemplary boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>used on the &#x201c;hot&#x201d; jaw <b>40</b>. As mentioned above, the boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>is made of material such as silicone rubber that resists tissue adhesions, and thus facilitates multiple tissue severing/welding operations prior to a reduction in the effectiveness of the jaws because of such tissue adhesions. The boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>provides electrical insulation between the heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, and also provides thermal insulation, thus helping to retain heat to the space between the jaws as opposed to being lost to the often metallic inner jaws <b>62</b>. The boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>generally comprises a hollow sleeve having an open proximal end <b>86</b> and a partially closed distal end <b>88</b>. An upper surface <b>90</b> that faces the cold jaw <b>40</b> when the boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>is mounted on the hot jaw <b>40</b> includes a pair of longitudinally-oriented rails <b>92</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10D and 10G</figref>, the rails <b>92</b> are generally evenly spaced apart and provide guide channels for the bifurcated first heating element <b>46</b> and the central second heating element <b>48</b>. The distal end <b>88</b> of the boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>has an opening into which extend the joined and curled or bent distal ends of the two heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. This holds the distal ends of the two electrodes on the hot jaw <b>40</b>. It should be noted that the distal end of the inner jaw member <b>62</b> has a forked depression as seen at <b>93</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. The insulating boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>is molded so that it has an inside shape which conforms within this depression <b>93</b>, and also provides an outwardly opening cavity to receive the joined barb <b>75</b> and connection end <b>76</b>. The arrowhead shape of the barb <b>75</b> helps secure the heating elements in place with respect to the soft insulating boot <b>52</b><i>a, </i>which, again, is preferably silicone rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref> illustrate the integration of the combined heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and conductor wires <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> into the inner jaw member <b>62</b>. As seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the proximal crimp <b>72</b> secures the first heating element <b>46</b> and an extension of the silicone boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>to an upstanding flange <b>94</b> of the pivot housing <b>66</b>. The conductor wires <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> are routed through the space in the pivot housing <b>66</b> formed by the pair of sidewalls <b>70</b>. The first conductor wire <b>82</b> extends straight along one side wall <b>70</b> and is resistance welded or otherwise secured to the proximal crimp <b>72</b> of the first heating element <b>46</b>. The second conductor wire <b>84</b> follows a bent path along the other side wall <b>70</b> and passes through the aforementioned aperture formed in the proximal flange <b>73</b> of the first heating element <b>46</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a bushing <b>96</b> having an upstanding shaft stub <b>98</b> assembled over the pivot housing <b>66</b>. The bushing <b>96</b> forms a part of a mechanism for opening and closing the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, and will be more clearly described below.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">One aspect of the present invention that facilitates assembly and thus reduces fabrication cost, is the integrated nature of the heating element subsystem. The subsystem is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 7A</figref>, and consists of five parts: the first heating element <b>46</b>, the second heating element <b>48</b>, the pivot housing <b>66</b> (typically fabricated integral with the first inner jaw <b>62</b>), and the two wires <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> that provide current through the series heating elements. These five parts are held together with several crimps, or desirably resistance welds, or both, and may be easily assembled prior to integration with the rest of the hot jaw <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As mentioned above, either or both of the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> includes an inner jaw member covered with a boot. The exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows both the inner jaw member <b>62</b> of the hot jaw <b>40</b>, and an inner jaw member <b>102</b> of the second or &#x201c;cold&#x201d; jaw <b>42</b>, along with the associated boots <b>52</b><i>a, </i><b>52</b><i>b. </i>Both boots <b>52</b><i>a, </i><b>52</b><i>b </i>fit over and surround the curved distal portions of the inner jaw members <b>62</b>, <b>102</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In prior tissue welders, stainless steel inner jaw members were conveniently used as the return conduction path for the current passing through one or more electrodes. This had a distinct disadvantage in that some of the current was dissipated as resistance heat generated within the inner jaw member. This also had a disadvantage of heat conduction from heating element into jaw that resulted in less efficient energy delivery to tissue and potential inadvertent thermal injury. In one aspect the present invention not only physically decouples the heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> from the first inner jaw member <b>62</b>, in that a layer of the insulating boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>is interposed therebetween, but no current runs through the inner jaw member. The series connection between the distal barb <b>75</b> and connection end <b>76</b> means that the entire electrical conduction path along the hot jaw runs only through the heating elements <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. In this way, the efficiency of conversion of electrical energy into desirable resistance heat is maximized, and the footprint of the device on tissue other than that directly in contact with the heating elements is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In addition to being able to weld and sever tissue, and in particular blood vessels, the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> may also be capable of performing fasciotomy, or an incision through fascia (e.g., bands or fillets of fibrous tissue that separate different layers of tissue). As seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, where the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are shown open, the second heating element <b>48</b>, the &#x201c;cutter wire,&#x201d; extends the full-length of the jaw along its midplane. In addition, it is positioned so as to be raised upward from the surrounding weld members of the first heating element <b>46</b> and thus presents the first surface of the hot jaw <b>40</b> to contact tissue received within the jaws. Fasciotomy can be performed by merely pushing the open jaws through a band of tissue with the second heating element <b>48</b> energized such that it cuts the tissue by heating it above the cutting temperature. Of course, in the exemplary embodiment the first heating element <b>46</b> also heats up, although this will have negligible impact on the fasciotomy procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also illustrates a tapered tip <b>103</b> on the distal end of the inner jaw member <b>102</b> of the second or &#x201c;cold&#x201d; jaw <b>42</b>. This tip <b>103</b> helps facilitate blunt dissection of tissue when the device is used as such. The surrounding boot <b>52</b><i>b </i>will have a similar taper. In a preferred embodiment, the inner jaw member <b>102</b> has a generally rectangular cross-section, and the tip <b>103</b> has two tapers provided on the opposite straight sides. Of course, other arrangements such as a more rounded cross-section and a conically-tapered tip <b>103</b> may be substituted. Moreover, the inner jaw member <b>102</b> of the cold jaw <b>42</b> is slightly longer than the more blunt inner jaw member <b>62</b> of the first jaw <b>40</b> to further ease dissection of tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Attachment of the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> to the distal end of the tissue welder shaft <b>36</b>, and an exemplary mechanism for opening and closing the jaws will now be described. With reference to the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the pivot housing <b>66</b> of the first inner jaw member <b>62</b> comes together with a proximal pivot housing <b>104</b> of the second inner jaw member <b>102</b>, capturing the bushing <b>96</b> therebetween. The bushing <b>96</b> includes oppositely directed shaft stubs <b>98</b> that fit within the aligned apertures formed in the pivot housings <b>66</b>, <b>104</b>, such as the aperture <b>67</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. The bushing <b>96</b> includes features on one side that mate with the particular shape of the pivot housing <b>66</b> and conductor wires <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> arranged therein. In this regard, the bushing <b>96</b> is fixed with respect to the pivot housing <b>66</b> of the first inner jaw member <b>62</b>. The pivot housing <b>104</b> of the second inner jaw member <b>102</b>, on the other hand, includes a flat lower surface that slides across a flat upper surface of the bushing <b>96</b> when the housing pivots about the shaft stub <b>98</b>. Consequently, the first inner jaw member <b>62</b> and second inner jaw member <b>102</b> are permitted to pivot with respect one another about the shaft stubs of the bushing <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also shows the distal end of the flexible shaft <b>36</b> which includes a stepped-down portion <b>110</b>. The flexible shaft <b>36</b> is hollow and receives a control rod <b>112</b> therethrough. A generally Y-shaped yolk <b>114</b> attaches to the distal end of control rod <b>112</b> through a resistance weld or similar expedient (not shown). Linear movement of the control rod <b>112</b> therefore also moves the yolk <b>114</b>. The generally tubular shaft tip <b>54</b> fits over the stepped-down portion <b>110</b> and is secured thereto with a rivet <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">With reference primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, but also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the tubular shaft tip <b>54</b> includes a bifurcated distal end having a pair of arms <b>120</b> defining side openings <b>122</b> therebetween. As will be explained, the pivot housings <b>66</b>, <b>104</b> of the jaws extend between the arms <b>120</b> and the side openings <b>122</b> permit pivotal movement thereof. The assembly of the two pivot housings <b>66</b>, <b>104</b> with the bushing <b>96</b> therebetween is sandwiched between a pair of small spacers <b>124</b> that have flat inner surfaces and partial cylindrical outer surfaces. The spacers <b>124</b> include through bores that align with the apertures <b>67</b> in the pivot housings and with the inserted shaft stubs <b>98</b>. The jaw assembly including spacers <b>124</b> then fits between the bifurcated arms <b>120</b> and is secured therein with a rivet <b>126</b> that passes through a pair of apertures <b>128</b> in the fingers, and through the aforementioned apertures. The jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> therefore pivot about the shaft stubs <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Both of the pivot housings <b>66</b>, <b>104</b> include the angled slots <b>68</b> that are generally aligned with elongated slots <b>130</b> formed in both of the arms <b>120</b> of the shaft tip <b>54</b>. As seen in the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the angled slots <b>68</b> are oppositely oriented with respect to one another. The combined thickness of the assembled pivot housings <b>66</b>, <b>104</b> fits between the bifurcated fingers of the yolk <b>114</b> and a rivet <b>132</b> passes through apertures in the distal ends of the yolk fingers and through the angled slots <b>68</b>. In this way, linear movement of the yolk <b>114</b> translates into linear movement of the rivet <b>132</b>, which in turn opens and closes the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> through a camming action in the angled slots <b>68</b>. The elongated slots <b>130</b> provide clearance for the rivet heads, ensure planar alignment of the rivets, and also facilitate assembly thereof. With the angled slots <b>68</b> oriented as shown, the jaws will be open when the control rod <b>112</b> is displaced distally, while proximal movement of the control rod closes the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Electricity can be delivered to the jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> through the conductor wires <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, or directly through the pivoting mechanism just described. For example, the control rod <b>112</b> may be electrically conductive and provide current to the inner jaw members and <b>62</b>, <b>102</b> via the connecting the yolk, pins, and angled slots. The return current path might be provided by a single conductive wire. The illustrated embodiment utilizing conductor wires <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> is preferred because it eliminates moving parts from the electrical conduction path.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Within the constraints of the small diameter design (less than 5 mm), the jaw movement mechanism should be relatively robust to be capable of applying a closing force of around 1-3 lb, preferably about 1 lb, and an opening force of around 1-3 lb. Further, the jaw opening distance at the distal tips thereof is desirably about 8 mm. In addition to welding and cutting tissue, the jaws can also be used for blunt dissection because of the tapered and rounded outer shape of the jaws. This blunt dissection can also be enhanced by the relatively robust opening force provided by the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As will be apparent, the jaw opening and closing function can be achieved in many different ways. The present invention, in its broad interpretation, is not particularly limited to any one type of mechanism. For example, instead of both jaws pivoting about a common axis, a series of linkage members may be utilized with the jaws pivoting about spaced axes. The form of jaw opening apparatus is preferably chosen to minimize cost and optimize transfer of linear force to pivoting movement of the jaws. Optionally, the pivoting mechanism is configured such that the jaw-facing surfaces of the jaws remain parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">An exemplary control handle <b>38</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11C</figref> and <b>12</b> contains a mechanism for actuating the control rod <b>112</b> and opening and closing the jaws, in addition to several other desirable features. The control handle <b>38</b> is seen in elevation and two opposite partial sectional views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11C</figref>. The control handle <b>38</b> includes an outer housing <b>140</b> formed by the juxtaposition of two molded housing halves <b>140</b><i>a, </i><b>140</b><i>b. </i>The outer housing <b>140</b> includes a plurality of walls and/or bulkheads <b>141</b> that defined therebetween a series of internal housing cavities. A distal through bore formed in the outer housing receives the flexible shaft <b>36</b> leading to the distal jaws <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. The aforementioned actuator <b>44</b>, in the illustrated example, is journalled to pivot about a pin <b>142</b> fixed with respect to the housing, and includes a thumb pad <b>144</b> opposite the pin <b>142</b>. A narrow section of the actuator <b>44</b> travels within a proximal-distal slot <b>146</b> in the housing <b>140</b> such that the thumb pad <b>144</b> provides a slider for the user. The actuator <b>44</b> is therefore constrained to pivot in a hollow space between the two housing halves <b>140</b><i>a, </i><b>140</b><i>b </i>and the thumb pad <b>144</b> travels between opposite ends of the slot <b>146</b>. Movement of the slider <b>144</b> in a distal direction (to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>) closes the jaws, while movement of the slider in the proximal direction (to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>) opens the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The exemplary control handle <b>38</b> includes circuitry for energizing the aforementioned heating elements at the distal end of the tool in addition to the mechanism for opening and closing the jaws. Although the invention is not limited to one particular switching arrangement, the exemplary embodiment includes a weld/cut switch that actuates both the welding heating element and the cutting heating element simultaneously, and coincident with the jaw closed position. Moreover, the control handle <b>38</b> includes a governor for limiting the force that can be applied by the jaws on tissue held therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">With reference still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11C</figref>, and in particular the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the actuator <b>44</b> possesses an enlarged mid-section <b>150</b> having a vertically elongated proximal-distal through bore <b>152</b> defined therewithin. The through bore <b>152</b> receives therein a rod <b>154</b> having a proximal head <b>156</b> and a distal head <b>158</b>. The proximal end of the rod <b>154</b> extends through a force transfer block <b>160</b> and into a cavity to the proximal side of the actuator <b>44</b>. The force transfer block <b>160</b> translates in a proximal-distal direction between a pair of guide walls <b>162</b> formed in the housing and includes a bore that slides over the rod <b>154</b>. A force-limiting spring <b>164</b> closely surrounds the rod and is constrained between the proximal head <b>156</b> and the force transfer block <b>160</b>. The distal end of the rod <b>154</b> extends to the distal side of the actuator <b>44</b> such that the distal head <b>158</b> is captured within a force coupler <b>166</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates best the internal contours of the generally box-shaped force coupler <b>166</b> which includes a large cavity, a smaller cavity in which the distal head <b>158</b> is received, and a pair of slots on opposite ends thereof (elements not numbered for clarity). One side of the force coupler <b>166</b> is removed to facilitate assembly of the cooperating parts, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. Like the force transfer block <b>160</b>, the force coupler <b>166</b> translates in a proximal-distal direction between a pair of guide walls <b>174</b> formed in the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, a small tang <b>180</b> projects laterally from the enlarged mid-section <b>150</b> of the actuator <b>44</b>. The tang <b>180</b> is positioned to engage and trip a weld/cut switch <b>182</b> mounted within the housing <b>140</b>. That is, the switch <b>182</b> is fixed with the respect to the housing <b>140</b>, while the tang <b>180</b> pivots with the actuator <b>44</b>. When the thumb pad <b>144</b> translates in a proximal direction within the slot <b>146</b>, the actuator <b>44</b> pivots in a clockwise direction until the tang <b>180</b> actuates the lever of the weld/cut switch <b>182</b>. An electrical wire <b>184</b> extends into the proximal end of the handle <b>38</b> and provides power to the switch <b>182</b>. From there, an electrical lead <b>186</b> continues in the distal direction and passes through the flexible shaft <b>36</b> to the heating elements on the jaws at the distal end of the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11B and 11C</figref> illustrate a cylindrical filter <b>190</b> captured between bulkheads <b>141</b> at the distal end of the housing <b>140</b>. The generally tubular filter <b>190</b> is seen exploded in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, and includes a stepped through bore <b>192</b> that receives, on either end, a pair of O-rings <b>194</b>. The O-rings <b>194</b> each have an inner diameter that closely fits and seals around the flexible shaft <b>36</b>. The shaft <b>36</b> extends into the distal end of the housing <b>140</b>, through the filter <b>190</b>, and terminates at a seal <b>196</b> adjacent one of the bulkheads <b>141</b> of the housing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, the control rod <b>112</b> continues through the seal <b>196</b> and into the force coupler <b>166</b>. A collar <b>200</b> received in the large cavity of the force coupler <b>166</b> fastens to the proximal end of the control rod <b>112</b> with a set screw <b>202</b>. In this manner, the proximal end of the control rod <b>112</b> is constrained by the collar <b>200</b> within the force coupler <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In use, the operator slides the thumb pad <b>144</b> in a distal direction along the slot <b>146</b> as seen by arrow <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> to pivot the actuator <b>44</b> and open the jaws of the tool. As the actuator <b>44</b> pivots, its angular movement is accommodated by the elongated through bore <b>152</b> over the rod <b>154</b>. A curved distal face of the enlarged mid-section <b>150</b> eventually contacts the proximal end of the force coupler <b>166</b> and acts as a cam to urge it in a distal direction. Because the collar <b>200</b> is constrained within the larger cavity of the force coupler <b>166</b>, it also translates in a distal direction which, in turn, pushes the control rod <b>112</b> distally. In this embodiment, there is no clutch or force-limiter interposed between the actuator <b>44</b> and distal movement of the control rod <b>112</b> to open the jaws. Therefore, the extent that the jaws open is limited by the extent of travel of the thumb pad <b>144</b>, or by the hinge mechanism of the jaws themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Conversely, the operator slides the thumb pad <b>144</b> in a proximal direction along the slot <b>146</b> as seen by arrow <b>206</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> to pivot the actuator <b>44</b> and close the jaws of the tool. A curved proximal face of the enlarged mid-section <b>150</b> eventually contacts the distal end of the force transfer block <b>160</b> and acts as a cam to urge it in a proximal direction. Because the force transfer block <b>160</b> is free to slide over the rod <b>154</b>, it moves in a proximal direction toward and compresses the spring <b>164</b>. Compression of the force-limiting spring <b>164</b> applies a proximally-directed force to the proximal head <b>156</b> of the rod <b>154</b>. Because the distal head <b>158</b> is constrained within the stepped cavity of the force coupler <b>166</b>, which in turn is connected to the control rod <b>112</b>, the resistance to proximal displacement of the rod <b>154</b> is provided by any force resisting closure of the jaws (assuming minimal frictional forces acting on the control rod <b>112</b>). Prior to the jaws clamping any tissue, this resistance to proximal displacement of the rod <b>154</b> is minimal and proximal displacement of the force transfer block <b>160</b> translates into equivalent displacement of the control rod <b>112</b>. However, when the jaws finally close on tissue, the maximum closing force of the jaws is limited by the stiffness of the spring <b>164</b>. Specifically, after the jaws close a constant force is applied to the tissue therebetween because of the spring <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Through careful calibration of the force-limiting spring <b>164</b> in conjunction with the particular jaws on the tool, this closing force can be limited to less than that which would unduly crush or otherwise cause trauma to the tissue within the jaws. Those of skill in the art will understand that it is the pressure applied to the tissue that must be limited, and that the pressure partly depends on the shape and size of the jaws, as well as the elastic constant of the spring <b>164</b>. Desirably, the force imparted on tissue by the jaws is between about 1-3 lbs (0.45-1.36 kg), and preferably about 1 lb, as regulated by the spring <b>164</b>. This preferred range of force ensures the heating elements effectively weld and sever tissue held within the facing surfaces of the jaws in a reasonably short amount time, preferably within 5 seconds or less. That is, applying a force of less than 1 lb to tissue tends to delay the cutting function, while application of a force greater than 3 lbs tends to sever the tissue before an effective weld is formed. Again, this preferred force range and operation time to depend upon the size and shape of the jaws. However, given the constraints of endoscopic tissue welding, in particular during vessel harvesting procedures, these parameters are believed to encompass a wide range of suitable jaw types.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">To better explained the desirable weld parameters of the tissue welder, the reader is directed back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8H</figref> showing the inner jaw member <b>62</b> of the hot jaw, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10H</figref> showing the boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>that covers the inner jaw member <b>62</b>. The inner jaw member <b>62</b> has the curved distal portion <b>64</b> extending from the proximal pivot housing <b>66</b>, and a length from the circular pivot hole <b>67</b> to its distal tip of approximately 0.740 inches (18.80 mm). As mentioned above, the inner jaw member <b>102</b> of the cold jaw <b>42</b> is slightly longer than the more blunt inner jaw member <b>62</b> of the first jaw <b>40</b> to ease dissection of tissue, and preferably has a length of approximately 0.765 inches (19.43 mm). Desirably, the jaw member <b>62</b> is made of stainless steel, although other materials, thermally conductive or otherwise, may be utilized. The transverse cross-sectional shape of the distal portion <b>64</b> is approximately square adjacent the pivot housing <b>66</b>, having a dimension on each side of approximately 0.060 inches (1.52 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The dimension of the tissue-facing side of the distal portion <b>64</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>, remains constant along the length of the jaw member <b>62</b>, while the perpendicular dimension seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8D and 8F</figref> gradually tapers smaller toward the distal tip to a final dimension of about 0.031 inches (0.79 mm). The boot <b>52</b><i>a </i>seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10H</figref> has an overall length sufficient to cover the curved distal portion <b>64</b>, and a transverse tissue-facing width of approximately 0.082 inches (2.083 mm). The dimensional parameters of the boot <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the cold jaw are equivalent, although the two boots perform different functions and are thus configured differently.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The previously mentioned desirable clamping force of the jaws of between 1-3 pounds can also be characterized in terms of pressure on the tissue to produce the most effective balance between severing and welding. Using the approximate dimensional values given above, the jaws desirably exert a pressure on the tissue of between about 25-75 psi, averaged transversely across the tissue-facing surfaces of the boots <b>52</b><i>a, </i><b>52</b><i>b. </i>It should be understood that this range is an estimate based on the non-uniform contours of the tissue-facing surfaces of the boots <b>52</b><i>a, </i><b>52</b><i>b, </i>and those of skill in the art will understand that structural modifications to the jaws may affect the preferred force and/or pressure range. Moreover, the temperature to which the heating elements on the jaws rise also affects the preferred force applied, as well as the duration of the weld. Once again, a commonly accepted range of temperatures at which human tissue may be welded is 50 to 90&#xb0; C., while severing occurs at temperatures of 100&#xb0; C. and above. Using these guidelines, if the exemplary jaws apply a clamping force of between 1-3 pounds on tissue and the welding and severing heating elements are energized to these temperatures, a preferred duration of weld is between 1-5 seconds. If the clamp duration is too short, the weld may not be effective and the tissue is less likely to completely sever, while an excessive duration above 5 seconds may tend to char tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Still with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, movement of the actuator <b>44</b> in the direction of arrow <b>206</b> also displaces the tang <b>180</b> into engagement with the weld/cut switch <b>182</b>. Even if the intervening force-limiting spring <b>164</b> limits further closure of the jaws, the actuator <b>44</b> can continue movement until the switch <b>182</b> is tripped. The control handle <b>38</b> of the present invention further includes feedback to indicate to the user aurally and via tactile sensation through the thumb pad <b>144</b> when the switch <b>182</b> has been tripped, both on and off. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11C and 12</figref> illustrate a small protrusion <b>208</b> projecting laterally from the actuator <b>44</b>. This protrusion pivots along with the actuator and engages a small tooth <b>210</b> provided on a pivoting detent lever <b>212</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, the detent <b>212</b> pivots about a point fixed within the housing <b>140</b> and the tooth <b>210</b> is biased upward by a detent spring <b>214</b>. The protrusion <b>208</b> cams past the tooth <b>210</b> which displaces and provides both an audible and tactile click to the user at the point that the switch <b>182</b> is tripped ON. Movement of the actuator <b>44</b> in the opposite direction also causes the protrusion <b>208</b> to cam past the tooth <b>210</b>, thus indicating when the switch <b>182</b> is turned OFF. In an exemplary procedure, the weld time is typically less than 5 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The exemplary control handle <b>38</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> further includes a system for capturing smoke or particulate matter that is generated by the distal jaws at the operating site within the tissue cavity. As mentioned above, various end effectors may be utilized with certain aspects of the present invention, with resistance heating elements being featured as the exemplary embodiment. Most of these end effectors, including resistance heating elements, often cause a substantial amount of smoke to be generated from the heated tissue. Furthermore, the operation is typically performed using CO<sub>2 </sub>insufflation which creates a pressure gradient forcing gas in a proximal direction through the flexible shaft <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">To control egress of this smoke through the flexible shaft <b>36</b>, the control handle <b>38</b> provides the aforementioned passive filter <b>190</b>. The flexible shaft <b>36</b> includes at least one gas escape port <b>220</b> at its proximal end. This port <b>220</b> is positioned between the O-rings <b>194</b> and within the hollow interior of the filter <b>190</b>. The hollow cavity within the filter <b>190</b> provides a venting chamber or space to receive the gasses from the port <b>220</b>. In addition, the proximal end of the flexible shaft <b>36</b> is capped by the seal <b>196</b> which conforms closely around the control rod <b>112</b> and electrical lead <b>186</b>. All of these seals force any gas (and smoke or particulate matter) traveling proximally through the flexible shaft <b>36</b> to exit through the gas escape port <b>220</b>. Consequently, the gas is forced through the gas permeable material of the filter <b>190</b> which traps any smoke or particulate matter before it reaches the interior of the housing <b>140</b>. From there, the now filtered gas, predominantly CO<sub>2</sub>, passes through the various cavities within the housing <b>140</b> and exits through random fissures and openings therein.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Several alternative configurations for filtering smoke generated by the tissue welding procedure are seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11D-11F</figref>. First of all, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> illustrates the exemplary control handle <b>38</b> having a small exhaust fan <b>222</b> mounted near its proximal end. The exhaust fan <b>222</b> helps pull gas passing through the elongated shaft <b>36</b> through the aforementioned passive filter <b>190</b>. In many instances means for gas insufflation is provided in the overall system within which the tissue welders is used, which provides a positive pressure within the body cavity and forces gas proximally through the elongated shaft <b>36</b>. However, in some procedures either no insufflation is used or it does not generate sufficient pressure, in which case the auxiliary fan <b>222</b> helps pull the gas through the filter <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref> illustrates the interior of an alternative control handle in which a cooling apparatus <b>224</b>, such as a Peltier cooler, is mounted adjacent the gas escape ports <b>220</b> in the elongated shaft <b>36</b>. The smoke emitted from the port <b>220</b> connect is on the cooling apparatus <b>224</b>, which effectively passively filters the gas which is then permitted to exit from various openings in the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Alternatively, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref> illustrates a further alternative control handle in which a plurality of louvers or fins <b>226</b> are arranged adjacent the gas escape ports <b>220</b>. The fins <b>226</b> diffuse and condense the smoke traveling proximally through the elongated shaft <b>36</b>, and thus act as a passive filter. The gas is then permitted to exit from various openings in the handle. Because the surface area through which the smoke exhausts is expanded, the density of that smoke is decreased making it less noticeable as it exits the handle. In the illustrated embodiment, the fins <b>226</b> are configured as a series of concentric annular elements, but other arrangements are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13C</figref> illustrate an alternative control handle <b>38</b>&#x2032; similar to that described above but including a separate electrical circuit for a fasciotomy cutter provided on a distal tool. As mentioned above, fasciotomy comprises an incision through fascia (e.g., bands or fillets of fibrous tissue that separate different layers of tissue). The tissue welding/cutting jaws may also be adapted to include such a fasciotomy cutter which enables the tool to be moved linearly through to cut tissue without opening and closing the jaws. The fasciotomy cutter may be a separate heating element provided on the forward end of one of the jaws, or within the jaws. Some of the elements illustrated for the alternative control handle <b>38</b>&#x2032; are common to the control handle <b>30</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-12</figref>, and therefore will be given the same element number with a prime &#x201c;&#x2032;&#x201d; designation.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B-13C</figref>, the flexible shaft <b>36</b>&#x2032; from the distal tool enters the molded housing <b>140</b>&#x2032;, and a control rod <b>112</b>&#x2032; projects therefrom into a cavity formed within the housing and is fixed to an enlarged collar <b>230</b>. Although not shown, a shaft member <b>232</b> fastened to the collar <b>230</b> extends in a proximal direction through a fasciotomy spring <b>234</b>, and through an actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; to terminate at a proximal head <b>236</b>. The actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; is much like the actuator <b>44</b> described above, with a body that pivots about a pin <b>238</b> and has an elongated through bore for passage of the shaft <b>232</b>. The distal end of the shaft <b>232</b> having the collar <b>230</b> thereon translates within a proximal-distal cavity <b>240</b>, while the proximal end of the shaft having a proximal head <b>236</b> translates within a proximal-distal cavity <b>242</b>. Because the control rod <b>112</b>&#x2032; is rigidly fastened to the collar <b>230</b> which in turn is fastened to the shaft <b>232</b>, movement of the shaft produces identical movement of the control rod.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>, an annular cam follower <b>244</b> surrounds the shaft <b>232</b> between the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; and the fasciotomy spring <b>234</b>. The cam follower <b>244</b> includes a short slot (not numbered) within which extends a small pin <b>246</b> projecting laterally from the shaft <b>232</b>. In the position illustrated, the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; is in a neutral position not in contact with the cam follower <b>244</b>, which in turn is therefore biased in a proximal direction by the fasciotomy spring <b>234</b> as far as the pin <b>246</b> and slot permit. A second cam follower <b>250</b> surrounds the shaft <b>232</b> between the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; and the fasciotomy spring <b>234</b>. A force-limiting spring <b>252</b> is concentrically constrained around the shaft <b>232</b> between the proximal head <b>236</b> and the second cam follower <b>250</b>. As noted, the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; is in the neutral position out of contact with the second cam follower <b>250</b>, and thus the force-limiting spring <b>252</b> remains uncompressed.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">A user displaces the thumb pad of the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; in a proximal direction as indicated by arrow <b>260</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, which pivots the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; and urges the cam follower <b>244</b> in a proximal direction. Compression of the fasciotomy spring <b>234</b> causes proportional displacement of the collar <b>230</b> and control rod <b>112</b>&#x2032;, therefore opening the jaws of the tool. At a certain distance of travel, the collar <b>230</b> reaches the end of the cavity <b>240</b> and further movement of the control rod <b>112</b>&#x2032; is impeded, corresponding to the maximum opening distance of the jaws. However, because the cam follower <b>244</b> includes the linear slot in which the pin <b>246</b> travels, the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; can continue its movement forcing the cam follower <b>244</b> proximally against the compressive force of the spring <b>234</b>. The user experiences a resistance to movement of the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; during this stage, which is an indication that the fasciotomy heater is activated. In particular, a tang <b>262</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>) on the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; eventually engages a fasciotomy switch <b>264</b> at the point that the fasciotomy spring <b>234</b> is being compressed. Although the circuitry is not shown, the switch <b>264</b> is supplied with current and when switched ON provides current to leads extending through the flexible shaft <b>36</b>&#x2032; to the distal end of tool and fasciotomy heating element.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Conversely, the user displaces the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; in a proximal direction as indicated by arrow <b>270</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> to close the jaws. A proximal face of the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; cams against the follower <b>250</b>, which in turn acts against the force-limiting spring <b>252</b>. As in the earlier embodiment, a minimal reaction force exists prior to the jaws closing and thus movement of the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; causes proportional movement of the control rod <b>112</b>&#x2032;. At the point that the jaws close over tissue, the force-limiting spring <b>252</b> determines the amount of pressure that may be applied to the tissue before further movement of the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; merely compresses the spring without moving the control rod <b>112</b>&#x2032;. Near the limit of travel of the actuator <b>44</b>&#x2032; in the direction of arrow <b>270</b>, the tang <b>262</b> engages a weld/cut switch <b>272</b> mounted within the housing <b>140</b>&#x2032;, thus actuating the welding and cutting heating elements at the distal end of the tool. The alternative control handle <b>38</b>&#x2032; further includes a detent <b>274</b> that acts in the same manner as the detent <b>212</b> described above and indicates to the user when the weld/cut function is ON and OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14C</figref> illustrate a preferred linkage <b>300</b> between a control rod and the jaws for opening and closing the jaws. In the jaw opening mechanisms of the prior art, certain disadvantages were recognized that increase the overall size of the jaw assembly, increase the cost of construction, exposed electrical connections to wear, or sacrificed mechanical and electrical consistency by including excess sources of friction, and sacrificed electrical consistency by relying on moving mechanical connections for electrical continuity, for example. The exemplary linkage <b>300</b> and the associated &#x201c;hard-wired&#x201d; electrical connection reduces the overall size of the jaws assembly, reduces the number of components and associated cost and complexity, improves the robustness of the mechanics, and improves the mechanical and electrical reliability (i.e., consistency) of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">A pair of jaws <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are shown open in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>. Each jaw includes a through bore that is journalled about a shaft <b>306</b>, such as the shaft stub <b>98</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. In this manner, proximal housings <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> of the respective jaws pivot with respect to one another. An angled slot <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> is provided in each pivot housings <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>. An actuating pin <b>316</b> extends into both of the angled slot <b>3</b> <b>12</b>, <b>314</b> and is connected to a proximal control rod (not shown). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> illustrates the distal end of a tool shaft <b>320</b> that encompasses the pivot housings <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>. The tool shaft <b>320</b> includes a linear slot <b>322</b> within which the actuating pin <b>316</b> translates. The distal end of the tool shaft <b>320</b> shown is analogous to the shaft tip <b>54</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref> shows movement of the actuating pin <b>316</b> to the left which causes the jaws <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> to close. That is, the pin <b>316</b> cams the angled slots <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> such that their proximal ends come together as seen. Of course, the reverse movement of the actuating pin <b>316</b> causes the jaws to open again. Because of the simplicity of the mechanism, the overall size of the jaw assembly can be reduced so that it fits through a 5 mm inside diameter tube. Furthermore, the reduction in the number of parts obtains an equivalent reduced manufacturing time and complexity, for a lower manufacturing cost. The moving parts consist of the actuating pin <b>316</b> translating within the three slots, and the two jaws which pivot with respect one another. This reduces the sources of friction and thus improves mechanical reliability. Finally, the angle of the slots <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> may be adjusted to change the actuation force required to open and close the jaws. That is, a shallower angle would necessitate a lower force from the control rod to actuate the jaws. The trade-off, of course is that the opening distance of the jaws is concurrently reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Clearly, the dual- or tri- heating element function can be achieved in many different ways. The present invention broadly includes a heating element for cutting tissue and a heating element for welding tissue, and is not particularly limited to any one type of either apparatus. Examples include, but are not limited to two, three, or more heating elements, cutting and welding heating elements separately activated or connected in series or parallel, or both, heating elements on one or both jaws, etc. The form of the multiple heating elements is preferably chosen so that they are relatively close together and one reliably cuts and the other reliably welds a variety of tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Optionally, the multiple heating elements are configured such that they operate substantially simultaneously and ensure good hemostasis of the welded tissue. The power applied and shape of the heating elements are chosen to ensure that inadvertent tissue charring or other such damage does not occur inadvertently during normal operation of the device. The primary clinical benefits of the heating elements of the present invention include but are not limited to balance of power outputs from cutter and welder(s) for consistently strong welds, as well as thermal efficiency for faster weld times.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">It should be understood that the force-limiting function of the spring within the control handle can be achieved in many different ways. The present invention, in its broad interpretation, is not particularly limited to any one type of mechanism for limiting the closing force of the jaws, but is characterized by a force-limiting interface between the control actuator and the elongated jaws for limiting the magnitude of closing force of the jaws. Examples include, but are not limited to the aforementioned spring provided within the control handle, a similar spring provided distal to the control handle, a pressure transducer on the jaws which provides feedback to the user or other device for limiting the force applied by the jaws, compliant jaws, etc. The form of the force-limiting apparatus is preferably chosen to limit the pressure applied to tissue by the particular jaws. Optionally, the force-limiting apparatus is configured simply in a cost-effective manner. The force-limiting apparatus is chosen to ensure that crushing of tissue does not occur inadvertently during normal operation of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Furthermore, aside from limiting the magnitude of force applied by the jaws, the present application contemplates applying force on the tissue within the jaws that is greater than a minimum but less than the force that would unduly damage the tissue. The minimum amount of force is determined such that an effective weld is created by clamping and heating the tissue. Accordingly, the minimum amount of force required depends on several factors, including the amount and duration of heat applied, the size and shape of the jaws, the jaw and boot material, the size and character of the tissue or vessel within the jaws, etc. In a preferred embodiment, a force-limiting mechanism interposed between the control actuator and the jaws is adapted to regulate the magnitude of closing force of the jaws to a value calibrated to ensure the heating element effectively welds tissue held within the facing surfaces of the elongated jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">While the tissue welding system described thus far is believed to be particularly effective, the present invention also provides a number of alternative jaws and clamping mechanisms which are each believed to be patentable in their own right. A number of these alternatives will now be described briefly with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-48</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">For example, the present application provides a number of embodiments for regulating the localized force applied to the tissue within the jaws. Several embodiments act to maintain parallelism of the jaws, which helps make the applied force, and thus applied heat, uniform from a proximal to a distal end of the jaws. Another configuration controls the gross movement of the jaws with respect one another such that they behave in a non-linear fashion relative to movement of a handle actuator. In short, the present application provides numerous configurations for controlling the applied force and displacement of the distal tissue welding jaws. It should be understood by the reader that unless they are mutually exclusive, any of these jaw or clamping configurations can be coupled with any of the aforementioned control handle/shaft embodiments. For example, if a particular jaw includes a malleable tissue contacting surface, it may also be used with the control handle <b>38</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-12</figref> which includes a pressure-limiting spring.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15B</figref>, a first embodiment of a force-limiting structure within a control handle <b>350</b> is shown. Only a portion of the control handle <b>350</b> is illustrated, and the remainder of the control handle may be similar to that described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>. The control handle <b>350</b> incorporates an actuator <b>352</b> that pivots about a pin <b>354</b>. A lever arm <b>356</b> projecting into the handle <b>350</b> from the actuator <b>352</b> engages a control rod <b>358</b>. The control rod <b>358</b> extends distally through a flexible shaft <b>360</b> to open and close distal tissue welding jaws (not shown), such as described above. The lever arm <b>356</b> may be bifurcated, for example, such that its ends straddle the control rod <b>358</b> between a proximal ball <b>362</b><i>a </i>and a distal ball <b>362</b><i>b. </i>A spring <b>364</b> concentrically surrounds the control rod <b>358</b> and is interposed between the lever arm <b>356</b> and the proximal ball <b>362</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">When the actuator <b>352</b> is rotated in a clockwise direction, such as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the lever arm <b>356</b> moves in a leftward direction against the spring <b>364</b>, which in turn acts against the proximal ball <b>362</b><i>a. </i>As long as the reaction force on the jaws is less than the spring constant, the spring <b>364</b> remains uncompressed and moves as a rigid body. This direction of travel of the control rod <b>358</b> corresponds to closing of the distal jaws. If the jaws close upon tissue, or are otherwise prevented from further closure, the reaction force through the control rod <b>358</b> eventually becomes greater than the spring constant, and the lever arm <b>356</b> compresses the spring <b>364</b> against the proximal ball <b>362</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Although the lever arm <b>356</b> continues to move, it does not translate movement to the control rod <b>358</b> and the jaw force clamping the tissue remains constant. Conversely, counter-clockwise rotation of the actuator <b>352</b>, such as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, causes the lever arm <b>356</b> to travel to the right- and act directly on the distal ball <b>362</b><i>b; </i>Because the distal ball <b>362</b><i>b </i>is fixedly attached to the control rod <b>358</b>, pivoting movement of the actuator <b>352</b> directly translates into linear displacement of the control rod, which opens the jaws. This arrangement is similar to the force-limiting configuration described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In a slight variation to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, the lever arm <b>356</b> itself may be formed as a spring in lieu of the coil spring <b>364</b>. In such an alternative, the lever arm <b>356</b> is a metallic or molded plastic leaf spring that is bifurcated around the control rod <b>358</b>. Application of a closing force eventually causes the lever arm <b>356</b> to bend, therefore limiting the applied clamping force at the jaws. To ensure that the lever arm <b>356</b> bends consistently at a predetermined force, it may be formed with a concavity (similar to a reed for a wind instrument) for added structural rigidity enabling it to resist buckling longer until reaching a discreet load.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> illustrates an alternative variation of a force-limiting configuration. An actuator <b>370</b> includes a rigid portion, defined by a thumb lever <b>372</b> and a lever arm <b>374</b>, that pivots about a pin <b>376</b>. A second thumb lever <b>378</b> also pivots about the pin <b>376</b> and is connected via a coil spring <b>380</b> to the lever arm <b>374</b>. Although not shown, a control rod attached to open and close distal tissue welding jaws is coupled to move with the distal end of the lever arm <b>374</b>. Depressing the thumb lever <b>372</b> in a counter-clockwise direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> causes the lever arm <b>374</b> to translate to the right, corresponding to linear movement of the control rod to open the distal jaws. On the other hand, depressing the second thumb lever <b>378</b> in a clockwise direction as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> causes the lever arm <b>374</b> and control rod to translate to the left, and thus open the distal jaws. Eventually, a reaction force from the jaws transmitted from the control rod to the lever arm will be sufficient to cause the coil spring <b>380</b> to compress, thus effectively decoupling movement of the second thumb lever <b>378</b> from movement of the distal jaws. Again, the clamping force on the tissue remains constant after the spring <b>380</b> begins to compress.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> illustrate an alternative force-limiting actuator <b>390</b> having a rigid portion defined by an extension <b>392</b> and a lever arm <b>394</b>. The rigid portion pivots about a pin <b>396</b>, about which also pivots a thumb lever <b>398</b> having wings extending in opposite directions. Depressing one of the wings of the thumb lever <b>398</b> in a counter-clockwise direction as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> acts on the extension <b>392</b> which causes the lever arm <b>394</b> to translate to the right and move a control rod linearly (not shown). The control rod, in turn, opens the distal tissue welding jaws. Depressing the opposite wing in a clockwise direction as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> causes a leaf spring <b>400</b> to contact one side of the lever arm <b>394</b>. As the lever arm <b>394</b> translates to the left, and pulls the control rod, the jaws close. Eventually, closure of the jaws on tissue results in a reaction force being transmitted through the control rod which resists further movement of the lever arm <b>394</b>. If the user depresses the wing of the thumb lever <b>398</b> farther, the leaf spring <b>400</b> merely bends.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">An alternative force-limiting structure provided within the control handle that is not specifically illustrated includes a pair of magnets that repel one another. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> the lever arm <b>394</b> and thumb lever <b>398</b> may carry magnets with like poles facing one another such that when the thumb lever <b>398</b> pivots in a clockwise direction the opposite magnets provide resistance against further closing motion.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Another variation of a force-limiting structure incorporated into a control handle is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. An actuator includes a rigid portion having a lever arm <b>410</b> and a perpendicular extension <b>412</b>. The rigid portion pivots about a shaft <b>414</b> about which also pivots a thumb lever <b>416</b> having opposite wings. A pin or other such projection <b>418</b> extends perpendicularly from the right-hand wing of the thumb lever <b>416</b> so as to engage the extension <b>412</b>. The distal ends of the right-hand wing and the extension <b>412</b> are connected by a coil spring <b>420</b>. Depressing the right-hand wing of the thumb lever <b>416</b> causes the pin <b>418</b> to contact and pivot the extension <b>412</b> about the shaft <b>414</b>, thus moving a control rod <b>422</b> connected to the lever arm <b>410</b>. Depressing the left-wing of the thumb lever <b>416</b> rotates the extension <b>412</b> in a clockwise direction about the shaft <b>414</b> until such time as a reaction force through the control rod <b>422</b> and lever arm <b>410</b> causes the coil spring <b>420</b> to expand.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Instead of the interposition on a spring between a thumb lever and a control rod, a clutch may be provided which completely decouples relative movement therebetween. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates an arrangement similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, but instead of the coil spring <b>420</b> a ball detent <b>430</b> is provided on the rigid portion of the actuator. The ball detent <b>430</b> engages the left-hand wing when the thumb lever <b>416</b> pivots in a counterclockwise direction. At a threshold reaction force, the ball detent <b>430</b> slips so that the thumb lever <b>416</b> no longer acts on the control rod.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Another variation of a clutch configuration is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In this version, a toothed rack <b>440</b> is mounted on a proximal end of the control rod <b>442</b> within the control handle (represented by a frame <b>443</b>). An actuator <b>444</b> includes a spring-loaded pin <b>446</b> that engages the toothed rack <b>440</b>. Movement of the actuator <b>444</b> to the left or right causes equivalent movement of the toothed rack <b>440</b>, and control rod <b>442</b>. If tissue within the distal jaws causes the control rod <b>442</b> to stop moving, eventually the pin <b>446</b> moves upward against its spring and cams out of the teeth of the rack <b>440</b>. A second spring <b>448</b> may be attached between the frame <b>443</b> and actuator <b>444</b> to provide a return force in one direction.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates an alternative configuration of a spring for use as a force-limiting member. In this embodiment, a tubular control rod <b>450</b> provides the spring itself. Namely, a laser cut spiral <b>452</b> in the control rod <b>450</b> results in a helical section designed to compress or extend upon a predetermined force being applied to the control rod. This configuration therefore eliminates a separate coil spring around the control rod. In a further alternative to forming a spring within the control rod <b>450</b>, a segment or all of a control rod may be made from super-elastic material such as Nitinol which undergoes a phase transition and stretches after application of a threshold tensile force. Desirably, in the latter arrangement a separate rigid push rod may be provided to open the jaws in conjunction with the super-elastic pull rod which limits the force that can be applied when closing the jaws. In one particular embodiment, a 30 cm long super-elastic pull rod undergoes approximately 5% elongation (1.5 cm) without exceeding its elastic limit (usually 6% with Nitinol), which therefore permits further actuator travel without applying more force to the closed jaws. Again, with elastic force-limiting members, a constant force is applied to tissue between the jaws after they close.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> illustrates an alternative force-limiting configuration for a tissue welder of the present invention which is not located within a control handle <b>460</b>. An actuator <b>462</b> includes a lever arm <b>464</b> that acts in opposite directions on two balls fixed to an actuator rod <b>466</b>. The actuator rod extends into a flexible shaft <b>468</b> and is fixedly attached to a distal block <b>470</b> therein. A small flange <b>472</b> is also provided on the actuator rod <b>466</b>. A proximal block <b>474</b> includes a through bore that receives the actuator rod <b>466</b>. A control rod <b>476</b> is fixedly attached to the proximal block <b>474</b> and continues in a distal direction through a bore in the distal block <b>470</b>. A coil spring <b>478</b> surrounds both the actuator rod <b>466</b> and control rod <b>476</b> in the area between the distal and proximal blocks <b>470</b>, <b>474</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Rotation of the actuator <b>462</b> in the clockwise direction as shown causes the lever arm <b>464</b> to act on the proximal ball and translate the actuator rod <b>466</b> to the left. This movement pulls the distal block <b>470</b> to the left, as indicated and also through the spring <b>478</b> causes the proximal block <b>474</b> and control rod <b>476</b> to move leftward. Typically this movement corresponds to closure of distal tissue welding jaws. At some point, the jaws close or close on tissue and resist further leftward movement of the control rod <b>476</b>. Further movement of the actuator rod <b>466</b> merely compresses the spring <b>478</b>. This is the situation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> in which a space S is indicated between the flange <b>472</b> and the proximal block <b>474</b>. Rotation of the actuator <b>462</b> in the opposite direction acts on the distal ball of the actuator rod <b>466</b> causing it to move distally to the right. In this case, the flange <b>472</b> acts directly on the proximal block <b>474</b> and pushes the control rod <b>476</b> an equivalent distance to the right (this is shown for the alternative configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> shows a slight variation on the force-limiting configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> which incorporates not only a first coil spring <b>478</b> but also a second coil spring <b>480</b>. The two springs <b>478</b>, <b>480</b> provide two different spring rates such that regulation of closing of the distal jaws occurs in two stages. Namely, the first spring <b>478</b> compresses when the distal jaws provide a first reaction force. The user senses this resistance and thus knows when tissue is clamped between the jaws. Further compression of the spring <b>478</b> ultimately results in compression of the second spring <b>480</b>, having a higher spring rate. The second spring <b>480</b> can be used to differentiate activation of a switch, for instance, to weld or for fasciotomy, or just as a detent to differentiate between grasping and welding.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Now with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a pair of tissue welding jaws <b>500</b> is shown schematically attached to the end of the control rod <b>502</b>. A portion of the control rod has a voice coil <b>504</b> thereon surrounded by a magnet <b>506</b>. This assembly provides an electromotive actuator <b>508</b> for translating the control rod <b>502</b> in proximal and distal directions upon running a current through the voice coil <b>504</b>. In this embodiment, a return spring <b>510</b> connects the control rod <b>502</b> to a control handle, represented by a fixed point <b>512</b>. The strength of the electromotive actuator <b>508</b> is desirably calibrated to be more than the minimum required to weld tissue within the jaws <b>500</b> but less than a force which would unduly damage the tissue. The strength of the electromotive actuator <b>508</b> can be controlled by choice of coil <b>504</b> or magnet <b>506</b>, or by regulating the current supplied to coil. The electromotive actuator <b>508</b> may be arranged as a solenoid or voice coil, whichever provides the desired response.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates a force-limiting leaf spring <b>520</b> provided within soft material <b>522</b> of one of the tissue welding jaws <b>524</b>. A heating element <b>526</b> is illustrated on the opposite jaw. Closure of the jaws <b>524</b> with tissue therebetween eventually causes the leaf spring <b>520</b> to bend, thus limiting the amount of force that can be applied to the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a similar arrangement as that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> has a series of bi-metallic inserts <b>530</b> mounted within one of the jaws that includes the heating element <b>532</b>. The bi-metallic inserts <b>530</b> are U-shaped and the two materials are chosen so that upon heating their differential expansion rates cause the inserts to straighten out. The jaws are arranged so that at their closest a gap <b>534</b> exists. Upon actuation of the heating element <b>532</b>, the bi-metallic inserts <b>530</b> straighten out from their U-shaped configuration, thus forcing the heating element <b>532</b> against the tissue within the gap <b>534</b>. Careful control of the dual materials of the bi-metallic inserts <b>530</b> and/or the amount of heat supplied by the heating element <b>532</b> ensures that proper welding occurs without tissue damage. In general, an elastic member(s) provided in one or both jaws is adapted to change shape at elevated temperatures. For example, instead of bi-metallic inserts <b>530</b>, a U-shaped member formed of a shape memory alloy with a phase transition temperature adjusted to the maximum heating element temperature may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref> illustrate a still further version of an arrangement for limiting the amount of force applied to tissue that is incorporated within a pair of tissue welding jaws <b>540</b>. A rigid tissue contacting plate <b>542</b> attaches to one of the jaws via an elastomeric layer <b>544</b> (the opposite jaw carries the heating element). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref> depicts compression of a blood vessel <b>546</b> within the jaws <b>540</b>. At some point of jaw closure, the elastomeric layer <b>544</b> deforms to limit the amount of force applied to the vessel <b>546</b>. In addition, the compliant character of the elastomeric layer <b>544</b> is such that it compresses more toward the proximal ends of the jaws <b>540</b> and thus helps maintain parallelism between the tissue contacting plate <b>542</b> and the opposite jaw. Stated another way, upon jaw closing the compliant middle layer <b>544</b> compresses unevenly such that the rigid tissue contacting plate <b>542</b> floats on its jaw <b>540</b> and helps even out clamping pressure on the vessel <b>546</b>. This arrangement not only limits force but also helps ensure even heating of the vessel <b>546</b> in a proximal-distal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> schematically illustrates a mechanism <b>550</b> for maintaining parallelism of a pair of jaws <b>552</b>. Translation of a pair of pins <b>554</b> within angled guide brackets <b>556</b> ensures that a first jaw <b>558</b> having a heating element <b>560</b> thereon remains parallel to an opposite jaw <b>562</b>. This results in more even heating of the vessel <b>564</b> between the jaws <b>552</b>, at least in a proximal-distal direction. It should be noted here that the mechanism <b>550</b> for maintaining parallelism of the jaws <b>552</b> can be coupled with any of the force-limiting configurations disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates an arrangement for both limiting the force that is applied to tissue between a pair of jaws <b>570</b><i>a, </i><b>570</b><i>b </i>and maintaining parallelism between the jaws. The proximal ends of the jaws <b>570</b><i>a, </i><b>570</b><i>b </i>are illustrated at the distal end of a flexible shaft <b>572</b> that houses a control rod <b>574</b>. Much like the movement mechanism seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14C</figref> the control rod <b>574</b> is connected to a pin <b>576</b> that translates in a proximal-distal line and acts on a pair of angled slots <b>578</b> formed in the jaws <b>570</b><i>a, </i><b>570</b><i>b. </i>The jaws <b>570</b><i>a, </i><b>570</b><i>b </i>are shown open with the pin <b>576</b> to the right end of the slots <b>578</b>, and movement of the pin in a proximal direction closes the jaws. A jaw pivot shaft <b>580</b> is received within a transverse slot <b>582</b> formed in a first one of the jaws <b>570</b><i>a, </i>while the second jaw <b>570</b><i>b </i>pivots about the shaft <b>580</b> as a fixed point. That is, the position of the shaft <b>580</b> is fixed with respect to the second jaw <b>570</b><i>b </i>but translates along the slot <b>582</b> with respect to the first jaw <b>570</b><i>a. </i>A spring <b>584</b> normally maintains the shaft <b>580</b> at the bottom of the slot <b>582</b>, and thus biases the proximal ends of the jaws together.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Upon closure of the jaws <b>570</b><i>a, </i><b>570</b><i>b </i>on tissue, the proximal end of the second jaw <b>570</b><i>b </i>and the shaft <b>580</b> will be forced upward against the force of the spring <b>584</b>, thus separating the proximal ends of the jaws. The reader will understand that the strength of the spring <b>584</b> may be calibrated to yield within a particular range of closing forces. For example, if the jaws <b>570</b><i>a, </i><b>570</b><i>b </i>are being used to weld relatively small vessels or delicate tissue, the spring <b>584</b> has a slight stiffness, but application to larger vessels or more fibrous tissue may require a greater spring force. At the same time, other factors such as the shape of the jaws <b>570</b><i>a, </i><b>570</b><i>b </i>or magnitude of heat applied may also affect the choice of spring <b>584</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Now with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, an actuator <b>590</b> configured to displace a control rod <b>592</b> at a non-linear rate is shown. The actuator <b>590</b> may be mounted to pivot about a shaft <b>594</b> within a control handle, such as was described previously. The proximal end of the control rod <b>592</b> carries a pin <b>596</b> positioned to travel within an arcuate cam slot <b>598</b> formed in an extension of the actuator <b>590</b>. Through rotation of the actuator <b>590</b> about the shaft <b>594</b>, the control rod <b>592</b> displaces as the pin <b>596</b> follows the cam slot <b>598</b>, thus opening and closing distal tissue welding jaws. The reader will understand that, because of the shape of the cam slot <b>598</b> and its spatial relationship with respect to the shaft <b>594</b>, the distance that the control rod <b>592</b> translates along its axis decreases as the actuator <b>590</b> rotates in a clockwise direction (indicated by arrow <b>599</b>). Conversely, the distance the control rod <b>592</b> translates along its axis increases when the actuator <b>590</b> rotates in a counter-clockwise direction. This variable or non-linear rate of travel of the control rod <b>592</b> may be beneficially coordinated with movement of the jaws so that as the jaws begin to come together their rate of closure decreases, or slows down. Conversely, as the jaws begin to open their rate of separation increases, or speeds up. This configuration may also be coupled with a force-limiting spring, for example, to automatically slow down the jaw closing phase and thus compress tissue with greater care.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In addition to regulating the movement of the jaws, and their closing force, the construction of each of the jaws may be designed to focus heat or enhance their welding and severing efficiency. To understand several different configurations in this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A and 30B</figref> illustrate a symmetric pair of jaws <b>600</b> each having an inner jaw <b>602</b> surrounded by a tissue-contacting boot <b>604</b>. The symmetric jaws <b>600</b> are seen closing on a vessel <b>606</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref>. A heating element is not shown, though any of the various configurations described herein may be coupled with the symmetric jaws <b>600</b> to weld and/or sever the vessel <b>606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref> offer an alternative to the symmetric jaws <b>600</b>, wherein a standard jaw <b>610</b> faces a relatively more narrow jaw <b>612</b>. That is, the standard jaw <b>610</b> has a transverse width substantially greater than the narrow jaw <b>612</b>. In this regard, the narrow jaw <b>612</b> has an inner jaw member <b>614</b> surrounded by a tissue-contacting boot <b>616</b>, both are shown proportionately reduced in size from the standard jaw <b>610</b>, preferably by at least 20%. When the jaws <b>610</b>, <b>612</b> close on tissue, such as the vessel <b>618</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>, the reduced width of the narrow jaw <b>612</b> reduces the tissue contacting surface and causes a shearing action of sorts such that the vessel falls away on either side. This arrangement therefore helps sever the vessel <b>618</b> after it has been welded, and helps reduce tissue sticking to the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref> respectively illustrate a contrast between a standard pair of jaws <b>620</b><i>a, </i><b>620</b><i>b </i>and an alternative pair <b>622</b><i>a, </i><b>622</b><i>b. </i>The standard jaws <b>620</b><i>a, </i><b>620</b><i>b </i>are similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref>, but also include a heating element <b>624</b> provided on a facing surface of the upper jaw <b>620</b><i>a. </i>The standard jaws <b>620</b><i>a, </i><b>620</b><i>b </i>have generally semi-circular cross-sections with the flat sides facing one another. In contrast, the alternative jaws <b>622</b><i>a, </i><b>622</b><i>b </i>have the same inner jaws <b>626</b> with their flat sides facing one another, but the surrounding tissue-contacting boots <b>628</b> are rotated 180&#xb0; such that there curved sides face one another. Because the rounded surfaces of the boots <b>620</b> form the tissue-contacting surfaces, the transverse width of tissue that is clamped between the jaws is reduced. This focuses the pressure applied to the tissue during thermal tissue welding along more of a line centered on the heating element <b>624</b>. Higher pressure at the heating element facilitates cutting of the tissue by both increasing heat transfer to the tissue and mechanical separation because of the higher pressure. The smaller tissue-contacting area also helps reduce tissue sticking to the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</figref> illustrate jaws <b>640</b><i>a, </i><b>640</b><i>b </i>in open and closed positions, respectively, that incorporate several of the concepts disclosed above. A first jaw <b>640</b><i>a </i>includes a rigid portion <b>642</b> and a compliant or malleable pad <b>644</b> on its jaw facing surface. The second jaw <b>640</b><i>b </i>includes a rigid portion <b>646</b> supporting a contoured heating element <b>648</b> on its jaw facing surface. A plurality of force arrows <b>650</b> represent the application of uniform pressure to the upper side of the first jaw <b>640</b><i>a, </i>such as through the use of fluid-mechanics (e.g., pneumatics or hydraulics). Specifically, a fluid-mechanical driver (not shown) would be connected between the control actuator of the handle and the jaws <b>640</b><i>a, </i><b>640</b><i>b </i>and is adapted to translate movement of the control actuator into movement of the jaws. When the jaws <b>640</b><i>a, </i><b>640</b><i>b </i>close, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref>, the malleable pad <b>644</b> conforms to the contour of the heating element <b>648</b>. The heating element has a transverse width <b>652</b> and a central protrusion <b>654</b> flanked by a pair of flat surfaces <b>656</b>. The flat surfaces <b>656</b> function as welding elements, while the protrusion <b>654</b> acts as a cutting element because of its higher profile.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> is a graph schematically indicating the temperature profile within tissue held between the jaws <b>640</b><i>a, </i><b>640</b><i>b </i>across their transverse width. The graph indicates a rise in the temperature in the tissue across the entire heating element <b>648</b>, with a spike in the center corresponding to the protrusion <b>654</b>. Assuming the material of the heating element <b>648</b> is uniform, the temperature of the heating element will also be uniform, but because of the higher pressure and thermal gradients in the tissue, the temperature in the tissue will be greater in the center. Of course, one potential alternative is to form the protrusion <b>654</b> as a different material than the rest of the heating element <b>648</b> so that the protrusion reaches a higher temperature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is a graph schematically illustrating the pressure distribution within tissue held between the jaws <b>640</b><i>a, </i><b>640</b><i>b </i>across their transverse width. Again, the pressure increases in the region of the heating element <b>648</b>, and spikes in the center due to the raise protrusion <b>654</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">A temperature and pressure distribution similar to that resulting from the jaw configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</figref> may be obtained using separate heating elements, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>. For instance, a narrow heating element <b>660</b> is positioned between a pair of flanking heating elements <b>662</b> on one of the jaws shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. The temperature and pressure profiles obtained depend on how large the narrow heating element <b>660</b> is with respect to the flanking heating elements <b>662</b>, and also on properties of the material, such as electrical resistance. It should also be understood that the flanking heating elements <b>662</b> may be actively heated, such as was described above, or they may be passively heated indirectly from heat generated by the narrow heating element <b>660</b>. The jaws shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> include a narrow heating element <b>670</b> on one jaw and a relatively wider heating element <b>672</b> on the opposite jaw. The narrow heating element <b>670</b> is positioned at the approximate transverse centerline of the wider heating element <b>672</b>. When the jaws are brought together, the pressure and temperature are greatest between the two heating elements <b>670</b>, <b>672</b>, which therefore provides the tissue severing action. Once again, the wider heating element <b>672</b> may be actively or passively heated and acts as a tissue welding element. It should be noted that if the wider heating element <b>672</b> is actively heated, structure to electrically insulate the two elements during use will likely be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> illustrates an alternative jaw <b>680</b> in which a heating element <b>682</b> is partially embedded within an outer boot <b>684</b>. This smoother profile increases the transition angle between the heating element <b>682</b> and the boot <b>684</b> and thus helps enhance tissue release. More specifically, this smoother transition from heating element <b>682</b> to the insulating boot <b>684</b> reduces the amount of char that collects at the edge of the heating element, thereby reducing adhesion (sticking) of tissue to the jaws. Sticking may increase weld time and can result in damage to the weld band as the jaws are removed from the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Another configuration for tissue welding jaws that helps release severed tissue is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A and 40B</figref>. Each of the illustrated jaws includes a small flap <b>690</b> that projects toward the other jaw. The flap <b>690</b> may be formed as part of the insulating boot, or may extend from the more rigid inner jaw. Further, only one or both of the jaws may feature a flap <b>690</b>. When the jaws close, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40B</figref>, the flaps <b>690</b> overlap to the side of the opposite jaw and push the vessel or tissue off of the jaws upon completion of the weld. This reduces weld time and sticking.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The present invention also contemplates a number of alternative control mechanisms that enhance ergonomics or user-friendliness of the aforementioned devices. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A and 41B</figref> a locking feature in a toggle switch is provided so that the user need not maintain pressure on the jaws during the welding/severing process. A toggle or actuator <b>700</b> includes a small slot <b>702</b> that pivots and translates with respect to a shaft <b>704</b> fixed on a control handle (not shown). A lower end of the actuator <b>700</b> is secured at a point <b>706</b> to a flexible (e.g., Nitinol) control wire <b>708</b>. The movement of the control wire <b>708</b> is seen in the two figures relative to movement of the actuator <b>700</b>. The actuator includes a small pin <b>710</b> that translates within an L-shaped slot <b>712</b> formed as part of the control handle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref> shows the actuator <b>700</b> in a position wherein the pin <b>710</b> is at the end of the long portion of the slot <b>712</b>, and corresponds to the jaw open state of the device. In addition, the actuator <b>700</b> is biased so that the shaft <b>704</b> is normally at the top of the slot <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Upon rotation of the actuator <b>700</b> in the counter-clockwise direction, the pin <b>710</b> translates along the channel <b>712</b> into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref> by virtue of the spring bias on the actuator <b>700</b>. The pin <b>710</b> remains in the short, angled portion of the channel <b>712</b> while the jaws are closed and the tissue is being welded. The user must first depress the actuator downward to release the actuator <b>700</b> and open the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Another arrangement for locking an actuator <b>720</b> during the welding/severing phase is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A and 42B</figref>. The actuator pivots about a shaft <b>722</b> within a control handle (not shown) and translates a control rod <b>724</b>. A locking feature <b>726</b> is provided on an extension of the actuator <b>720</b> to engage a pin <b>728</b> fixed in the control handle. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref>, the actuator <b>720</b> may be locked in a clockwise position corresponding to the jaws being closed.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">An actuator specially designed to facilitate fasciotomy can be understood by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</figref>. The actuator <b>730</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref> is similar to those described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, and pivots about a shaft <b>732</b> fixed with respect to a control handle (not shown). The actuator <b>730</b> includes a through bore that receives a control rod <b>734</b> leading to distal tissue welding jaws. As the actuator <b>730</b> pivots in a clockwise direction as shown, a cam lobe <b>736</b> acts on a cam follower <b>738</b> attached to the control rod <b>734</b>. The round profile of the cam lobe <b>736</b> pushes the follower <b>738</b> and rod <b>734</b> distally to the right to fully open the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</figref> illustrates a modified actuator <b>730</b>&#x2032; that includes a recessed region <b>740</b> in the upper part of the cam lobe <b>736</b>. As the actuator <b>730</b>&#x2032; continues rotating in a clockwise direction, the jaws open but eventually the cam follower <b>738</b> reaches the recess <b>740</b> and translates a small distance in the opposite direction to slightly close the jaws. After the actuator <b>730</b>&#x2032; has pivoted its full extent, the user may actuate a switch for fasciotomy. Because the cam follower <b>738</b> has retreated proximally a small distance, the jaws are not fully open so that there is less interference with the surrounding tissue cavity and more maneuverability of the jaws. The angle at which the jaws remain open during fasciotomy may be optimized based on the contour of the recess <b>740</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Fasciotomy using the tissue welding jaws of the present invention may also be enhanced by uneven control of one jaw with respect to the other. That is, much like the design seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</figref>, there are other mechanisms for controlling the angle of the jaw having the cutting element thereon so that it more effectively faces the fascia to be cut. For example, the exemplary movement mechanism described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be modified so that the hot jaw <b>40</b> assumes an angle that facilitates fasciotomy. Namely, the angled slots <b>68</b> may be angled differently such that linear movement of the yolk <b>114</b> translates and unequal jaw opening motion. The hot jaw may be opened up to a steeper angle than the cold jaw. Another contemplated mechanism is an asymmetric two-bar linkage system such that the jaws open unevenly.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The present invention also contemplates a variety of means for activating safety interlocks for the electric circuits for the heating elements for welding, severing, or fasciotomy, such that the heating elements can only be actuated upon movement of the control actuator to fully close the jaws. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> discloses a toggle or actuator <b>750</b> having a conductive strip <b>752</b> on an underside positioned to contact and connect two pads <b>754</b> mounted within a control handle (not shown). Connecting the two pads <b>754</b> closes a safety interlock circuit such that another switch may then be actuated to energize the welding/severing heating elements. In this way, the user cannot energize the heating elements without the actuator being depressed, corresponding to the jaws being closed. An alternative arrangement of a safety interlock is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> wherein an actuator <b>760</b> carries a protrusion <b>762</b> positioned to contact the moving element <b>764</b> of a microswitch <b>766</b>. Actuating the microswitch <b>766</b> enables separate activation of a heating element. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> shows a third alternative wherein an actuator <b>770</b> carries a protrusion <b>772</b> that acts on a leaf spring <b>774</b> to close a safety interlock circuit. The leaf spring <b>774</b> may be enclosed or embedded by a fluid seal <b>776</b>, such as a silicone membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Two other safety interlock configurations are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 and 48</figref>. In both of these, an actuator <b>780</b> pivots to translate a control rod <b>782</b>, as has been previously described. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A and 47B</figref> the control rod <b>782</b> eventually actuates a microswitch <b>784</b> at its proximal-most travel. The microswitch <b>74</b> may be part of a safety interlock circuit, or may be the heating element activation switch. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48A and 48B</figref>, the control rod <b>782</b> carries a conductive strip <b>786</b> that contacts a conductive pad <b>788</b> at the proximal end of its travel. In this embodiment, the control rod <b>782</b> is conductive and itself forms a part of a safety interlock circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the relevant art that various modifications or changes may be made to the examples and embodiments described without departing from the intended scope of the invention. In this regard, the particular embodiments of the invention described herein are to be understood as examples of the broader inventive concept disclosed.</p>
