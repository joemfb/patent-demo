<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Background is intended to provide the basic context of this patent application and it is not intended to describe a specific problem to be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Technology has made data more transportable and able to fit on smaller devices. For example, music that previously was stored on compact discs can now be stored as an electronic file on a portable player. Many, many files may be stored on a portable device. As a result, keeping track of data has become increasingly difficult but personalization of the data is possible by creating playlists and adding art. In addition, as the data is easily transferable, there is a desire to share the data with a community. In addition, as the data is easily transferable, there is a desire to share the data with a community. Tracking statistics on the communication of containers of data may provide valuable information to a variety of markets. In addition, before obtaining a container, it may be useful to have some knowledge of the reputation of the container.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although the following text sets forth a detailed description of numerous different embodiments, it should be understood that the legal scope of the description is defined by the words of the claims set forth at the end of this patent. The detailed description is to be construed as exemplary only and does not describe every possible embodiment since describing every possible embodiment would be impractical, if not impossible. Numerous alternative embodiments could be implemented, using either current technology or technology developed after the filing date of this patent, which would still fall within the scope of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It should also be understood that, unless a term is expressly defined in this patent using the sentence &#x201c;As used herein, the term &#x2018;<sub>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</sub>&#x2019; is hereby defined to mean . . . &#x201d; or a similar sentence, there is no intent to limit the meaning of that term, either expressly or by implication, beyond its plain or ordinary meaning, and such term should not be interpreted to be limited in scope based on any statement made in any section of this patent (other than the language of the claims). To the extent that any term recited in the claims at the end of this patent is referred to in this patent in a manner consistent with a single meaning, that is done for sake of clarity only so as to not confuse the reader, and it is not intended that such claim term by limited, by implication or otherwise, to that single meaning. Finally, unless a claim element is defined by reciting the word &#x201c;means&#x201d; and a function without the recital of any structure, it is not intended that the scope of any claim element be interpreted based on the application of 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;112, sixth paragraph.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The steps of the claimed method and apparatus are operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the methods or apparatus of the claims include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The steps of the claimed method and apparatus may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The methods and apparatus may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The method may be stored on computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can accessed by computer. Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term &#x201c;modulated data signal&#x201d; means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of the any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A network may be used as part of the method. The computing devices may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers. The remote computer may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device, a portable media player, a cell phone, or other common network node. The logical connections may include a local area network (LAN) and a wide area network (WAN) but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer, or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of a sample data container <b>100</b>. The container <b>100</b> may be an electronic collection that contains a variety of data which may or may not have a common theme. In some ways, the container <b>100</b> is similar to a folder on a personal computer in that virtually any file may be placed in a folder. The container <b>100</b> may take on a variety of forms such as being displayed as a card. The variety of possible container <b>100</b> forms is limited only by the user's or designer's imagination.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The container <b>100</b> may include a variety of items <b>110</b>. The items <b>110</b> may be or contain virtually any kind of media or data. Common item <b>110</b> examples include a card name <b>120</b>, a symbol <b>125</b>, biographical information about a band <b>130</b>, merchandise available for sale related to the band <b>135</b>, tour dates of a band <b>140</b>, friends of the author of the container <b>145</b>, the author <b>150</b>, a ratings of the container <b>155</b>, a number of times the container has been downloaded <b>160</b>, the date of update of the information <b>165</b> in the container <b>100</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The data in the container may be data related to advertising and the advertising may be related to the other data in the container <b>100</b>. The advertising may carry referrals to other goods or services. In addition, the advertising may be coupons. In addition, the ability to access and search the container <b>100</b> may be part of a subscription plan or may be a pay per download plan. Of course, other ways of helping to subsidize the container <b>100</b> are possible and are contemplated. As previously stated, the container <b>100</b> may contain virtually any data and the previous example is simply an illustration, not a limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The container <b>100</b> may have some characteristics that will be further explained in this application. At a high level, the container <b>100</b> may be a container <b>100</b> in that it may include one or more components such as a bucket can hold water, soap, oil, syrup, a brush, a mop, a tennis ball, etc., either alone or in combination. The container <b>100</b> also may be heterogeneous in that it, like the bucket, may hold more than one type of component such as an executable file, a jpeg picture, an avi animation and a Microsoft Word&#xae; file. The container <b>100</b> may be transportable in that it can travel from one node to another in a wide variety of ways. Any way of communicating data may be used to transport the container <b>100</b>. The container <b>100</b> may also be communicated while online or offline. For example, the container <b>100</b> may be stored on a flash memory device and the flash memory device may be in communication with several computers that are not online. The container <b>100</b> may be multi-layout capable in that it can be rendered in more than one client or offline network. For example, the container <b>100</b> may be viewed on portable media device, a computer, on a portable game, on a cell phone, etc. The container <b>100</b> may be &#x201c;live&#x201d; in that data in the container <b>100</b> may be updated when possible and when appropriate. The container <b>100</b> may be shareable in that the share-ability of the container <b>100</b> degrades gracefully as the licenses of the content in the container <b>100</b> expire or restrictions are triggered. The container <b>100</b> is interactive in that it can be browsed and acted upon by selecting items in the container <b>100</b>. The container <b>100</b> may be playable in that items in the container <b>100</b> may be selected and played. The container <b>100</b> may be social in that it carries information about how it relates to the community in which it lives such as the number of downloads <b>160</b>, etc. The container <b>100</b> may be modified by users in that the container <b>100</b> may include content generated or assembled by end users. The container <b>100</b> may have a reputation that may be determined by its community. Finally, the container <b>100</b> may be monetizable in a variety of ways.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a method of creating a container <b>100</b> of data. At block <b>210</b>, data may be selected to be included in the container <b>100</b>. As previously stated, the data may be any data. Examples include items <b>110</b> of interest to the author of the container <b>100</b> including music, photos, tour dates, trivia, videos, lyrics, news, etc. In one embodiment, the data includes information about games or games themselves. The selection may be performed through a drag and drop operation or may be performed in virtually any other manner of adding a file to a container <b>100</b>. In addition, the container <b>100</b> may include content generated or assembled by users. For example, an author could include art, animation or movies they created in the container <b>100</b>. The data in the container <b>100</b> may be selectable and may execute an action related to the data selected. For example, the file may be a video file and selecting the file in the container <b>100</b> may cause the video file to be displayed. As another example, the file may be an executable file (such as a game) and selecting the file may cause the executable file to be executed (the game would begin). Of course, other actions and file types are possible and are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The items <b>110</b> may or may not have a common theme. For example, one card may have a college theme related to a specific college. Items <b>110</b> on such a card may include the college fight song, videos of the college's band, videos of historic sporting events related to the college, maps of the campus, dates of sporting events for the college, photos of recognizable places on the college campus, games related to the college, etc. On the other hand, another example may have a theme of movies that the user finds amusing. The items <b>110</b> may be completely unrelated movies and information related to the actors, directors and producers of these unrelated movies. Of course, these are just examples, and are not meant to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The container <b>100</b> may be created by an author <b>150</b>. The author <b>150</b> may be an individual, a group of people, a computer program that selects items to be included in a container <b>100</b> or a combination thereof. The author <b>150</b> may allow others the right to view and modify the container <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, others may copy some or all of the container <b>100</b> and the data therein to create their own container <b>100</b>. In addition, the other users may simply modify the container <b>100</b>. The author <b>150</b> may also have the right to ensure that no one else may modify the container <b>100</b> such as by &#x201c;sealing&#x201d; the container <b>100</b> which means changes cannot be made to the container <b>100</b> or copies of the container <b>100</b>. For example, a music studio may issue a container <b>100</b> and the studio may desire that only specific music be items <b>110</b> in the container <b>100</b>. In addition, there may be limited editions of the container <b>100</b>. For example, a studio may only create 5,000 containers <b>100</b> to celebrate an anniversary of a popular album release.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The containers <b>100</b> also may have signatures <b>170</b> to ensure that the container <b>100</b> is authentic. The signature <b>170</b> may have a variety of forms from a unique name assigned to the container <b>100</b> by a signature authority to an encryption algorithm such as RSA that is used to verify a signature. Of course, virtually any signature would work and is contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As the data may be copyrighted data such as music, videos, e-books, etc., license information related to the media related data may also be stored in the container <b>100</b>. Logically, this license information may travel with the container <b>100</b> when the container <b>100</b> is communicated from one electronic device to another. Also, the share-ability of the items in the container <b>100</b> may degrade over time as licenses expire. For example, if a song has a three day/three listen limit before it must be purchased, after the three days, the song may disappear from the container <b>100</b>. In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a new song (Hit the Bricks) by Willie <b>172</b> is displayed. Below the song, the time the license to the song will expire <b>174</b> is listed as is the number of plays left <b>176</b>. In addition, an option is displayed to purchase <b>178</b> the song. If the song is purchased, the license rights will change. The license data may be stored in a manner to ensure that the data is not modified without proper authority.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at block <b>220</b>, a graphical representation of the master container may be created. In one embodiment, the graphical representation looks like a credit card. As previously stated, the container <b>100</b> may take on a variety of forms in addition to being displayed as a card. The variety of possible container <b>100</b> forms is limited only by the user's or designer's imagination.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At block <b>230</b>, one or more graphical representations of the data to be displayed may be created inside the graphical representation of the master container <b>100</b>. For example, the author may desire that the symbol <b>125</b> be displayed on the container. Other graphical representations may be added. The graphical representations may be text, numbers, drawings, picture, movies, etc. Common graphical displays may include album covers, movie promos, author information, container <b>100</b> name, etc. The graphical representation is similar to a blank canvas to an artist as virtually anything may be displayed on the graphical representation. The graphical representations are limited only by the imagination.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At block <b>240</b>, the data which may represent items <b>110</b> in the master container <b>100</b> may be stored with the data being associated with the master container <b>100</b>. Similar to a folder on a personal computer, the container <b>100</b> stores the data inside it and the data is reached through the container <b>100</b>. The master container <b>100</b> may be stored in a variety of locations. The master container <b>100</b> may be stored on a central server that is accessible through a network such as the Internet. In addition, the master container <b>100</b> may be stored locally or may be accessed through a web site.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an embodiment where a master container <b>100</b> is stored on the network <b>300</b> and duplicate copies of the container <b>100</b> are stored locally. The network may have a container server <b>305</b> that stores containers <b>100</b> and allows searches of containers <b>100</b>. Containers <b>100</b> (or cards in this example) may be created in a container factory <b>310</b>. The container factory <b>310</b> may obtain data to create containers <b>100</b> from a container store <b>315</b> which may store previously created containers <b>100</b>. The containers <b>100</b> in the container store <b>315</b> may be created using a container editor <b>320</b>. In the editor <b>320</b>, cards may be created, updated or deleted. The edited containers <b>100</b> may be added to an indexer <b>325</b> and stored in an index <b>330</b> which may be searched using a container search function <b>335</b> which may be accessible to the container server <b>305</b>. In addition, the card factory <b>310</b> may draw from a usage store <b>340</b>, a user generated content store <b>345</b>, a catalog store <b>350</b>, a layout store <b>355</b> and from external data stores <b>360</b> through a external data proxy <b>365</b>. External data stores <b>360</b> may store the duplicate containers <b>100</b> of the master containers <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The network <b>300</b> may also contain players which may be stored in a player server. Players may include HTML players, player binaries and skin stores. Also, the network <b>300</b> may store shared services <b>375</b> such as authentication services. Authentication service <b>375</b> may be used to authenticate authors to modify sealed containers <b>100</b>, for example. Another use may be where some services are provided for a fee, the users are authenticated to use the services in which they are entitled.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At block <b>250</b>, others may be permitted to obtain a duplicate container of the master container. When the duplicate containers are in communication with the network <b>300</b>, the duplicate container <b>100</b> may be synchronized with the master container <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, changes made to the master container <b>100</b> may be communicated to the duplicate copies of the container <b>100</b> when the devices on which the duplicate copies of the container <b>100</b> are in communication with the network <b>300</b>. In addition, in some embodiments, changes made to the duplicate copies of the container <b>100</b> are added to the master container <b>100</b> in a type of wiki fashion, i.e., all the changes and comments by the non-authors are added to the master container <b>100</b> for all to see.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may illustrate one method of distributing updated items from a master container <b>100</b> to a duplicate container <b>100</b>. At block <b>410</b>, communicating with a network may be established. The communication may be established in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, the communication is wireless such as communication following IEEE 802.11 guidelines. In another embodiment, the communication is wired over Ethernet. Of course, virtually any communication methodology is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At block <b>420</b>, updated data related to the data in the container <b>100</b> may be obtained from the network. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, additional tour dates may be added to a music tour and tour dates that have passed may be removed from the container <b>100</b>. The additional tour dates may be added to the container <b>100</b> when the container <b>100</b> is in communication with the network.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At block <b>430</b>, the updated data may be transferred to the container <b>100</b>. The transfer may be communicated in a variety of fashions. By way of example and not limitation, the update may be a packet of data with header information to signify that the packet contains update information. Of course, the ways and manners to transfer data are virtually limitless.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At block <b>440</b>, the updated data as items in the container <b>100</b> may be displayed. In the updated tour dates example, the updated tour dates may be displayed with the other elements of the container <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the container <b>100</b> is stored on a web site. Users may be able to review and search for containers <b>100</b> using virtually any search criterion, such as the author <b>150</b> of the container <b>100</b>, the name <b>120</b> of the container <b>100</b> or a word in a song title <b>172</b>. Users can access the web site through the network <b>300</b>. Reviewing the container <b>100</b> on a web page may present additional options.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a method of interaction between a web page and a media related container <b>100</b> where the media related container <b>100</b> has a plurality of items <b>110</b>. At block <b>510</b>, a container <b>100</b> may be selected to be viewed on the web page. The containers <b>100</b> may be reviewed, searched or recommended. In some embodiments such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the container <b>100</b> is viewed as a card and the items <b>110</b> on the card are viewed as images on the card. In one embodiment, the card appears to be of a size that would fit in a wallet. A user may design what the container <b>100</b> will look like as a card on a portable device and as a web page.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As previously mentioned, the container <b>100</b> may be stored in a variety of places and a variety of different data may be stored with the container <b>100</b>. When the container <b>100</b> is stored on the network <b>300</b>, a wide variety of data and options available along with the container <b>100</b>. At a home page, statistics related to all users may be present.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At block <b>520</b>, the container <b>100</b> may be displayed in a larger form on the web page. If the container <b>100</b> is on a portable media device, the display on the device will be relatively small. If the container <b>100</b> is viewed on a larger display such as on a personal computer viewing a web page, the container <b>100</b> may be rendered in a larger size. Ideally, images on the container <b>100</b> will have sufficient detail that when they are expanded, the images are still identifiable. In addition, some authors will create separate card images the card itself and when the card is selected to be viewed on a web site.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At block <b>530</b>, the items in the container <b>100</b> on the web page may be expanded. For example, any images on the container <b>100</b> may be expanded, lists may be more detailed, additional sections may appear and the network may even add updated or additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an illustration of an embodiment of any expanded card <b>600</b>. In this embodiment, additional statistics <b>610</b> are displayed. In addition, addition items <b>620</b> are added and expanded such as the location of the various concerts, games, etc. Videos <b>630</b> are added and additional videos may be selected by selecting the video tab. Yet additional items include user profile <b>640</b>, artists <b>642</b>, album <b>644</b>, user content <b>646</b>, search <b>648</b>, send email <b>650</b>, inbox <b>652</b>, friend list <b>654</b> and update <b>656</b>. In some embodiments, additional information is obtained by selecting one of the items. For example, by selecting user profile <b>640</b>, additional information may be displayed such as friends, inbox, outbox, usage data, user generated content, etc. Selecting artists <b>642</b> or albums <b>644</b> may provide additional information such as a marketplace to buy things, editorial data such as ratings, community statistics such as the popularity, and other user generated content. This embodiment is an example and is not intended to be a limitation. Similar to the design of web pages, the variety and type of embodiments of expanded containers <b>600</b> are virtually limitless.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the container <b>100</b> is displayed as a card, expanding the card onto a web page may entail selecting the card, displaying a larger version of the images on the card on the web page and displaying additional information related to the images.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at block <b>540</b>, additional options may be displayed in at least one of the items of the container <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, the additional options include allowing a user to use authoring tools to add, remove and modify items in the container <b>100</b>. The modified containers <b>100</b> may be saved as new containers <b>100</b> with a new name.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At block <b>550</b>, if authorization is present, manipulation of the items of the container <b>100</b> may be allowed. Authorization may be available if the author has not locked or sealed the container <b>100</b>, for example. If the authorization is available, options may be displayed to add, remove or modify items on the container <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Statistics may be tracked related to containers <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a method of tracking statistics related to a container <b>100</b> of media files. At block <b>710</b>, the container <b>100</b> created by an author may be stored on a network. The network may be the network illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or any other appropriate network. At block <b>720</b>, other users may be permitted to search for containers <b>100</b>. The search may be executed using the search function <b>375</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or may be executed using any appropriate search mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At block <b>730</b>, the other users may be permitted to obtain a duplicate of a selected container <b>100</b>. As previously described, the communication may occur in virtually any manner used to transfer data. As the data is transferred from the network <b>300</b>, the network <b>300</b> keeps track of the number of downloads. In one embodiment, if a container <b>100</b> is sent directly from one device to another, a signal is communicated to the network <b>300</b> that such a transfer has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At block <b>740</b>, statistics related to the downloads of the container <b>100</b> may be stored. The statistics of interest may vary widely. For example, some users and advertisers may only care what women aged 19-24 like. Other relevant calculations may include how often a container <b>100</b> was downloaded, how often a container <b>100</b> was used, who used the container <b>100</b> an aggregate number of downloads, number of uses and greatest increase in the number of downloads. Other calculations may include calculating top referring web sites, most popular containers <b>100</b>, number of hits to a container <b>100</b>, number of container <b>100</b> views, number of unique visitors, most popular containers <b>100</b> and current visitor count. Further calculations may include where visitors entered the network, which paths were taken to access the network, where a path taken to exit the network, what are the most frequent referring sites, most frequent referring search engines, an the most frequently used keywords used to locate the network <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Yet more calculations may include an average time a user stays on the network, on a container <b>100</b> and a return frequency for a user to the network or to a container <b>100</b>. The calculation may be even more detailed such as a breakdown of physical location that accessed the network, a language of users that accessed the network, and a breakdown of the operating systems that accessed the network <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The statistics of a container <b>100</b> may be displayed as a graphical representation of a card and statistics related to the container <b>100</b> are displayed on the graphical representation of the card as items on the card. Additional statistics related to the card may be displayed when the card is displayed in a web browser. The statistics of the container <b>100</b> are updated when the device with the container <b>100</b> is in communication with the network.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The statistics may also be used in creating reputations for containers <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a method of creating a reputation for a container <b>100</b> that contains media related data. At block <b>810</b>, a user may be permitted to review a container <b>100</b> that is stored on a network. The review may be simply a review of the items in the container <b>100</b> or may be an extended review of all the items in the container <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">At block <b>820</b>, a user may be permitted to submit an opinion rating of the container <b>100</b>. The opinion may be as simple as a thumbs up or a thumbs down. In another embodiment, the opinion is a number between 0 and 100. In another embodiment, the numerical rating is supplemented with further written responses.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At block <b>830</b>, the opinion rating and an user identification may be stored. The user identification may be used to assess the reliability of the rating. Some users may be reflect the mainstream opinion while others may not. Further, by being able to identify the reviewer, the user may be able to identify and track reviewers they like or dislike.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At block <b>840</b>, the opinion rating and the user identification may be added to a database. The database may be any storage arrangement that allows searchable access to data. At block <b>850</b>, the data in the database may be used to calculate a reputation for the container <b>100</b>. The reputation may be calculated in a variety of ways.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a simple case, calculating a reputation for the container <b>100</b> entails creating a weighted average of the ratings of the container <b>100</b>. The weights may make the process more complicated but more meaningful. In one embodiment, increased weights are added to users that have rated previous containers <b>100</b> similar to the weighted average rating of the previous containers <b>100</b>. Somewhat related, a decreased weight is assigned to users that have rated previous containers <b>100</b> dissimilarly to the weighted average rating of the previous containers <b>100</b>. Another possibility is that an increase weight is added to users that have used the container <b>100</b> for a longer time than users that have used the container <b>100</b> for a shorter time. If a user has not really fully explored a container <b>100</b>, then the opinion logically may have a lesser weight. Related, an increased weight may be added to users that have used the network <b>300</b> more. If a user has been a long time user, then this opinion may be more meaningful than a user just beginning to use and evaluate containers <b>100</b>. In addition, an increased weight may be added to users that have used the network <b>300</b> more recently.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another embodiment, a prediction of a user's rating may be created using previous ratings of similar containers <b>100</b>. The prediction of opinions may take into account a variety of factors. An increase weight may be added to users' ratings that are closer to the predicted user ratings. In this way, extreme scores may be eliminated and more useful results may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The reputation related to the container <b>100</b> (or card) and the reputation may be displayed on the card. As expected, the displayed reputation may change as more opinions are received for a specific card and the change may be reflected on the displayed reputation on the card. The calculation of the reputation of the card may take on an almost infinite number of forms. Once the reputations of the cards has been created, groups of users may be create that appear to have common interests by selecting users that had similar opinion ratings of the same container <b>100</b> to be part of a group.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">If the container <b>100</b> is stored locally, it may still be completely operational even though the device storing the container <b>100</b> is not in communication with the network. For example, if the container <b>100</b> is stored on a portable media device, all the music stored on the container <b>100</b> may be played on the portable media device even though the device is not in communication with the network.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A container <b>100</b> may be added to a device even if the device is not in communication with the network. Portable media may communicate with the device in question and containers <b>100</b> on the portable media may be added to the device. For example, the container <b>100</b> may be stored on a flash memory card and the flash memory card may be added to a portable media player. The portable media player may then access the flash memory card and the container <b>100</b> may be added to the portable media device. Similarly, a container <b>100</b> on a device may be copied to a flash memory device and the flash memory device may be moved to virtual any device that can read the flash memory device and the container <b>100</b> may then be moved to that device.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Additional data may be available when the container <b>100</b> is viewed on a personal computer. As the processing, display and memory capabilities of portable devices may be limited, not all the options related to the container <b>100</b> may be displayed on the portable device. The container <b>100</b> when viewed on a personal computer or on a web device that access a web based container <b>100</b> may display additional data and options. For example,</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The container <b>100</b> may be synched whenever it is in communication with an approved network source. For example, the container <b>100</b> may contain concert information for a particular music artist. This information may be updated (additional concerts added, opening acts named, etc.) when the device on which the container <b>100</b> resides is in communication with an approved network source. Approved network sources may be the Internet which may be accessed through wired or wireless methods. Of course, other networks are possible and are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As a result of the method and apparatus described, users can create containers <b>100</b> full of data of interest to them. These containers <b>100</b> may be posted to a web site where others may share or review the containers <b>100</b>. The users may then rate the container <b>100</b> or add, modify or delete items in the container <b>100</b> to create their own container. In addition, if a user appreciates a container <b>100</b>, changes made to the container <b>100</b> by the author may be communicated to the duplicate container <b>100</b> whenever the device with the duplicate container <b>100</b> is in communication with the original container <b>100</b>, either directly or through a network. In addition, changes made on the duplicate container <b>100</b> may be posted on the original container <b>100</b> in a wiki type style. As a result, sharing and communication is increased and it is far easier for people to keep up with other people and the changing tastes in music, fashion, movies, games, etc. The subject of the data exchanged is virtually limitless.</p>
