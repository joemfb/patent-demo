No. 12/079,705, filed Mar. 28, 2008 now abandoned, entitled &#x201c;ROTATABLE PULL-TAB ASSEMBLY,&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety&#x2014;including all references cited therein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates in general to a pull-tab assembly and, more particularly, to a rotatable pull-tab assembly which substantially reseals a dispensing aperture of a beverage container to, in turn, preserve and/or retain the contents therein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pull-tab assemblies have been known in the art for years. While conventional pull-tab assemblies have been known in the art, issues relative to the resealability of the dispensing aperture associated with beverage containers remains largely problematic. In particular, to the best of Applicant's knowledge, traditional beverage containers do not provide means for resealing the dispensing aperture, thereby exposing any beverage contained therein to outside contaminates such as insects and/or debris. To be sure, the inability to reseal and/or cover the dispensing aperture may have substantially adverse implications for individuals who are susceptible to allergic reactions from insect bites and/or stings&#x2014;including anaphylactic shock and, in some cases, death.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, beverage containers are frequently wasted when one of the following occurs: (1) the contents in the beverage container loses carbonation; (2) the beverage container loses some or all of its contents via a spill; and/or (3) the contents in the beverage container becomes contaminated through exposure of the same via the dispensing aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a rotatable pull-tab assembly that, among other things, remedies and/or minimizes the aforementioned detriments and/or complications associated with conventional pull-tab assemblies and containers having the same.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent in light of the present specification, claims, and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and described herein in detail several specific embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the embodiments illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It will be understood that like or analogous elements and/or components, referred to herein, may be identified throughout the drawings with like reference characters.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to the drawings, and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in particular, a perspective view of rotatable pull-tab assembly <b>10</b> and associated beverage container <b>12</b> is shown in an initial position. Beverage container <b>12</b> is shown as generally comprising top wall <b>14</b>, bottom wall <b>16</b> and side wall <b>18</b>. Top wall <b>14</b>, bottom wall <b>16</b>, and side wall <b>18</b> form a cavity for containing a beverage therein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with the present invention, top wall <b>14</b> is configured to receive rotatable pull-tab assembly <b>10</b>. Top wall <b>14</b> is shown as comprising, among other components, seal plate <b>20</b> and severable score line <b>22</b>. The outer peripheral geometry of seal plate <b>20</b> is defined by severable score line <b>22</b>. Severable score line <b>22</b> terminates short of a complete geometrical shape to provide hinged area <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to one side of post <b>26</b> by which the rotatable pull-tab assembly <b>10</b> is rotatably and pivotally secured to top wall <b>14</b>. It will be understood that when severable score line <b>22</b> is ruptured, it creates opening and/or dispensing aperture <b>28</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which allows a beverage to be dispensed from beverage container <b>12</b>. Top wall <b>14</b> also preferably comprises lip groove <b>30</b>.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this embodiment, secondary seal member <b>46</b> preferably comprises suction cup <b>60</b> which engages around opening <b>28</b> and preferably creates a substantially hermetic seal thereby preserving the contents therein. Advantages of such a secondary seal, among others, include preserving carbonation in a beverage, preventing possible contamination and/or loss of the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a cross sectional view of an alternative embodiment of secondary seal member <b>46</b> is shown as comprising plug <b>62</b>. Plug <b>62</b> preferably fits into opening <b>28</b> and preferably contacts at least a portion of inner surface <b>48</b> of top wall <b>14</b>. It will be understood that this embodiment also acts to create a substantially hermetic seal preserving the contents therein. Plug <b>62</b> preferably comprises, for example, a section of natural rubber, silicone rubber, and/or a siloxane polymer. It will be understood that siloxane polymers which are commercially available from Dow Corning (Midland, Mich.) are particularly preferred because of their functional characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a cross sectional view of an alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown as comprising cover plate member <b>36</b> without secondary seal member <b>46</b>. In this embodiment, cover plate member <b>36</b> overlies and is preferably biased against opening <b>28</b> to substantially cover the same. It will be understood that cover plate member <b>36</b> may extend to lip groove <b>30</b>, or merely extend past aperture <b>28</b>, as is shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. It will be further understood that such a variable dimension is applicable to all embodiments provided in the present invention, including, but not limited to, those provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Other alternative embodiments may include, but are not limited to, cover plate member <b>36</b> having secondary seal member <b>46</b> which may comprise, for example, a substrate of sealing material (i.e. natural rubber, silicone rubber, and/or siloxane polymer), or a ring of sealing material.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a top plan view of a piece of sheet metal is shown having a die cut pattern for a rotatable pull-tab assembly. By way of non-limiting example, to construct rotatable pull-tab assembly <b>10</b>, a piece of sheet metal is die cut to the appropriate pattern and formed to correspond to the desired shape and size. It will be understood that the pattern used to manufacture rotatable pull-tab assembly <b>10</b> will vary depending on the type of beverage container it will be associated with.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> collectively, a top plan view of a rotatable pull-tab assembly <b>10</b> is shown. To reinforce handle member <b>32</b> and seal opening member <b>34</b>, the sheet metal may be bent upon itself to form a double thickness. This double thickness extends continuously around handle member <b>32</b> and seal opening member <b>34</b>. The sheet metal is preferably bent about line <b>50</b> during the creation of the double thickness around front edge <b>52</b> of seal plate opening member <b>34</b>. This allows leading edge <b>38</b> of cover plate member <b>36</b> to extend in the direction of handle member <b>32</b> and simultaneously creates an acute angle &#x3b8; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) between handle member <b>32</b> and cover plate member <b>36</b>. Also, the end of leading edge <b>38</b> is preferably bent to correspond a lip groove of an associated beverage container.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Cover plate member <b>36</b> will also preferably be constructed with cover plate displacement member <b>42</b>. Cover plate displacement member <b>42</b> is shown as comprising a vertical tab fabricated into a side of cover plate member <b>36</b>. It will be understood that cover plate displacement member <b>42</b> is adapted to be grasped by a user to displace rotatable pull-tab assembly <b>10</b> from an initial position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to a closed position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). To reinforce cover plate displacement member <b>42</b>, the sheet metal is bent upon itself to form a double thickness. It will also be understood that cover plate displacement member <b>42</b> may also preferably be a separate structure attached to the upper surface of cover plate member <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To secure rotatable pull-tab assembly <b>10</b> to an associated beverage container aperture <b>40</b> is die cut into cover plate member <b>36</b>. Aperture <b>40</b> comprises an inner surface <b>54</b> which contacts a post of an associated beverage container.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, post <b>26</b> may comprise, for example, a rivet, or a single post with a head. However, any one of a number of structures that would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art having the present disclosure before them are likewise contemplated for use in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, collectively, top wall <b>14</b> and/or edge wall of the beverage container may also include one or more bump(s) and/or protrusion(s) <b>15</b>, which facilitate frictional securement of cover plate member <b>36</b> while in the engaged and/or closed position. It will be understood that one or more protrusion(s) <b>15</b> are preferably placed near and/or around (e.g. proximate) aperture <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In operation, a user either grasps handle member <b>32</b> or inserts a portion of their finger into handle member <b>32</b>. A user then displaces handle member <b>32</b> upward from a storage position to a seal opening position, pivoting seal plate opening member <b>34</b> downwardly. The downward displacement of seal plate opening member <b>34</b> ruptures severable score line <b>22</b> creating opening <b>28</b>. In order to reseal opening <b>28</b>, a user grasps or simply pushes at least one of handle member <b>32</b>, cover plate member <b>36</b>, and cover plate displacement member <b>42</b>, rotatably displacing cover plate member <b>36</b> and, in turn, rotatable pull-tab assembly <b>10</b> from an initial position, to a closed position. During displacement, optional cleaning member <b>44</b> of cover plate member <b>36</b> preferably removes dirt and/or debris residing in lip groove <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the rotatable pull-tab assembly <b>10</b> is in the closed position, cover plate member <b>36</b> and/or secondary seal member <b>46</b> is positioned above opening <b>28</b>. The upper surface of cover plate is then depressed to engage secondary seal member <b>46</b> (if present) and create a substantially hermetic seal around and/or with opening <b>28</b> preserving the carbonation of the contents therein. Also, engagement of cover plate member <b>36</b> and opening <b>28</b> operates to substantially preclude loss and/or contamination of the contents of the beverage container.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It will be understood that the present invention pertains to containers that comprise food products, fruits, vegetables, liquids, solids, gases, etceteras, and that the term beverage as used herein is interchangeable with the same.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The foregoing description merely explains and illustrates the invention and the invention is not limited thereto except insofar as the appended claims are so limited, as those skilled in the art who have the disclosure before them will be able to make modifications without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
