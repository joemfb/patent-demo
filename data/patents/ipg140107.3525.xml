<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of magnetic field sensors and more particularly to the field of spin valves, with a current geometry perpendicular to the plane of the layers.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In particular, it has an application in the field of magnetic recording.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Magnetic field sensors are used in numerous applications, reading heads for computer hard disks, devices for reading magnetic tracks, magnetic ink, position encoders, shaft position encoders, electronic compasses, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Magnetic field sensors have been the subject of considerable research in recent years, in order to keep pace with the rapid increase in the recording density on hard disks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since 1992, the magnetic field sensors used in computer hard disk reading heads are of the magnetoresistive type. In a sensor of this type, the magnetic field variations modify the resistance of a magnetoresistive material, resulting in voltage variations at the terminals of the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The first magnetoresistive sensors exploited the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance of a magnetic thin layer, that is the dependence of the resistance of such a layer on the angle between the magnetization and the current applied to it.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The latest magnetoresistive sensors are based on spin valves. A spin valve is generally defined as a structure consisting of two magnetic layers separated by a thin layer of nonmagnetic metal. The magnetization of one of the magnetic layers, called the pinned layer, is maintained fixed by exchange interaction with an antiferromagnetic material. The magnetization of the other magnetic layer, called free or sensitive layer, is free to follow the variations in the magnetic field applied to it. The relative variation in orientation of the respective magnetizations of the two magnetic layers induces a change in electrical resistance in the nonmagnetic layer (called the giant magnetoresistance effect). A description of spin valves is found for example in the article by B. Dieny entitled &#x201c;Giant magnetoresistance in spin-valve multilayers&#x201d;, published in Journ. Magn. Mater. 136, (1994), pp. 335-359.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first spin valves used a current geometry parallel to the plane of the layers in a configuration called CIP (Current In Plane). The reduction of the size of the bits on the hard disks (about 100 nm&#xd7;40 nm in 2006) lead to the development of spin valves having a CPP (Current Perpendicular to Plane) configuration having both a higher integration level and a wider variation in magnetoresistance.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to this configuration, the screens that frame the magnetoresistive element also serve as a power lead and a voltage tap. A description of a spin valve having a CPP configuration can be found in particular in application WO-A-97/44781.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a magnetoresistive sensor using a spin valve <b>100</b> in a CPP configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The two metal screens <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> serve to bound the magnetic field measurement zone and as current supply and voltage tap. The width d of this zone gives the maximum read resolution. The spin valve essentially consists of an antiferromagnetic layer <b>110</b>, a magnetic layer <b>120</b> of which the magnetization is pinned by the layer <b>110</b>, a nonmagnetic thin layer <b>130</b>, and a magnetic layer <b>140</b> of which the magnetization is free to follow the external magnetic field. A bias magnetic field may be applied to the free layer <b>140</b> by means of a pair of lateral permanent magnets (not shown) so as to give it a predefined magnetization orientation, in the absence of an external magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The resistance of the spin valve is low if the magnetization directions of the free layer <b>140</b> and of the pinned layer <b>120</b> are parallel, and high in the case in which they are antiparallel. When a magnetic field to be measured is applied in the plane of the layers, this field produces a rotation of the magnetization of the free layer in said plane. The relative orientation of the magnetization of the free layer with regard to that of the thin layer determines the resistance of the spin valve.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Spin valves with a CPP configuration have a very low resistance, due to the low thickness of the layers making them up and their metallic character. In order to produce impedance sensors adapted to the typical input impedance of a preamplifier (a few tens of Ohms), it is possible to use magnetoresistive materials having a high surface resistance (measured in &#x3a9;&#xb7;&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>). For this purpose, it has been proposed to introduce, into the nonmagnetic separating layer, a discontinuous oxide layer designed to locally confine the current paths. However, this approach leads to very high current densities, and hence to electromigration phenomena detrimental to the service life of the sensor. Finally, the most promising technique appears to be the one based on the use of magnetoresistive tunnel junctions or MTJs. An MTJ junction is distinguished from a spin valve with a CPP configuration in that the separating layer <b>130</b> is made of an insulating material, for example of alumina or magnesia (MgO).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another limitation of spin valves derives from the noise affecting the read signal. This arises from various sources. As stated in the article by N. Smith et al. entitled &#x201c;<i>White</i>-<i>noise magnetization fluctuations in magnetoresistive heads</i>&#x201d;, published in Appl. Phys. Lett. 78 (2001), pp. 1148-1150, when a spin valve has a low relative variation in magnetoresistance, that is a low &#x394;R/R ratio, where &#x394;R is the variation in resistance between the parallel and antiparallel states, the predominant source of noise is of electrical origin, more precisely the Johnson noise resulting from the Brownian motion of the conduction electrons. On the other hand, if this ratio is high, the predominant source of noise is of magnetic origin. In fact, in this case, the fluctuations in magnetization in the sensitive layer can cause wide fluctuations in the resistance of the sensor. These magnetization fluctuations may be caused by the thermal agitation or may result from irreversible movements of the walls or the instability of magnetic domains. For the same dissipated power, the thermal fluctuations are commensurately higher as the size of the sensor is smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the same way, for an MTJ junction sensor having a low ratio &#x394;R/R, the predominant source of noise is of electrical origin, that is the shot noise of the tunnel junction, whereas at a high &#x394;R/R ratio, the noise is essentially of magnetic origin as stated above.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, for magnetoresistive sensors with spin valves or magnetic tunnel junctions having very high sensitivity (that is having a high ratio &#x394;R/R) the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is essentially conditioned by the noise of magnetic origin.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the typical noise density curve (normalized by RI<sup>2 </sup>where R is the resistance of the sensor and I the current traversing it) affecting the measurement signal in a magnetoresistive sensor (based on a CPP spin valve or a magnetic tunnel junction) as a function of the frequency f of the measured magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A distinction is made between three distinct noise regimes:</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a low frequency zone, denoted zone (I), extending from 0 to a few hundred MHz, the measurement noise is the sum of the white noise, partially of electrical origin (Johnson noise or shot noise) and partially of magnetic origin (thermal magnetization fluctuations in the sensitive layer of the sensor), and a noise in 1/f deriving from an insufficient magnetic polarization of the sensitive layer by the bias magnetic field. In fact, an insufficient polarization can give rise in the sensitive layer to walls likely to shift irreversibly or unstable magnetic domains of which the magnetization may jump during the rotation of the magnetization of the sensitive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a high frequency zone, denoted zone (III), typically extending from about 1.5 GHz to a few tens of GHz, the shape of the noise curve is due to a ferromagnetic resonance phenomenon or FMR. The thermally activated FMR excitations are naturally amplified when their frequency corresponds to the natural precession frequency of the magnetization of the sensitive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An intermediate zone, denoted zone (II), separates the low and high frequency zones. In this zone, the noise is essentially white, the noise in 1/f and the FMR resonance are virtually absent.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is consequently the object of the present invention to propose a magnetoresistive sensor structure having very high performance (high sensitivity, small dimensions) while exhibiting a high signal-to-noise ratio in an advantageous frequency range.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED SUMMARY OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The basic idea of the invention is to use the effect called lateral spin transfer effect to reduce noise of magnetic origin in a magnetoresistive sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The lateral spin transfer effect, also called self-torque in the literature, has been described in the article by M. D. Stiles et al. entitled &#x201c;Phenomenological theory of current-induced magnetization precession&#x201d; published in Phys. Rev. B. Vol. 69, 054408 (2004), and in the article by M. L. Polianski et al. entitled &#x201c;Current-induced transverse spin wave instability in a thin nanomagnet&#x201d; published in Phys. Rev. Lett. Vol. 92, Number 2, 026602 (2004).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> schematically illustrate the lateral spin transfer phenomenon. These figures show the interface between the'free magnetic layer, or sensitive layer <b>310</b>, and a nonmagnetic metal layer <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A distinction is made between the case in which the magnetization M in the sensitive layer is presumed to be perfectly uniform in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, and where it presents fluctuations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3C</figref>, a spin current flows from the sensitive layer to the nonmagnetic layer, that is the electrons go from the nonmagnetic layer to the sensitive layer. On the contrary, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3D</figref>, a spin-polarized current flows from the nonmagnetic layer to the sensitive layer, that is the electrons go from the sensitive layer to the nonmagnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the electrons issuing from the nonmagnetic layer and having a spin s antiparallel to the magnetization M are reflected by the sensitive layer. The reflected electrons are then sidescattered and are again returned to the interface by the electric field, while retaining their spin direction. Their interaction with the magnetization of the sensitive layer is consequently laterally invariant. The equilibrium of the sensitive layer is nevertheless unstable as shown below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the electrons issuing from the sensitive layer have their spins s polarized along the magnetization direction M and penetrate into the nonmagnetic layer under the action of the electric field. Some of these electrons, in their Brownian motion, are backscattered to the interface but, since their spins remain parallel to M, their interaction with the sensitive layer is laterally invariant.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, an electron issuing from the nonmagnetic layer having a spin s antiparallel to the local magnetization M<sub>1 </sub>of a first zone Z<sub>1 </sub>of the sensitive layer is reflected at the interface, and then sidescattered before returning to another zone Z<sub>2 </sub>of the sensitive layer having a local magnetization M<sub>2</sub>, having a distinct orientation from that of M<sub>1</sub>. Its spin s is reoriented to be antiparallel to M<sub>2</sub>, by transferring its magnetic moment to the sensitive layer. This transfer accentuates the disorientation of M<sub>2 </sub>with regard to M<sub>1</sub>. The lateral spin effect destabilizes the sensitive layer by increasing the fluctuations of its magnetization.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Conversely, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, an electron issuing from a first zone Z<sub>1 </sub>of the sensitive layer, polarized along the local magnetization M<sub>1 </sub>of this zone, has a non-negligible probability, in its Brownian motion, of being backscattered to the interface in the nonmagnetic layer. If it returns to a zone Z<sub>2 </sub>of the sensitive layer having a local magnetization M<sub>2</sub>, distinct from M<sub>1</sub>, its spin s is oriented to be parallel to M<sub>2</sub>, by transferring its magnetic moment to the sensitive layer. This transfer is equivalent to a torque which tends to align the magnetization M<sub>2 </sub>in the direction of M<sub>1</sub>. In this case, the lateral spin transfer effect stabilizes the sensitive layer by rendering its magnetization uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The lateral spin transfer effect is a spin transfer exerted by the sensitive layer on itself, thanks to the lateral coupling exerted by the electrons having passed through or having been reflected by the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the structure of a sensor according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The sensor <b>400</b> comprises two metal screens <b>401</b> and <b>402</b> serving on the one hand to bound the magnetic field measurement zone, and on the other, to input a continuous current and to measure the measurement voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As in the prior art, it also comprises a first magnetic layer <b>410</b>, of which the magnetization is pinned by an antiferromagnetic layer (not shown), and a free magnetic layer <b>430</b>, constituting the sensitive layer. A nonmagnetic separating layer <b>420</b> serves for uncoupling the pinned layer and the sensitive layer. The separating layer may be a metal layer, typically of Cu, optionally arranged in a sandwich with a discontinuous oxide layer to confine the current paths, or a fine insulating layer, for example of alumina or magnesium (MgO). This respectively produces a spin valve, a current confinement spin valve, or a magnetic tunnel junction.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The antiferromagnetic layer may consist of an alloy IrMn, PtMn, PtPdMn. The pinned layer is, for example, a single layer of CoFe 3 nm or is part of a synthetic antiferromagnetic structure CoFe/Ru/CoFe as shall be shown below.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The first pinned magnetic layer <b>410</b> has a magnetization M<sub>T </sub>oriented along a fixed direction, substantially parallel to the direction of the magnetic field H<sub>ext </sub>to be measured. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, the free magnetic layer has a magnetization M in the plane thereof, substantially orthogonal to the magnetization of the first layer. This orthogonal orientation can be obtained by applying a bias magnetic field by means of a pair of lateral permanent magnets, for example made from alloy CoCr, located on either side of the magnetoresistive element. Alternatively, in the case in which this element is a tunnel junction, the orthogonal orientation of the magnetization of the free layer can be obtained by a permanent magnet layer located in the stack (in-stack bias) between the tunnel junction and the metal screens serving to convey the current. The magnetization of the permanent magnet layer is selected in the plane of the layers and orthogonal to that of the pinned layer. By partially closing through the free layer of the tunnel junction, the magnetic field generated by the permanent magnet layer polarizes the free layer in the desired direction.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The choice of an orthogonal polarization in the sensitive layer serves to obtain a linear response of the sensor, the magnetoresistance of the spin valve or of the tunnel junction varying as the cosine of the angle between the magnetizations of the sensitive layer and the pinned layer.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Unlike the prior art, the sensor <b>400</b> further comprises a second layer <b>440</b>, called below a lateral coupling layer, suitable for controlling the lateral spin transfer effect on the sensitive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to a first embodiment, the sensor comprises means (for example, a current source, not shown) for circulating a continuous current from the lateral coupling layer to the pinned layer, that is the electrons go from the sensitive layer to the lateral coupling layer as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to the first embodiment, the lateral coupling layer is suitable for favoring the backscattering of the electrons to the sensitive layer with conservation of spin during this backscattering. In general, the lateral coupling layer <b>440</b> comprises a backscattering layer <b>445</b>, possibly incorporated in or added to a metal layer <b>443</b>, as shown respectively in</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. The lateral spin effect stabilizes the magnetization of the sensitive layer and the noise of magnetic origin in the sensor is consequently reduced when it is used in the zone (I) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The choice of the lateral coupling layer depends on the nature of the separating layer <b>420</b>. In fact, the resistance of the lateral coupling layer is in series with the magnetoresistance of the pinned layer/separating layer/sensitive layer stack (spin valve or tunnel junction). As it happens, the resistance of the coupling layer is substantially independent of the measured magnetic field, thereby reducing the relative variation in resistance &#x394;R/R of the sensor and hence its sensitivity. Thus advantageously, a lateral coupling layer having a resistance substantially lower than that of the pinned layer/separating layer/sensitive layer stack is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, if the separating layer is a tunnel barrier, the backscattering layer <b>445</b> may be according to each case:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0080">a) a second thinner tunnel barrier and/or one having a lower barrier height than the first tunnel, insulating or semiconducting barrier;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0081">b) a current confinement layer, that is a discontinuous insulating layer suitable for confining the current paths;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0082">c) a metal layer with a higher resistivity than the metal layer <b>443</b>, directly in contact with the sensitive layer.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0083">The surface resistivity of the second tunnel barrier/current confinement layer is selected to be substantially lower than that of the first tunnel barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0084">If the separating layer is a current confinement layer, the backscattering layer <b>445</b> may be according to each case:

    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0085">a) a very thin tunnel, insulating or semiconducting barrier;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0086">b) a second current confinement layer;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0087">c) a metal layer having a higher resistivity than the metal layer <b>443</b>, directly in contact with the sensitive layer.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0088">The surface resistivity of the tunnel barrier/second current confinement layer is selected to be substantially lower than that of the first current confinement layer.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0089">Finally, if the separating layer is a metal layer, the backscattering layer <b>445</b> is preferably a metal layer having a higher resistivity than the metal layer <b>443</b>, which incorporates it or which is added to it, and which is directly in contact with the sensitive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0090">For the electrons to conserve their spin as much as possible during their backscattering movement, it is necessary to avoid introducing, into the lateral coupling layer, elements tending to produce a spin flip, such as Pd, Pt, Mn, Au.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0091">According to a second embodiment of the invention, the sensor comprises means (for example, a current source not shown) for circulating a continuous current from the pinned layer to the lateral coupling layer, that is the electrons go from the lateral coupling layer to the sensitive layer as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0092">According to the second embodiment, the lateral coupling layer is suitable for reducing the sidescattering of the electrons (reflected by the sensitive layer) and/or for producing a loss of spin memory of the backscattered electrons. In this way, the magnetization fluctuations in the sensitive layer are not amplified by the lateral spin transfer effect. This serves to maintain the noise of magnetic origin in the magnetoresistive sensor to a relatively lower level.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0093">The choice of the lateral coupling layer also depends on the nature of the separating layer. For example, if the separating layer is a tunnel barrier or a current confinement layer, the lateral coupling layer may comprise according to each case:

        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0094">a) a layer having a high electrical resistivity, in which the electrons have a short mean free path. In the context of the present invention, short mean free path means a mean free path shorter than the characteristic lateral dimension of the uniform magnetization zones of the sensitive layer;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0095">b) a metal layer having a low resistivity but containing impurities causing a spin flip of the electrons.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0096">Finally, if the separating layer is a metal layer, the lateral coupling layer may comprise a metal layer having a low resistivity containing impurities causing a spin flip.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0097">The magnetoresistive sensor according to the invention can be produced as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0098">The method first preferably begins with the deposition of a nonmagnetic buffer layer on a current input electrode, for example one of the metal screens bounding the measurement zone.

<p id="p-0095" num="0105">(c) a nonmagnetic layer constituting the separating layer of the sensor according to the invention. It may be insulating, for example of alumina or MgO or TiOx, to produce a tunnel barrier. It may also be metallic, for example of Cu, to produce a spin valve.

<p id="p-0097" num="0107">However, if the first underlying separating layer is of MgO with a face-centered cubic structure, it is preferable to use a CoFe alloy having the same structure or an amorphous CoFeB alloy which can then be annealed.
