<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0034388, filed on Apr. 14, 2010, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present embodiments relate to a polysilicon layer, a method of crystallizing a silicon layer, a thin film transistor (TFT) using the polysilicon layer, and an organic light emitting display device including the polysilicon layer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A thin film transistor (TFT) is a type of an electric field effect transistor (FET) prepared by using a semiconductor thin film on an insulting support substrate. Like an electric FET, a TFT can include three devices, e.g., a gate, a drain, and a source, and performs a switching operation. The TFT performs the switching operation by adjusting a voltage supplied to the gate so as to turn a current flowing between the source and the drain on or off. TFTs are used in a sensor, a memory device, an optical device, or the like, and can be used as a pixel switching device or a driving device of a flat panel display.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, commercialized products, such as lap tops, personal computers (PCs), monitors, televisions (TVs), and mobile devices, mostly use an amorphous silicon TFT (a-Si TFT). Amorphous silicon does not have a regular atom arrangement like a crystal, and has a short distance order but not a long distance order. The amorphous silicon is mostly used in TFTs since it is easily deposited in a large area and is easily prepared on a glass substrate at a low temperature. However, as a size and quality of a display increase, a device needs to operate at a high performance. Accordingly, a high performance TFT having higher electron mobility than the amorphous silicon TFT having electron mobility of about 0.5 to 1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs, and a method of preparing the high performance TFT are required.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The polysilicon TFT (poly-Si TFT) has superior performance to a conventional a-Si TFT. Since the poly-Si TFT has electron mobility of tens to hundreds of cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs, the poly-Si TFT may be built in a data driving circuit or peripheral circuits that require high mobility. Also, since a size of a channel of a transistor may be decreased, an aperture ratio of a screen may be increased. Also, since a wiring pitch, which is used to connect the data driving circuits according to an increase in pixel numbers, is not limited due to the built-in data driving circuit, high resolution is possible, a driving voltage and power consumption may be reduced, and a device's characteristic deterioration may be very low.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of preparing polysilicon may be classified into a low temperature process and a high temperature process, according to a process temperature. Here, the high temperature process is performed at a particular temperature or above when an insulating substrate deforms, and thus an expensive quartz substrate having high thermal resistance is used instead of a glass substrate. Also, a polysilicon thin layer formed according to the high temperature process has low quality crystallization, which results in high surface roughness or minute grains.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The low temperature process is a technology of crystallizing amorphous silicon into polysilicon, and excimer laser crystallization (ELC), crystallization using a metal as a catalyst, etc. are being studied. Here, in an ELC process, a pulse shape laser beam is irradiated onto a substrate so as to melt and coagulate amorphous silicon in units of nano seconds. However, such an ELC process is expensive, takes a long time, and is inefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are conceptual diagrams illustrating crystal growth characteristics of silicon in methods of crystallizing silicon by using a metal as a catalyst. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows the crystal growth characteristics of silicon according to metal induced crystallization (MIC), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the crystal growth characteristics of silicon according to metal induced lateral crystallization (MILC). In the MIC, a relatively large amount of catalyst metal is deposited on amorphous silicon and is crystallized at a high temperature, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, small linear polysilicon is grown randomly. In the MILC, a metal used as a catalyst is arranged in a line on amorphous silicon by using a mask and then deposited, thereby growing polysilicon in one direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF CERTAIN INVENTIVE ASPECTS</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Aspects of the present embodiments provides polysilicon thin layers, which have high quality crystals, and have a crystalline catalyst metal distributed away from the bottom of a channel region so that leakage current characteristics are satisfactory, methods of crystallizing amorphous silicon into the polysilicon thin layer by using a catalyst metal, thin film transistors (TFTs) using the polysilicon thin layer, and flat panel display devices including the TFTs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present embodiments, there is provided a method of crystallizing a silicon layer, the method including: forming an amorphous silicon layer on a buffer layer on a substrate; forming a catalyst metal layer on the amorphous silicon layer to have a density of 10<sup>11 </sup>to 10<sup>15 </sup>atom/cm<sup>2</sup>; and thermal-treating the amorphous silicon layer so that a crystalline seed having a pyramid shape is formed on an interface between the amorphous silicon layer and the buffer layer as a catalyst metal of the catalyst metal layer diffuses into the amorphous silicon layer, and a polysilicon layer is formed as a silicon crystal grows by the crystallization seed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INVENTIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, the present embodiments will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2E</figref> are diagrams sequentially illustrating a method of crystallizing a silicon layer, according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a buffer layer <b>11</b> is disposed on a substrate <b>10</b>. Then, an amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> is disposed on the buffer layer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The substrate <b>10</b> may comprise transparent glass, but a material of the substrate <b>10</b> is not limited thereto, and may comprise transparent plastic. A plastic substrate may comprise an insulating organic material.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to prevent diffusion of moisture or impurities generated in the substrate <b>10</b>, the buffer layer <b>11</b> may be disposed on the substrate <b>10</b>. The buffer layer <b>11</b> may comprise a silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), a silicon nitride (SiNx), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> is disposed on the buffer layer <b>11</b>. The amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> may be formed by using one of various methods, like plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> is disposed on the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b>. The catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> may comprise a metal, such as, for example, Ni, Pd, Ti, Ag, Au, Al, Sn, Sb, Cu, Co, Mo, Tr, Ru, Rh, Cd, or Pt. The catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> may be formed by using physical vapor deposition (PVD) such as sputtering, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), or a doping method such as ion implantation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, catalyst metals of the catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> are not exist continuous, but are discontinuous. The catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> is formed at a density smaller than a monolayer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> may have a density of from about 10<sup>11 </sup>to about 10<sup>15 </sup>atom/cm<sup>2</sup>. When the density of the catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> is below about 10<sup>11 </sup>atom/cm<sup>2</sup>, it is difficult to form the catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> that is reliable and has uniform density, and it is also difficult to measure the density. When the density of the catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> is above about 10<sup>15 </sup>atom/cm<sup>2</sup>, the amount of the catalyst metals diffusing into the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> is too high, and thus a size of a crystal of polysilicon is reduced, and the catalyst metal is left on a polysilicon layer <b>20</b> forming a channel region, thereby deteriorating characteristics of a thin film transistor (TFT), for example, causing a leakage current.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> is thermal-treated so that the catalyst metals of the catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> are diffused into the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b>. Such a thermal-treatment process may be performed at a temperature from about 500 to about 800&#xb0; C. The catalyst metals diffuse into the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> via the thermal-treatment process. The diffused catalyst metals gather on an interface between the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> and the buffer layer <b>11</b>, and are diffused to two sides of the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the catalyst metals gathered on the interface between the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> and the buffer layer <b>11</b> are thermal-treated so as to form metal silicide crystallization seeds <b>21</b>, thereby growing silicon crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, grains <b>22</b> of silicon crystals grown from each of the metal silicide crystallization seed <b>21</b> encounter each other to form the polysilicon layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A polysilicon layer formed according to a method of crystallizing silicon according to an embodiment will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an optical microscope photographic image of a polysilicon layer formed according to a method of crystallizing silicon and using nickel as a catalyst metal, according to an embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, sizes of grains are tens of micrometers. Also, crystallization seeds are distributed in the center of the grain or on a boundary of the grain as metal silicide diffuses outward when a crystal grows.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When amorphous silicon is crystallized to polysilicon by using a metal as a catalyst, growth behavior of silicon differs according to an amount and distribution of the metal. The growth behavior of silicon while forming the polysilicon layer, according to an embodiment will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a transmission electron microscope (TEM) photographic image of the polysilicon layer <b>20</b> during crystallization, according to an embodiment. Here, a nickel layer is used as a catalyst metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the polysilicon layer <b>20</b> is disposed on the buffer layer <b>11</b>, and a crystallization seed <b>14</b>&#x2032; exists on an interface between the polysilicon layer <b>20</b> and the buffer layer <b>11</b>. The crystallization seed <b>14</b>&#x2032; has a pyramid shape having surfaces growing in a direction (111).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is an enlarged TEM photographic image of an interface between the crystallization seed <b>14</b>&#x2032; and the polysilicon layer <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, it is shown that a crystal growth direction of the polysilicon layer <b>20</b> is the direction (111) similar to the growth direction of the crystallization seed <b>14</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) photographic image showing distribution and the growth direction of the crystallization seed <b>14</b>&#x2032; during crystallization to the polysilicon layer <b>20</b>, according to an embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the polysilicon layer <b>20</b> is disposed on the buffer layer <b>11</b>, and the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> that is not yet crystallized is disposed on the polysilicon layer <b>20</b>. Also, a plurality of the crystallization seeds <b>14</b>&#x2032; exist on the interface between the buffer layer <b>11</b> and the polysilicon layer <b>20</b>. The crystallization seed <b>14</b>&#x2032; has a pyramid shape, and thus grows in the direction (111).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref>, it is determined that the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> is crystallized to form the polysilicon layer <b>20</b> as the silicon crystals grow and encounter each other in the same direction as the growth direction of the crystallization seeds <b>14</b>&#x2032; distributed on the interface between the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> and the buffer layer <b>11</b> and having the pyramid shape.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a secondary ion mass spectrum (SIMS) of a polysilicon layer according to an embodiment. According to the current embodiment, a nickel layer is used as a catalyst metal layer so as to crystallize an amorphous silicon layer on a buffer layer to form a polysilicon layer. Concentration of nickel is measured while sputtering the polysilicon layer formed on the buffer layer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the concentration of nickel is uniformly low in the polysilicon layer, increases in the interface between the polysilicon layer and the buffer layer, and reduces in the buffer layer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>C, and <b>5</b>, it is determined that crystallization seeds exist in an interface between a polysilicon layer and a buffer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum of the crystallization seeds <b>14</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref>. Silicon (Si) and nickel (Ni) peaks are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and it is determined that the crystallization seeds <b>14</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref> are nickel silicide based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Nickel from the nickel layer, e.g., the catalyst metal layer, diffuses to the interface between the buffer layer <b>11</b> and the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> to form nickel silicide having a pyramid shape, and the nickel silicide turns into the crystallization seed <b>14</b>&#x2032; that helps the polysilicon layer <b>20</b> to be crystallized in the same direction as the growth direction of the crystallization seed <b>14</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a TEM photographic image and shows electron diffraction patterns of an amorphous silicon layer during initial crystallization, according to an embodiment. A top electron diffraction pattern A is a background of the TEM photographic image, e.g., a pattern of amorphous silicon, and a bottom electron diffraction pattern B is a pattern region of the TEM photographic image, e.g., crystallized region. A halo-ring pattern of the electron diffraction pattern A is due to un-crystallized amorphous silicon, and a bright point of the electron diffraction pattern B is due to a crystal in a direction (111). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is determined that polysilicon grows in the direction (111) during initial growth. After the initial growth, the polysilicon grows in various directions including direction (110).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a TEM photographic image of a polysilicon layer during initial crystallization, according to an embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is an EDX spectrum of a crystallized black region of the polysilicon layer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> is an EDX spectrum of circled black dots in an amorphous silicon region in front of the crystallized black region of the polysilicon layer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, it is determined that only silicon exists in the crystallized black region since only a silicon peak is shown and no nickel peak is shown. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, it is determined that a catalyst metal forms a crystallization seed in the amorphous silicon region in front of the crystallized black region since the nickel peak and the silicon peak exist together. Accordingly, it is determined that the crystals of the polysilicon layer grow from at least one crystallization seed. Also, a growth behavior of a silicon crystal, which linearly grows as in metal induced lateral crystallization (MILC) may be inferred from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The mechanism of forming polysilicon according to crystallization has been described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 7</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A through 9D</figref> are conceptual diagrams sequentially illustrating a crystallization mechanism of a polysilicon layer, according to an embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> is disposed on the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> is disposed on the buffer layer <b>11</b> on the substrate <b>10</b>, and the catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> is disposed on the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b>. Here, metal density of the catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> is controlled to be below or equal to 10<sup>15 </sup>atom/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, since the amount of catalyst metals is very small, e.g., equal to or less than about 10<sup>15 </sup>atom/cm<sup>2</sup>, the catalyst metals from the catalyst metal layer <b>14</b> quickly diffuses into the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> according to thermal-treatment. Since the catalyst metals quickly diffuses in the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> but a diffusion speed of the catalyst metals reduces at the buffer layer <b>11</b>, the catalyst metals gather in an interface having high crystal defection density. Accordingly, the density of the catalyst metals is higher in the interface between the buffer layer <b>11</b> and the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b> than the top of the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b>. The metal silicide crystallization seed <b>21</b> is formed by thermal-treating the catalyst metals on the interface, and then the silicon crystals grow in an upward direction and a width direction from the metal silicide crystallization seed <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, as the silicon crystals grow from the metal silicide crystallization seed <b>21</b> below the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b>, the silicon crystals encounter neighboring silicon crystals, thereby forming the grains <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> shows the polysilicon layer <b>20</b> that is formed by crystallizing the amorphous silicon layer <b>12</b>. The sizes of the grains <b>22</b> of the polysilicon layer <b>20</b> are in a range from several to hundreds of &#x3bc;m. Remaining metals (not shown) or remaining metal silicide seeds (not shown) are mostly distributed in the bottom of the polysilicon layer <b>20</b>, and some exist on a boundary of the grains <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a shape of a crystal of polysilicon, according to an embodiment. The polysilicon of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> includes grains grown in the direction (111), unlike the shapes illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> or <b>1</b>B. Also, crystals that grew around a seed at the same speed encounter each other to form polysilicon. Since directions of the crystals forming the polysilicon are uniform in the direction (111), electric characteristics may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is an atomic force microscope (AFM) photographic image obtained by measuring a topography formed on a buffer layer after forming a polysilicon layer according to an embodiment on the buffer layer and then selectively removing the polysilicon layer. The polysilicon layer is selectively removed by drying etching. The topography of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows crystallization seeds remaining on the buffer layer, and shows distribution of the crystallization seeds for forming the polysilicon layer.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, metal silicide seeds are disposed in the center and boundary of the grain of the polysilicon layer, and the size of the metal silicide seeds is several &#x3bc;m if largest, in the center of the grain. This may be because the crystallization seeds remaining during an initial crystallization starting process exist in the center of the grain, and as the crystallization seed grows, the crystallization seeds encounter each other at the boundary of the grains.</p>
