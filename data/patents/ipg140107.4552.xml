<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">More customization and adaptation of coded data streams may be achieved by processing the information signal such that the various syntax structures obtained by pre-coding the information signal are placed into logical data packets, each of which being associated with a specific data packet type of a predetermined set of data packet types, and by defining a predetermined order of data packet types within one access unit of data packets. The consecutive access units in the data stream may, for example, correspond to different time portions of the information signal. By defining the predetermined order among the data packet types it is possible, at decoder's side, to detect the borders between successive access units even when removable data packets are removed from the data stream on the way from the data stream source to the decoder without incorporation of any hints into the reminder of the data stream.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to information signal coding schemes in general and, in particular, to coding schemes suitable for single media or multimedia signal coding, such as video coding or audio coding.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The MPEG-2 video coding standard, which was developed about 10 years ago primarily as an extension of prior MPEG-1 video capability with support of interlaced video coding, was an enabling technology for digital television systems worldwide. It is widely used for the transmission of standard definition (SD) and High Definition (HD) TV signals over satellite, cable, and terrestrial emission and the storage of high-quality SD video signals onto DVDs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, an increasing number of services and growing popularity of high definition TV are creating greater needs for higher coding efficiency. Moreover, other transmission media such as Cable Modem, xDSL or UMTS offer much lower data rates than broadcast channels, and enhanced coding efficiency can enable the transmission of more video channels or higher quality video representations within existing digital transmission capacities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Video coding for telecommunication applications has evolved through the development of the MPEG-2 coding standard, and has diversified from ISDN and T1/E1 service to embrace PSTN, mobile wireless networks, and LAN/Internet network delivery. Despite this evolution, there is still a need to maximize coding efficiency while dealing with the diversification of network types and their characteristic formatting and loss/error robustness requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently, the MPEG-4 Visual standard has also begun to emerge in use in some application domains of the prior coding standards. It has provided video shape coding capability, and has similarly worked toward broadening the range of environments for digital video use.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the video schemes available today have in common, that it is difficult to adapt an already coded video stream during its way from its creation to the arrival at a receiver in order, for example, to adapt the performance level of the coded video stream to the performance of the receiver or to the performance of the transmission link connecting the coded video streams source and the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, a MPEG-4 data stream may be provided at a video server in Dolby surround, thus providing a relatively large number of audio channels. However, the receiver may be a device capable of only reproducing mono-audio information. In this case, transferring the video-coded stream with full performance level, i.e. incorporating all audio channels, would mean waste of transfer-linked capacity. Thus, it would be advantageous if a gateway between the coded video stream source and the receiver could convert the coded video stream from its initial performance level to a lower performance level. However, in available video coding schemes, the gateway may not convert a video data stream from a higher performance level to a lower performance level merely by discarding the portion of the coded video data stream pertaining the excessive channels without manipulating the reminder of the coded video stream, i.e. the portion concerning both the higher performance level as well as the lower performance level.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, there is a need for a video coding scheme, which allows a higher &#x201c;network friendliness&#x201d; to enable simple and effective customization for a broad variety of systems. To be more specific, the video coding scheme should allow a greater customization of carrying the video content in a manner appropriate for each specific network. Moreover, the customization and adaptation of coded video streams should be possible with reasonable efforts.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is the object of the present invention to provide an information signal coding scheme which enables more customization and adaptation of the coded data stream with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, this object is achieved by an apparatus for coding an information signal, the apparatus comprising means for processing the information signal in order to obtain data packets, each data packet being of a data packet type of a predetermined set of data packet types, at least one of the data packet types being a removable data packet type; and means for arranging the data packets into a data stream so that the data stream comprises consecutive access units of consecutive data packets, so that the data packets within each access unit are arranged in accordance with a predetermined order among the data packet types, wherein the means for processing and the means for arranging are adapted so that even when a data packet of the removable data packet type is removed from the data stream, borders between successive access units are detectable from the data stream by use of the predetermined order.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with a fifth aspect of the present invention, this object is achieved by a method for converting a data stream representing a coded version of an information signal from a first performance level to a second performance level, the data stream comprising consecutive access units of consecutive data packets, each data packet being of a data packet type of a predetermined set of data packet types, at least one of the data packet types being a removable data packet type, and the data packets within each access unit being arranged in accordance to a predetermined order among the data packet types such that even when a data packet of the removable data packet type is removed from the data stream, borders between successive access units are detectable from the data stream by use of the predetermined order, the method comprising removing at least one data block of the removable data packet type from the bit stream without manipulating the reminder of the data stream.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with a sixth aspect of the present invention, this object is achieved by a method for decoding a data stream representing a coded version of an information signal, the data stream comprising consecutive access units of consecutive data packets, each data packet being of a data packet type of a predetermined set of data packet types, at least one of the data packet types being a removable data packet type, and the data packet within each access unit being arranged in accordance with a predetermined order among the data packet types, such that even when a data packet of the removable data packet type is removed from the data stream, borders between successive access units are detectable from the data stream by use of the predetermined order, the method comprising detecting a border between successive access units by use of the predetermined order; and decoding the successive access units.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with a sixth aspect of the present invention, this object is achieved by a data stream representing a coded version of a video or audio signal, the data stream comprising consecutive access units of consecutive data packets, each data packet being of a data packet type of a predetermined set of data packet types, at least one of the data packet types being a removable data packet type, and the data packets within each access unit being arranged in accordance with a predetermined order among the data packet types such that even when a data packet of the removable data packet type is removed from the data stream, borders between successive access units or detectable from the data stream by use of the predetermined order.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention is based on the finding that a customization and adaptation of coded data streams may be achieved by processing the information signal such that the various syntax structures obtained by pre-coding the information signal are placed into logical data packets, each of which being associated with a specific data packet type of a predetermined set of data packet types, and by defining a predetermined order of data packet types within one access unit of data packets. The consecutive access units in the data stream may, for example, correspond to different time portions of the information signal. By defining the predetermined order among the data packet types it is possible, at decoder's side, to detect the borders between successive access units even when removable data packets are removed from the data stream on the way from the data stream source to the decoder without incorporation of any hints into the reminder of the data stream. Due to this, decoders surely detect the beginnings and endings of access units and therefore are not liable to a buffer overflow despite a removal of data packets from the data stream before arrival at the decoder.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The removable data packets may be data packets which are negligible or not necessary for decoding the values of the samples in the information signal. In this case, the removable data packets may contain redundant information concerning the video content. Alternatively, such removable data packets may contain supplemental enhancement information, such as timing information and other supplemental data that may enhance usability of the decoded information signal obtained from the data stream but are not necessary for decoding the values of the samples of the informations signal.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, the removable data packets may also contain parameters sets, such as important header data, that can apply to a large number of other data packets. In this case, such removable data packets contain information necessary for retrieval of the video content from the data stream. Therefore, in case of removal of such data packets, same are transferred to the receiver in another way, for example, by use of a different transmission link or by inserting thus removed data packet somewhere else into the data stream in accordance with the predetermined order among the data packet types in order not to accidentally create a condition in the data stream defining the beginning of a new access unit although being in the middle of an access unit.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, it is an advantage of the present invention that an information signal may be coded into a data stream composed of consecutive data packets, and that removable data packets may be removed from the data stream without having to manipulate the reminder of the data stream and with, despite this, the order among the data packet types within access units being maintained so that boarders between successive access units are still derivable by use of the order, preferably merely by the knowledge of the order.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Moreover, another advantage of the present invention is the higher flexibility in arranging the data packets in the data stream as long as the arrangement complies with the predetermined order among the data packet types. This allows duplicating data packets for redundancy enhancement and purposes as well as adapting the performance level of the data stream to the receiving or transmission environment.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Before describing preferred embodiments of the present invention with respect to the figures, it is noted that like elements in the figures are designated by like reference numbers, and that a repeated explanation of these elements is left-out.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the creation, conversion and decoding of a data stream in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the data stream representing a coded version of an information signal, such as an audio, video or multi-media signal.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the information signal is indicated by reference number <b>10</b>. Although the information signal <b>10</b> could be any time-domain or time-dependent information signal, the information <b>10</b> is illustrated as a multimedia signal comprised of a video signal or video content <b>10</b><i>a </i>and an audio signal or audio content <b>10</b><i>b</i>. The video content <b>10</b><i>a </i>is illustrated as being composed of a sequence of pictures <b>12</b>, while the audio signal <b>10</b><i>b </i>is illustrated as comprising a sequence of audio samples <b>14</b>, the sequence extending along the time axis t.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although the information signal <b>10</b> could be handled, such as stored and transferred, in an un-coded digital manner, the information signal <b>10</b> is encoded in order to compress the information signal, i.e. to reduce the amount of data necessary in order to represent the information signal. This encoding process is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by arrow <b>16</b>, while an encoder performing the encoding process <b>16</b> is indicated at <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which is also referred to in the following and which shows an example for a possible environment in which the processes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> could be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">By the encoding process <b>16</b> a bit stream <b>20</b> is obtained. The bit stream <b>20</b> is composed of a sequence of consecutive data packets <b>22</b>, with the data stream <b>20</b> being illustrated as an arrow. The direction of the arrow indicates which of the data packets <b>22</b> precedes which data packet <b>22</b> of the data stream <b>20</b>. The data packets are indicated by individual rectangles inside the arrow <b>20</b> and are labeled by A-F. Each data packet is uniquely associated with one of a predetermined set of data packet types, each data packet type being illustrated by A-F. The data packets <b>22</b> are, for example, associated with a respective data packet type by a type number in a header of the data packets <b>22</b>. Each data packet type would by uniquely associated with a different type number.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Several consecutive data packets <b>22</b> are grouped into an access unit, as illustrated by braces <b>24</b>. In this way, the data stream <b>20</b> is composed of immediately consecutive access units <b>24</b> which are themselves composed of immediately consecutive data packets <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although access units <b>24</b> could have any meaning, in the following it will be assumed that each access unit <b>24</b> belongs to a specific time portion of the information signal <b>10</b>. In the case of a multimedia signal, as illustrated at <b>10</b>, each access unit <b>24</b> could, for example, represent a coded version of a specific of the pictures <b>12</b> and the corresponding portion of the audio signal <b>14</b> of the information signal <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As will be described in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the encoding process <b>16</b> could be composed of several steps. For example, as a first step the encoding process <b>16</b> could involve a pre-coding step in which samples of the information signal are pre-coded in order to obtain syntax elements of various syntax element types, each syntax element either applying to a portion of one picture <b>12</b> or a portion of the audio signal <b>14</b>, to a whole picture <b>12</b> or to a sequence of pictures <b>12</b>. As a second step, the encoding process <b>16</b> could then involve a step of grouping syntax elements being of the like syntax element type and applying to the same pictures <b>12</b> to obtain the individual data packets <b>22</b>. In a further, last step, these data packets <b>22</b> would then be arranged in a sequence in order to obtain the data stream <b>20</b> the characteristics if which will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the following, the encoding process <b>16</b> is assumed to be optimized in order to achieve a high-performance level coded version of the information signal <b>10</b>. In other words, the encoding process <b>16</b> is assumed to be adjustable in the sense that the encoding process creates, beside others, syntax elements and corresponding data packets <b>22</b> which are not essential or absolutely necessary for retrieval of the information signal from the resulting data stream <b>20</b>. In particular, it is assumed that the encoder <b>18</b> creates a data stream <b>20</b> being composed of the data packets of all possible or envisaged data packet types A-F. Of course, due to the high-performance level of the data stream <b>20</b>, same involves a greater amount of data than a data stream of a lower-performance level.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is assumed that the data stream <b>20</b> is firstly stored in a store <b>26</b> such as a video server or the like, with which the encoder <b>18</b> is connected. Now, in order to enable the transmission of the data stream <b>20</b> to a receiver <b>28</b> via a transmission link <b>30</b> in an efficient way, a gateway <b>32</b> is connected between the store <b>26</b> and the receiver <b>28</b>, and preferably between the store <b>26</b> and the transmission link <b>30</b>. This gateway <b>32</b> performs an adaptation or conversion of the data stream <b>20</b> from the high-performance level as it is provided in the server <b>26</b> to a lower performance level which is adapted to the capacity and performance of the transmission line <b>30</b> and receiver <b>28</b>, respectively. For example, the transmission link <b>30</b> may be a transmission link with a very low error bit rate. In this case, the gateway <b>32</b> would convert the data stream <b>20</b> into a data stream having less or no redundancy information.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to enable this conversion which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by an arrow <b>34</b>, in an effective and very simple way, the encoding process <b>16</b> is performed such that the data packets <b>22</b> within one access unit <b>24</b> are arranged in accordance with a predetermined order among the data packet types A-F. For illustrating purposes only, it is assumed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that the predetermined order among the data packet types A-F is equivalent to the alphabetical order. Thus, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in each access unit <b>24</b> the consecutive data packets <b>22</b> are arranged in alphabetical order with respect to their type. It is emphasized, that there is possibly more than one data packet of a specific data package type in an access unit, although such circumstances are not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and that the order among such data packets of the same data packet type may or may not be prescribed by a predetermined ordering rule. Moreover, even though it is assumed that the present data stream <b>20</b> is of highest performance level, there may exist access units <b>24</b> in the data stream <b>20</b> which do not contain data packets of all the data packet types A-F, although such an access unit is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Moreover, it is noted that for the purpose of enabling adaptation and converting the data stream in a simple way, a more relaxed predetermined order among the data packet types A-F could be sufficient as will be described in the following with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4 to 8</figref>. To be more precise, it is not necessary that the predetermined order is such strict that each data packet type is fixed to a position in front of all other data packet types, between two other data packet types or after all other data packet types. Rather, it could be sufficient if the predetermined order contains just one or more ordering rules such as &#x201c;data packets of the removable data packet type X (X=A, . . . , F) have to precede or succeed data packets of data packet type Y (Y&#x2260;X and Y=A, . . . , F)&#x201d;. In particular, it would be possible that instead of the strict alphabetic order, the predetermined order could allow the mixing-up of data packets of the data packet types C and D, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Due to the prescribed order among the data packet types A-F, the gateway <b>32</b> can convert the data stream <b>20</b> having a high-performance level to a data stream <b>36</b> having a lower performance level merely by removing some of the removable data packet types which, for example, contain redundant picture information or supplemental enhancement information which is not necessary for retrieval of the pictures <b>12</b> or audio signal <b>14</b> from the data stream <b>20</b>. Moreover, the removed data packets of the removable data packet types could as well concern essential information. In this case, the gateway <b>32</b> would, for example, transmit this information of these data packets via a different transmission link to the receiver <b>28</b> as will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is assumed that in the conversion process <b>34</b> performed by gateway <b>32</b> all data packets <b>22</b> of the data packet types A, B, and E have been removed from the data stream <b>20</b> in order to obtain a shortened data stream <b>36</b>. As can easily be understood, the borders between successive access units can still easily be detected in the data stream <b>36</b> by means of the predetermined order: Each time a data packet of a specific data packet type X precedes a data of a data packet type Y that, in accordance with the predetermined order, precedes the data packet type X of the preceding data packet, between these data packets two successive access units <b>38</b> abut or a border between two successive access <b>38</b> units exists. In the exemplary case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this condition applies all times when the data packet of the data packet type F precedes a data packet of the data packet type C. Thus, the extension of each access unit <b>38</b> in the converted data stream <b>36</b> can still easily be obtained at decoder's side by use of the knowledge of the predetermined order among data packet types even though, at decoder's side, it is unknown which if the removable data packet types have been removed. Thus, each access unit of the access units in the converted data stream <b>36</b> which are indicated by braces <b>38</b> corresponds with one of the access units <b>24</b> in the data stream <b>20</b>. In particular, the access units <b>24</b> and access units <b>38</b> are equal in number and order. Moreover, since the borders between successive access units are detectable even in the modified data stream <b>36</b> and are arranged at the same places, removal of data packets merely results reducing the size of access units <b>38</b> of data stream <b>36</b> relative to the access units <b>24</b> in data stream <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After transmission of the data stream <b>36</b> via a transmission link <b>30</b> to receiver <b>28</b>, the converter data stream <b>36</b> is decoded at the receiver <b>28</b> in a decoding process <b>40</b>. The receiver <b>28</b> may decode the data stream <b>36</b> solely by use of the data stream itself if the data packets removed at the converting process <b>34</b> merely contained information not being necessary for retrieval of the original information signal <b>10</b>. In the other case, the receiver <b>28</b> decodes the converted data stream <b>36</b> based on information contained in the data packets having been removed in the converting process <b>34</b> and having been transmitted to receiver <b>28</b> via an extra transmission link, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The result of the decoding process <b>40</b> is a decoded information signal <b>42</b> in a quality as it would be obtained by directly decoding the data stream <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the quality of the decoded information signal <b>42</b> is somewhat reduced in comparison to the quality of a decoded information signal as obtained directly by decoding data stream <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To summarize, by defining the predetermined order among the data packet types, it is possible not only to maintain the correspondence between access units in the original data stream <b>20</b> and the access units <b>38</b> in the converted data stream <b>36</b> but also to enable the receiver <b>28</b> to associate each data packet with the access unit it originally belonged to in the original data stream <b>20</b>. The latter guaranties that a receiver <b>28</b> buffering the incoming data packets and emptying the buffer in units of access units is not liable to a buffer overflow as will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the following, a specific embodiment of the present invention will be described in view of a video signal as the information signal. In the following, reference will also be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in order to illustrate the following specific embodiment in view of an exemplary application environment.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment of an encoder <b>18</b> for encoding a video signal into a data stream. The encoder <b>18</b> comprises a precoder <b>50</b>, an encoder <b>52</b> and an arranging unit <b>54</b> all being connected in series between an input <b>56</b> and an output of the encoder <b>18</b>. At the input <b>56</b> the encoder <b>18</b> receives the video signal, wherein in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustratively one picture <b>12</b> of the video signal is shown. All pictures <b>12</b> of the video signal are composed of a plurality of pixels or picture samples arranged in rows and columns.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The video signal or pictures <b>12</b> are fed via input <b>56</b> to the video precoder <b>50</b>. The video precoder <b>50</b> treats the pictures <b>12</b> in units of so-called macroblocks <b>12</b><i>a</i>, i.e. a block of, for example, 4&#xd7;4 pixel samples. On each macroblock <b>12</b><i>a </i>precoder <b>50</b> performs a transformation into spectral transformation coefficients followed by a quantization into transform coefficient levels. Moreover, intra-frame prediction or motion-compensation is used in order not to perform the afore-mentioned steps directly on the pixel data but on the differences of same to predicted pixel values, thereby achieving small values which may more easily be compressed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The macroblocks into which the picture <b>12</b> is partitioned are grouped into several slices. For each slice a number of syntax elements are generated which form a coded version of the macroblocks of the slice. For illustration purposes, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the picture <b>12</b> is shown as being partitioned into three slice groups or slices <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The syntax elements output by precoder <b>50</b> are dividable into several categories or types. The encoder <b>52</b> collects the syntax elements of the same category and belonging to the same slice of the same picture <b>12</b> of a sequence of pictures and groups them to obtain data packets. In particular, in order to obtain a data packet, the encoder <b>52</b> forms a compressed representation of the syntax elements belonging to a specific data packet to obtain payload data. To this payload data encoder <b>52</b> attaches a type number indicating the data packet type to obtain a data packet. The precoder <b>50</b> and the encoder <b>52</b> of the encoder <b>18</b> form a so-called video coding layer (VCL) for efficiently representing the video content.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The data packets output by encoder <b>52</b> are arranged into a data stream by arranging unit <b>55</b> as will be described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The arranging unit <b>55</b> represents the network abstraction layer (NAL) of encoder <b>18</b> for formatting the VCL representation of the video and providing header information in a manner appropriate for conveyance by a variety of transport layers of a storage media.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The structure of the data stream output by encoder <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is described in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the data stream output at output <b>58</b> is shown at <b>70</b>. The data stream <b>70</b> is organized in consecutive blocks <b>72</b> of coded video sequences of consecutive pictures of a video. The coded video sequence blocks <b>72</b> internally consist of a series of access units <b>74</b> that are sequential in the data stream <b>70</b>. Each coded video sequence <b>72</b> can be decoded independently of any other coded video sequence <b>72</b> from the data stream <b>70</b>, given the necessary parameter set information, which may be conveyed &#x201c;in-band&#x201d; or &#x201c;out-of-band&#x201d; as will be described in more detail below. Each coded video sequence <b>72</b> uses only one sequence parameter set.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At the beginning of a coded video sequence <b>72</b> is an access unit <b>74</b> of a special type, called instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR) access unit. An IDR access unit contains an intra picture, i.e. a coded picture that can be decoded without decoding any previous pictures in the data stream <b>70</b>. The presence of an IDR access unit in the data stream <b>70</b> indicates that no subsequent picture in the stream <b>70</b> will require reference to pictures prior to the intra picture it contains in order to be decoded. The data stream <b>70</b> may contain one or more coded video sequences <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">An access unit <b>74</b> is a set of NAL units <b>76</b> in a specified form, the specified form being explained in more detail below. The decoding of each access unit <b>74</b> results in one decoded picture. In the following, the data stream <b>70</b> is also sometimes called NAL unit stream <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The NAL units <b>76</b> correspond with the data packets mentioned above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In other words, the coded video data is organized by encoder <b>52</b> in NAL units <b>76</b>. Each NAL unit <b>76</b> is effectively a packet that contains an integer number of bytes. The first byte of each NAL unit is a header byte <b>78</b> that contains an indication of the type of data in the NAL unit, and the remaining bytes contain payload <b>80</b> data of the type indicated by header <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The payload data <b>80</b> in the NAL units <b>76</b> may be interleaved, as necessary, with emulation prevention bytes. Emulation prevention bytes are bytes inserted with a specific value to prevent a particular pattern of data called a start co-prefix from being accidentally generated inside the payload.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The NAL unit structure definition specifies a generic format for use in both packet-oriented and bit stream-oriented transport systems, at a series of NAL units generated by an encoder as referred to as the NAL unit stream <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, some systems require delivery of the entire or partial NAL unit stream <b>70</b> as an ordered stream of bytes or bits within which the locations of NAL unit boundaries <b>82</b> need to be identifiable from patterns with the coded data itself.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For use in such systems, encoder <b>18</b> creates data stream <b>70</b> in a byte stream format. In the byte stream format each NAL unit <b>76</b> is prefixed by a specific pattern of, for example, three bytes, called a start code prefix. This start code prefix is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> since it is optionally. If present, the start code prefix within an NAL unit precedes the header byte <b>78</b>. The boundaries of the NAL <b>76</b> can then be identified by searching the coded data for the unique start code prefix pattern. Moreover, the NAL data stream output by encoder <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be interleaved by emulation prevention bytes within the payload data blocks <b>80</b> of the NAL units <b>76</b> in order to guarantee that start code prefixes are unique identifiers of a start of a new NAL unit <b>76</b>. A small amount of additional data (one byte per video picture) may also be added to allow decoders that operate in systems that provide streams of bits without alignment to byte boundaries to recover the necessary alignment from the data in the stream.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additional data could also be inserted into the byte stream format that allows expansion of the amount of data to be sent and can aid in achieving more rapid byte alignment recovery, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In other systems, like internet protocol or RTP systems, the coded data or data stream <b>70</b> is carried in packets that are framed by the system transport protocol, an identification of the boundaries of NAL units within the packets can be established without use of start code prefix patterns. In such systems, the inclusion of start code prefixes in the data of NAL units <b>76</b> would be a waste of data-carrying capacity, so instead the NAL units <b>76</b> can be carried in data packets without start code prefixes.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">NAL units are classified into VCL and non-VCL NAL units. The VCL NAL units contain the data that represents the values of the samples in the video pictures <b>12</b> and are, therefore, necessary for decoding, and the non-VCL NAL units contain any associated additional information such as parameter sets, i.e. important header data that can apply to a large number of VCL NAL units, and supplemental enhancement information, such as timing information and other supplemental data that may enhance usability of the decoded video signal (<b>42</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) but are not necessary for decoding the values of the samples in the video pictures <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A parameter set is supposed to contain information that is expected to rarely change and offers the decoding of a large number of VCL NAL units. There are two types of parameter sets:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0068">sequence parameter sets, which apply to a series of consecutive coded video pictures called a coded video sequence, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0069">picture parameter sets, which apply to the decoding of one or more individual pictures <b>12</b> within a coded video sequence <b>72</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">The sequence and picture parameter set mechanism which is described in more detail below decouples the transmission of infrequently changing information from the transmission of coded representations of the values of the samples in the video pictures <b>12</b>. Each VCL NAL unit <b>76</b> contains in its payload data portion <b>80</b> an identifier that refers to the content of the relevant picture parameter set, and each picture parameter set non-VCL NAL unit contains in its payload data portion <b>80</b> an identifier that refers to the content of the relevant sequence parameter set. In this manner, a small amount of data, i.e. the identifier, can be used to refer to a larger amount of information, i.e. the parameter set, without repeating that information within each VCL NAL unit.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">Sequence and picture parameter sets can be sent well ahead of the VCL NAL units that they apply to, and can be repeated to provide robustness against data loss, as will be described in more detail below. In some applications, parameter sets may be sent within the channel that carries the VCL NAL units termed &#x201c;in-band&#x201d; transmission. In other applications, it can be advantageous to convey the parameter sets &#x201c;out-of-band&#x201d; using a more reliable transport mechanism or transmission link than the video channel for transmitting the NAL data stream <b>70</b> itself as will be described in the following with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">Now, before explaining in detail the predetermined order among the NAL unit types in accordance with the present embodiment, in the following the different NAL unit types are listed in Table 1 below along with their associated NAL unit type number for reasons of completeness.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0074">As can be seen from Table 1, NAL units <b>76</b> having a NAL unit type 1 as its header byte <b>78</b> belong to one of the non-IDR access units, i.e. one of the access units <b>74</b> which succeed the first access unit of each coded video sequence <b>72</b>, which is the IDR access unit as mentioned before. Moreover, as indicated in Table 1, a NAL unit <b>76</b> of NAL unit type 1 represent coded versions of a slice of a non-IDR picture, i.e. a picture other than the first picture of a coded video sequence <b>72</b>. As is shown in the last column of Table 1, in NAL units <b>76</b> of NAL unit type 1 syntax elements of categories C=2, 3 and 4 are combined.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">At the side of the encoder, it may have been decided not to combine the syntax elements of category 2, 3 and 4 of one slice in one common NAL unit <b>76</b>. In this case, partitioning is used in order to distribute the syntax elements of different categories 2, 3 and 4 to NAL units of different NAL unit types, i.e. NAL unit type 2, 3 and 4 for categories C 2, 3 and 4, respectively. To be more specific, partition A contains all syntax elements of category 2. Category 2 syntax elements include all syntax elements in the slice header and slice data syntax structures other than the syntax elements concerning single transform coefficients. Generally spoken, partition A syntax elements as contained in NAL units of the NAL unit type 2 are more important than the syntax elements contained in NAL units <b>76</b> of NAL unit type 3 and 4. These latter NAL units contain syntax elements of category 3 and 4, which include syntax elements concerning transform coefficients.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">As can be seen, slice data partitioning is not possible within the first picture of a video sequence so that coded versions of slices of an IDR picture are conveyed by NAL units <b>76</b> of a NAL unit type 5.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">NAL units <b>76</b> of NAL unit type 6 contain in its payload data portion <b>80</b> supplemental enhancement information (SEI) with the afore-mentioned examples.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">NAL units <b>76</b> of NAL unit type 7 contain in its payload data <b>80</b> a sequence parameters set, while NAL units <b>76</b> of NAL unit type 8 contain in its payload data <b>80</b> a picture parameter set.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">NAL units <b>76</b> of NAL unit type 9 are called an access unit delimiter and indicate the beginning of an access unit. As it will turn out from the following description, access unit delimiter are optional and not necessary for parsing of the NAL data stream <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">NAL units of NAL unit types 10 and 11 are NAL units indicating the end of a sequence and the end of the whole data stream, respectively. NAL units <b>76</b> of NAL unit type 12 contain in its payload portion <b>80</b> filler data as may be necessary for some networks. NAL unit types 13 to 23 and 24 to 31 pertain reserved or unspecified NAL unit types for specific applications.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">Now, after having described rather broadly the structure of the NAL unit stream <b>70</b> generated by the encoder <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the constrains on the order of the NAL units <b>76</b> in the bit stream <b>70</b> are described in more detail with reference to Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Any order of NAL units <b>76</b> and the data or bit stream <b>70</b> obeying the below mentioned constrains are, in accordance with the present embodiment of the present invention, in conformity with parsing rules used by a decoder of interest in order to retrieve the coded information, i.e. the video signal. Decoders using that parsing rules shall be capable of receiving NAL units <b>76</b> in this parsing or decoding order and retrieving the syntax elements.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">In the following, the positioning of sequence and picture parameter set NAL units, i.e. NAL units of NAL unit type 7 and 8, is specified first. Then, the order of access units <b>74</b> is specified. Then, the order of NAL unit <b>76</b> and coded pictures <b>12</b> and their association to access units <b>74</b> is specified. Finally, the order of VCL NAL units and association to coded pictures is described.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">As mentioned before, NAL units <b>76</b> are classified into VCL and non-VCL NAL units. The VCL NAL units contain the data that represent the values of the samples and the video pictures, and the non-VCL NAL units contain any associated additional information such as parameter sets and supplemental enhancement information, such as timing information and other supplemental data that may enhance usability of the decoded video signal but are not necessary for decoding the values of the samples and the video pictures. With reference to Table 1, which specifies the type of RBSP data structure contained in the NAL unit <b>76</b>, VCL NAL units are specified as those NAL units having NAL_unit_type=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 12, all remaining NAL units are called non-VCL NAL units.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">The NAL units having NAL unit type other than 1-5 and NAL units having NAL unit type 1-5 and, concurrently, having a syntax element indicating that they are concerning redundant pictures are removable NAL units.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">In the following, the payload data <b>80</b> is sometimes called Raw Bata Sequence Payload or RBSP. The RBSP <b>80</b> is a syntax structure containing an integer number of bytes that is encapsulated in a NAL unit <b>76</b>. An RBSP is either empty or has the form of a string of data bytes containing syntax elements followed by an RBSP stop bit and followed by a zero and more subsequent bytes equal to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">In this way, a NAL unit <b>76</b> is a syntax structure containing an indication of the type of data to follow, i.e. the header byte <b>78</b>, and bytes <b>80</b> containing the data in the form of an RBSP interspersed as necessary with emulation prevention bytes as already noted above.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">On the other hand, an access unit <b>74</b> represents any primary coded picture, zero or more corresponding redundant coded pictures, and zero or more non-VCL NAL units. The association of VCL NAL units to primary or redundant coded pictures or access units is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">In order to allow the removal of removable NAL units <b>76</b> from data stream <b>70</b> with remaining the decoding or parsing order, the format of the access unit <b>74</b> is like shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The NAL units <b>76</b> that can be removed are all types except VCL NAL units of a primary coded picture, i.e. all NAL unit types except NAL unit types 1 to 5.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each access unit contains in any case a set of VCL NAL units that together compose a primary coded picture <b>100</b>. An access unit may be prefixed with an access unit delimiter <b>102</b>, i.e. a NAL unit having NAL_unit_type 9 to 8 to aid in locating the start of the access unit <b>74</b>. Some supplemental enhancement information SEI in form of SEI NAL units of NAL unit type 6 containing data such as picture timing information may also precede the primary coded picture <b>100</b>, this SEI block being indicated by reference number <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">The primary coded picture consists of a set of VCL NAL units <b>76</b> consisting of slices or sliced data partitions that represent samples of the video picture.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">Following the primary coded picture <b>100</b> may be some additional VCL NAL units that contain redundant representations of areas of the same video picture. These are referred to as redundant coded pictures <b>106</b>, and are available for use by a decoder in recovering from loss or correction of the data in the primary coded pictures <b>100</b>. Decoders are not required to decode redundant coded pictures if they are present. Finally, if the coded picture the access unit <b>74</b> is associated with is the last picture of a coded video sequence <b>72</b>, wherein a sequence of pictures is independently decodable and uses only one sequence parameter set, an end of sequence NAL unit <b>108</b> may be present to indicate the end of the sequence <b>72</b>. And if the coded picture is the last coded picture in the entire NAL unit stream <b>70</b>, an end of stream NAL unit <b>110</b> may be present to indicate that the stream <b>70</b> is ending.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the structure of access units not containing any NAL units with NAL_unit_type=0, 7, 8 or in the range of 12 to 31, inclusive. The reason for having limited the illustration of access units to cases where NAL units of the aforementioned have been removed is, that, as already noted above, sequence and picture parameter sets in NAL units of NAL unit type 7 and 8 may, in some applications, be conveyed &#x201c;out-of-band&#x201d; using a reliable transport mechanism or, in an redundant manner, in-band. Thus, an encoder <b>18</b> may output the sequence and picture parameter sets in-band i.e. in the data stream <b>70</b>, or out-of-band i.e. using an extra output terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">Anyway, the encoder <b>18</b> or any means in between the encoder <b>18</b> and the decoder <b>28</b> has to guarantee that the following constrains on the order of sequence and parameter set RBSPs and their activation are obeyed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">A picture parameter set RBSP includes parameters that can be referred to by decoded slice A NAL units or coded slice data partition NAL units of one or more coded pictures.

This picture parameter set RBSP is called the active picture parameter set RBSP until it is deactivated by the activation of another picture parameter set RBSP. Picture parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of PIC_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process at decoder <b>28</b> prior to its activation.

This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active sequence parameter set RBSP until it is deactivated by the activation of another sequence parameter et RBSP. A sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation.

        <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0135">frame num differs in value. frame_num is an identifier in each VCL NAL unit indicating the picture <b>12</b> of the video <b>10</b><i>a </i>it belongs to. A value of frame_num may be assigned to more than one picture or access unit, but the value of frame_num in the payload data of the VCL NAL unit of successive access units <b>74</b> may not be the same. In other words, frame_num is used as a unique identifier for each short-term reference frame. For example, when the current picture is an IDR picture, frame_num shall be equal to zero.</li>

To be more specific, a coded video sequence consists of a sequence of coded pictures, wherein a coded picture may represent either an entire frame or a single field. Generally, a frame of video can be considered to contain two interleaved fields, a top and a bottom field. The top field contains even-numbered rows, whereas the bottom field contains the odd-numbered rows, for example.

Therefore, nal_ref_idc equal to zero for a NAL unit containing a slice or slice data partition indicates that a slice or slice data partition is part of a non-reference picture. Any nal_ref_idc shall not be equal to zero for a sequence parameter set or a picture parameter set in a NAL unit. If nal_ref_idc is equal to zero for one slice or slice data partition in a NAL unit of a particular picture, it shall be equal to zero for all slice and slice data partition NAL units of the picture. nal_ref_idc is, therefore, not equal to zero for IDR NAL units, i.e. NAL units with a nal_unit_type equal to 5. A nal_ref_idc is equal to zero for all NAL units having an nal_unit_type equal to 6, 9, 10, 11 or 12. Picture order_cnt_type is an syntax element contained in payload data <b>80</b> in order to specify the method to code the syntax element picture_order_count.

An IDR picture shall, for example, have pic_order_cnt_lsb equal to zero. Data_pic_order_cnt_bottoms is a syntax element that specifies, when contained in a payload data <b>80</b> of a VCL NAL unit, the picture order count difference from the expected picture order count for the top field in a coded frame of a coded field.</li>

<p id="p-0105" num="0141">After having described an embodiment for an encoder <b>18</b> and its constraints for creation of a data stream <b>70</b>, in the following there is described a possible functionality of a gateway <b>32</b> suitable for parsing the data stream <b>70</b> of encoder of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to a receiver <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0142">The gateway <b>32</b> receives the data stream <b>70</b> NAL unit-wise at step <b>120</b>. At step <b>122</b>, the gateway <b>32</b> investigates the type number, i.e. nal_unit_type, of the current NAL unit <b>76</b> just received in order to determine at step <b>124</b> as to whether this NAL unit is of a NAL unit type to be removed. For example, the NAL data stream <b>70</b> is of high performance and has several redundant coded pictures <b>106</b>. In this case, it could be, that gateway <b>32</b> decides to lower the redundancy level of the data stream <b>70</b> and removes all NAL units <b>76</b> from data stream <b>70</b> having NAL unit types 1 to 5 and concurrently having a syntax element in the payload data called redundant_pic_cnt being different to 0, wherein redundant_pic_cnt, in accordance with the present embodiment, equal to 0 indicates slice and slice data partitions belonging to the primary coded picture of an access unit. The reduction in redundancy is advantageous if the transmission link <b>30</b> between gateway <b>32</b> and receiver <b>28</b> has a low bit error rate.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0143">Alternatively, gateway <b>32</b> decides to transmit sequence and picture parameter set NAL units via an extra transmission link (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to receiver <b>28</b>. In this case, gateway <b>32</b> removes all NAL units of NAL unit types 7 and 8. Of course, it is possible that gateway <b>32</b> removes any combination of NAL unit types being removable.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0144">If the NAL unit <b>76</b> received at step <b>120</b> is to be removed, gateway <b>32</b> performs the removal of the current NAL unit from the data stream <b>70</b> and discards this NAL unit at step <b>126</b>. Otherwise, gateway <b>32</b> determines at step <b>128</b> as to whether the NAL unit received at step <b>120</b> has to be transmitted to the receiver <b>28</b> safely or has to be left unchanged. For example, if the NAL unit just received is a parameter set NAL unit it has to be transferred to the receiver <b>28</b>. In this case, there are two possibilities for gateway <b>32</b>. In the first case, gateway <b>32</b> decides to transmit the parameter set NAL unit via an extra transmission link. In this case, gateway <b>32</b> removes, in step <b>130</b>, the NAL unit from the data stream <b>70</b> and, then, transmits, in step <b>132</b>, the NAL unit via the extra transmission link. In particular, gateway <b>32</b> can perform the transmission of step <b>132</b> several times. Gateway <b>32</b> just has to comply with the constraints on the order of sequence and picture parameter set RBSPs and their activation at decoder side as mentioned above (see I and II).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0145">Alternatively, gateway <b>32</b> decides to transmit NAL units containing the parameter sets in-band. In this case, gateway <b>32</b> inserts, at step <b>134</b>, the current NAL unit at another position of the data stream <b>70</b> to be more precise, at a preceding position of the NAL data stream <b>70</b>. Of course, step <b>134</b> may be performed several times. Gateway <b>32</b> thus has to guarantee that the constraints on the order of sequence and picture parameters at RBSPs and their activation at receiver <b>28</b> are obeyed (see constraints o and p).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0146">After any of steps <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, gateway <b>32</b> checks, at step <b>136</b>, as to whether there are NAL units left in the data stream <b>70</b>. If this is the case, the next NAL unit is received at step <b>120</b>. Otherwise, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and gateway <b>32</b> awaits the reception of the next NAL data stream <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0147">In order to illustrate the decoupling of the transmission of infrequently changing information from the transmission of coded representations of the values of the samples in the video pictures the sequence and picture parameter set mechanism is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the encoder <b>18</b> and the receiving decoder <b>28</b>. The data stream <b>70</b> is represented by an arrow. The data stream <b>70</b> passed from encoder <b>18</b> to decoder <b>28</b> comprises a NAL unit with VCL data that is encoded by means of a parameter set having a pic_parameter_set_id of 3 as an address or index in the slice header. As can be seen, the encoder <b>18</b> has generated several picture parameter sets, wherein in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the picture parameter set having pic_parameter_set_id 1, 2 and 3, respectively, are shown representatively by small boxes <b>140</b>. The transmission of the parameter set NAL unit is performed via an extra transmission link <b>142</b> which is illustrated by an double-headed arrow indicated &#x201c;reliable parameter set exchange&#x201d;. In particular, the content of the picture parameter set having pic_parameter_set_id of 3 is shown at <b>144</b> in more detail for illustration purposes. The picture parameter set having pic_parameter_set_id 3 contains information such as the video format used, i.e. PIL, and the entropy coding scheme used, such as one of a context adaptive binary arithmetic coding or a context adaptive variable length (Huffman) coding. So, the NAL unit with VCL data having pic_parameter_set_id as an index to the parameter set NAL unit <b>144</b> does not have to contain all the content of the parameter set NAL unit <b>144</b>. Therefore, the amount of data contained in the stream <b>70</b> can be reduced. As mentioned above, the decoder <b>28</b> buffers the incoming parameter sets and indexes same by the pic_parameter_set_id in the current NAL units by use of the above explained activation mechanism (see I and II).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0148">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in the following an embodiment for the functionality of receiver or decoder <b>28</b> is described. At step <b>160</b> decoder <b>28</b> receives a NAL unit <b>76</b> of a NAL unit data stream <b>70</b> which may have been modified by the gateway <b>32</b> by the process described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> relative to the original version of the data stream as created by encoder <b>18</b>. At step <b>162</b>, the decoder <b>28</b> buffers the NAL unit <b>76</b> in a buffer having a predetermined buffer space exceeding a predetermined standardized minimum buffer size known to the encoder. Next, at step <b>164</b>, the decoder <b>28</b> detects the beginning of a new access unit. In other words, the decoder <b>28</b> checks as to whether the NAL unit just received at step <b>160</b> is the first of a new access unit.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0149">The detection in step <b>164</b> is performed by use of the afore-mentioned constraints on the order of NAL units and coded pictures and the association to access units (see a-f). In particular, the decoder <b>28</b> detects the beginning of a new access unit if the NAL unit received at step <b>160</b> is the first of any of the following NAL units after the last VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture of the current access unit:
<ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0150">Access unit delimiter NAL unit (when present)</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0151">sequence parameter set NAL unit (when present)</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0003" num="0152">picture parameter set NAL unit (when present)</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0004" num="0153">SEI NAL unit (when present)</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0005" num="0154">NAL units with nal_unit_type in the range of 13 to 18, inclusive</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0006" num="0155">first VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture (always present)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0156">It is noted that the decoder <b>28</b> can detect the presence of a last VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture <b>100</b> by means of the assumption that the payload data of all the VCL NAL units of the primary coded picture <b>100</b> have to yield a complete pre-coded version of one picture as well as by means of the constraints mentioned above at (w).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0157">When a new access unit has been detected (step <b>166</b>), the decoder <b>28</b> deallocates or flushes buffer space at step <b>168</b> by removing an odd access unit stored in the buffer. Thereupon, the decoder <b>28</b> makes available the picture derived from the current access unit, i.e. the access unit which precedes the new access unit, just detected in step <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0158">Otherwise, i.e. if no new access unit has been detected (step <b>166</b>), or after step <b>170</b>, the decoder <b>28</b> decodes the NAL unit received at step <b>160</b> in order to receive the syntax elements contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0159">The process then loops back to step <b>160</b>. As may have become clear from the foregoing description, the decoder <b>28</b> is not liable to a buffer overflow as long as (1) the encoder <b>18</b> has created an NAL unit data stream <b>70</b> with access unit sizes that comply with the maximum buffer size and (2) gateway <b>32</b> lets the data stream <b>70</b> unchanged, merely removes and discards removable and negligible NAL units from the data stream <b>70</b>, merely removes removable but essential NAL units from the data stream <b>70</b> with transmitting them via an extra transmission link or, alternatively, inserts NAL units merely in access units so that the resulting access unit size does not result in an buffer overflow at decoder's side. Anyway, by the above-described constraints on the creation of the data stream, the decoder <b>28</b> is in any way capable of detecting the beginning of a new access unit in an unitary and exact way. Therefore, it is possible for the encoder <b>18</b> and the gateway <b>32</b> to forecast the buffer space consumption at decoder side and, therefore, to avoid buffer spacer overflow, provided the decoder has the minimum amount of buffer space.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0160">As may be clear from the above, the present invention is not restricted to multimedia, video or audio signals. Moreover, it is noted with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, that other constellations in which the present invention could be used are also possible. For example, more than one gateway <b>32</b> could be interposed between the data stream presentation (encoder) and the decoder. With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> it is noted, that the gateway <b>32</b> does not have to influence all of the options shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For example, a gateway could be designed to implement merely the removal of NAL units from the data stream without implementing steps <b>128</b> to <b>134</b>. Alternatively, a gateway could implement all steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> except step <b>134</b> or all steps except <b>130</b> and <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0161">With regard to decoder of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it is noted that the buffering management described there helps in standardizing the data stream format of the data stream <b>70</b> of that embodiment. Nevertheless, the buffer management may be realized in a different way, for example with de-allocating buffer space in other units than access units.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0162">In other words, in accordance with the above embodiments each syntax element is placed into a logical packet called a NAL unit. Rather than forcing a specific bitstream interface to the system as in prior video standards, the NAL unit syntax structure allows greater customization of the method of carrying the video content in a manner appropriate for each specific network. In particular, the above embodiment defines how NAL units are to be ordered within in access units. The constraints formulated on the order of NAL units specify the decoding order that must by accepted by an standard-conform decoder allowing a novel degree of freedom. Moreover, the ordering of the NAL units and their arrangement specifies access units and makes the distinction between various access units possible even if NAL units that are allowed to be removed from the bitstream are removed.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0163">The above embodiments permit, by their new way of defining the decoding order, an increased degree of flexibility that is especially important in internet applications where each NAL unit is typically transported in one packet and shuffling is likely to occur. This permits simpler decoder implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0164">The distinction between various access units even if units that are allowed to be removed from the bitstream are removed permits a flexible rate shaping and transcoding of data and makes the method robust the transmission errors. The automatic distinction method also increases coding efficiency by making start codes or delimiter codes superfluous.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0165">Depending on an actual implementation, the inventive encoding/decoding/converting methods can be implemented in hardware or in software. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a computer program, which can be stored on a computer-readable medium such as a CD, a disk or any other data carrier. The present invention is, therefore, also a computer program having a program code which, when executed on a computer, performs the inventive method of encoding, converting or decoding described in connection with the above figures.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0166">While this invention has been described in terms of several preferred embodiments, there are alterations, permutations, and equivalents which fall within the scope of this invention. It should also be noted that there are many alternative ways of implementing the methods and compositions of the present invention. It is therefore intended that the following appended claims be interpreted as including all such alterations, permutations, and equivalents as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0167">Furthermore, it is noted that all steps indicated in the flow diagrams are implemented by respective means in the encoder, gateway or decoder, respectively, an that the implementations may comprise subroutines running on a CPU, circuit parts of an ASIC or the like.</p>
