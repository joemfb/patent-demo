<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to semiconductors, and more specifically, to a laterally double diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) transistor having a reduced surface field structure and method therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Laterally double diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) transistors are used in mixed signal and analog circuits for high power switching. Optimization characteristics such as on resistance (Ron), break-down voltage (BVDSS), and safe operating area (SOA) often conflict. Also, depending on the needs of the particular application, good isolation and high side capabilities may be desirable or necessary. To have high side capability means that a transistor can have all of its terminals coupled to a high potential relative to the substrate, such as when a load is connected to the source of the LDMOS transistor with the drain connected to the supply voltage. Ideally, the performance of a high side capable device does not depend on the voltage between the terminals and the substrate within the rated voltage range. High side capability is desirable because it enables greater flexibility in circuit design, for example, it allows transistors to be stacked. Good isolation is desirable for minimizing substrate injection of charge carriers and enables robustness with respect to negative excursions of the drain-to-substrate voltage. A buried layer can be used to provide isolation from the substrate and to achieve high side capability, as well as for optimizing Ron and BVDSS by providing reduced surface field action (RESURF). However, the buried layer itself can become break-down limiting. Another aspect related to a buried layer is the presence of associated parasitic bipolar transistors (BJT) that may limit the SOA. These problems can be addressed by providing a buried layer that only partially underlies the LDMOS structure; however, isolation and high side capability are sacrificed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, what is needed is an LDMOS transistor that solves the above problems.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Generally, there is provided, a P-type LDMOS transistor that is isolated using a buried oxide layer and a deep trench. The deep trench may be filled with polysilicon in one embodiment. Also a lightly doped N-type RESURF region is connected to the source region via a N-type well region. The RESURF region extends to, but not completely under the drain region leaving a gap, or opening, under the drain region. The opening under the drain allows the drain potential to spread over the full depth of the epitaxial layer on top of the buried oxide (BOX) achieving a double RESURF action with the RESURF layer being depleted from P-regions situated above and below. The P-type LDMOS transistor with double RESURF action is realized using P-type epitaxially grown layers. The P-type epitaxially grown layers are typically only optimized for N-type LDMOS transistors leaving the P-type LDMOS in single RESURF configuration for an N-type buried layer. There is provided herein a semiconductor device in a high voltage analog technology having both N-type LDMOS transistors and P-type LDMOS transistors that uses P-type epitaxially grown layers for both transistor types and also provides double RESURF action for the P-type LDMOS transistors. High side capability is not compromised by the use of a buried oxide layer to provide isolation. Furthermore, the RESURF layer can be optimized without being constrained by high side capability or isolation requirements, thus providing an improved Ron versus BVDSS and SOA trade-off.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one aspect, there is provided, a laterally double diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) transistor comprising: a substrate of semiconductor material; an insulator layer overlying the substrate; a semiconductor layer overlying the insulator layer, the semiconductor layer including: a first conductivity type well region; a second conductivity type source region in contact with the first conductivity type well region; a second conductivity type drain region; and a reduced surface field (RESURF) region, the RESURF region including at least one first conductivity type material portion, at least one portion of the at least one first conductivity type material portion is electrically coupled to the first conductivity type well region, wherein second conductivity type semiconductor material is located below the RESURF region, wherein second conductivity type semiconductor material is located over a part of the RESURF region; and a gate located over the semiconductor layer, the gate is located over the first conductivity type well region, the gate is located over the RESURF region. The first conductivity type may be N-type and the second conductivity type may be P-type. The second conductivity type drain region may include at least a portion not located over the RESURF region.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, there is provided, a P-type laterally double diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) transistor comprising: a substrate of semiconductor material; an insulator layer overlying the substrate; a semiconductor layer overlying the insulator layer, the semiconductor layer including: a N-type well region; a P-type source region in contact with the N-type well region; a P-type drain region; and a reduced surface field (RESURF) region, the RESURF region including at least one N-type material portion, at least one portion of the at least one N-type material portion is electrically coupled to the N-type well region, wherein P-type semiconductor material is located below the RESURF region, wherein P-type semiconductor material is located over a part of the RESURF region; and a gate located over the semiconductor layer, the gate is located over the N-type well region, the gate is located over the RESURF region. The LDMOS transistor may further comprise a substrate contact extending through the semiconductor layer and the insulator layer for electrically coupling to the substrate. An N-type dopant concentration of the RESURF region may be higher next to the N-type well region than at a location closer to a location under the drain region. The RESURF region may be characterized as a contiguous region of N-type material. The RESURF region may be characterized as including a plurality of portions of N-type material separated laterally by P-type material of the semiconductor layer. The LDMOS transistor may further comprise a first P-type well region, the P-type well region in contact with the P-type drain region, a portion of the P-type well region extending under the gate, wherein a part of the RESURF region may be located under a part of the P-type well region. The P-type drain region may include at least a portion not located over the RESURF region.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In yet another aspect, there is provided, a method of making a laterally double diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) transistor, the method comprising: implanting first conductivity type dopants into a layer of second conductivity type semiconductor material for forming a reduced surface field (RESURF) region of the LDMOS transistor, wherein the layer of second conductivity type semiconductor material is located over an insulator layer, the insulator layer is located over a semiconductor substrate; forming a first conductivity type well region, where the first conductivity type well region is electrically coupled to the RESURF region; forming a gate over the semiconductor layer, over the first conductivity type well region, and over the RESURF region; forming a second conductivity type source region in the first conductivity type well region; and forming a second conductivity type drain region; wherein the RESURF region is located over second conductivity type semiconductor material, wherein second conductivity type semiconductor material is located over a part of the RESURF region. The implanting of first conductivity type dopants may be characterized as implanting first conductivity type dopants into a contiguous area of the layer of second conductivity type semiconductor material. The implanting of first conductivity type dopants may be characterized as implanting first conductivity type dopants into non contiguous areas of the layer of second conductivity type semiconductor material. After implanting, the wafer may be heated so that the first conductivity type dopants diffuse into a contiguous area of the first conductivity type semiconductor material. The method may further comprise forming a second conductivity type well region, where the second conductivity type drain region may be formed in the second conductivity type well region, wherein a portion second conductivity type well region may be located over the RESURF region. The method may further comprise epitaxially growing second conductivity type semiconductor material on the layer of second conductivity type semiconductor material after the implanting, wherein the second conductivity type source region and the second conductivity type drain material may be formed in the epitaxially grown second conductivity type semiconductor material.

To form RESURF region <b>20</b>, epitaxial layer <b>18</b> is implanted with an N-type dopant, for example, phosphorus to a concentration of about 1e16-5e17 atoms per cm<sup>3 </sup>in an area defined using an implant mask (not shown).

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an LDMOS transistor <b>48</b> in accordance with another embodiment. LDMOS transistor <b>48</b> is the same as LDMOS transistor <b>10</b> except that transistor <b>48</b> has the RESURF region divided into multiple non-contiguous portions <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b>. The spacing of the openings between the multiple portions and the size of the portions can be varied to tailor the potential distribution. Spacing can be sufficiently close for the portions to merge by lateral diffusion. Also, spacing should be sufficiently close to allow the potential to punch-through, such that the non-contiguous portions <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b> are electrically coupled to N-well <b>32</b>. In another similar embodiment, RESURF portion <b>50</b> may not be present, and a spacing between portion <b>52</b> and N-well <b>32</b> is sufficiently close for N-well <b>32</b> to electrically couple directly to portion <b>52</b> via punch-through of the electric potential, or by merging due to lateral diffusion. Alternatively, an electrical coupling between portions <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and N-well <b>32</b> could be established by an electrical connection elsewhere in the LDMOS structure, for example in the device termination, allowing for larger spacing between portions <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and N-well <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a high voltage LDMOS device, it is desirable that the voltage blocking capability BVDSS be high for a gate voltage below the threshold voltage, while also having low on resistance when the gate voltage is higher. Both characteristics depend on the properties of the accumulation region, which is the P-type material of regions <b>22</b> and <b>34</b> adjacent to the channel extending laterally to the field oxide region, and on the properties of the drift region, which is the portion of the P-type material of regions <b>22</b> and <b>34</b> underlying the field oxide region and extending laterally from the accumulation region to the drain region <b>44</b>. In the off-state, most of the electric potential drops between the heavily doped drain contact region <b>44</b> and the channel region formed by the portion of N-well <b>32</b> underlying gate <b>38</b>. Mutual layer depletion due to double RESURF action promotes a uniform field distribution in the off state, thus resulting in a high breakdown voltage for a given drift length and doping level. On the other hand, the double RESURF action will allow for a shorter drift length and/or higher doping resulting in lower on resistance compared to a single RESURF structure for a given target voltage rating. The drift region above the RESURF region is depleted from above by the portion of the gate extending onto the drift region, and below by the RESURF layer. Because the RESURF layer can also be depleted by the P-type regions P-well <b>34</b> and epitaxial layer <b>22</b>, situated above the RESURF layer, and below by semiconductor layer <b>16</b> and P-type epitaxial layer <b>18</b>, the charge balance allows for high doping in the drift region enabling low on resistance without the RESURF layer itself becoming break-down limiting. As can be seen in the illustrated embodiments, P-type epitaxial material is provided both above and below RESURF region <b>23</b>. Also, a gap, or space is provided around RESURF region <b>23</b> leaving a P-type connection below or around drain region <b>44</b> so that the drain potential will spread over the full depth of the epitaxial layers <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>, and semiconductor layer <b>16</b>, which in turn are depleted by the RESURF layer under high voltage blocking conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The use of P-type epitaxial layers <b>18</b> and <b>22</b> for P-type LDMOS transistor <b>10</b> provides the advantage of a double RESURF configuration while also supporting the fabrication of N-type LDMOS transistors on the same integrated circuit, or die. High side capability is not compromised by using buried oxide isolation in conjunction with a thick epitaxial layer. Also, the use of dielectric isolation simplifies the integration of the LDMOS transistors with other device types.</p>
