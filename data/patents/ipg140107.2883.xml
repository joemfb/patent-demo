<p id="p-0003" num="0001">This application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0130905 filed on Dec. 20, 2010, and all the benefits accruing therefrom under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119, the content of which in its entirety is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">This disclosure relates to a polyimide precursor composition, a method of preparing a polyimide, a polyimide prepared by using the method, and a film including the polyimide.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Information technology is advancing rapidly, and electronic information retrieval is becoming more popular. There is an increasing need for an ultra-light, flexible, thin display that consumes a low amount of electrical power for visualizing and delivering the information regardless of place and time. To produce a flexible display, advances in flexible substrates, organic and inorganic materials useful in low temperature processes, flexible electrical components, and container and packaging technologies are also required. Among these, the flexible substrate may determine overall performance, reliability, and price of a display.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">The flexible substrate may include a plastic substrate since plastic substrates have easy workability and low weight and are applicable to continuous processing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">However, since plastic substrates may have a low thermal stability, their thermal properties may need to be improved. To meet these demands, there is an increasing need for a polyimide polymer having excellent heat resistance.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">An embodiment of this disclosure provides a polyimide precursor composition that may provide a polyimide having excellent thermal stability and optical transmittance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Another embodiment of this disclosure provides a method of preparing a polyimide having excellent thermal stability and optical transmittance.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Yet another embodiment of this disclosure provides a polyimide prepared by using the method of preparing a polyimide.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">Still another embodiment of this disclosure provides a film including the polyimide.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">According to an embodiment of this disclosure, a polyimide precursor composition is provided that includes a polyamic acid including a repeating unit represented by the following Chemical Formula 1, and a diisocyanate represented by the following Chemical Formula 2. The diisocyanate represented by the following Chemical Formula 2 is included in an amount of about 0.01 moles to about 10 moles based on 100 moles of the repeating unit represented by the following Chemical Formula 1 in the polyamic acid.</p>

<p id="p-0251" num="0249">The glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of each polyimide film prepared according to Example 1 to 4 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6 is measured with differential scanning calorimetry (&#x201c;DSC,&#x201d; model DSC 2010 available from TA Instruments Company), and the decomposition temperature T<sub>d2 </sub>of each film is measured with a thermogravimetric analyzer (&#x201c;TGA,&#x201d; model TGA Q5000 available from TA Instruments Company) at a heating rate of 10&#xb0; C./min. The results are shown in the following Table 1. Also, graphs of data acquired from the thermogravimetric analyzer are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The decomposition temperature T<sub>d2 </sub>signifies the temperature for which the sample loses 2 weight percent (wt. %) by decomposition, based on the initial weight of the respective sample of Example 1 to 4 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6. In the case of Comparative Examples 2, 3, 5, and 6, the content of the cross-linking agent is so high that the cross-linking is excessive. This amount of cross-linking hinders complete formation of the films. Therefore, the thermal decomposition temperature T<sub>d2 </sub>for the samples produced in Comparative Examples 2, 3, 5, and 6 are not measured.</p>

Therefore, a relative weight of 100% corresponds to no weight change in a sample, while a relative weight of 60% corresponds to a 40% loss of weight of the sample compared to its initial weight.</p>
