<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a fixing device of a light-emitting body and a lighting device. In particular, the present invention relates to a fixing device fixing a planar light-emitting body and a lighting device including a planar light-emitting body.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A planar light-emitting element which includes a first electrode, a second electrode overlapping with the first electrode, and a light-emitting layer between the first electrode and the second electrode, and in which light emitted from the light-emitting layer is extracted to the outside through the first electrode or the second electrode is known. A light-emitting element with such a structure has characteristics in that a light-emitting region is easily spreads on a plane and a plurality of light-emitting regions is easily arranged in a plane.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In conventional light sources typified by incandescent lamps, fluorescent lamps, and the like, a light-emitting body itself is about several centimeters high since light is emitted from a space sealed with glass. Further, since a light source is shaped like a dot or a line, efforts have been made. For example, a diffusion plate is provided between a light-emitting body and a user, in order to reduce glare of the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Owing to the above circumstances, a conventional lighting device tends to protrude from a mounting portion (e.g., a ceiling) at a height (or a thickness) of several centimeters to several tens of centimeters. When a protrusion of a lighting device needs to be reduced because of design or construction, a mounting portion is processed so that the lighting device is embedded in the mounting portion, resulting in complicated work and difficult construction. Note that in this specification, the height of a portion that protrudes from a mounting portion is referred to as &#x201c;mounting height&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, a fluorescent lamp needs to include a terminal portion, a driver portion including an inverter and the like; however, since the fluorescent lamp is a line light source, it is difficult to cover the driver portion with the light source. Consequently, a housing needs to be provided in the terminal portion and the driver portion in order to improve the appearance, which leads to an increase in the number of components.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is made in view of such a technical background. Therefore, an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a fixing device of a light-emitting body, whose mounting height is suppressed. Further, an object is to provide a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed. Further, an object is to provide a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed and in which fixtures supporting a light-emitting body are hidden from view. Furthermore, an object is to provide a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed and in which light-emitting bodies can be arranged with no space therebetween and supported.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to achieve the above objects, attention is focused on an organic electroluminescent element (also referred to as an organic EL element) in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Then, a structure is considered in which a planar light-emitting body whose thickness is suppressed is formed using an organic electroluminescent element, a terminal is provided in each of end portions facing each other in the planar light-emitting body, the terminals are made in contact with contacts provided in fixtures, and the end portions of the light-emitting body are held between the fixtures. With this structure, the above objects are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">That is, one embodiment of the present invention is a fixing device of a light-emitting body, including a first fixture including a first contact, a second fixture including a second contact, a power supply circuit driving the light-emitting body, and a switch detecting that the light-emitting body is fixed. In addition, the first fixture and the second fixture are provided to face each other so that end portions of the light-emitting body are held therebetween, and the power supply circuit supplies power for driving the light-emitting body to the first contact and the second contact through the switch.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the above embodiment of the present invention, a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed can be provided with a structure in which end portions of a light-emitting body are held between fixtures facing each other. The switch detects the light-emitting body held between the fixtures, and the power supply circuit can supply power to the first contact and the second contact; thus, a short circuit between the first contact and the second contact can be prevented in the state where the light-emitting body is not mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, one embodiment of the present invention is a lighting device including a planar light-emitting body, a first fixture and a second fixture which have elasticity and are arranged, to face each other, a power supply circuit driving the light-emitting body, and a switch. In addition, the light-emitting body includes an organic EL element, a first latch portion, and a second latch portion. The organic EL element includes a layer comprising an organic material with a light-emitting property between a first electrode and a second electrode. The first latch portion includes a first terminal electrically connected to the first electrode of the organic EL element. The second latch portion includes a second terminal electrically connected to the second electrode of the organic EL element. The first latch portion is latched to the first fixture so that the first terminal is electrically connected to a first contact provided in the first fixture, and the second latch portion is latched to the second fixture so that the second terminal is electrically connected to a second contact provided in the second fixture; thus, the light-emitting body supported by the first fixture and the second fixture is detected by the switch, and the power supply circuit can supply power to the first contact and the second contact.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the above embodiment of the present invention, the height of the planar light-emitting body is suppressed by using the organic EL element, the terminals of the light-emitting body are made in contact with the contacts provided in the fixtures, and the end portions of the light-emitting body are held between the fixtures. With such a structure, a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed can be provided. The switch detects the light-emitting body held between the fixtures, and the power supply circuit can supply power to the first contact and the second contact; thus, a short circuit between the first contact and the second contact can be prevented in the state where the light-emitting body is not mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, one embodiment of the present invention is the above-described lighting device including the first latch portion and the second latch portion in a back surface of the light-emitting body on a side where light is extracted; and in which the first fixture and the second fixture are provided to overlap with the light-emitting body.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the above embodiment of the present invention, the fixtures can be arranged in the back surface of the light-emitting body, so that a lighting device arranged adjacent to the light-emitting body does not interfere with the fixtures. Thus, a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed and in which light-emitting bodies can be arranged with no space therebetween and supported can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, one embodiment of the present invention is the above-described lighting device including the first fixture and the second fixture with a distance which is the same as a distance between the first latch portion and the second latch portion.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the above embodiment of the present invention, a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed and in which light-emitting bodies can be arranged with no space therebetween and supported can be provided. The first fixture and the second fixture are provided in advance with a distance which is the same as a distance between the first latch portion and the second latch portion in the lighting device, so that adjustments of a position where the first fixture is mounted and a position where the second fixture is mounted are unnecessary. Thus, a lighting device, which can be mounted in a simpler way, can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, one embodiment of the present invention is a lighting device including a first planar light-emitting body, a first fixture and a second fixture, which have elasticity and are arranged to face each other, a power supply circuit driving the first light-emitting body, and a switch. The first light-emitting body includes an organic EL element, a first latch portion, and a second latch portion. The organic EL element includes a layer comprising an organic material with a light-emitting property between a first electrode and a second electrode. The first latch portion includes a first terminal electrically connected to the first electrode of the organic EL element. The second latch portion includes a second terminal electrically connected to the second electrode of the organic EL element.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Embodiments will be described with reference to the drawings. Note that the present invention is not limited to the following description, and it will be easily understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the description in the following embodiments. Note that in the structures of the invention described below, the same portions or portions having similar functions are denoted by the same reference numerals in different drawings, and description of such portions is not repeated.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, a structure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1F</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2E</figref>. In the structure, a planar light-emitting body is formed using an organic electroluminescent element, a terminal is provided in each of end portions facing each other in the planar light-emitting body, the terminals are made in contact with contacts provided in fixtures, and the end portions of the light-emitting body are held between the fixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A lighting device described as an example in this embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1F</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a top view from a light-emitting surface side of a lighting device <b>550</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-sectional view along a line M-N.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The lighting device <b>550</b> includes a planar light-emitting body <b>500</b>, a first fixture <b>510</b>, a second fixture <b>520</b>, a switch <b>530</b>, and a power supply circuit (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The light-emitting body <b>500</b> includes an optical member <b>160</b> having a light-transmitting property and a sealing member <b>170</b>, and an organic EL element (not shown) provided therebetween. Note that light emission of the organic EL element is extracted to the optical member <b>160</b> side. A first latch portion <b>171</b> and a second latch portion <b>172</b> are provided in end portions facing each other in the light-emitting body <b>500</b>. The first latch portion <b>171</b> includes a first terminal <b>181</b> electrically connected to a first electrode of the organic EL element and the second latch portion <b>172</b> includes a second terminal <b>182</b> electrically connected to a second electrode of the organic EL element. By providing the first terminal <b>181</b> and the second terminal <b>182</b> in a surface other than a surface from which light from the optical member <b>160</b> is extracted, the whole surface of the light-emitting body can emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A structure of the first fixture <b>510</b> is described with reference to a top view of the lighting device <b>550</b> from which the light-emitting body <b>500</b> is removed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) and a cross-sectional view along a line M-N in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>). Perspective views partly showing the first fixture <b>510</b> and the second fixture <b>520</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>. The first fixture <b>510</b> described as an example in this embodiment includes a contact <b>511</b><i>a</i>, hooks <b>512</b><i>a</i>, a contact <b>511</b><i>b</i>, and hooks <b>512</b><i>b</i>. The second fixture <b>520</b> includes a contact <b>521</b> and hooks <b>522</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The light-emitting body <b>500</b> is held between the hooks <b>512</b><i>a </i>and the hooks <b>522</b> and between the hooks <b>512</b><i>b </i>and the hooks <b>522</b>. Ends of each of the hooks <b>512</b><i>a</i>, the hooks <b>512</b><i>b</i>, and the hooks <b>522</b>, which are described as an example in this embodiment have hook shapes and include elastic bodies. As an elastic body, a flat spring or the like can be used, for example. Since the hooks <b>512</b><i>a</i>, the hooks <b>512</b><i>b</i>, and the hooks <b>522</b> each include an elastic body, the end portions of the light-emitting body can be held between the fixtures and the light-emitting body can be easily attached and detached to/from the fixtures. The latch portions provided in the end portions of the light-emitting body are held between the first fixture and the second fixture, whereby the height of the lighting device is suppressed by the latch portions, which leads to an effect of suppressing the mounting height. The latch portion is provided on a side surface of the light-emitting body in the lighting device described as an example in this embodiment, so that the height of the light-emitting body is not increased by the latch portion. Moreover, since the light-emitting body is held between the first fixture and the second fixture, a protrusion of the light-emitting body is prevented. Note that the shapes of the hooks <b>512</b><i>a</i>, the hooks <b>512</b><i>b</i>, and the hooks <b>522</b> are not limited to a hook shape as long as the hooks <b>512</b><i>a</i>, the hooks <b>512</b><i>b</i>, and the hooks <b>522</b> can support the light-emitting body <b>500</b> to attach and detach to/from the fixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The contact <b>511</b><i>a</i>, the contact <b>511</b><i>b</i>, and the contact <b>521</b> are electrically connected to terminals provided in the light-emitting body <b>500</b>. In the lighting device described as an example in this embodiment, the contact <b>511</b><i>a </i>and the contact <b>511</b><i>b </i>are connected to the first terminal <b>181</b>, and the contact <b>521</b> is connected to the second terminal <b>182</b>. The contact <b>511</b><i>a</i>, the contact <b>511</b><i>b</i>, and the contact <b>521</b> each include a flat spring having electrical conductivity. Since the contacts are each formed using an elastic body having electrical conductivity, the contacts can be electrically connected to the terminals of the light-emitting body surely and easily.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The reason why the switch <b>530</b> is provided in a position overlapping with the light-emitting body <b>500</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. First, the second latch portion <b>172</b> is latched to the second fixture <b>520</b> so that the second contact <b>521</b> provided in the second fixture <b>520</b> is electrically connected to the second terminal <b>182</b> in the light-emitting body <b>500</b>. Next, the first latch portion <b>171</b> is moved to the first fixture <b>510</b> in a circular motion while the light-emitting body <b>500</b> is pressed on the second fixture <b>520</b>, so that the light-emitting body <b>500</b> can be held between the first fixture <b>510</b> and the second fixture <b>520</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the switch <b>530</b> is provided in a position overlapping with the light-emitting body <b>500</b>, a detector <b>531</b> can detect that the light-emitting body <b>500</b> is correctly mounted. The switch <b>530</b> described as an example in this embodiment is a contact type switch. The detector <b>531</b> in the switch <b>530</b>, which is provided in a position overlapping with the light-emitting body <b>500</b>, is pushed when the light-emitting body <b>500</b> is mounted, whereby the switch <b>530</b> turns on.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Note that the light-emitting body held between the first fixture and the second fixture turns on the switch, whereby power can be supplied from the power supply circuit to a first contact included in the first fixture and a second contact included in the second fixture. With such a structure, a short circuit between the first contact and the second contact can be prevented in the state where the light-emitting body is not mounted.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Modification Example</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A modification example of the lighting device described as an example in this embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2E</figref>. Specifically, a lighting device in which a first latch portion and a second latch portion are included in a back surface of a light-emitting body on a side where light is extracted, and a first fixture and a second fixture are provided in a position overlapping with a light-emitting body will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A lighting device <b>650</b> can be formed using fixtures, a switch, and a power supply circuit, which are similar to those of the lighting device <b>550</b>, except a light-emitting body <b>600</b>. Therefore, description of the lighting device <b>550</b> can be referred to for the details of portions having a structure similar to that of the lighting device <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The light-emitting body <b>600</b> includes an optical member <b>260</b> having a light-transmitting property, a sealing member <b>270</b>, and an organic EL element (not shown) provided therebetween. Note that light emission of the organic EL element is extracted to the optical member <b>260</b> side. The sealing member <b>270</b> includes end portions facing each other positioned inside the rim of the optical member <b>260</b>, that is, positioned to overlap with the optical member <b>260</b>. In the end portions facing each other, a first latch portion <b>271</b> and a second latch portion <b>272</b> are provided. The first latch portion <b>271</b> includes a first terminal <b>281</b> electrically connected to a first electrode of the organic EL element and the second latch portion <b>272</b> includes a second terminal <b>282</b> electrically connected to a second electrode of the organic EL element.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">By providing the latch portions in positions over lapping with the optical member, the latch portions are not seen from the optical member side, which leads to an improvement of the appearance. Further, the latch portions do not block light emitted from the organic EL element through the optical member, whereby an effective area of the lighting device can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The structure in which a planar light-emitting body whose thickness is suppressed is formed using an organic electroluminescent element, a terminal is provided in each of end portions facing each other in the planar light-emitting body, the terminals are made in contact with contacts provided in a fixture, and the end portions of the light-emitting body are held between the fixtures is described as an example in this embodiment. With this structure, a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed can be provided.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A constant voltage supply <b>901</b> supplies power to the fixture <b>810</b><i>a </i>and the fixture <b>810</b><i>b</i>, and a constant current supply <b>902</b> supplies power to the fixture <b>810</b><i>c </i>and the fixture <b>810</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, the wirings connecting to the power supplies, the contacts provided in the fixtures, and the switches provided in the fixtures will be described. Note that the fixture <b>810</b><i>a </i>and the fixture <b>810</b><i>b </i>shown in the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> each have a structure different from those of the fixture <b>810</b><i>c </i>and the fixture <b>810</b><i>d </i>shown in the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>; therefore, each description is made separately.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The contacts provided in the fixture <b>810</b><i>a </i>and the fixture <b>810</b><i>b </i>shown in the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are connected to the constant voltage supply <b>901</b> in parallel, and the fixture <b>810</b><i>a </i>and the fixture <b>810</b><i>b </i>are equivalent to the constant voltage supply <b>901</b>. Therefore, a connection relation of only the fixture <b>810</b><i>a </i>is described and the description of the connection relation of the fixture <b>810</b><i>a </i>is referred to for the description of a connection relation of the fixture <b>810</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A first power supply potential is supplied from the constant voltage supply <b>901</b> to a first terminal of the switch <b>830</b><i>a</i>. A second terminal of the switch <b>830</b><i>a </i>is connected to the contacts <b>811</b><i>a </i>and <b>811</b><i>b</i>. The contacts <b>811</b><i>a </i>and <b>811</b><i>b </i>are connected to a first terminal of the DCDC converter <b>630</b><i>a </i>provided in the light-emitting body through a first terminal (not shown) of the light-emitting body. A second terminal of the DCDC converter <b>630</b><i>a </i>is connected to a first electrode of the light-emitting element <b>620</b><i>a</i>. A second power supply potential is supplied from the constant voltage supply <b>901</b> to a second electrode of the light-emitting element <b>620</b><i>a </i>through the contact <b>823</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The switch <b>830</b><i>a </i>detects that the light-emitting body is correctly mounted on the fixture <b>810</b><i>a</i>, and the constant voltage supply <b>901</b> connected to the first terminal is connected to the second terminal. Note that the structure of the switch <b>830</b><i>a </i>is not particularly limited. For example, a contact type switch can be used. In that case, when the light-emitting body is mounted, the light-emitting body pushes the switch, whereby whether the light-emitting body is held or not can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, the light-emitting body described as an example in this embodiment includes a DCDC converter suitable for the specifications of a light-emitting element. By including the DCDC converter on the light-emitting body side, a problem of flow of overcurrent to the light-emitting element can be prevented even in the case where light-emitting elements with different driving voltages are included in the light-emitting bodies. Thus, the light-emitting body can be freely replaced with a light-emitting body with desired specifications without any change in an output voltage of the constant voltage supply.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Note that the DCDC converter may be provided on the fixture side not on the light-emitting body side. For example, the DCDC converter can be connected between the switch <b>830</b><i>a </i>and the contact <b>811</b><i>a </i>and between the switch <b>830</b><i>a </i>and the contact <b>811</b><i>b</i>. With a structure in which the DCDC converter is provided in the fixture side, the cost of manufacturing the light-emitting body that is a consumable product can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">With such a structure and connections, a lighting device, in which a switch detects that a light-emitting body is correctly mounted, and power can be supplied to contacts in a fixture, can be provided.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The contacts <b>811</b><i>a </i>and <b>811</b><i>b </i>provided in the fixture <b>810</b><i>c </i>are connected to a first terminal of the light-emitting element <b>620</b><i>c </i>included in the light-emitting body. A second terminal of the light-emitting element <b>620</b><i>c </i>is connected to the other output terminal of the constant current supply <b>902</b> through the contact <b>823</b> provided in the fixture <b>810</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The switch <b>830</b><i>c </i>detects a state in which the light-emitting body is correctly mounted on the fixture <b>810</b><i>c</i>, and the first terminal of the switch <b>830</b><i>c </i>is connected to the second terminal of the switch <b>830</b><i>c</i>. In a state other than the above, the first terminal of the switch <b>830</b><i>c </i>is connected to the third terminal of the switch <b>830</b><i>c</i>.

In a state other than the above, the first terminal of the switch <b>830</b><i>d </i>is connected to the third terminal of the switch <b>830</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Note that for the switch <b>830</b><i>c </i>and the switch <b>830</b><i>d</i>, a switch, which detects that a light-emitting body is correctly mounted and in which a second terminal or a third terminal is connected to a first terminal, is used. For example, a structure can be employed in which a contact type switch is pushed by a light-emitting body when a light-emitting body is mounted, whereby whether the light-emitting body is held or not is detected. Alternatively, a relay can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">With such a structure and connections, a lighting device, in which a switch detects that a light-emitting body is correctly mounted and power can be supplied to contacts in a fixture, can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When light-emitting bodies, each including an organic EL element as a light-emitting element, are connected to the constant current supply <b>902</b> in series, the light-emitting bodies connected in series can emit light at substantially the same luminance. This is because the luminance of an organic EL element is roughly controlled by a driving current. In the case of using a plurality of lighting devices which are arranged, the lighting devices emit light at the same luminance, so that uniform luminance can be achieved, which is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">With such a structure and connections, a bypass circuit can be provided for each of a plurality of light-emitting bodies connected in series. There is a problem in that when one of a plurality of light-emitting bodies connected in series is out of order and the conductivity is lost, a current does not flow to all of the other light-emitting bodies connected in series. However, by providing a bypass circuit for each of the plurality of light-emitting bodies connected in series, the other light-emitting bodies can be connected in series while the light-emitting body losing conductivity is bypassed; therefore, a constant current can be supplied to a light-emitting body with no problem and the lighting device can be operated.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, in the lighting device described as an example in this embodiment, when the light-emitting element <b>620</b><i>c </i>loses conductivity, a current does not flow to the light-emitting element <b>620</b><i>d </i>connected in series to the light-emitting element <b>620</b><i>c</i>. However, by removing the light-emitting element <b>620</b><i>c </i>with a problem and connecting the first terminal of the switch <b>830</b><i>c </i>to the third terminal of the switch <b>830</b><i>c</i>, a current can be flown to the light-emitting element <b>620</b><i>d </i>through a bypass circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Modification Example</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As a modification example of the lighting device described as an example in this embodiment, a lighting device having a structure in which a relay is used as a switch, a sensor observing an operation state of a light-emitting element in the lighting device is provided, and the relay is operated depending on a signal of the sensor can be given.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">For example, in the case where a sensor detecting temperature of the light-emitting element is provided in the lighting device, and the temperature of the light-emitting element is determined as unusual, a signal is input to the relay to switch connection from the light-emitting body to a bypass circuit, and power supply to the light-emitting body can be stopped. Such a structure prevents lights of all of the light-emitting bodies connected in series from being turned off due to one light-emitting element with a problem. In addition, only light of a light-emitting body including the light-emitting element with a problem turns off, so that a user can visually identify the light-emitting body, and the light-emitting body can be easily exchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The sensor detecting an operation state of a light-emitting element is not limited to a temperature sensor, and a photosensor detecting unusual brightness, a potentiometer detecting an unusual voltage between terminals of a light-emitting element, or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The structure in which a planar light-emitting body whose thickness is suppressed is formed using an organic electroluminescent element, a terminal is provided in each of end portions facing each other in the planar light-emitting body, the terminals are made in contact with contacts provided in a fixture, and the end portions of the light-emitting body are held by the fixture is described as an example in this embodiment. With this structure, a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed can be provided. Further, a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed and in which a fixture supporting a light-emitting body is hidden from view can be provided. Furthermore, a lighting device whose mounting height is suppressed and in which light-emitting bodies can be arranged with no space therebetween and supported can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">This embodiment can be freely combined with any of the other embodiments in this specification.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In this embodiment, a structure of a planar light-emitting body whose thickness is suppressed and which uses an organic electroluminescent element and can be used in Embodiments 1 to 3, will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Specifically, a light-emitting body including an optical member, an organic EL element, a drying agent, a first sealing member, a DCDC converter, a second sealing member, a first latch portion, a second latch portion, a first terminal, and a second terminal will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a light-emitting body <b>2000</b> described as an example in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The light-emitting body <b>2000</b> includes an optical member <b>2250</b>, an organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>a</i>, an organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>b</i>, an organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>c</i>, an organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>d</i>, a first sealing member <b>2273</b>, and a second sealing member <b>2274</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The optical member <b>2250</b> has a light-transmitting property. A hemispherical structure body <b>2251</b> is formed on one surface of the optical member <b>2550</b>, and an uneven structure <b>2252</b> is formed on the other surface. The optical member <b>2250</b> can be manufactured by shaping or bonding a plastic, glass, or the like and is formed using a material with a refractive index (e.g., with a refractive index greater than or equal to 1 and less than 1.6), which is relatively easily obtained at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">With the hemispherical structure provided in the one surface, efficiency of extracting light from the light-emitting element to the air can be increased. In particular, a planarized structure in which a material with a high refractive index (e.g., a resin or the like with a refractive index greater than or equal to 1.6 and less than or equal to 2.1) is applied to the unevenness provided on the other surface is preferable. By filling the unevenness with the resin with a high refractive index, a structure body with a high refractive index is formed on the other surface, which is in contact with the light-emitting element, resulting in an increase in the efficiency of extracting light.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Note that a barrier film having a high refractive index (e.g., a refractive index greater than or equal to 1.6 and less than or equal to 2.1) and transmitting light emitted from the light-emitting element is preferably provided at the interface between the optical member. <b>2250</b> and the light-emitting element. An inorganic material such as a silicon nitride film is preferably used as the barrier film. By providing the barrier film, diffusion of an impurity to the light-emitting element can be prevented and the decrease in reliability can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>a</i>, a layer <b>2203</b> containing an organic compound with a light-emitting property is provided between a first electrode <b>2201</b> and a second electrode <b>2202</b>. In this embodiment, the first electrode <b>2201</b> includes a conductive film (e.g., indium tin oxide (ITO)) transmitting light emitted from the organic EL element itself, and the second electrode <b>2202</b> includes a conductive film (e.g., aluminum) reflecting light emitted from the organic EL element itself.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Note that the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>b</i>, the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>c</i>, and the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>d </i>have the same structure as that of the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>a</i>; therefore, description of the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>a </i>can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Note that the organic EL elements of this embodiment are connected in series. Specifically, the first electrode of the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>a </i>is connected to a second electrode of the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>b</i>. A first electrode of the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>b </i>is connected to a second electrode of the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>c</i>. A first electrode of the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>c </i>is connected to a second electrode of the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>d</i>. With such a structure, a driving voltage of the light-emitting body can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In general, an alternating current of about 100 V is supplied from a lamp line as a voltage. On the other hand, an organic EL element operates at a direct current of about 3 V to 5 V. When a difference between a voltage supplied from a lamp line to a converter and a driving voltage of an organic EL element connected to the converter as a load is large, there is a problem of the decrease in the power conversion efficiency of the converter.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The light-emitting body <b>2000</b> described as an example in this embodiment includes a plurality of organic EL elements and the organic EL elements are connected in series in order to obtain a driving voltage that can be efficiently converted by converter. With such a structure, the power conversion efficiency of the converter is increased and power consumption can be reduced. Note that a driving voltage can be adjusted as appropriate by changing the number of organic EL elements connected in series. Further, a range where the power conversion efficiency of a converter is well is specifically the output voltage of about greater than or equal to 12 V and less than or equal to 50 V.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The first sealing member <b>2273</b> has a barrier property to moisture or the like, and by sealing an organic EL element with a dry agent <b>2275</b>, the organic EL element is protected from the air. Glass or a metal lid can be used as the first sealing member <b>2273</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Note that a first electrode of the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>d </i>is connected to a first extraction terminal <b>2291</b> extending the outside of the first sealing member <b>2273</b>. A second electrode of the organic EL element <b>2200</b><i>a </i>is connected to a second extraction terminal <b>2292</b> extending the outside of the first sealing member <b>2273</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The light-emitting body described as an example in this embodiment includes a DCDC converter <b>2300</b> over the first extraction terminal <b>2291</b>; however, the DCDC converter <b>2300</b> can be provided on a fixture side.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The second sealing member <b>2274</b> is a housing of the light-emitting body <b>2000</b>, and a first latch portion <b>2271</b> and a second latch portion <b>2272</b> are included in end portions facing each other in the second sealing housing member <b>2274</b>. The first latch portion <b>2271</b> includes a first terminal <b>2281</b> electrically connecting to a first extraction terminal <b>2291</b> through the DCDC converter <b>2300</b>.
