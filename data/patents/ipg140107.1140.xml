<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention describes a device for preserving and serving by-the-glass wine, or other liquid that can be affected by oxygen, from a bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In particular, the invention relates to the field of enology and is adapted to be used in cellars, wine shops, bars, restaurants or places for by-the-glass wine tasting. This way, organoleptic features of the wine are preserved.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Devices are known for preserving wine, or other liquid that can be affected by oxygen in bottles, that operates either under vacuum or by means of inert gas, for already open wine bottles. The main object of such apparatus is to preserve, for the longest time possible, the organoleptic features of wine that, as well known, change after contact with oxygen present in the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This kind of devices comprises, normally, a plug which can be fixed to the opening of a bottle and which is equipped with a check valve that allows the air or gas flow according in a single direction, for causing the suction of air or the supply of an inert gas inside.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With reference to the latter kind of apparatus, which use a inert fluid against the alteration of wine, special devices for the supply of wine are used that exploit a variation of the pressure in the bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, such apparatus provide a releasable fastening member engageable with the opening of a bottle, a thin delivery tube that draws wine from the bottle, and a gas injection duct that pumps in the bottle a pressurized gas, for example an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon; the increasing pressure in the bottle causes the wine to exit from the thin delivery tube. Once ended the delivery of wine the device prevents the air to exit from the bottle by a check valve.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, the valve, in the known devices, comprises an &#x201c;a mushroom&#x201d; element, or in other exemplary embodiments a couple of lips, coupled to each other, in a normally closed configuration. In the first case, the pressure difference, applied by the gas supply apparatus causes the element to slide from a position, where it blocks the gas duct to a gas inlet position. In the other case, according at a same operation, the blades pass from an open position to a closed position causing the inert gas or air to flow by suction from the inside of the bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The drawbacks of such apparatus are, firstly, in the components, since lips or &#x201c;mushroom&#x201d; valves loose their functionality with time thus affecting partially or completely the tightness and then allowing the oxygen to flow inside.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to this aspect also low functionality of such valves is present, since for keeping a positive pressure, even if low, in the bottle a perfect tightness has to be achieved that is not ensured by a single seal element represented by the valve.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is then a general object of the present invention to provide a device for preserving and serving wine, or other liquid that can be affected by oxygen, which improves the efficiency and the functionality of the known devices.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is also a feature of the present invention to provide a device for preserving and serving wine, or other liquid that can be affected by oxygen, which allows keeping a positive pressure in the bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another feature of the present invention is to provide a device for preserving and serving wine, or other liquid that can be affected by oxygen, which is structurally easy and reliable with time.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other objects are achieved by a device for preserving and serving, from a bottle by-the-glass liquid that can be affected by oxygen, in particular wine, by pumping pressurized inert gas into said bottle, said bottle having a neck with an inlet mouth, said device comprising:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">wherein to said inlet duct an inlet valve is associated, adapted to open said inlet duct when delivery of liquid is requested and to stop said inlet duct to prevent the inert gas to enter the bottle the bottle when delivery of liquid is not requested, and</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">wherein to said delivery duct a delivery valve is associated, adapted to open said delivery duct when delivery of liquid is requested and to stop said delivery duct and to prevent the liquid to exit from the bottle when delivery of liquid is not requested,</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">characterised in that at least one among said inlet valve and said delivery valve is a pilot valve, which is piloted by the pressure of said inert gas,</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">and in that</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">a pilot channel is provided communicating with a pilot port present in said coupling portion and communicating with said pilot valve.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">This way, when said coupling portion couples with said pressurized gas supply, said gas enters at the same time in said pilot channel through said pilot port, and in said inlet duct.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">In a first case, said pilot valve of said inert gas is said inlet valve. This way, when said coupling portion couples with said pressurized gas supply, the gas enters at the same time in the inlet duct and in the pilot channel of the pilot valve, which by the gas pressure opens the inlet duct and allows the inert gas to enter the bottle and then the liquid to go up by the pressure the delivery duct from which it exits; the latter equipped, for example, with a tap.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">Alternatively, said pilot valve of said inert gas is said delivery valve. This way, when said coupling portion couples with said pressurized gas supply, the gas enters at the same time in the inlet duct and in the pilot channel of the delivery valve. This way, the gas that has entered the bottle through the inlet duct causes the liquid to go up the delivery duct that is open, and from which it exits.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">Advantageously, said inlet valve and said delivery valve are both pilot valves that are piloted by the pressure of the inert gas, having each a respective pilot channel communicating with a respective pilot port. This way, the pressurized gas enters at the same time both the inlet duct and the two pilot channels through the respective pilot ports, which open the inlet duct and the delivery duct.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">Advantageously, said pilot valve comprises:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0027">a first chamber connected to said pilot duct from which the gas is supplied;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0028">a second chamber connected to said inlet duct and/or to said delivery duct;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0029">a membrane arranged between said first and second chamber;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0030">a stopper arranged in said second chamber and integral to said membrane;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0031">such that said membrane deforms by the pressure difference between said first and second chamber and moves said stopper from a first position that opens said inlet duct and/or said delivery duct, to a second position that blocks said inlet duct and/or said delivery duct.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0032">This way, when the pressure in the first chamber is higher than that of the second chamber the stopper opens the inlet duct and/or the delivery duct to which it is connected, whereas when the pressure in the first chamber is less than the second chamber the stopper blocks the inlet duct and/or the delivery duct.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figs. from 1 to 3</figref>, a device <b>100</b> is diagrammatically shown for preserving and serving, from a bottle, by-the-glass liquid that can be affected by oxygen such as wine, by pumping pressurized inert gas into a bottle <b>40</b>&#x2032; (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In particular, the device <b>100</b> comprises a coupling portion <b>10</b>, which is adapted to tightly couple with a pressurized gas supply (not shown), a central body <b>20</b>, and a portion <b>30</b> for fastening to bottle <b>40</b>&#x2032;, in particular, to a neck <b>40</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">Furthermore, the central body <b>20</b> provides a pressurized gas inlet duct <b>21</b>, ending in bottle <b>40</b>&#x2032;, and communicating with an inlet port <b>11</b> present on coupling portion <b>10</b>, and a delivery duct <b>22</b> for the liquid, which draws the liquid from bottle <b>40</b>&#x2032; and brings it to a delivery mouth <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">Furthermore, to inlet duct <b>21</b> an inlet valve <b>24</b> is associated, adapted to open inlet duct <b>21</b> when delivery of liquid is requested and to stop it to prevent the inert gas to enter bottle <b>40</b>&#x2032; when delivery of liquid is not requested, whereas to delivery duct <b>22</b> a delivery valve is associated <b>25</b>, adapted to open delivery duct <b>22</b> when delivery of liquid is requested and to stop it and to prevent the liquid to exit from bottle <b>40</b>&#x2032; when delivery of liquid is not requested. The main feature of the device <b>100</b> is that at least one among inlet valve <b>24</b> and delivery valve <b>25</b> is a pilot valve, which is piloted by the pressure of the inert gas, and that a pilot channel <b>26</b>,<b>29</b> is provided communicating with a pilot port <b>27</b>,<b>28</b> present in coupling portion <b>10</b> and communicating with the pilot valve.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">This way, when coupling portion <b>10</b> couples with the pressurized gas supply <b>110</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the gas enters at the same time pilot channel <b>26</b> or <b>29</b>, through the respective one among pilot ports <b>27</b> or <b>28</b>, and inlet duct <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053">In a first case, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pilot valve of the inert gas is inlet valve <b>24</b>. This way, when coupling portion <b>10</b> couples with the pressurized gas supply, the gas enters at the same time inlet duct <b>21</b> and pilot channel <b>26</b> of the pilot valve, which by the gas pressure opens inlet duct <b>21</b> and allows the inert gas to enter bottle <b>40</b>&#x2032; and then the liquid to go up by the pressure through delivery duct <b>22</b> from which it exits; the latter is equipped, for example, with a tap, such as valve <b>25</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0054">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, device <b>100</b> provides, as pilot valve, delivery valve <b>25</b>. This way, when coupling portion <b>10</b> couples with the pressurized gas supply, the gas enters at the same time inlet duct <b>21</b> and pilot channel <b>29</b> of the delivery valve. This way, the gas that has entered bottle <b>40</b>&#x2032; through inlet duct <b>21</b> causes the liquid to go up delivery duct <b>22</b> that is open, and through which it can exit by delivery mouth <b>23</b>. Valve <b>24</b>&#x2032;, which lets the gas to enter in bottle <b>40</b>&#x2032;, can be operated for example, by a push button (not shown) present in the central body <b>20</b> of device <b>100</b>, or in the pressurized gas supply.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a preferred exemplary embodiment where inlet valve <b>24</b> and delivery valve <b>25</b> are both pilot valves that are piloted by the pressure of the inert gas. In this exemplary embodiment, each pilot valve comprises a respective pilot channel indicated as <b>26</b> and <b>29</b> communicating with a respective pilot port <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>. This way, the pressurized gas enters at the same time both in inlet duct <b>21</b>, through inlet port <b>11</b>, and in the two pilot channels <b>26</b> and <b>29</b>, through the respective pilot ports <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>, which open inlet duct <b>21</b> and liquid delivery duct <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a perspective view of the device <b>100</b> in which, in particular, the inlet ports of duct <b>21</b> and the piloted ducts <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> of the pilot valves are shown. The latter, integrally to mouth <b>11</b> of inlet duct <b>21</b>, are connected by grooves <b>51</b> made in a recess <b>50</b> of the coupling portion <b>10</b>. this solution improve the distribution of the inert gas once connected to the gas supply (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), since the gas flows in the grooves <b>51</b> up to reaching the inlet ports of valves <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>. Furthermore, it ensures a tight connection that avoids leaks of inert gas.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">As shown in FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>5</b>&#x2032;, a cross sectional view of the two gas piloted valves <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> is shown, according to two different planes, each of them comprising a first chamber <b>62</b>, connected to the respective pilot duct <b>26</b> or <b>29</b>, a second chamber <b>63</b>, connected to inlet duct <b>21</b> or to delivery duct <b>22</b>, a membrane <b>32</b> separating first chamber and second chamber <b>63</b>, and a stopper <b>66</b> arranged in second chamber <b>63</b> and blocking membrane <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058">In particular, central body <b>20</b> is a box-like body with a housing <b>20</b>&#x2032; having a shoulder <b>92</b> such that first chamber <b>62</b> and second chamber <b>63</b> are obtained arranging membrane <b>32</b> on shoulder <b>92</b>. Furthermore, a plug <b>93</b> is provided that tightly engages in housing <b>20</b>&#x2032; and has a recess <b>95</b> and an edge <b>94</b>, such that, in a closed position of plug <b>93</b>, in housing <b>20</b>&#x2032; the edge <b>94</b> presses membrane <b>32</b> against shoulder <b>92</b>. Therefore, first chamber <b>62</b> is formed by recess <b>95</b>, whereas second chamber <b>63</b> is formed by the other part of housing <b>20</b>&#x2032; located beyond membrane <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">In addition, housing <b>20</b>&#x2032;, at the side of second chamber <b>63</b>, has a hole <b>66</b>&#x2032; where stopper <b>66</b> engages, and beyond hole <b>66</b>&#x2032; a passage is present that represents a portion of inlet duct <b>21</b> and/or delivery duct <b>22</b> that stopper <b>66</b> selectively opens or blocks. In particular, stopper <b>66</b> has a portion <b>70</b> welded to membrane <b>32</b> and an o-ring <b>67</b> adapted exclusively to tightly close inlet duct <b>21</b> or delivery duct <b>22</b>. The wine can thus exit from tube <b>23</b>, mounted by means of o-ring <b>61</b> at the exit of delivery valve <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows membrane <b>32</b> arranged in one of pilot valves <b>24</b> or <b>25</b>, in the configuration deformed by the pressure difference that is created between first chamber <b>62</b> and second chamber <b>63</b> by the introduction of the gas through the duct <b>26</b>. This way, stopper <b>66</b> moves from a first position that opens inlet duct <b>21</b>, to a second position that blocks inlet duct <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">Similarly, the pressure difference between first chamber <b>62</b> and second chamber <b>63</b> by the introduction of the gas through the pilot duct <b>29</b>, moves stopper <b>66</b> from a first position that opens delivery duct <b>22</b>, to a second position that blocks delivery duct <b>22</b> (shown in FIG. <b>5</b>&#x2032;).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a partially cross sectional view of the device <b>100</b> according to a plane passing through the mouth <b>11</b> that connects to inlet pilot valve <b>24</b> that, operated by the pressurized gas, opens stopper <b>66</b> and allows a pneumatic connection between mouth <b>11</b> and the gas inlet duct <b>21</b> (shown partially in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0063">FIG. <b>7</b>&#x2032; shows a cross sectional view of the device <b>100</b> with a plane passing through pilot port <b>27</b> and inlet port <b>11</b>.
