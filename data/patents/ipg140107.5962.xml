<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to communication networks and, more particularly, to secure block acknowledgment mechanisms in communication networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise quality as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An ever-increasing number of relatively inexpensive, low power wireless data communication services, networks and devices have been made available over the past number of years, promising near wire speed transmission and reliability. Various wireless technology is described in detail in the IEEE 802.11 Standards, including for example, the IEEE 802.11a (1999) Standard and its updates and amendments, the IEEE 802.11g (2003) Standard, as well as the IEEE 802.11e, the IEEE 802.11n and the IEEE 802.11w Standards, all of which are collectively incorporated herein fully by reference. These standards have been or are in the process of being commercialized with the promise of increased accuracy and efficiency of data transmission, making them a strong competitor to traditional wired Ethernet and &#x201c;802.11b&#x201d; or &#x201c;WiFi&#x201d; 11 Mbps mobile wireless transmission standard.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite the advances in wireless communication technology, data that is transmitted via wireless communication systems sometimes fails to reach its destination in a proper manner, e.g., as a result of channel imparities, failure of network devices, power loss, etc. As a result, various techniques have been developed to monitor and account for data loss, and some of the most common such techniques utilize acknowledgement-based mechanisms. Generally, under acknowledgement-based mechanisms, when a transmitting station, referred to as an &#x201c;originator,&#x201d; transmits information to a receiving station, referred to as a &#x201c;recipient,&#x201d; and that information is properly received at the recipient, the recipient transmits an acknowledgement back to the originator, acknowledging proper receipt of that information. Therefore, if the originator transmits information to the recipient but does not receive an acknowledgment for that information, it may be inferred at the originator that the transmitted information was not received properly, and the originator may retransmit that information to the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, originators and recipients communicate information using information units (e.g., frames, packets, and so on), and under traditional acknowledgement-based mechanisms, recipients separately acknowledge the receipt of each information unit. One issue associated with these traditional mechanisms that acknowledge separately each individual information unit is that they often lead to significant overhead that results in suboptimal performance, e.g., with respect to bandwidth utilization. This may be particularly problematic in wireless communication systems, in which bandwidth is often a scarce resource.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to address this issue, and to improve efficiency of bandwidth utilization, a block acknowledgement (BA) mechanism has recently been defined in the IEEE 802.11e Standard. Generally, the BA mechanism enables the recipient to acknowledge the receipt of multiple information units (or a &#x201c;block&#x201d; of information units) at the same time.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure provides secure block acknowledgment techniques for use in communication networks.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a method of processing data at a communication device that maintains a receiving window defining a set of information units that the communication device may accept includes receiving an information unit from a transmitting station during a block acknowledgment session with the transmitting station. The information unit includes information indicative of a request for the communication device to adjust the receiving window. The method further includes determining whether the received information unit is encrypted. The method further includes adjusting the receiving window if the received information unit is encrypted.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, a method of communicating with a receiving station that maintains a receiving window defining a set of information units that the receiving station may accept includes establishing a block acknowledgement session with the receiving station. The method further includes forming an encrypted information unit, where the information unit includes information indicative of a request for the receiving station to adjust the receiving window. The method further includes transmitting the encrypted information unit to the receiving station during the block acknowledgment session.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, a communication device includes a communication interface and a secure block acknowledgement engine. The communication interface is configured to receive an information unit from a transmitting station during a block acknowledgment session with the transmitting station. The information unit includes information indicative of a request for the communication device to adjust a receiving window associated with the communication device. The receiving window defines a set of information units that the communication device may accept. The secure block acknowledgement engine is configured to determine whether the received information unit is encrypted and to adjust the receiving window if the received information unit is encrypted.</p>

Generally, in order to communicate information, an originator <b>110</b> forms that information into one or more information units and transmits those information units to the recipient <b>120</b> via the network <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For ease of explanation, example secure BA mechanisms will be described in the in the context of Layer 2 (also known as the &#x201c;Data Link Layer&#x201d;) of the Open System Interconnection Reference Model (&#x201c;OSI Model&#x201d;) of computer networking. However, it will be understood that the stations <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, as well as the present disclosure in general, are not limited to any particular layer of the OSI Model. Therefore, terms and phrases that are typically associated with Layer 2 of the OSI Model, when used herein, should not be understood as limiting the scope of the present disclosure to the Data Link Layer. For example, although, for ease of explanation, the information units used for transmitting information from the originator <b>110</b> to the recipient <b>120</b> will be referred to as a &#x201c;frames,&#x201d; it will be understood that the term &#x201c;frame&#x201d; may refer to information units other than Layer 2 frames, such as packets, messages, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, it will be understood that the present disclosure is not limited to any particular topology of the network <b>140</b>, or to any particular function or placement of the stations <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> in the network. For example, the stations <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may be located at the edge of the wireless communication system <b>100</b>, or they may be intermediate network devices that are part of the network backbone interconnecting different networks. Stations <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may be end hosts (e.g., personal computers, laptops, printers, copier systems, scanners, personal digital assistants (PDAs), wireless phones and other devices, fax machines, and so on) or intermediate network devices (e.g., bridges, routers, hubs, firewalls, proxies, and so on). Furthermore, although, for ease of explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a single originator <b>110</b> and a single recipient <b>120</b>, it will be understood that the example secure block acknowledgement mechanisms may be utilized in wireless communication systems that include any number of originators <b>110</b>, recipients <b>120</b>, or other stations that, for example, may be capable of both transmitting and receiving information.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, although for ease of explanation, secure block acknowledgment mechanisms will be described with regard to a single traffic identification (TID), it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the secure block acknowledgment mechanisms described herein may be utilized in a multi-TID environment, i.e., with multiple traffic identifications.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Conventional Acknowledgement-Based Mechanisms</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Before discussing the details of the secure block acknowledgement mechanisms, it is helpful to provide more details regarding conventional acknowledgement-based mechanisms implemented by conventional originators <b>210</b> and recipients <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a message sequence diagram that illustrates some example conventional acknowledgment-based mechanisms implemented by conventional originators <b>210</b> and recipients <b>220</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in order to acknowledge receipt of a frame from the originator <b>210</b>, recipients <b>220</b> typically transmit special frames know as acknowledgement (&#x201c;ACK&#x201d;) frames. Because frames, in general, include identifiers (e.g., sequence numbers) that identify individual frames, an ACK frame typically acknowledges receipt of a particular frame if the ACK frame includes an identifier of that particular frame, or an indication thereof. That is, to acknowledge receipt of a particular frame from an originator <b>210</b>, the recipient <b>220</b> may transmit to the originator <b>210</b> an acknowledgement frame that includes the sequence number of the particular frame, the sequence number of the last frame received from the originator <b>210</b>, the sequence number of the next expected frame, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some instances, the recipient <b>220</b> may acknowledge the receipt of each frame from the originator <b>210</b> via a separate ACK frame. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, if the originator <b>210</b> transmits frame <b>1</b> (i.e., frame with a sequence number 1) to the recipient <b>220</b>, the recipient <b>220</b> may respond with an acknowledgment frame ACK(<b>2</b>), indicating that the conventional recipient <b>220</b> is expecting frame <b>2</b> as the next frame. This provides the originator <b>210</b> with a confirmation that frame <b>1</b> has been received. Likewise, if the originator <b>210</b> transmits frame <b>2</b> to the recipient <b>220</b>, the recipient <b>220</b> may respond with an acknowledgment frame ACK(<b>3</b>), confirming the receipt of frame <b>2</b> and indicating to the originator <b>210</b> that the recipient <b>220</b> is expecting frame <b>3</b> as the next frame.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition to sending acknowledgment frames to the originator <b>210</b>, the recipient <b>220</b> typically maintains a sliding receiving window that defines a set of frames the recipient <b>220</b> may accept. Generally, the receiving window may be characterized by a start position (&#x201c;WinStart<sub>R</sub>&#x201d;), an end position (&#x201c;WinEnd<sub>R</sub>&#x201d;), a maximum window size (&#x201c;WinSize<sub>R</sub>&#x201d;), or a combination thereof. Generally, WinStart<sub>R </sub>is the lowest sequence number of a frame that the recipient <b>220</b> may accept; WinEnd<sub>R </sub>is the highest sequence number of a frame that the recipient <b>220</b> may accept; and WinSize<sub>R </sub>relates to the maximum number of unacknowledged frames that the recipient <b>220</b> may accept. In some instances, WinSize<sub>R</sub>=WinEnd<sub>R</sub>&#x2212;WinStart<sub>R</sub>+1.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example, the recipient <b>220</b> maintains a sliding receiving window of 10 frames. At the outset of the communication between the originator <b>210</b> and the recipient <b>220</b>, WinSize<sub>R</sub>=10, WinStart<sub>R</sub>=1, and WinEnd<sub>R</sub>=10, meaning that the receiving window may accept frames <b>1</b>-<b>10</b>. Once the recipient <b>220</b> receives frame <b>1</b>, the receiving window of the recipient <b>220</b> is updated to accept frames <b>2</b>-<b>11</b>. Likewise, after the recipient <b>220</b> receives frame <b>2</b>, the receiving window of the recipient <b>220</b> is updated to accept frames <b>3</b>-<b>12</b>. Thus, if after receiving frame <b>2</b> the recipient <b>220</b> receives frame <b>7</b>, the recipient <b>220</b> will accept that frame, even though it was received out of order. However, if the recipient <b>220</b> receives frame <b>15</b>, the recipient <b>220</b> will drop that frame because the sequence number 15 is outside of the receiving window.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some instances, instead of acknowledging individually each frame transmitted by the originator <b>210</b> with a separate ACK frame, the originator <b>210</b> and the recipient <b>220</b> may employ an acknowledgement-based mechanism in which a single acknowledgment frame may be used to acknowledge receipt of a block of frames. An example of such a mechanism is the unsecured block acknowledgment (BA) mechanism, as originally defined in the IEEE 802.11e standard.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to employ the unsecured BA mechanism, the originator <b>210</b> and the recipient <b>220</b> typically need to set up an unsecured BA session and to negotiate the attributes of that BA session. To do so, the originator <b>210</b> may transmit a special unsecured BA session setup request frame that includes data indicative of a request to set up an unsecured BA session. In response, the recipient <b>220</b> may transmit a special unsecured BA session setup response frame that includes data indicative of the acceptance by the recipient <b>220</b> acceptance of the request to set up the unsecured BA session.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Examples of a special unsecured BA session setup request frame and the special unsecured BA session setup response frame are the Add Block Acknowledgement (ADDBA) request frame and the ADDBA response frame, as originally defined in the IEEE 802.11e standard. In addition to data indicative of a request to set up an unsecured block ACK session, the ADDBA request frame includes data indicative of various attributes associated with the unsecured block acknowledgment session, e.g., a dialog token field for matching the ADDBA request with the ADDBA response; a block ACK parameter set field for signaling the parameters for the unsecured block ACK session, such as WinSize<sub>R</sub>, WinEnd<sub>R </sub>and WinStart<sub>R</sub>; and a block ACK timeout value that specifies when the unsecured block ACK session expires. Similarly, in addition to data indicative of a response to a request for an unsecured block ACK session, the ADDBA response frame includes a the dialog token field, the block ACK parameter field and the block ACK timeout field (e.g., extracted from the ADDBA request session) and the ADDBA status code field, which indicates whether the recipient <b>220</b> granted or rejected the request for the unsecured block ACK session.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">After setting up the unsecured BA session, the originator <b>210</b> may transmit multiple frames, or a &#x201c;block&#x201d; of frames, to the recipient <b>220</b> (e.g., frames <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and the recipient <b>220</b> may update the receiving window in response to each received frame. However, the recipient <b>220</b> is not required to acknowledge receipt of any of these frames until the originator <b>210</b> transmits a special frame that includes data indicative of a request for an acknowledgement for the transmitted block of frames. An example of such a frame is the unencrypted Block Acknowledgement Request (&#x201c;BlockAckReq&#x201d; or &#x201c;BAR&#x201d;) frame, as originally defined in the IEEE 802.11e standard. When the recipient <b>220</b> receives the unencrypted BAR frame, the recipient <b>220</b> may acknowledge receipt of all of the frames that were, in fact, received, via a single acknowledgment frame that includes the status of multiple frames associated with the unsecured BA session. An example of such a frame is the Block Acknowledgement (&#x201c;BlockAck&#x201d; or &#x201c;BA&#x201d;) frame, as originally defined in the IEEE 802.11e standard.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, frame <b>5</b> is not received properly at the recipient <b>220</b>. Accordingly, in response to the unencrypted BAR frame from the originator <b>210</b>, the recipient <b>220</b> may respond with a BlockAck that confirms the receipt of only frames <b>3</b>-<b>4</b> and indicates to the originator <b>210</b> that the recipient <b>220</b> is still waiting for frame <b>5</b>. In response, the originator <b>210</b> may retransmit frame <b>5</b> (potentially several times until the recipient <b>220</b> acknowledges its receipt).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some instances, the originator <b>210</b> may discard a lost frame (or frames) and instruct the recipient <b>220</b> to advance the starting position of the receiving window despite the lost frame. For example, the originator <b>210</b> may discard the lost frame <b>5</b> and instruct the recipient <b>220</b> to update the receiving window to start at the sequence number <b>6</b>, for example. This may be done by sending an overloaded unencrypted BAR (<b>6</b>) frame, where the unencrypted BAR(<b>6</b>) frame is overloaded with additional data to specify the new starting position (i.e., <b>6</b>) of the receiving window. When the recipient <b>220</b> receives the overloaded unencrypted BAR (<b>6</b>) frame, the recipient <b>220</b> adjusts the receiving window accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If, at some point, the originator <b>210</b> decides to terminate the unsecured block ACK session, the originator <b>210</b> may transmit a special block acknowledgment session termination frame that includes data indicative of a request to terminate the unsecured block acknowledgment session. An example of a block acknowledgment session termination frame is a Delete Block ACK (DELBA) request frame, as originally defined in the IEEE 802.11e standard. Upon the terminations of the unsecured block ACK session, frames transmitted from the originator <b>210</b> to the recipient <b>220</b> may be acknowledged individually with individual ACK frames, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">There are several drawbacks associated with conventional BA mechanisms, such as the BA mechanism illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. One such drawback is that conventional BA mechanisms provide limited or no security, which makes stations <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> implementing such mechanisms vulnerable to attacks from rogue devices <b>230</b> <b>230</b>. For example, a rogue device <b>230</b> may transmit unencrypted overloaded BAR frames to the recipient <b>220</b>, causing the recipient <b>220</b> to adjust the receiving window inappropriately. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for instance, if a rogue device <b>230</b> transmits an unencrypted overloaded BAR(<b>10</b>) frame before the recipient <b>220</b> receives frame <b>6</b>, the rogue device <b>230</b> may cause the recipient <b>220</b> to adjust the receiving window to start at frame <b>10</b>. As a result, data frames <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>-<b>9</b> transmitted from the originator <b>210</b> to the recipient <b>220</b> will be mistakenly dropped by the originator <b>210</b>. Unencrypted overloaded BAR frames can therefore be used by rogue devices to carry out denial of service (DoS) attacks.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, in order to employ a secure BA mechanism, the originator <b>510</b> and the recipient <b>520</b> set up a BA session and communicate to each other their respective capabilities to implement the BA mechanism in a secure manner. To do so, the originator <b>510</b> may transmit a special BA session setup request frame that includes data indicative of a request to set up a BA session and data indicative of the capability of the originator <b>510</b> to implement the BA mechanism in a secure manner. In response to the BA session setup request frame, the recipient <b>520</b> may transmit to the originator <b>510</b> a special BA session setup response frame that includes data indicative of an acceptance of the request to set up the BA session by the recipient <b>520</b> and data indicative of the capability of the recipient <b>520</b> to implement the BA mechanism in a secure manner.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The originator <b>510</b> may communicate its capability to implement the BA mechanism in a secure manner via a special Secure BA Capability (&#x201c;SBAC&#x201d;) field in the BA session setup request frame.

When the recipient <b>520</b> receives the unencrypted BAR frame, the recipient <b>520</b> may acknowledge receipt of all of the frames that were, in fact, received, via a single BlockAck frame.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to employ the secure BA method <b>600</b>, the originator sets up a BA session with the recipient (block <b>610</b>), e.g., via the secure block acknowledgement engine <b>350</b> and the communication interface <b>310</b>, as described above, for example, in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. During the set-up of the BA session, the originator communicates to the recipient (e.g., via the BA session setup request frame described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) whether the originator has a capability to implement a BA mechanism in a secure manner (block <b>620</b>). The originator also determines (e.g., from the BA session setup response frame described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) whether the recipient has a capability to implement a BA mechanism in a secure manner (block <b>630</b>). If the recipient does not have the capability to implement a BA mechanism in a secure manner (&#x201c;NO&#x201d; branch of block <b>640</b>), and if the originator intends to advance the receiver BA session, the originator forms an unencrypted window adjustment action frame that includes information indicative of a request for the recipient to adjust its receiving window (block <b>650</b>). The originator then transmits the unencrypted window adjustment action frame to the recipient (block <b>670</b>) via the communication interface <b>310</b>, potentially causing the recipient to adjust its receiving window.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If the recipient does have the capability to implement a BA mechanism in a secure manner (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; branch of block <b>640</b>), and if the originator intends to advance the receiver BA session, the originator forms an encrypted window adjustment action frame that includes information indicative of a request for the recipient to adjust its receiving window (block <b>660</b>). The originator forms the encrypted frame using the frame encryption engine <b>340</b> and then transmits the encrypted window adjustment action frame to the recipient (block <b>680</b>) via the communication interface <b>310</b>, potentially causing the recipient to adjust its receiving window.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The encryption of the window adjustment action frame can be performed at the frame encryption engine <b>340</b> in a variety of ways. Any suitable encryption techniques, such as the techniques described in the IEEE 802.11w Standard, for example, can be used to encrypt the window adjustment action frame. In some embodiments, the window adjustment action frame can be an encrypted frame that includes some or all data associated with the ADDBA request frame, as originally defined in the IEEE 802.11e Standard. As explained above, the ADDBA request frame, as originally defined in the IEEE 802.11e Standard, includes data regarding the receiving window parameters (such as WinSize<sub>R</sub>, WinEnd<sub>R </sub>and WinStart<sub>R</sub>) for a new BA session. This data regarding the receiving window parameters can be included in the window adjustment action frame to indicate a request to adjust the window, e.g., to advance WinStart<sub>R </sub>to a new sequence number. In other embodiments, the window adjustment action frame may be unrelated the ADDBA request frame, as originally defined in the IEEE 802.11e Standard, and may include data that indicates a request to adjust the receiving window in a different manner.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram of an example secure BA method <b>600</b> that may be employed by a recipient, such as the recipient <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For ease of explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> will be described with reference to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>-<b>5</b>. It will be understood, however, that the example secure BA method <b>700</b> may be utilized with systems and devices other than those illustrated in FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In order to employ the secure BA method <b>700</b>, the recipient can set up a BA session with the originator (block <b>710</b>), e.g., via the secure block acknowledgement engine <b>450</b> and the communication interface <b>410</b>, as described above, for example, in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. During the set-up of the BA session, the recipient determines (e.g., from the BA session setup request frame described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) whether the originator has a capability to implement a BA mechanism in a secure manner (block <b>720</b>). The recipient also communicates to the originator (e.g., via the BA session setup response frame described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) whether the recipient has a capability to implement a BA mechanism in a secure manner (block <b>725</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If the recipient and the originator have the capability to implement a BA mechanism in a secure manner, when the recipient receives a window adjustment action frame that includes information indicative of a request for the recipient to adjust its receiving window (block <b>730</b>), the recipient adjusts its receiving window (block <b>780</b>) if the received window adjustment action frame is encrypted (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; branch of block <b>740</b>). The recipient also adjusts its receiving window (block <b>780</b>) in response to an unencrypted window adjustment action frame (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; branch of block <b>740</b>) if it is determined that the originator does not have the capability to implement a BA mechanism in a secure manner (&#x201c;NO&#x201d; branch of block <b>750</b>). On the other hand, if the received window adjustment action frame is not encrypted (&#x201c;NO&#x201d; branch of block <b>740</b>), and it is determined that the originator does have the capability to implement a BA mechanism in a secure manner (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; branch of block <b>750</b>), the received window adjustment action frame is dropped, and the receiving window is not adjusted. Additionally, in some embodiments, the originator is identified as an attacking, or a rogue, device (block <b>760</b>). Consequently, the BA session with the originator (and possibly all outstanding BA sessions with the originator) is terminated (block <b>770</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At least some of the various blocks, operations, and techniques described above may be implemented utilizing hardware, a processor executing firmware instructions, a processor executing software instructions, or any combination thereof.

Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism. The term &#x201c;modulated data signal&#x201d; means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, radio frequency, infrared and other wireless media. Thus, the software or firmware instructions may be delivered to a user or a system via a communication channel such as a telephone line, a DSL line, a cable television line, a fiber optics line, a wireless communication channel, the Internet, etc. (which are viewed as being the same as or interchangeable with providing such software via a transportable storage medium). The software or firmware instructions may include machine readable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform various acts.</p>
