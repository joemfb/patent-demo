No. 12/286,155, filed on Sep. 29, 2008 entitled, &#x201c;TOUCH PANEL, METHOD FOR MAKING THE SAME, AND DISPLAY DEVICE ADOPTING THE SAME&#x201d;. The disclosures of the above-identified applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method for making such touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Following the advancement in recent years of various electronic apparatuses, such as mobile phones, car navigation systems, for example, toward high performance and diversification, there has been continuous growth in the number of electronic apparatuses equipped with optically transparent touch panels in front of their respective display devices (e.g., liquid crystal panels). A user of any such electronic apparatus operates it by pressing or touching the touch panel with a finger, a pen, stylus, or another tool while visually observing the display device through the touch panel. A demand thus exists for such touch panels that are superior in visibility and reliable in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At present, different types of touch panels, including a resistance-type, a capacitance-type, an infrared-type, and a surface sound wave-type, have been developed. Due to the high accuracy and low cost of production of the resistance-type touch panel, this touch panel has become widely used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A conventional resistance-type touch panel includes an upper substrate, an optically transparent upper conductive layer formed on a lower surface of the upper substrate. In addition, a lower substrate, an optically transparent lower conductive layer formed on an upper surface of the lower substrate, and a plurality of dot spacers formed between the optically transparent upper conductive layer and the optically transparent lower conductive layer. The optically transparent upper conductive layer and the optically transparent lower conductive layer are formed of conductive indium tin oxide (ITO).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In operation, an upper surface of the upper substrate is pressed with a finger, a pen, or another tool, and visual observation of a screen on the liquid crystal display device provided on a back side of the touch panel is provided. The pressing causes the upper substrate to be deformed, and the upper conductive layer thus comes in contact with the lower conductive layer at the position where the pressing occurs. Voltages are applied successively from an electronic circuit to the optically transparent upper conductive layer and the optically transparent lower conductive layer. Thus, the electronic circuit can detect the position of the deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The optically transparent conductive layer (e.g., ITO layer) is generally formed by means of ion-beam sputtering, and this method is relatively complicated. Additionally, the ITO layer has poor durability, low chemical endurance, and uneven resistance over an entire area of the touch panel. Furthermore, the ITO layer has relatively low transparency. All the above-mentioned problems of the ITO layer makes for a touch panel with somewhat low sensitivity, accuracy, and brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">What is needed, therefore, is to provide a durable touch panel with high sensitivity, accuracy, and brightness, a method for making such touch panel, and a display device using the touch panel.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference will now be made to the drawings to describe, in detail, embodiments of the present touch panel, method for making the same, and display device adopting the same.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrates a touch panel <b>10</b> of one embodiment. The touch panel <b>10</b> includes a first electrode plate <b>12</b>, a second electrode plate <b>14</b>, and a plurality of dot spacers <b>16</b> located between the first electrode plate <b>12</b> and the second electrode plate <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first electrode plate <b>12</b> includes a first substrate <b>120</b>, a first conductive layer <b>122</b>, and two first-electrodes <b>124</b>. The first substrate <b>120</b> includes an upper surface and a lower surface. The two first-electrodes <b>124</b> and the first conductive layer <b>122</b> are located on the lower surface of the first substrate <b>120</b>. The two first-electrodes <b>124</b> are located separately on opposite ends of the first conductive layer <b>122</b>. A direction from one of the first-electrodes <b>124</b> across the first conductive layer <b>122</b> to the other first-electrode <b>124</b> is defined as a first direction. The two first-electrodes <b>124</b> are electrically connected with the first conductive layer <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second electrode plate <b>14</b> includes a second substrate <b>140</b>, a second conductive layer <b>142</b>, and two second-electrodes <b>144</b>. The second substrate <b>140</b> includes an upper surface and a lower surface, each of which is substantially flat. The two second-electrodes <b>144</b> and the second conductive layer <b>142</b> are located on the upper surface of the second substrate <b>140</b>. The two second-electrodes <b>144</b> are located separately on opposite sides of the second conductive layer <b>142</b>. A direction from one of the second-electrodes <b>144</b> across the second conductive layer <b>142</b> to the other second-electrode <b>144</b> is defined as a second direction. The two second-electrodes <b>144</b> are electrically connected with the second conductive layer <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first direction is perpendicular to the second direction. That is, the two first-electrodes <b>124</b> are aligned parallel to the second direction, and the two second-electrodes <b>144</b> are aligned parallel to the first direction. The first substrate <b>120</b> is a transparent and flexible film or plate. The second substrate <b>140</b> is a transparent plate. The first-electrodes <b>124</b> and the second-electrodes <b>144</b> are made of metal or any other suitable material. In the present embodiment, the first substrate <b>120</b> is a polyester film, the second substrate <b>140</b> is a glass plate, and the first-electrodes <b>124</b> and second-electrodes <b>144</b> are made of a conductive silver paste.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An insulative frame <b>18</b> is provided between the first and second electrode plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. The first electrode plate <b>12</b> is located on the insulative frame <b>18</b>. The first conductive layer <b>122</b> is opposite to, but is spaced from, the second conductive layer <b>142</b>. The dot spacers <b>16</b> are separately located on the second conductive layer <b>142</b>. A distance between the second electrode plate <b>14</b> and the first electrode plate <b>12</b> is in an approximate range from 2 to 20 microns. The insulative frame <b>18</b> and the dot spacers <b>16</b> are made of insulative resin or any other suitable insulative material. The insulative frame <b>18</b> and the dot spacers <b>16</b> provides insulation between the first electrode plate <b>12</b> and the second electrode plate <b>14</b>. The dot spacers <b>16</b> are optional, particularly when the touch panel <b>10</b> is relatively small. The dot spacers <b>16</b> serve as supports having regard to the size, span, and strength of the first electrode plate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At least one of the first conductive layer <b>122</b> and the second conductive layer <b>142</b> includes a carbon nanotube layer. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube structure are arranged isotropically, arranged along a same applied direction, or arranged along different directions. An angle between a primary alignment direction of the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube structure and the carbon nanotube structure is 0&#xb0; to approximately 15&#xb0; when measured from the surface of the carbon nanotube structure. The carbon nanotube structure can be formed by pressing a carbon nanotube array. The angle is closely related to pressure applied to the carbon nanotube array. The greater the applied pressure is the smaller the angle becomes. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube structure can be parallel to the surface of the carbon nanotube structure when the angle is 0&#xb0;. The carbon nanotube structure can be a transparent carbon nanotube film. A length and a width of the carbon nanotube film can be arbitrarily set as desired. A thickness of the carbon nanotube structure is in an approximate range from 0.5 nanometers to 100 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one suitable embodiment, the first conductive layer <b>122</b> and the second conductive layer <b>142</b> each include, at a minimum, one carbon nanotube layer. In this embodiment, the carbon nanotube structure includes a single carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes isotropically arranged, or arranged either along a same direction or along different directions. In one embodiment, the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are parallel to the surface of the carbon nanotube film. In one suitable embodiment, the carbon nanotubes in the first conductive layer <b>122</b> are arranged along the first direction, and the carbon nanotubes in the second conductive layer <b>142</b> are arranged along the second direction. In another embodiment, the carbon nanotubes in the first conductive layer <b>122</b> are arranged along a direction oblique to a direction along which the carbon nanotubes in the second conductive layer <b>142</b> are arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one suitable embodiment, a transparent protective film <b>126</b> can be further located on the upper surface of the first electrode plate <b>12</b>. The material of the transparent protective film <b>126</b> can be selected from a group consisting of silicon nitride, silicon dioxide, benzocyclobutene, polyester film, and polyethylene terephthalate. The transparent protective film <b>126</b> can, rather appropriately, be a slick plastic film and receive a surface hardening treatment to protect the first electrode plate <b>12</b> from being scratched when in use.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the touch panel <b>10</b> can further include a shielding layer <b>22</b> located on the lower surface of the second substrate <b>140</b>. The material of the shielding layer <b>22</b> can be selected from indium tin oxide, antimony tin oxide, carbon nanotube film, and any other suitable electrically conductive material. In the present embodiment, the shielding layer is a carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes, and the orientations of the carbon nanotubes can be set as desired. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film of the shielding layer <b>22</b> are arranged along a same direction. The carbon nanotube film is connected to ground and thus enables the touch panel <b>10</b> to operate without interference (e.g., electromagnetic interference).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exemplary method for making the touch panel <b>10</b> includes the following steps: (a) providing at least one array of carbon nanotubes, a first substrate, and a second substrate; (b) pressing the array of carbon nanotubes with a pressing device to form a carbon nanotube structure on the first and second substrates, thereby forming a first conductive layer and a second conductive layer on the first and second substrates respectively; and (c) locating two first-electrodes on opposite short ends of the first electrode plate and two second-electrodes on opposite long sides of the second electrode plate, and spacing the first electrode plate a distance from the second electrode plate such that the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer face each other, thereby forming the touch panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In step (a), the array of carbon nanotubes is a super-aligned array of carbon nanotubes. The super-aligned array of carbon nanotubes can be formed by the substeps of: (a1) providing a substantially flat and smooth growing substrate; (a2) forming a catalyst layer on the growing substrate; (a3) annealing the growing substrate with the catalyst layer in air at a temperature in an approximate range from 700&#xb0; C. to 900&#xb0; C. for about 30 to 90 minutes; (a4) heating the growing substrate with the catalyst layer to a temperature in an approximate range from 500&#xb0; C. to 740&#xb0; C. in a furnace with a protective gas therein; and (a5) supplying a carbon source gas to the furnace for about 5 to 30 minutes and growing the super-aligned array of carbon nanotubes on the growing substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In step (a1), the growing substrate can be a P-type silicon wafer, an N-type silicon wafer, or a silicon wafer with a film of silicon dioxide thereon. Preferably, a 4-inch P-type silicon wafer is used as the growing substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In step (a2), the catalyst can be made of iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), or any alloy thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In step (a4), the protective gas can be made up of at least one of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), and a noble gas. In step (a5), the carbon source gas can be a hydrocarbon gas, such as ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The super-aligned array of carbon nanotubes can have a height of about 50 microns to 5 millimeters. The super-aligned array of carbon nanotubes includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes parallel to each other and approximately perpendicular to the growing substrate. The carbon nanotubes in the super-aligned array can be selected from a group consisting of single-walled carbon nanotubes, double-walled carbon nanotubes, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Diameters of the single-walled carbon nanotubes are in an approximate range from 0.5 nanometers to 50 nanometers. Diameters of the double-walled carbon nanotubes are in an approximate range from 1 nanometer to 50 nanometers. Diameters of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes are in an approximate range from 1.5 nanometers to 50 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The super-aligned array of carbon nanotubes formed under the above conditions is essentially free of impurities such as carbonaceous or residual catalyst particles. The carbon nanotubes in the super-aligned array are closely packed together by van der Waals force.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step (b), the carbon nanotube array is adherent in nature, and therefore the first substrate and the second substrate can be firmly adhered to the array of carbon nanotubes. In the present embodiment, either of two methods can form the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first method includes the steps of: (b1) providing a pressing device, and pressing the array of carbon nanotubes to form a carbon nanotube film; (b2) cutting the carbon nanotube film into sizes of the first substrate and the second substrate; and (b3) adhering the cut carbon nanotube films on the first substrate and the second substrate respectively to form the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer. The second method includes the steps of: (b1&#x2032;) placing first surfaces of the first substrate and the second substrate on the array of carbon nanotubes; (b2&#x2032;) providing a pressing device, and pressing opposite second surfaces of the first substrate and the second substrate so that the first substrate and the second substrate are pressed onto the array of carbon nanotubes to form a carbon nanotube film on each of the first substrate and the second substrate; and (b3&#x2032;) cutting away excess carbon nanotube film to form the first conductive layer on the first substrate and the second conductive layer on the second substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step (b), a certain pressure can be applied to the array of carbon nanotubes by the pressing device. In the process of pressing, the carbon nanotubes in the array of carbon nanotubes form each of the carbon nanotube films under pressure. The carbon nanotubes in each carbon nanotube film are nearly all parallel to a surface of the carbon nanotube film. In step (b1), in the process of pressing, the carbon nanotubes slant, thereby forming a carbon nanotube film having a free-standing structure on the substrate on which the carbon nanotube array is initially formed. The carbon nanotubes in the free-standing structure are nearly all parallel to a major surface of the carbon nanotube film, and are arranged isotropically, or arranged along a same direction or arranged along a different directions. In step (b2&#x2032;), the carbon nanotube film, under a certain pressure, separates from the growing substrate on which the carbon nanotube array is initially formed, and is adhered on the first substrate and the second substrate respectively because of the adhesive properties of the carbon nanotubes.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present embodiment, the pressing device can be a pressure head. The pressure head has a smooth surface. The shape of the pressure head and the pressing direction can, opportunely, determine the direction of the carbon nanotubes arranged in each carbon nanotube film. In one embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when a planar pressure head is used to press the array of carbon nanotubes along a direction perpendicular to the applicable substrate, a carbon nanotube film having a plurality of carbon nanotubes isotropically arranged can be obtained. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when a roller-shaped pressure head is used to travel across and press the array of carbon nanotubes along a predetermined single direction, a carbon nanotube film having a plurality of carbon nanotubes aligned along a general direction is obtained. When a roller-shaped pressure head is used to travel across and press the array of carbon nanotubes along different directions, a carbon nanotube film having a plurality of carbon nanotubes aligned along corresponding different directions is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the process of pressing, the carbon nanotubes will bend/fall over, thereby forming a carbon nanotube film having a free-standing structure with slanted carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotubes in the free-standing structure are nearly all parallel to a surface of the carbon nanotube film, and are isotropically arranged, arranged along a same direction, or arranged along different directions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the present embodiment, each carbon nanotube structure includes a single carbon nanotube film. Each carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes arranged along a same direction, the direction being substantially the same as the traveling and pressing direction. It is to be understood that a degree of the slant of the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film relative to the vertical is proportional to the pressure applied. The greater the pressure applied is, the greater the degree of slant becomes. An angle a between the alignment directions of the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film and the major surface of the carbon nanotube film is in an approximate range from 0&#xb0; to 15&#xb0;. The conductive property of the carbon nanotube film is influenced the angle &#x3b1;. The smaller the angle &#x3b1; is, the better the conductive property of the carbon nanotube film becomes. It can be understood that the angle &#x3b1; relates to the conductive property of the carbon nanotube film. Therefore, in one quite suitable embodiment, the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are substantially parallel to the surface of the carbon nanotube film. A thickness of the carbon nanotube film is opportunely determined by the height of the carbon nanotube array and the pressure applied. That is, the greater the height of the carbon nanotube array and/or the less the pressure, the greater the thickness of the carbon nanotube film.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an alternative embodiment of step (b1&#x2032;), it can be understood that first surfaces of the first substrate and the second substrate can be respectively placed on two arrays of carbon nanotubes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an alternative embodiment of each of the carbon nanotube layers, the carbon nanotube structure can include at least two stacked carbon nanotube films. For example, when the carbon nanotube structure includes two stacked carbon nanotube films, a method for forming such carbon nanotube structure can be as follows. First, the first carbon nanotube film is made according to either of the methods described above. Thereby, a carbon nanotube film adhered (formed) on each the first substrate and the second substrate is obtained. Then the first substrate and the second substrate each with the carbon nanotube film formed thereon is inverted and is placed on a carbon nanotube array in much the same way as described in steps (b1&#x2032;) above. After that, the equivalent of steps (b2&#x2032;) and (b3&#x2032;) as described above are performed. Thereby, a two-layer carbon nanotube film structure on each of the first and second substrates is formed. The two adjacent carbon nanotube films in each such film structure are combined together by van der Waals attractive force.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The width of each carbon nanotube film depends on a size of the carbon nanotube array. The length of the carbon nanotube film can be arbitrarily set as desired. In one useful embodiment, when the growing substrate is a 4-inch P-type wafer as in the present embodiment, the width of the carbon nanotube film is in an approximate range from 0.5 nanometers to 10 centimeters, and the thickness of the carbon nanotube film is in an approximate range from 0.5 nanometers to 100 micrometers. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film can be selected from a group consisting of single-walled carbon nanotubes, double-walled carbon nanotubes, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Diameters of the single-walled carbon nanotube are in an approximate range from 0.5 nanometers to 50 nanometers. Diameters of the double-walled carbon nanotubes are in an approximate range from 1 nanometer to 50 nanometers. Diameters of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes are in an approximate range from 1.5 nanometers to 50 nanometers.</p>
