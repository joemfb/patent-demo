<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a system that provides one or more variably-locatable electrical sockets and data connection points along a wall, and a related method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In business offices and commercial premises, there is often a need to provide a large number of power sockets at many locations along the base or skirting boards of the walls of a room or office. Many power sockets are needed to run the large number of electrical apparatus used in a typical office, such as computers, facsimile machines, photocopiers, lighting etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, with the ubiquity of networked computers in offices, there is also a need to provide a large number of data connection points. These data connection points allow individual computers or terminals to be connected to a network of computers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The arrangement of office layouts, and the positioning of desks, computers and other office equipment within the office often change from time to time. Such change can require the number and location of the large number of power sockets and/or data connection points to be shifted to more convenient locations according to the new office layout.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To cater for this need to shift the position of power sockets and/or data connection points, there is a known system <b>10</b> of providing such a large number of variably-locatable electrical power sockets, and also with or without data connection points, which is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the known system <b>10</b>, a large number of power sockets <b>40</b> and data connection points <b>41</b> are located at the base of the walls <b>101</b> of rooms in such a manner that the location of these can be changed from time to time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The known system makes use of metal compartments <b>20</b> which are positioned along the length of the base of each wall at the level of the skirting board.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">At generally any location along these compartments <b>20</b>, it is possible to selectively attach one or more power sockets <b>40</b> and/or data connection points <b>41</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this known system, such a large number of power sockets alone, or with data connection points, requires a correspondingly large number of wires and cables. These wire and cables are concealed within the elongate compartments <b>20</b> which are referred to as cable ducts <b>20</b>. The prior art cable ducts <b>20</b> act as enclosures for concealing the cables or wires associated with the power sockets or data connection points.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The large quantity of cables need to be concealed in the ducts <b>20</b> because it is often unfeasible to contain the cables inside the walls <b>101</b>, particularly for solid walls such as brick walls. Also, in those instances where cables are installed inside hollow walls, the subsequent task of relocating the power sockets <b>40</b> and data points <b>41</b>, from time to time, is even more difficult because of the need for cutting open and subsequent repair of the walls, including re-plastering and re-painting etc.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A problem with the known system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> arises from the complexity of the process of installation or alteration of the location of the ducts, power sockets alone, or with data points. This complexity can lead to higher costs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Moreover, the long duration of the alteration work can often lead to disruption to the staff that usually work in those parts of an office where the alteration work is carried out on the system <b>10</b>. This disruption has its associated effect on the costs or loss of productivity of those office workers affected by the disruption.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There is complexity in the process of initial installation of the known system <b>10</b>. The complexity arises because these metal cable ducts <b>20</b> are manufactured and supplied in standard fixed lengths, and must therefore be cut to required size by the workman. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, if gaps between power sockets and/or data points (dimensions A or B) are not of the standard fixed length, then the workman has to cut the portion of the duct to required size. The cutting procedure tends to be time-consuming because the metal sheet material of the ducts <b>20</b> has to be cut to precise dimensions with little margin for error, for example, within an exacting margin of plus or minus half a millimeter. This is to avoid unsightly gaps at the butt joint of adjoining ducts.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, when changing the location of power sockets alone, or with data points, the existing ducts <b>20</b> have to be replaced with fresh ducts that may have to be cut to the new dimensions, thus involving the same complex and painstaking process of preparing ducts according to the new dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another time-consuming aspect of the system can be the need to connect each metal duct <b>20</b> to an earth, and also to ensure an electrical connection between adjoining ducts <b>20</b> to facilitate the earthing of these adjoining ducts.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, when changing the location of power sockets or data points, the existing ducts <b>20</b> have to be removed. This causes the cables, that were concealed in the ducts, to suddenly be exposed. Since such ducts can sometimes contain a multitudinous amount of cables that are tightly crammed into the duct, the removal of the duct can result in these cables spilling out when re-exposed, which presents an inconvenient task to re-pack the cables tightly in the fresh duct that has the new dimensions. As an example, there can sometimes be, for example, fifty or eighty data cables crammed into the duct, plus power cables. This degree of compactness of power and data cables inside the duct can lead to difficulties when individual cables need to be altered or re-wired.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, in an office environment, there might be a need to provide ten power sockets, and also ten data connection points. The power sockets can be daisy-chained all from one power cable, however, each of the ten data connection points has to be supplied as an individual data cable. Hence, when power sockets and data points are provided together, the volume taken up by the numerous data cables can often present a problem. For instance, there could be four power cables used to daisy-chain eighty power sockets, with an accompanying eighty data cables needed to create the data connection points.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another problem is that, when power sockets are being installed, the power for that part of the room has to be turned off. Thus, if the installation work is carried out during office hours, the temporary shutdown of power inconveniences those office workers would rely on electrical power for their office equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, in the known system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, often during installation, the workman has to cut and splice power cables in those instances when the existing length of cable does not suit the updated configuration. Once again, this cutting and splicing of power cables adds to the time required for installation, and thus can inconvenience the people would normally use that area of the office. Thus, if that particular power socket has to be removed or shifted in location, it sometimes requires the workman to electrically re-wire the entire connection, which involves work on the wiring of the new power socket location, as well as re-wiring work at the former power socket location. Also, a detrimental side effect of this complex electrical wiring work is that the power supply to that area of the building needs to be turned off for the duration of the work. This disruption, once again, has an effect on costs or loss of productivity of those office workers who cannot use their computers or electrical equipment for that period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An object of the present invention is to overcome or at least ameliorate one or more of the problems in the prior art, or to provide an improved alternative.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0081">Referring to the accompanying drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> show a perspective, schematic view of an implementation of an embodiment of a power-socket variable location system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0082">The system <b>100</b> is adapted to provide one or more variably-locatable electrical sockets along a wall <b>101</b> (the wall is not drawn to scale).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an elongate-conductor-enclosure-means in the form of an elongate conductor casing <b>200</b>. In use, the conductor casing <b>200</b> is arranged along the wall <b>101</b>, preferably along the base of the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0084">In other variations of the embodiment, the conductor casing <b>200</b> may be arranged along the wall at a height above the floor, for example, when the conductor casing <b>200</b> stretches horizontally along a wall just above the level of a table top or benchtop.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0085">In other modifications, the conductor casing <b>200</b> may be arranged vertically along a wall, i.e. up and down the wall, depending on the needs of the particular environment.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows what appears to be a rather short conductor casing <b>200</b>, however, in other practical embodiments, the conductor casing <b>200</b>, of appropriate length, is able to be arranged along the base of the entire length of the wall <b>101</b> of a room, or part of the wall, as required.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Conductor Casing</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show cross sections of the same conductor casing <b>200</b>, as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a cross-section view of the casing <b>200</b> as seen along the line X-X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at a location along the conductor casing <b>200</b> where there is no power socket. In such locations, the conductor casing <b>200</b> is provided with fascia-panel-means in the form of fascia panels <b>405</b>. The fascia panels <b>405</b> are removable to reveal and provide access to the interior of the conductor casing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0089">The fascia panel <b>405</b> is positioned at the front of the casing <b>200</b>, and held in place by upper <b>202</b>U and lower slots <b>202</b>L. The fascia panel <b>405</b> conceals the internal regions of the conductor casing <b>200</b>. When the facsia panel <b>405</b> is removed, the interior or internal regions of the conductor casing <b>200</b> are revealed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the same conductor casing <b>200</b> without a fascia panel <b>405</b>. The absence of fascia panel at this location is to enable power-socket-means, in the form of a variably-locatable power socket <b>400</b>, to be inserted at that location (Y-Y).</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Materials</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0091">Preferably, embodiments of the elongate-conductor-enclosure-means are made of non-conductive material. If the components of the elongate-conductor-enclosure-means were to be made from a conductive material, such as sheet metal, then it would increase the time required for installation because of the consequential, additional step of having to earth all those conductive components, to safeguard against the user touching electrically-live parts.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0092">Hence, in the embodiment, for example, the conductor casing <b>200</b> and its main rail <b>210</b> are both made of non-conductive materials, such as an appropriate polymer material. This reduces installation time by avoiding the need for earthing of such components.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Power-Socket Variable Location</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0093">One or more of the variably-locatable power sockets <b>400</b>A, <b>400</b>B etc. can generally be selectively located at substantially any location along the conductor casing <b>200</b>, even at the extreme ends of the casing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0094">This enables pins <b>51</b> of an electrical plug <b>50</b> to be inserted at those various locations along the wall in order to obtain electrical power from the sockets <b>400</b>A, <b>400</b>B etc.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0095">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a first power socket <b>400</b>A that the workman has selected to be installed at a first location Y-Y along the conductor casing <b>200</b>. A user is able to insert pins of an electrical power into the power socket <b>400</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the same conductor casing <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, except that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the user has moved the first power socket <b>400</b>A away from position Y-Y- to a different location YY-YY that is closer to the left side of the conductor casing <b>200</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the user has also attached a second power socket <b>400</b>B to the same conductor casing <b>200</b> at a further location Z-Z. Consequently, the workman has also installed a new fascia panel <b>405</b>A that has a longer dimension to span the wider gap between power sockets Z-Z, YY-YY.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0097">In use, an elongate conductor casing <b>200</b> is arranged along a wall, and the user is able to add a large number of power sockets, subject to a limitation of the current and power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0098">In the embodiment, each time a power socket is inserted into the conductor casing <b>200</b>, the socket is being added, in parallel, to the existing circuit in the casing. The number of sockets that can be inserted into a given length of casing <b>200</b> depends on the physical size of the sockets, which places a natural limit on the number of sockets that can be attached. Also, another limitation may be legislative regulations that may prescribe limits. Moreover, adding too many power sockets may cause the circuit breaker to trip. Hence, the usual guidelines should be heeded in relation to how many power sockets can be added in parallel to one circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0099">When the location and perhaps the number of power sockets have been changed, fresh fascia panel <b>405</b> is cut to size and slotted into the conductor casing <b>200</b> according to the new arrangement of the power sockets. It is substantially easier to cut a planar fascia panel <b>405</b>, than it is to re-cut a replacement box-like metal compartments <b>20</b> of the prior art in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0100">In a modification, the facia-panel-means is adapted to be adjustable in terms of its length by breaking the facia-panel-means along scored lines of weakness provided thereon. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the fascia panel <b>405</b> may be provided in a form with scored lines <b>406</b> of weakness to allow the panel to be broken or snapped by hand at selective lengths. Thus, this modified fascia panel <b>405</b> can be broken by hand into appropriate lengths, rather than needing cutting tools such as saws. In this modification, the ability to reduce the size of the fascia panel <b>405</b> by breaking it along the scored lines <b>406</b> also avoids the creation of debris or saw dust that is usually produced when cutting the panel, for instance, with a mechanical saw.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Elongate Conductor Means</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0101">The conductor casing <b>200</b> acts as an enclosure for an elongate-electrical-conductor-means that is located within the casing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0102">In the embodiment, the elongate-electrical-conductor-means is in the form of a three-part set of elongate electrical contacts <b>300</b>. The contacts <b>300</b> extend along the entire length of the casing <b>200</b>. The contacts <b>300</b> have uniform cross-section along their entire length. In other embodiments, the contacts <b>300</b> can extend at least substantially along the entire length of the casing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0103">The three electrical contacts <b>300</b> consist of a live contact <b>300</b>L, an earth contact <b>300</b>E and a neutral <b>300</b>N contact (the suffixes L, E and N denote Live, Earth and Neutral respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0104">In the embodiment, preferably the earth contact <b>300</b>E is in the middle, while the active contact <b>300</b>L is uppermost, and the neutral <b>300</b>N is lowermost.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0105">The conductor casing <b>200</b> includes a main rail <b>210</b> that encloses the electrical contacts <b>300</b>. The main rail <b>210</b> of the conductor casing <b>200</b> substantially encloses the electrical contacts <b>300</b>, except for providing narrow slits <b>310</b>L, <b>310</b>E, <b>310</b>N in the face <b>211</b> of the main rail that provide limited access to the contacts <b>300</b> within.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0106">Each slit <b>310</b> acts as a narrow opening that allows limited physical access to the electrical contacts <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L within the casing <b>200</b>. This ensures that, in operation, the casing <b>200</b> minimises the likelihood of inadvertent contact between a user and the electrically-live contacts, <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L within the casing <b>200</b>, since the slits are too narrow to allow insertion of a person's fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0107">In the embodiment, the main rail <b>210</b> is made of an insulating material, for example, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) polymer, or may be made from any suitable insulator that has sufficient stiffness required for the function of the main rail.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0108">The electrical contacts <b>300</b> are made from a conductor material, for example, a copper and spring steel composite alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0109">In use, the conductor casing <b>200</b> is arranged along at least part of a wall, which effectively causes the elongate electrical contacts, <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L&#x2014;which are inside the casing <b>200</b>&#x2014;to be arranged along that wall. The three contacts&#x2014;active, earth and neutral <b>300</b>L, <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N&#x2014;are appropriately connected to a power source.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0110">The elongate electrical contacts <b>300</b> act as an elongate, electrically-live power source that extends along the wall <b>101</b>. One or more power sockets <b>400</b> can be inserted into and attached to the main rail <b>210</b> at any location along its length to draw electricity from the electrically-live contacts <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0111">Since the user is able to shift the location of power sockets <b>400</b> simply by removing and re-attaching the sockets <b>400</b> anywhere along the main rail <b>210</b>, it has an advantage of avoiding the need for re-wiring the power socket each time the socket location is shifted.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0112">Furthermore, the amount of time needed to attach or shift a variably-locatable power socket <b>400</b> to another location on the main rail <b>210</b> is significantly less than the time needed in the known system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0113">Another advantage of the present embodiment is a reduction in the amount of wires and cables relating to the power sockets <b>400</b>A, <b>400</b>B etc. The problem of the amount of wiring for the sockets, in the prior art, is at least ameliorated in the present embodiment by the power socket wiring being replaced by a single main rail <b>210</b>, which is more compact, and which has a far neater appearance compared to a multitudinous mass of socket wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0114">A further advantage of the system of the present embodiment is that, when the location of power sockets <b>400</b> are shifted from time to time, there is no need to remove or open up the casing <b>200</b>, and hence it avoids the problem of re-exposing the internal contents of the casing <b>200</b>. This, in turn, avoids the problem of the contents of the casing <b>200</b> falling out when the casing is opened.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a conductor casing <b>200</b>, as seen along the line Y-Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shown with a variably-locatable power socket <b>400</b>A attached to the casing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0116">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an electrical plug <b>50</b> has been inserted into the variably-locatable power socket <b>400</b>A (or <b>400</b>B). The electrical plug <b>50</b> has pins <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0117">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there are metallic strips <b>52</b> behind the socket-body-frame <b>402</b>. When the plug <b>50</b> is inserted into power socket <b>400</b>A, the pins <b>51</b> of the plug connect with the metallic strip <b>52</b>, thus creating a circuit through which electrical power can flow, from the electrically-live contacts <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L to the pins <b>51</b> and on to the electrical device that draws current from the plug <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0118">Thus, in order to electrically connect the pins <b>51</b> to the electrically-live contacts <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L inside the main rail <b>210</b>, each power socket <b>400</b>, <b>400</b>A, <b>400</b>B has pin-to-conductor-conduction-means.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0119">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the pin-to-conductor-conduction-means is in a form that includes long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N. Each power socket <b>400</b>, <b>400</b>A and <b>400</b>B preferably includes a power switch <b>53</b> which is interposed between the pins <b>51</b> and the electrically-live contact <b>300</b>L, to allow switching on and off of the power supply to the plug <b>50</b> and thus to the appliance which is connected to the plug <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0120">When the pins <b>51</b> of the electrical plug are inserted into the variably-locatable power socket <b>400</b>, an electrical circuit is established, from the contacts <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L, through the long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N, to the pins <b>51</b> of the plug <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0121">In the embodiment, most of the length of the long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N is protectively covered by an insulation material, except for the distal ends which are exposed as metallic conductive surfaces that can engage with the electrically-live contacts <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0122">In the embodiment, even though the narrowness of the slits <b>310</b> would prevent entry of a person's fingers, the slits may still not obstruct an unreasonable act of entry, for example, the insertion of a knife between the slits perhaps being a malicious act of vandalism. Therefore, in other modifications, the slits <b>310</b> can be modified by having struts or webbing that create a continuous series of segmented, short slits <b>310</b> through which the long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N can still enter, but which are too narrow to allow entry of small potential invasive objects, such as knives.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Installation Process</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0123">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the user wishes to attach a power socket <b>400</b>A to the conductor casing <b>200</b> at a desired location, the process requires that a portion of the fascia panel <b>405</b>, at the location, is removed and replaced with the power socket <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0124">In the embodiment, during attachment of the power socket <b>400</b> to the conductor casing <b>200</b>, it is advantageous for the long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N to enter the slits <b>310</b> of the main rail <b>210</b> at least in a substantially straight-ahead alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0125">Theoretically, the pins <b>450</b> should enter the slits in a perfectly straight-ahead alignment at the instant that they enter the slits <b>310</b>, i.e. the pins should theoretically be 90 degrees with respect to the face plane <b>211</b> of the main rail. Furthermore, the reference to &#x201c;straight-ahead&#x201d; alignment also means that, as far as possible, the lateral surfaces of the long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N, at the moment of entry, should at least be substantially parallel to the internal surfaces of the slits <b>310</b>. In other words, the longitudinal axis of each long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N should be at least substantially co-axial with an axis that runs through the longitudinal chamber of its corresponding slit <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0126">In practice, however, in the embodiment, it should suffice for the pins <b>450</b> to merely enter the slits substantially straight-ahead to the extent that the leeway does not result in damage to the pins, which is actually the ultimate aim of ensuring appropriate pin-to-slit alignment. For example, in the embodiment, the pins can be within a range of approximately 85 to 90 degrees with respect to the face plane <b>211</b> of the main rail as they enter the slits <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0127">In practice, in the exemplary embodiment, the connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N would be perfectly 90 degrees with respect to the face plate <b>211</b> only once the pins are fully engaged with the slits <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0128">The purpose of this straight-ahead alignment is to avoid damage to the long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N as they enter the slits <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0129">In contrast, if such straight-ahead alignment is not achieved at least substantially, and if the long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N were to enter the slits at a significant angle, the pins <b>450</b> could be damaged as a result of being forced against the face <b>211</b> of main rail <b>210</b>, rather than entering smoothly into slits, or may experience bending forces while entering the slits.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0130">To avoid damage to the distal-ends of the connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N at the instant of entry into the slits, in other modifications, the distal-ends can be slightly rounded. The intention is that, if the distal-ends of the pins approach the slits <b>310</b> on a trajectory that is slightly out of alignment, such that part of the pin hits the face plate <b>211</b> of the main rail, rather than entering straight into the slit <b>310</b>, the curvature of the rounded distal end of the pins can cause the pin to be guided back into the its slit <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0131">Therefore, to minimise or avoid such damage, the embodiment includes straight-ahead-alignment-means adapted, during attachment, to enable a leading, distal portion of the connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N, at instant of actual entrance, to enter at least substantially straight into the slits <b>310</b>, rather than entering misaligned or entering at an angle that may causes damage to the pins <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0132">As an aside comment, by way of illustration only&#x2014;as anyone who has tried to insert an electrical plug into a socket while in the dark&#x2014;it is appreciated that it could potentially be difficult to manually guide the connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N straight ahead into the slits, at the correct angle, without damaging the pins, particularly from constant disconnection and re-connection of the power socket <b>400</b>. Moreover, this can be particularly difficult to achieve manually, merely through hand-eye-coordination, because, at the instant of entry, the user cannot see the pins <b>450</b> and slits <b>310</b> at the moment of entrance when the pins enter the slits.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0133">Therefore, in the present embodiment, the straight-ahead-alignment-means provides a reference point for guiding the pins into the slits, rather than relying on the hand-eye coordination of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0134">The straight-ahead-alignment-means includes a pivot-support that acts as a reference point for the movement of the pins into the slits.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0135">As will be described below, the embodiment includes a two-phase installation process.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0136">The pivot-support has a first-support-portion and a second-support-portion. During installation, the power socket <b>400</b> is initially supported by the first-support-portion. Subsequently, immediately prior to the instant of actual entrance of the pin-to-conductor-conduction-means into the elongate-electrical-conductor-means, the support of the power socket <b>400</b> transitions from the first-support-portion to the second-support-portion. This concept of the first and second-support-portions is explained in further detail as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0137">In the embodiment, the rim <b>202</b>R of the lower slot <b>202</b>L acts as a first-support-portion that initially pivotally supports the power socket <b>400</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a motion diagram of the process of attaching the variably-locatable power socket <b>400</b> to the conductor casing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0139">As per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the attachment process initially requires the lower distal end of the socket-body-frame <b>402</b> to be positioned on the rim <b>202</b>R of the lower slot <b>202</b>L. In this tilted orientation, the lower tab <b>401</b>L is skewed, i.e. tilted relative to the vertical slot <b>202</b>L, and hence the lower tab <b>401</b>L cannot slide into the lower slot <b>202</b>L.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0140">Subsequently, the socket-body-frame <b>402</b> is progressively pivoted towards the conductor casing <b>200</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the direction of this progressive pivotal motion is indicated by an arrow <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0141">Finally, as the socket-body-frame <b>402</b> approaches a vertical orientation, the lower tab <b>401</b>L eventually also approaches a vertical orientation until it becomes sufficiently close to a vertical orientation to allow the lower tab <b>401</b>L to slide into the lower slot <b>202</b>L, which, in the embodiment, is the second-support-portion. Thus, immediately prior to the instant of actual entrance of the pins <b>450</b> into the slits <b>310</b>, the support of the power socket <b>400</b> transitions from the rim <b>202</b>R to the lower slot <b>202</b>L itself. This is the two-stage process mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0142">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the upper part of the conductor casing <b>200</b> also has an upper rim <b>203</b>R, which is a mirror image of the lower rim <b>202</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0143">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the upper part of the socket-body-frame <b>402</b> has a ledge <b>404</b> that is intended, when installed, to abut the outer surface of the upper rim <b>203</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0144">During installation, as the lower tab <b>401</b>L slides into the lower slot <b>202</b>L, as described above, the ledge <b>404</b> moves towards the outer surface of the upper rim <b>203</b>R. At the moment when the lower tab <b>401</b>L slides into the lower slot <b>202</b>L, generally concurrently, the ledge <b>404</b> abuts the upper rim <b>202</b>R. A resilient or spring loaded clip <b>470</b> locks the ledge <b>404</b> to the upper rim <b>202</b>R by engaging with the rear of an inner tab <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0145">In the embodiment, in order to remove the power socket <b>400</b>A from the conductor casing <b>200</b>, there is preferably provided a pin hole that the user can insert a tool to force the clip <b>470</b> downwards to disengage from the inner tab <b>204</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an example of a tool that is used to force the clip downwards, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The pin-like tool <b>471</b> has a sloping, leading-face <b>472</b> which, in use, acts similarly to a cam that pushes the clip <b>470</b> downwards as the tool <b>471</b> moves forwards. In other embodiments, variations of the mechanism for disengaging the locking mechanism of the power socket are possible. For instance, rather than needing to use a separate tool, a variation of the embodiment can have the face of the power socket being provided with a switch that triggers an internal, in-built cam mechanism that acts on the clip <b>470</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0146">Therefore, an advantage of the embodiment is that the socket-body-frame <b>402</b> can be installed without tools, and moreover can be removed simply by using a single, simple tool <b>417</b>, as compared to configurations in the prior art that require a workman to go through a significantly more complex disassembly process requiring more tools to remove and shift the location of the power socket. Significantly, in the embodiment, the socket-body-frame <b>402</b> can be inserted, installed, removed to a different location on the rail, and re-installed, all without the need to turn off the electrical power supply to the main rail <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0147">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, once the clip <b>470</b> is forced downwards, the clip no longer holds the power socket <b>400</b>A in place, and the user is able to remove the power socket <b>400</b>A in an outwards pivoting motion.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0148">As a result of the forwards pivoting motion during insertion of the power socket, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N are also brought towards their ultimate destination, which is that each of the three long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N should enter the respective narrow slits <b>310</b>E, <b>310</b>N, <b>310</b>L of the main rail <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0149">In the embodiment, the entrance of each of the narrow slits <b>310</b>E, <b>310</b>N, <b>310</b>L are slightly rounded so that any imprecision in the installation sequence can be allowed a degree of leeway in terms of the alignment of the respective components that engage with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0150">The ends of each of the contacts <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L are in the form of resilient, triangular-shaped springs which, in the embodiment, each have an upwards bias so as to press up against the long connector pins <b>450</b> when each pin <b>450</b> enters its respective slit <b>310</b>. The resilience and upward bias of the contacts <b>300</b> provides a press fit for the pins <b>450</b> in the slits <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0151">As described above, as the socket-body-frame <b>402</b> of the power socket <b>400</b> pivots and sweeps towards the conductor casing <b>200</b> in an arc, for the majority of this arc motion the frame <b>402</b> pivots about the first-support-portion, which is in the form of the rim <b>202</b>R of the lower slots <b>202</b>L. In other words, for much of the sweep of its pivotal motion, the long connector pins <b>450</b> move in a false trajectory that would see the pins <b>450</b> hit the face <b>211</b> of main rail <b>210</b> out of alignment with the narrow slits <b>310</b>E, <b>310</b>N, <b>310</b>L&#x2014;if not for the fact that, at the last moment, the lower tab <b>401</b>L slides into the lower slot <b>202</b>L. At that last moment, the three long connector pins <b>450</b> are translated, out of the false trajectory, into a correct trajectory that enables the pins to smoothly enter the narrow slits <b>310</b>E, <b>310</b>N, <b>310</b>L without any or substantial hindrance from the face <b>211</b> of the main rail <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0152">Therefore, in the embodiment, in order to avoid the long connector pins <b>450</b> from being jammed into the face <b>211</b> of the main rail <b>210</b> while still in its false trajectory, before the last moment translation into the true trajectory, it is preferable that the protruding length of the long connector pins <b>450</b> is designed to be of such a length that each pin <b>450</b> only makes contact and enters its corresponding slit <b>310</b> at the abovementioned last moment. Some experimentation will be required, since the appropriate protrusion length of the pins <b>450</b> will depend on other size dimensions of the other components, such as the conductor casing <b>200</b>, the main rail <b>210</b>, and the size of the power socket <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0153">Thus, the lower slot <b>202</b>L itself (rather than its rim) act as the second-support-portion. The lower slot <b>202</b>L supports the socket-body-frame <b>402</b> of the power socket <b>400</b> such that, immediately prior to the instant of actual entrance of the pins <b>450</b> into the slits, the pins <b>450</b> enter the slits at least substantially straight-ahead in a true trajectory to avoid damage to the pins.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0154">The long connector pins <b>450</b> are perpendicular to the plane of frame <b>402</b> of the power socket <b>400</b>, hence, the precaution&#x2014;of ensuring that the pin <b>450</b> only enters the slit <b>310</b> at the abovementioned last moment&#x2014;will also ensure that the pins enter the slits in an orientation that is as perpendicular as possible, relative to the face <b>211</b> of the main rail <b>210</b>, i.e. the straight-ahead alignment.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Data Connection Points</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0155">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one or more data connection points <b>410</b> can be selectively attached to the conductor casing <b>200</b>. Data connection points <b>410</b> can be attached at any location along the length of the conductor casing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0156">In the embodiment, the one or more data connection points are associated and linked to data-cables or data-wiring <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0157">In the embodiment, the data connection point is supported on a data-point-body-frame (not shown) that is similar to the socket-body-frame <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, except that the data-point-body-frame omits long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N and associated wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0158">The similarity of the overall frame of the data-point-body-frame is intended to allow the data-point-body-frame to be selectively attached to the conductor casing <b>200</b> with a similar pivoting motion, as has been described for the socket-body-frame <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0159">In the embodiment, the interior of the conductor casing <b>200</b> includes data-cable-confinement-means that confines any data cables to part of the interior of the conductor casing <b>200</b>. This confinement of the data cables preferably are sufficient to avoid interference between the data cables <b>411</b> and the electrical circuit components of the socket <b>400</b>, namely the long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N and the contacts <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L of the main rail <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0160">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the data-cable-confinement-means is in a form that includes a plurality of resilient fingers <b>220</b>U, <b>220</b>L.</p>

<p id="p-0157" num="0162">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref>, the downwardly depending fingers <b>220</b>U have an overall L-shaped body with a stem <b>223</b> that is attached to and extends from the rear inner surface of the case <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0163">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, between the upper <b>220</b>U and lower <b>220</b>L rows of fingers, there is a gap <b>221</b> through which the workman is able to push data cables <b>411</b> into a region <b>222</b> inside the conductor casing <b>200</b> where the cables <b>441</b> are confined.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0164">The data cables are thus confined to part <b>222</b> of the interior, i.e. not the whole, of the conductor casing <b>200</b> using the data-cable-confinement-means.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0165">Such confinement of the data cables <b>411</b> to a restricted part <b>222</b> of the conductor casing <b>200</b>, rather than allowing the data cables to take up any location inside the conductor casing <b>200</b>, ensures that the data cables <b>411</b> will not interfere with the entry or withdrawal of the long connector pins <b>450</b> L, <b>450</b>E, <b>450</b>N inside the conductor casing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0166">In the embodiment, the fingers <b>220</b> are particularly useful for confining the data cables, especially when the fascia panel <b>405</b> is temporarily removed. Without the fingers, the often large number of data cables might fall out of the casing <b>200</b> if the fascia <b>405</b> were to be removed without the benefit of the fingers <b>220</b> to confine the data cables.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0167">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref>, there are five data connection wires <b>411</b> shown, however, in practice, the number of data wires <b>411</b> depends on the number of data connection points <b>410</b> that are attached along the length of the conductor casing <b>200</b>. Each data connection point <b>410</b> has its own individual cable <b>411</b> leading to the connection point <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0168">In other modifications, the data-cable-confinement-means can be in alternative forms. For instance, rather than having fingers, an alternative embodiment can replace the upper and lower fingers <b>220</b>U, <b>220</b>L instead with flexible panels that achieve the same function as the fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0169">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is a gap between the upper and lower fingers <b>220</b>U, <b>220</b>L, whereas in alternative embodiments, the edges of the upper and lower parts can be provided with a releasable locking mechanism. In such an embodiment, once the cables <b>411</b> have been inserted, the upper and lower parts can be locked together. For example, the locking mechanism can be in the form of clips or some other suitable configuration.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Other Modifications</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0170">In other modifications, the straight-ahead-alignment-means is not limited to a pivotal motion. For example, as an alternative, the upper and lower slots <b>202</b>U, <b>202</b>L may be provided with straight-ahead-alignment-means in the form of alignment cut-out portions which could guarantee appropriate alignment of the pins and slits, if the power socket <b>400</b> were to be guided into connection with the casing <b>200</b> in a movement that is precisely guided by the cut-out slots.</p>

<p id="p-0166" num="0171">In order to create longer lengths of rail <b>210</b>, two or more of the main rails <b>210</b> can be joined together with a circuit-connector <b>230</b> shown in the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0172">The circuit-connector <b>230</b> is used to connect the main rail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 13</figref> to another main rail <b>230</b> to form a longer rail of combined length of the two joined rails.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0173">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the circuit-connector <b>230</b> is provided with two parallel sets of circuit-connector pins <b>451</b>L, <b>451</b>E, <b>451</b>N, and <b>451</b>LL, <b>451</b>EE, <b>451</b>NN. One set <b>451</b>L, <b>451</b>E, <b>451</b>N can be inserted into the slits <b>310</b>A of a first main rail <b>210</b>, while the other set <b>451</b>LL, <b>451</b>EE, <b>451</b>NN can be inserted into a second main rail, so that the first and second main rails are thus joined to form a longer rail.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0174">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, there is wiring or circuitry (not shown) to provide electrical connection between the two sets of circuit-connector pins on either side of the circuit-connector <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a schematic, cross-sectional side view of one set of circuit-connector pins <b>451</b>L, <b>451</b>E, <b>451</b>N inserted into the slits of one of the main rails to be joined to another. In other words, the circuit-connector pins <b>451</b>L, <b>451</b>E, <b>451</b>N is able to physically connect two adjacent main rails together so that electrical current can run from one main rail through to its adjacent main rail via the circuit-connector that connects the two rails <b>210</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0176">Another use of the circuit-connector <b>230</b> is that it can connect the main rail <b>210</b> to the electrical power supply. For example, in this mode, one set of circuit-connector pins <b>451</b>L, <b>451</b>E, <b>451</b>N is inserted into the main rail <b>210</b>, while the second set of pins <b>451</b>L, <b>451</b>E, <b>451</b>N on the same connector <b>230</b> is inserted into a connector (not shown) that ultimately leads to the power supply <b>460</b>. In other words, the circuit-connector <b>230</b> can act as a modular mechanism for attaching the main rail <b>210</b> to the source of electrical power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0177">The circuit-connector <b>230</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, is connected to an electrical power source. The circuit-connector <b>230</b> is provided with screw terminals <b>231</b> which are in electrical contact with the pins <b>451</b>L, <b>451</b>E, <b>451</b>N. The terminals <b>231</b> facilitate connection to the electrical power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0178">When the pins <b>451</b>L, <b>451</b>E, <b>451</b>N of the circuit-connector <b>230</b> are inserted into the main rail <b>210</b>, this connects the contacts, <b>300</b>E, <b>300</b>N, <b>300</b>L to the electrical power source <b>460</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> show variations of circuit-connector <b>230</b>A, <b>230</b>B which can be used at corners of walls.
