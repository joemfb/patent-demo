<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary environment in which the methods and systems described herein may be represented. In the exemplary environment <b>200</b>, the single person or a single group of two or more people (both the single person and the single group being represented by the participant <b>202</b>) may use one or more computers <b>204</b> to receive component information and/or to retrieve auxiliary information having to do with a discourse comprising a monologue of the single person represented by the participant <b>202</b> or from a discourse comprising a dialogue among the group of people represented by the participant <b>202</b>, and/or to present the component information and/or auxiliary information. The one or more computers <b>204</b> may be operably coupled to the network <b>110</b> and/or the PSTN <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Following are a series of flowcharts depicting implementations of processes. For ease of understanding, the flowcharts are organized such that the initial flowcharts present implementations via an overall &#x201c;big picture&#x201d; viewpoint and thereafter the following flowcharts present alternate implementations and/or expansions of the &#x201c;big picture&#x201d; flowcharts as either sub-steps or additional steps building on one or more earlier-presented flowcharts. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that the style of presentation utilized herein (e.g., beginning with a presentation of a flowchart(s) presenting an overall view and thereafter providing additions to and/or further details in subsequent flowcharts) generally allows for a rapid and easy understanding of the various process implementations. In addition, those skilled in the art will further appreciate that the style of presentation used herein also lends itself well to modular and/or object-oriented program design paradigms.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a high-level logic flowchart of an operational process. The illustrated process may include operation <b>300</b>, operation <b>302</b>, and/or operation <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Operation <b>300</b> shows receiving component information from a discourse component. Operation <b>300</b> may include, for example, receiving component information from a discourse component, where a discourse component including an audio component may include, e.g., a voice of a participant <b>102</b> and/or <b>104</b> and/or <b>106</b> and/or <b>108</b> and/or <b>202</b> in the discourse and/or stored (e.g., recorded and/or stored in a computer memory) voice data that is used in the discourse. Further, a discourse component including a video component may include, e.g., a video signal including an image of the face of a participant <b>102</b> and/or <b>104</b> and/or <b>106</b> and/or <b>108</b> and/or <b>202</b> in the discourse and/or stored (e.g., recorded and/or stored in a computer memory) video data. In addition, a discourse component including a graphic component may include, e.g., a drawing and/or a photograph and/or a video still image and/or another pictorial representation. Further, a discourse component including a text component may include, e.g., an electronic text document (e.g., a MICROSOFT&#xae; WORD document and/or a portable document format (herein, &#x201c;PDF&#x201d;) and/or an email and/or a facsimile document. In the context of the exemplary environment <b>100</b>, operation <b>300</b> may include, for instance, receiving component information from a discourse component, where, in a discourse in which participants <b>102</b> and/or <b>104</b> and/or <b>106</b> and/or <b>108</b> are participating, the VoIP-enabled computer <b>114</b> associated with the participant <b>102</b> receives discourse components including an audio component and a text component. In one specific example of operation <b>300</b>, during a conference call participant <b>104</b> directs computer <b>120</b> to transmit to participant <b>102</b>, through VoIP-enabled computer <b>114</b>, discourse components including an audio component, such as a signal carrying the speech of participant <b>104</b>, and a text component, such as an email including text. The VoIP-enabled computer <b>114</b> receives the discourse components and receives the component information from the discourse components, including, e.g., voice-characterizing information (e.g., sonic frequency spectrum information) from the audio component and the name &#x201c;David Bowman&#x201d; from the text component. Upon receipt, participant <b>102</b> indicates to VoIP-enabled computer <b>114</b> through some means (e.g., a voice and/or graphical user interface) that participant <b>102</b> is interested in any additional information that VoIP-enabled computer <b>114</b> could supply regarding participant <b>104</b> using the component information, that is, the sonic frequency spectrum information and the name &#x201c;David Bowman.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The receiving of operation <b>300</b> may be performed at least in part in response to operator input (where an operator may include, without being limited to, a person or persons and/or a software agent acting on behalf of a person or persons and/or autonomously) and/or hardware/software/firmware input via hardware/software/firmware associated with the network <b>110</b> and/or the PSTN <b>112</b> and/or the VoIP-enabled computer <b>114</b> and/or telephone <b>116</b> and/or VoIP-enabled telephone unit <b>118</b> and/or computer <b>120</b> and/or the telephone <b>122</b> and/or the computer <b>124</b> and/or a computer <b>204</b> and/or performed using hardware/software/firmware associated with equipment and/or devices with which the network <b>110</b> and/or the PSTN <b>112</b> and/or the VoIP-enabled computer <b>114</b> and/or telephone <b>116</b> and/or VoIP-enabled telephone unit <b>118</b> and/or computer <b>120</b> and/or the telephone <b>122</b> and/or the computer <b>124</b> and/or a computer <b>204</b> are operably coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Operation <b>302</b> depicts retrieving auxiliary information correlated and/or provisionally correlated with the component information.

Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims. It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as &#x201c;open&#x201d; terms (e.g., the term &#x201c;including&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;including but not limited to,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;having&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;having at least,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;includes but is not limited to,&#x201d; etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and indefinite articles such as &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;a&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should typically be interpreted to mean &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of &#x201c;two recitations,&#x201d; without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, or C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, or C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase &#x201c;A or B&#x201d; will be understood to include the possibilities of &#x201c;A&#x201d; or &#x201c;B&#x201d; or &#x201c;A and B.&#x201d;</p>
