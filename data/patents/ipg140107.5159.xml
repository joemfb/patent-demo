<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to healthcare applications, and more particularly to sensors in medical monitoring.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various medical procedures require continued monitoring of patients. For example, when the patients are unable to take care of themselves, the patients may be monitored using a variety of monitoring devices (e.g., by remote monitoring) to ensure their well-being. This kind of monitoring may be for the bed-ridden patients or for the mobile patients as well. Such devices may monitor, ventilation, oxygenation, metabolism, blood circulation, electrocardiography (ECG), and electroencephalography (EEG). ECG devices monitor the activity of the heart, whereas EEG devices monitor the activity of the brain. Both ECG and EEG employ sensors that can pickup electrical signals from the corresponding organs in the body. These electrical signals are generally low level. For example, the electrical signal from the heart is about 0.5 milli volts to 2 milli volts, and the signal from the brain is a few hundred microvolts. Accordingly, it is desirable to have optimum skin preparation and electrode placement to avoid weakening and artifacts of these signals at the skin-electrode interface. A good contact between the sensor and the skin is desirable for good signal acquisition. Failure to have a good or continuous contact between the sensor and the skin can cause signal loss. Also, failure to securely attach the sensor to the skin can introduce artifacts into the signals. These artifacts may cause the system to generate false calls or suspend analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional sensors, adhesive materials are used to couple the electrodes to the skin. Depending on the application, the adhesives may vary in shape and tack strength. As used herein, the term &#x201c;tack strength&#x201d; refers to &#x201c;stickiness&#x201d; of adhesive material, and is a measurement of the strength of adhesion. For short-term ECG recordings (few seconds), the electrodes may be smaller and need not employ high strength adhesive because the patient will generally be still during this short period. However, the adhesive material, such as an adhesive gel, employed to couple the electrode to the skin, may dry out during the recording. Therefore a technician is required to continuously monitor and, if required, repair any electrode dislocations. For long term recordings, the electrode is more likely to suffer from disturbances caused by tugging, jostling, inadvertent scratching, clothing changes. During these disturbances the electrode may be inadvertently detached from the skin and coupling the electrode again to the skin using the same adhesive material may not have desirable results. Moreover, sudden detachment of the electrode may injure the patient. Adhesive materials may also cause rashes or other skin irritations. Adhesives may also cause injury and pain when the sensor is removed from the skin. For example, in neo-natal applications, removing sensors from the soft skin of a newborn without injuring the skin is difficult at best.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to have a sensor that may be easily coupled and detached from the skin and which is configured to attach to the skin for extended period of time.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an exemplary embodiment, a self-adhering sensor for non-invasively attaching to a portion of a skin is provided. The sensor comprises a biocompatible substrate, and an array of solid nanoelectrodes coupled to the biocompatible substrate and configured to self-adhere to the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another exemplary embodiment, a sensor for attaching to a portion of a skin is provided. The sensor includes an array of solid electrodes configured to self-adhere to the skin, where each of the solid structures comprises a stem and one or more projections extending out from the stem, where both the stem and the projections are solid. The stem comprises a mechanical stopper to control the extent of penetration of the solid electrodes into the skin. The sensor further comprises an electrolyte coating disposed on one or more of the solid structures.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another exemplary embodiment, a method of non-invasively coupling a sensor to a portion of the skin is provided. The method comprises providing a sensor comprising a biocompatible substrate, and an array of solid nanoelectrodes configured to self-adhere to the skin, wherein the solid nanoelectrodes are coupled to the substrate. The method further comprises coupling the sensor by pressing the sensor against the surface of the skin so that at least a portion of one or more of the nanoelectrodes engages the surface of the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another exemplary embodiment, a method of coupling a sensor array to a portion of the skin is provided. The method comprises providing a sensor array. The sensor array comprises an array of solid structures configured to self-adhere to the skin, wherein each of the solid structures comprises a stem and one or more projections extending out from the stem, wherein both the stem and the projections are solid, and wherein the stem comprises a mechanical stop to control the amount of penetration of the solid structures into the skin. The sensor array further comprises an electrolyte coating disposed on one or more of the solid structures. The method further comprises pressing the sensor array against the surface of the skin so that the distal ends of the solid structures engage the surface of the skin while the mechanical stop is seated on the outside surface the skin.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Monitoring a patient may be desired under various circumstances. Monitoring for different functions of the body is accomplished using various pathways. Some of the monitoring may be non-invasive, for example, blood circulation may be monitored by monitoring blood pressure externally. Yet, skin sensors are employed to evaluate/read organ function. For example, skin sensors may be employed for monitoring the function of the heart and brain.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Electrocardiography (ECG) is a technique used to monitor heart activity. The heart is a muscle that has an electrical field having a current flow. The electrical activity of the heart may be detected by placing electrodes on the skin. The ECG signals can be measure between one or more pairs of electrodes placed on the human body. Each pair contains two electrodes of opposite polarity that are in electrical communication. By positioning the electrode at different locations, the clinician may monitor different views of the heart's electrical activity. Typically, the measurements are taken in a negative electrode to positive electrode direction. The positive and negative electrodes are disposed at different positions on the body. Also, more than one pair of electrodes may be applied to pick up the ECG signal. In an exemplary embodiment, a pair of electrodes is employed by disposing a negative electrode on the right arm and a positive electrode on the left arm.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a portion of a human body <b>10</b> employing two pairs <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> of electrodes. The pair <b>12</b> includes a negative electrode <b>14</b> employed on the right shoulder and a positive electrode <b>16</b> employed on the left shoulder. The second pair <b>18</b> includes a negative electrode <b>20</b> employed on the right side of the torso and a positive electrode <b>22</b> employed on the left side of the torso. Depending on the position of these electrodes on the body, the ECG signals may have different shapes and amplitudes. Additionally, a third electrode also referred to as a reference electrode may also be employed. The reference electrode may be maintained at neutral and is used to reduce electrical interference. The ECG measures and records the electrical impulses when they are conducted through different parts of the heart. As noted above, the electrical signals generated by the heart are weak and therefore require good contact between the skin and the sensor employing the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Brain activity may be monitored using electroencephalography (EEG). Neurons transmit electrical pulses when they communicate with each other. EEG measures the spontaneous electrical activity of the cerebral cortex, i.e., the surface layer of the brain. Similar to ECG, EEG is also measured as a voltage differential between two electrodes. To attach the electrodes that employ adhesive materials, the dead cells and grease are first removed from the skin surface to facilitate adhesion. Conductive gel or paste may also be used to improve the contact between the skin and the electrodes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a set up for taking ECG measurements. Sensors <b>24</b> are fixed to the forehead <b>26</b> of a human being <b>28</b>. The signals captured by the sensors <b>24</b> are very low; hence an amplifier <b>30</b> is employed to boost the signals. The signals are then processed using the processor <b>32</b> and displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some of the embodiments, the sensors do not employ adhesive materials. The sensors are self-adhering. As used herein, the term &#x201c;self-adhering&#x201d; embodies structures which are configured to couple to a surface and do not need additional means for coupling the structures to the surface. For example, the self-adhering electrodes may be coupled to the surface without employing any adhesive materials.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although, the exemplary embodiments described and illustrated are described in the context of ECG and EEG applications, these examples are not limiting. The self-adhering sensors may be used in a variety of other medical and non-medical applications. For example, the self-adhering devices and methods may be used to measure, the saturation of oxy-hemoglobin (SpO2) or even to fix or adorn the skin or other similar surfaces with any number or type of items with which adhesives are not a desirable means of fixing.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one or more of the embodiments, the self-adhering sensor for non-invasively attaching to a portion of a skin includes a biocompatible substrate having an array of solid nanoelectrodes. As used herein, the term &#x201c;solid nanoelectrodes&#x201d; refer to nanoelectrodes that have a solid core and are not hollow from inside. The biocompatible substrate may comprise any material that has the ability to be brought in contact with the skin without causing the body to attack, reject, or react against the substrate. In certain embodiments, the substrate may comprise, but is not limited to, a ceramic, metal, or a polymeric material, or combinations thereof. For example, the substrate may comprise a plastic. As will be described in detail below, the solid nanoelectrodes are configured to self-adhere to the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a side view of a self-adhering sensor <b>34</b>. The sensor <b>34</b> may be non-invasively coupled to a portion of the skin. In the presently contemplated embodiment, the sensor <b>34</b> includes a plurality of nanoelectrodes <b>36</b>. In some of the embodiments, the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> comprise solid nanostructures. The nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> preferably comprise biocompatible materials. In some embodiments, the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> are made of electrically conductive material, such as metals. For example, the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> may be made of, but not limited to, silver, gold, platinum, alloys of palladium and cobalt, stainless steel, noble metals, conductive polymers, or combinations thereof. In other embodiments, the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> may comprise conductive materials, which may or may not be biocompatible depending on the material and the application. If not biocompatible, the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> may comprise a coating of a biocompatible material to avoid any reactions that may otherwise occur if the non-biocompatible material is brought in contact with the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some of the embodiments, the cross-section of the solid nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> may comprise the same or differing geometric shapes. For example, in one embodiment, the sensor may comprise a combination of different geometrical shapes, such as, but not limited to, circular, triangular, hexagonal, square, or rectangular shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some of the embodiments, the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> may have a length, shown by arrow <b>40</b>, of less than or equal to about 5 micrometers. In one example, the length of the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> is less than or equal to about 1 micrometer. The length of the nanoelectrodes may be chosen so as to avoid collapsing/buckling of the nanoelectrodes. The diameter of these nanoelectrodes is preferably in a range from about 10 nanometers to about 500 nanometers. The combination of length and diameter may be chosen so as to provide an aspect ratio in a range from about 1:2 to about 1:20. In one example, the aspect ratio may be in a range from about 1:5 to about 1:10. Lower aspect ratios may be desirable while employing conductive polymers due to the lower strength of the polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some of the embodiments, the array of nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> in the sensor <b>34</b> may comprise nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> having varied diameters. Alternatively, all the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> in the array of the sensor <b>34</b> may have same diameters. Further, the spacing between any two nearest nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> is preferably about a few hundred nanometers. As used herein, the spacing is the distance from the outer surface of one nanoelectrode to the outer surface of another nanoelectrode. For example, nanoelectrodes <b>36</b>, having a diameter of about 200 nanometers, are preferably positioned at a distance of about 100 nanometers from the nearest neighbors. The spacing and the diameters may be chosen to provide sufficient surface-to-surface contact when the sensor <b>34</b> is brought into contact with the skin. The area of the sensor <b>34</b> may be in a range from about 1&#xd7;1 cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 3&#xd7;3 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The sensor <b>34</b> is disposed on the skin such that the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> are closer to the skin than to the substrate <b>38</b>. In one example, the substrate <b>38</b> comprises a polymer, a ceramic, or a printed circuit board. Van der Waals forces are optimized between the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> and the skin when the sensor <b>34</b> is disposed close to the skin or brought in contact with the skin. Van der Waals forces in part enable coupling of the sensor <b>34</b> to the skin without the need to use adhesive materials. Nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> also do not require invasive techniques, and therefore, the sensor <b>34</b> can be easily coupled to and detached from the skin. Accordingly, the sensor <b>34</b> may be used in neo-natal healthcare applications. In such applications, the sensors <b>34</b> may be easily removed from the soft skin of the baby as compared to the other sensors that employ adhesive materials as a coupling means for adhering to the skin. Unlike adhesives that lose their tack strength in a short period of time, sensor <b>34</b> may be used for an extended period of time. Some or all of the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b> in the sensor <b>34</b> may also provide other functionality in addition to adhesion and electrical conductivity functions, such as, but not limited to, thermal conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some of the embodiments, sensors comprising solid nanoelectrodes, such as nanoelectrodes <b>36</b>, may be formed using the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> illustrate various steps involved in the method of making the nanoelectrodes <b>36</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the steps of growing nanostructures that can be used as nanoelectrodes. In the illustrated embodiment, a substrate <b>42</b> is provided. In one example, the substrate may be a semiconductor substrate. For example, the substrate may include materials, such as but not limited to, silicon, gallium arsenide, aluminum gallium arsenide, or combinations thereof. Next, a metal film <b>44</b>, comprising aluminum, is deposited on the substrate <b>42</b>. In some embodiments, the metal film <b>44</b> is configured to develop pores <b>46</b> upon anodization or oxidation. In one embodiment, anodization of the metal film <b>44</b> may be performed by employing processes, such as wet chemical processes. In an exemplary embodiment, the metal may include aluminum, which upon oxidation may convert into porous alumina with uniform vertical channels. In some embodiments, the pore density of the anodized alumina may be in a range from about 10<sup>7 </sup>pores/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 10<sup>11 </sup>pores/cm<sup>2</sup>. Alternatively, a porous template layer, such as anodic aluminum oxide layer, may be attached directly onto the substrate <b>42</b>. Although not illustrated, an additional dissolvable metal layer may be deposited between the metal film <b>44</b> and the substrate <b>42</b>. In some embodiments, this dissolvable metal layer may be dissolved in certain solutions, thereby detaching the metal film <b>44</b> from the substrate <b>42</b>, as described below. In some embodiments, the metal layer may include metals, such as but not limited to, titanium, chromium, tungsten, titanium-tungsten, copper, gold, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, a catalyst <b>48</b>, such as gold may be deposited in the pores <b>46</b>. In some embodiments, the catalyst <b>48</b> may be deposited by employing processes, such as electrochemical deposition, e-beam evaporation, thermal evaporation, or sputtering. The catalyst <b>48</b> may be used to facilitate the growth of the nanoelectrodes. The fill factor of the catalyst <b>48</b> and/or the nanostructures <b>50</b> may be reduced to increase the space between individual nanowires. For example, the fill factor of the catalyst <b>48</b> may be reduced by using an easily oxidizing metal layer, such as titanium. Further, if a catalyst <b>48</b>, such as gold, is employed, the catalyst <b>48</b> is heated to form a liquid droplet and absorb the material of the nanoelectrodes and deposit it on the substrate <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, nanostructures <b>50</b> are deposited in the pores <b>46</b> having the catalyst <b>48</b>. In some embodiments, the nanostructures <b>50</b> may be made of a biocompatible material. For example, silicone elastomer, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, hexamethyldisiloxane, or silazane. In other embodiments, the nanostructures <b>50</b> may be made of a material that is not biocompatible. For example, in these embodiments, the nanostructures <b>50</b> may include silicon, germanium, group III-V semiconductors, group II-VI semiconductors, group IV-IV semiconductors, or combinations thereof. As will be described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the embodiments where a non-biocompatible material is employed in the nanostructures <b>50</b>, a thin film <b>60</b> of a biocompatible material may be deposited on the nanostructures <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, the nanostructures <b>50</b> may be deposited using chemical vapor deposition, such as one using vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. In these embodiments, the substrate <b>42</b> having the catalyst <b>48</b> in the pores <b>46</b> may be transferred to a chemical vapor deposition chamber prior to depositing the nanostructures <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the nanostructures <b>50</b> may not have a uniform length, thereby making it difficult to ensure a good contact between the sensor and the skin. As used herein, the term &#x201c;uniform length&#x201d; embodies a difference of up to about 50 nanometers in the length of the nanoelectrodes. Although not illustrated, prior to depositing the sensor substrate <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the lengths <b>54</b> of the nanostructures <b>50</b> may be made uniform by etching away a portion of the structures <b>50</b>. The length <b>54</b> of the nanostructures <b>50</b> may be made uniform by depositing a photoresist or other polymer filling material around the nanostructures <b>50</b> up to a desired length. For example, the photoresist layer may be spin coated on the nanostructures <b>50</b>. The photoresist layer may be deposited at low temperatures in a range from about 46&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C. In some of the embodiments, oxygen plasma may be employed to etch the extended portions of the nanostructures <b>50</b> having uniform length. In other embodiments, wet etch may be employed to etch away the extended portions of the nanostructures <b>50</b>, thereby forming the nanostructures <b>50</b> having uniform lengths. Subsequently, the photoresist is removed by dissolving it in a suitable solvent, such as acetone, or other resist strippers, or etching by oxygen plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates steps of depositing a sensor substrate <b>52</b> that is configured to hold the nanostructures <b>50</b> together to form a sensor, such as the sensor <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The sensor substrate <b>52</b> includes ceramic, silicon, or a printed circuit board. The sensor substrate <b>52</b> may be deposited by any of the deposition techniques such as physical vapor deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (PECVD), radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (RFPECVD), expanding thermal-plasma chemical-vapor deposition (ETPCVD), reactive sputtering, electron-cyclodrawn-residence plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (ECRPECVD), inductively coupled plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (ICPECVD), sputter deposition, evaporation, atomic layer deposition (ALD), or combinations thereof. Subsequently, the metal film <b>44</b> of anodized alumina is etched away by controlled wet etching, such as buffered oxide etch, or KOH or NaOH, to form the sensor <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the sensor <b>56</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the sensor <b>58</b> includes nanostructures <b>50</b> having a thin film of the biocompatible material. The sensor <b>58</b> may include a non-biocompatible material; the film <b>60</b> is made of one or more biocompatible materials listed above. In some embodiments, the film <b>60</b> may have a thickness in a range from about 10 nm to about 100 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a solid electrode <b>62</b> is illustrated. The solid electrode <b>62</b> is configured to penetrate inside the skin to acquire data for applications such as ECG or EEG monitoring. The dimensions of the electrode <b>62</b> may be selected to avoid rupture of the skin and prevent bleeding from the skin. In other words, the penetration of the electrode <b>62</b> into the skin should be limited to the stratum corneum, which has a thickness of about 15 micrometers, although, a part of the electrode <b>62</b> may be allowed to reach into the upper portion of the epidermis. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an array of the solid electrodes <b>62</b> assembled together in a substrate forms a sensor <b>80</b>. When employed in a sensor array, the solid electrodes, such as electrodes <b>62</b>, may all have same geometric shapes. Alternatively, some of the solid electrodes may have different geometric shapes. For example, the cross-sections may be selected from a rectangular cross-section, a circular, cross-section, a square cross-section, a triangular cross-section, a hexagonal cross-section, or any other geometrical shape. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the solid electrode <b>62</b> comprises a stem <b>64</b>, which has projections <b>66</b>. Further, the cross-section of the stem <b>64</b> may have different geometric shapes. The stem <b>64</b> and the projections <b>66</b> are both solid structures. In one embodiment, the solid electrode <b>62</b> comprises one or more of silver, gold, platinum, noble metals, or conductive polymers. In another embodiment, the solid electrode <b>62</b> may comprise one or more electrically conductive coating. As will be described below, the electrically conductive coating comprises an electrochemical material.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the figures are for illustrative purposes and are not drawn to scale. Also, although only two projections are illustrated, one on each side of the stem <b>64</b>, in other embodiments, the projections <b>66</b> may be arranged in various configurations, shapes, numbers on the stem <b>64</b>. The projections may be in a range from about 1 micron to about 100 microns. In some embodiments, the projections <b>66</b> are configured to hold the solid electrode <b>62</b> inside the skin. The distal end of the stem <b>64</b> is pointed to form the tip <b>72</b>. In some embodiments, the projections <b>66</b> may be at an obtuse angle <b>78</b> from the surface of the stem <b>64</b>, which is closer to the distal end of the stem <b>64</b> or the tip <b>72</b>. The distal end or the tip <b>72</b> facilitates the insertion of the electrode <b>62</b> in the skin. Having the projections <b>66</b> at an angle such as angle <b>78</b> facilitates insertion of the solid electrode <b>62</b> in the skin with a small puncture. Small puncture size reduces the list of infections. The projections <b>66</b> may be disposed on the stem in various different configurations, some of the configurations will be described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, the surface <b>68</b> may either be smooth or may have textures. In some embodiments, the surface <b>68</b> may be a combination of smooth surface and textures. For example, the surface <b>68</b> at the tip <b>72</b> may be smooth to facilitate penetration of the solid electrode <b>62</b> into in the skin. The length <b>73</b> of the tip <b>72</b> may be a few tens of micrometers. However, the texture in the rest of the portion of the stem <b>64</b> may be roughened/jagged to facilitate grip of the solid electrode <b>62</b> inside the skin. The textures on the surface <b>68</b> of the stem <b>64</b> may be different at different positions. Further, in some embodiments, the projections <b>66</b> may have smooth surface <b>70</b>. In other embodiments, the surface <b>70</b> may be jagged.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The solid electrode <b>62</b> further includes a mechanical stopper <b>74</b> for controlling the extent of the solid electrode <b>62</b> penetrating inside the skin. Although not illustrated, the solid electrode, such as the solid electrode <b>62</b> may include more than one mechanical stopper <b>74</b> so that in instances where the first mechanical stopper coming in contact with the skin fails to stop the penetration of the electrode <b>62</b>, the next one or two stoppers may be able to prevent further penetration of the electrode in the skin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-16</figref> illustrate alternate embodiments of the mechanical stopper <b>74</b>. Once the solid electrode <b>62</b> is inserted inside the skin, the mechanical stopper <b>74</b> also functions to hold the solid electrode <b>62</b> in its position. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the mechanical stopper <b>74</b> does not enter inside the skin and remains on the surface. It should be noted that two or more mechanical stoppers <b>74</b> may be employed by the solid electrode <b>62</b>. Additionally, the mechanical stopper <b>74</b> may or may not be a continuous structure. As illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the mechanical stopper <b>74</b> may include a plurality of blocks. These pluralities of blocks are positioned such that they act as a mechanical stopper, thereby holding the solid electrode <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The mechanical stopper <b>74</b> is positioned such that the distance <b>76</b> between the tip of the electrode <b>62</b> and the mechanical stopper <b>74</b> is about a few hundred of micrometers. The dimensions of the electrode <b>62</b> may be varied depending on the application. For example, the length of the electrode <b>62</b> may be varied depending on the location of the sensor on the body. Also, the dimensions of the electrode <b>62</b> may be varied depending on the age of the patient, as the age may be related to the thickness of the skin. For example, when employed in a neo-natal application, the length <b>76</b> of the electrode may be reduced to below 50 micrometers to avoid rupturing of the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An electrochemical system may be formed to acquire signals from the electrode <b>62</b>. The electrochemical system may be formed between the electrode <b>62</b>, an electrolyte disposed on the electrode <b>62</b>, and a reference electrode (not shown) disposed outside the sensor. The reference electrode is in electrical communication with the electrode <b>62</b>. Further, an electrochemical material comprising an electrolyte, such as silver chloride is deposited on the electrode <b>62</b>. In some embodiments, a separate layer of silver may be deposited before depositing the electrolyte, such as silver chloride, such that a layer of silver exists between the electrode <b>62</b> and the layer of silver chloride. In this embodiment, the layer of silver acts as an electrode. Further, the projections <b>66</b> of the electrode <b>62</b> may have one or more functionality groups coupled to the surfaces <b>70</b> of the projections <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a sensor <b>80</b> penetrated inside the skin <b>82</b>. The sensor <b>80</b> includes a biocompatible substrate <b>84</b> having a plurality of solid electrodes <b>86</b>. The sensor <b>80</b> requires small pressure to insert the electrodes <b>86</b> inside the skin. The pressure required to insert the electrodes <b>86</b> inside the skin may be applied by hand. For example, the pressure applied by a thumb of a hand may be sufficient to insert the electrodes <b>86</b> inside the skin up to the desired depth. As illustrated, each of the solid electrodes <b>86</b> includes a stem <b>88</b>, projections <b>90</b>, a tip <b>92</b> and a mechanical stopper <b>94</b>. As noted above, the different solid electrodes <b>86</b> may have cross-sections with different geometric shapes. Also, the number of projections <b>90</b> employed on an electrode <b>86</b> may vary from one stem to another. Additionally, the arrangement of the projections on the stem <b>88</b> may be different on different electrodes <b>86</b>. The mechanical stoppers <b>94</b> are configured to hold the solid electrodes <b>86</b> in their respective positions, and prevent further penetration of the solid electrodes <b>86</b> in the skin <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref> illustrate alternative embodiments of the solid electrodes <b>62</b> and <b>86</b>. The different type of electrodes may be chosen for the given skin type. Although the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref> have stems with circular cross section, it should be noted that the solid electrodes of these embodiments may employ any of the different geometric shapes for the stems.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates an example of the method for forming solid electrodes, such as the solid electrodes illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-16</figref>. The method comprises the step of providing a substrate <b>180</b> having a seed layer <b>182</b>. In the illustrated method, the seed layer <b>182</b> comprises two layers <b>184</b> and <b>186</b>. The bottom seed layer <b>184</b> is an adhesion promoter layer to provide better adhesion between the seed layer <b>182</b> and the substrate <b>180</b>. For example, the bottom layer <b>184</b> may include titanium, chromium, or nickel. The top seed layer <b>186</b> comprises a conductive material, such as copper, to facilitate deposition process such as electroplating. Although not illustrated, in some embodiments, the seed layer <b>182</b> may comprise more than two layers. Further, a photo resist layer <b>188</b> is deposited and patterned to form patterns <b>190</b> in the photo resist layer <b>188</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The top view of the pattern <b>190</b> is depicted in the dotted circle <b>191</b>. As illustrated the pattern <b>190</b> imitates the structure of the desired solid electrode. Further, the material of the solid electrode is then deposited in the pattern <b>190</b> by methods such as electroplating to form the electrode <b>194</b>, such as physical vapor deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (PECVD), radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (RFPECVD), expanding thermal-plasma chemical-vapor deposition (ETPCVD), reactive sputtering, electron-cyclodrawn-residence plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (ECRPECVD), inductively coupled plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (ICPECVD), sputter deposition, evaporation, atomic layer deposition (ALD), or combinations thereof. Further, a conductive material layer <b>194</b> is deposited on the electrode material <b>194</b>. The conductive material layer <b>194</b> may comprise silver. Subsequently, the photo resist <b>188</b> is dissolved from in between the electrodes to form a pattern <b>196</b> in the photo resist <b>188</b> to form a sensor array having the substrate <b>180</b> and a plurality of electrodes <b>192</b> with conductive material coating <b>194</b>. The method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, facilitates bulk production of the electrodes, such as the electrode <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a method of making solid electrodes with varying geometric shapes. While employing geometric shapes with sharper edges the force required to insert the electrode in the skin is reduced due to the sharper tips. The method includes providing a substrate <b>200</b>. The substrate <b>200</b> may be made of a semiconductor, a ceramic, and a polymer. In one example, the substrate <b>200</b> may be made of silicon. In another example, the substrate <b>200</b> may be a printed circuit board. Further, an etching layer <b>202</b> is deposited on the substrate <b>200</b>. The etching layer may include an oxide or a nitride. Suitable examples of etching layer materials may include silicon nitride, or silicon oxide. Further, a photo resist layer <b>204</b> is deposited on the etching layer <b>202</b>. The photo resist layer facilitates selective removal of a portion of the etching layer <b>202</b> to form an opening <b>206</b> in the etching layer <b>202</b>. Subsequently, the substrate <b>200</b> is etched to create a predetermined pattern. In the illustrated embodiment, a hexagonal shape <b>208</b> is formed by controlled etching. Suitable etching may include wet etching, or chemical etching. The etching may be isotropic or anisotropic etching depending on the predetermined shape of the etched pattern. Next, the etching layer <b>202</b> and the photo resist layer <b>204</b> are removed. Subsequently, a first seed layer <b>210</b> comprising for example, titanium, is deposited on the etched pattern. The first seed layer <b>210</b> promotes adhesion and also promotes removal of the seed layers from the substrate during later stages of the processing. The second seed layer <b>212</b> is deposited on the first layer. The second seed layer <b>212</b> facilitates electroplating. The second seed layer <b>212</b> comprises a conductive metal, such as copper. After depositing the two seed layers <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>, one more coating of the material of the first seed layer <b>210</b> is deposited to form a layer <b>213</b>. Subsequently, the metal layer <b>214</b> may be deposited in the pattern <b>208</b> by electroplating and the seed layers <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> may be removed thereafter. As illustrated, the layer <b>214</b> acquires a shape similar to the shape <b>208</b>, thereby producing solid electrodes with different cross-sections.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates a method of forming a composite electrode, such as the electrode illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, having both a solid electrode and nanostructures. The method of this example begins by providing a structure <b>216</b>. The structure <b>216</b> is for illustrative purposes and various alternatives of the structure <b>216</b> may be used in the referenced method. In the illustrated embodiment, the structure <b>216</b> comprises a plurality of tapered needles <b>218</b> coupled together by a common base <b>220</b>. In some embodiments, such a structure <b>216</b> may be formed by laser drilling. The needles <b>218</b> may comprise silicon or any other suitable material. Also provided is a substrate <b>222</b> with a sacrificial layer <b>224</b>. The substrate <b>222</b> may be made of ceramic, polymer, glass, or semiconductor material. The sacrificial layer <b>224</b> is configured to deform permanently upon application of pressure. The sacrificial layer <b>224</b> may include a polymer. The sacrificial layer <b>224</b> may either be directly deposited on the substrate <b>222</b> or may be formed separately and then coupled to the substrate <b>222</b>. The structure <b>216</b> is then disposed on the substrate <b>222</b> having the sacrificial layer <b>224</b> such that the needles <b>218</b> penetrate into the sacrificial layer <b>224</b> when the pressure is applied on the structure <b>216</b>. Subsequently, the structure <b>216</b> is removed from the substrate <b>222</b> and a sacrificial layer <b>224</b> is obtained which replicates the pattern of the structure <b>216</b> and forms cavities <b>226</b> in the sacrificial layer <b>224</b>. Subsequently, a seed layer <b>228</b> having three layers <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> is deposited on the sacrificial layer <b>224</b>. In one example, the layers <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> are made of titanium, copper and titanium, respectively. The cavities <b>226</b> are then filled with a material <b>236</b> suitable for use in solid electrodes as noted above. The cavities <b>226</b> may be filled by employing electroplating.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Subsequently, the seed layer <b>228</b> is removed from the portions of the polymer layer that are outside the cavities <b>226</b>. An adhesion-promoting layer <b>238</b> is deposited on the exposed portions of the sacrificial layer <b>224</b>, as illustrated. The adhesion-promoting layer <b>238</b> may include titanium. Further, an aluminum layer <b>240</b> is deposited on the adhesion-promoting layer <b>238</b>. The aluminum layer <b>240</b> is configured to form pores upon anodization. The layer <b>240</b> may also employ any other metal other than aluminum which is capable of forming pores upon anodization. The aluminum layer <b>240</b> is anodized and the pores <b>242</b> so formed are filled with a conductive material, such as silver, platinum, gold, noble metals, or any other metal which may be suitable for use in nanostructures. The pores <b>242</b> may be filled by dipping the aluminum layer <b>240</b> in a bath of the conductive material. Subsequently, the base layer <b>244</b> is deposited by electroplating. The substrate <b>222</b> and the sacrificial layer <b>224</b> are then decoupled from the rest of the structure. The decoupling may be done by dissolving the sacrificial layer. The sacrificial layer may be dissolved by wet etching. Subsequently, anodized aluminum layer <b>240</b> is dissolved by etchants as noted above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>. The dissolution of the anodized layer <b>240</b> yields nanostructures <b>246</b> that are coupled to the base layer <b>244</b>.</p>
