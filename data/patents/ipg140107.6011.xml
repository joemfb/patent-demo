<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The embodiments described herein relate to a semiconductor memory apparatus, and more particularly, to a local skew detecting circuit for implementation in a semiconductor memory apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a design rule in the fabrication of semiconductor memory apparatus, it is important to monitor certain characteristic changes that can occur as the size of the wafer and the wafer process are reduced. In particular, a critical dimension (CD) of a transistor is an important factor that must be accounted for in the layout of a semiconductor apparatus. The critical dimension (CD) is a minimum dimension required in a width of a pattern that is formed on the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Two types of skew can effect the fabrication of a semiconductor memory apparatus: local skew, which is generated in relation to a single chip; and global skew which will have a different characteristic for each wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Global skew typically refers to distortions or changes in the physical characteristics of transistors that result from changes in PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature) during the fabrication of the wafer. The global skew can create different signal skews for each chip on the wafer. The local skew means that the signal skew is different among circuits of the same function according to the locations (i.e. center, right, and left) in a chip. That is, the critical dimension (CD) of the gate width and the threshold voltage (Vt) are changed according to a location in a chip in the semiconductor memory apparatus, which changes the operating parameters for, e.g., a MOS transistor according to the location.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, even circuits that perform the same function, and have the same operating characteristics may behave differently according to the locations thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A local skew detecting circuit for a semiconductor memory apparatus can detect operation characteristics of similar circuits at different locations.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one aspect, there is provided a local skew detecting circuit for a semiconductor apparatus. The local skew detecting circuit can include a reference delay block located on a center of the semiconductor apparatus, the reference delay block being configured to receive a predetermined signal and generate a reference delay signal by delaying the predetermined signal by a delay time and a first timing detecting block located on a first edge of the semiconductor apparatus, the first timing detecting block being configured to receive the predetermined signal, generate a first delay signal by delaying the predetermined signal by the delay time, and detect a first enable timing order of the reference delay signal and the first delay signal to generate a first detection signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The semiconductor apparatus can include a reference delay block configured to receive a predetermined signal and generate a reference delay signal by delaying the predetermined signal by a delay time, a first timing detecting block configured to receive the predetermined signal, generate a first delay signal by delaying the predetermined signal by the delay time, and detect a first enable timing order of the reference delay signal and the first delay signal to generate a first detection signal and a first signal control block configured to compensate setup/hold time of a first input signal according to the first detection signal, and generate a first output signal.</p>

The signal input unit <b>111</b> can include first and second SR flip-flops SR F/F<b>1</b> and SR F/F<b>2</b>.

The signal input unit <b>111</b> can be configured to generate the fast signal &#x2018;FASTS&#x2019; and the slow signal &#x2018;SLOWS&#x2019;, respectively, based on whether the left delay signal &#x2018;LDLY&#x2019; goes high before the reference delay signal &#x2018;DLY_REF&#x2019;. This can be explained with the aid of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the left delay signal &#x2018;LDLY&#x2019; transits high level before the reference delay signal &#x2018;DLY_REF&#x2019;, the first SR flip-flop SR F/F<b>1</b> is set at the rising edge of the reference delay signal &#x2018;DLY_REF&#x2019;. However, the first SR flip-flop SR F/F<b>1</b> cannot be reset, because the rising timing of the left delay signal &#x2018;LDLY&#x2019; is earlier than the rising timing of the reference delay signal &#x2018;DLY_REF&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Accordingly, the first SR flip-flop SR F/F<b>1</b> outputs a slow signal &#x2018;SLOWS&#x2019; that transitions from a &#x2018;low&#x2019; level to a &#x2018;high&#x2019; level at a rising edge of the reference delay signal &#x2018;DLY_REF&#x2019; and is then maintained at a &#x2018;high&#x2019; level.

Accordingly, the second SR flip-flop SR F/F<b>2</b> outputs a fast signal &#x2018;FASTS&#x2019;, which transitions from a &#x2018;low&#x2019; level to a &#x2018;high&#x2019; level when the slow signal &#x2018;SLOWS&#x2019; transitions to a &#x2018;high&#x2019; level, but then transitions low again. The fast signal &#x2018;FASTS&#x2019; will have a pulse width in this scenario that corresponds to a delay time from when the left delay signal &#x2018;LDLY&#x2019; transits high level to when the reference delay signal &#x2018;DLY_REF&#x2019; transits high level.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when The left delay signal &#x2018;LDLY&#x2019; goes high after the reference delay signal &#x2018;DLY_REF&#x2019;, then the first SR flip-flop SR F/F<b>1</b> will be set when the reference delay signal &#x2018;DLY_REF&#x2019; goes from a &#x2018;low&#x2019; level to a &#x2018;high&#x2019; level. The first SR flip-flop SR F/F<b>1</b> is reset when the left delay signal &#x2018;LDLY&#x2019; transitions to a &#x2018;high&#x2019; level, which causes the slow signal &#x2018;SLOWS&#x2019; to transition from a &#x2018;high&#x2019; level back to a &#x2018;low&#x2019; level. Thus, the slow signal &#x2018;SLOWS&#x2019; has a pulse width in this scenario that is equal to the delay between when the reference delay signal &#x2018;DLY_REF&#x2019; transits high level and when the left delay signal &#x2018;LDLY&#x2019; transits high level.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this scenario, the second flip-flop SR F/F<b>2</b> cannot be reset after transitioning to a &#x2018;high&#x2019; level when the left delay signal &#x2018;LDLY&#x2019; transitions from a &#x2018;low&#x2019; level to a &#x2018;high&#x2019; level. Therefore, the second flip-flop SR F/F<b>2</b> outputs a fast signal &#x2018;FASTS&#x2019; that is maintained at a &#x2018;high&#x2019; level.</p>

Accordingly, a detailed description of the left delay unit <b>120</b> and the center delay unit <b>220</b> will be omitted. However, it will be understood that the left delay unit <b>120</b>, the center delay unit <b>220</b>, and the right delay unit <b>320</b> can have different delay characteristics according to delay elements and wiring lines.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the right delay unit <b>320</b> can include a third NAND gate ND<b>3</b> and a plurality of inverters IV&#x3c;1:n&#x3e;. The third NAND gate ND<b>3</b> can be supplied with a power supply voltage VDD and the test signal &#x2018;TM&#x2019;, on which it can perform a NAND operation and generate an output signal passed to the first inverter IV<b>1</b>. The first inverter IV<b>1</b> receives the output signal of the third NAND gate ND<b>3</b>, inverts it, and generates an output signal to be applied to the second inverter IV<b>2</b>, and so on through the n inverters. As can be seen, the plurality of inverters IV&#x3c;1:n&#x3e; are connected in series. Also, each inverter has a specified delay time. Thus, connected the inverters in series in this manner provides a predetermined delay time.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it can be seen that the left delay signal &#x2018;LDLY&#x2019;, the right delay signal &#x2018;RDLY&#x2019;, and the reference delay signal &#x2018;DLY_REF&#x2019; are therefore generated from the same test signal &#x2018;TM&#x2019; using the same delay. Accordingly, if the circuit characteristics were the same, then these signals would all transition at the same time. But due to the local skew described above, the circuit characteristics will vary by location. These variations will cause the signals to transition at different times, depending on the location, and these differences can be detected as described above, and communicated via the first and second, left and right delay signals, &#x2018;LDET<b>1</b>&#x2019;, &#x2018;LDET<b>2</b>&#x2019;, &#x2018;RDET<b>1</b>&#x2019;, and &#x2018;RDET<b>2</b>&#x2019;, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, the local skew detecting circuit <b>101</b> can detect that the local skew generated for each location in the chip due to, e.g., changes in the gate width CD or the threshold voltage Vt, which as explained can have different characteristics for different locations, even in the same circuit or chip. Therefore, the local skew detecting circuit <b>101</b> can then generate the detection signals, which are generated by detecting the characteristic change for the locations (i.e. center, right, and left) in the chip, and provide them, e.g., to a setup/hold time circuit, such as the first and second compensating block <b>400</b> and <b>500</b>, which can be configured to compensate for the characteristic change, thereby allowing the characteristics for each location in the same circuit to be the same.</p>
