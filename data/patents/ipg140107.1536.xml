<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">Patent Document 2 and Patent Document 3 discloses a ring cam, hydraulic pistons and cylinders that constitute a hydraulic pump. However, neither of the documents proposes specifically how to mount these parts with respect to a main shaft of a wind turbine, or how to perform the mounting process in a simplified manner, or a structure suitable for mounting the unit to the main shaft and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">Further, none of Patent Documents discloses a detailed structure of the hydraulic pump such as the arrangement of a pump bearing for supporting the hydraulic pump to the main shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">Therefore, it is necessary to make improvements so as to provide a simple structure which performs the mounting process with ease. By this, it is possible to reduce the number of steps of mounting the hydraulic pump with respect to the main shaft, reduce the cost of performing the mounting process.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">In view of the issues above, an object of the present invention is to provide a hydraulic pump structure which improves the ease of mounting the hydraulic pump on the main shaft of a wind turbine generator or a tidal current generator, and a method of mounting the hydraulic pump which can be performed in a simplified manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">To achieve the object, a first aspect of the present invention is a hydraulic pump structure for a wind turbine generator or a tidal current generator which comprises a hub equipped with a plurality of blades, a main shaft connected to the hub and a hydraulic pump mounted on the main shaft, the hydraulic pump structure comprising: a hydraulic pump unit in which the hydraulic pump is unitized by a cylindrical member which is fit into an outer circumference of the main shaft and a hydraulic pump body which is arranged on an outer circumferential side of the cylindrical member, wherein the hydraulic pump body comprises: a ring cam which is mounted on the outer circumference of the cylindrical member; a pump bearing; a pump housing which is provided rotatably with respect to the cylindrical member via the pump bearing and is fixed to a body side of the wind turbine generator or the tidal current generator; a plurality of pistons which are housed in the pump housing and is actuated by the ring cam that is rotated with the main shaft; and a plurality of cylinders which guide the plurality of pistons in a radial direction and are arranged in a circumferential direction, and wherein the hydraulic pump unit is configured such that the pump unit is insertably fixed to the main shaft by the cylindrical member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">According to the first aspect of the present invention, the hydraulic pump unit is configured such that the hydraulic pump is unitized by the cylindrical member which is fit onto an outer circumference of the main shaft and the hydraulic pump body, wherein the hydraulic pump body comprises: the ring cam mounted on the outer circumference of the cylindrical member; the pump bearing; the pump housing provided rotatably with respect to the cylindrical member via the pump bearing and fixed to the body side of the wind turbine generator or the tidal current generator; the plurality of pistons housed in the pump housing and actuated by the ring cam that is rotated with the main shaft; and the plurality of cylinders which guide the plurality of pistons in the radial direction and are arranged in the circumferential direction, and wherein the hydraulic pump unit is configured such that the pump unit is insertably fixed to the main shaft by the cylindrical member, and the hydraulic pump unit is constituted of the cylindrical member and the hydraulic pump body which is arranged on an outer circumferential side of the cylindrical member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Specifically, the hydraulic pump unit is formed including the cylindrical member and the hydraulic pump unit is inserted onto the main shaft via the cylindrical member, thereby improving the ease of mounting the hydraulic pump unit to the main shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">Further, the performance of the hydraulic pump can be checked per unit before mounting the hydraulic pump to the main shaft. The performance of the hydraulic pump can be firmly ensured to improve the reliability of the product.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">In such a conventional case that the hydraulic pump is mounted on the main shaft while being assembled, the completed hydraulic pump is already mounted on the main shaft as an actual machine, and thus a detailed confirmation test of the hydraulic pump is hard to perform due to restrictions on items that can be tested of the performance test and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">Further, it is preferable in the first aspect of the present invention that the main shaft has a stepped portion with a reduced diameter, and a tip section of the cylindrical member of the hydraulic pump unit comes in contact with the stepped portion so as to position the hydraulic pump unit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">As described above, the tip section of the cylindrical member of the hydraulic pump unit comes in contact with the stepped portion of the main shaft so as to position the hydraulic pump unit. As a result, the positioning becomes easier in the steps such as inserting the hydraulic pump unit onto the main shaft and thus, the workability of the mounting process and the precision and stability of positioning the unit are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">Further, it is also preferable in the first aspect of the present invention that the cylindrical member is fixed to the main shaft by any one of a shrink disk connection, a flange coupling, a key connection and an involute spline connection.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">As described above, the cylindrical member can be fixed to the main shaft by a shrink disk connection, a flange coupling, a key connection or an involute spline connection other than a simple method of inserting and fitting the cylindrical member onto the main shaft. As a result, the fixing of the cylindrical member with respect to the main shaft is further secured.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">Furthermore, it is also preferable in the first aspect of the present invention that the cylindrical member has a large diameter section and small diameter sections disposed on both ends of the large diameter section, the ring cam is arranged on an outer circumferential side of the large diameter section, the pump bearing is mounted on stepped portions between the large diameter section and the small diameter sections.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">With the above structure of the cylindrical member having a large diameter section and small diameter sections disposed on both ends of the large diameter section, the pump bearings supporting pump housing on the cylindrical member are respectively mounted on stepped portions between the large diameter section and the small diameter sections. As a result, the positioning of the pump bearing is made easy and it becomes more stable at the mounting position.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0075">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the main shaft <b>12</b> with a hollow structure forms, from a hub side, a hub mount section <b>40</b>, a first stepped portion <b>42</b> with a reduced diameter and a second stepped portion <b>44</b> with a reduced diameter and the diameter of the main shaft <b>12</b> is reduced in the order of a first diameter D<b>1</b>, a second diameter D<b>2</b> and a third diameter D<b>3</b> in this order in a step pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">The hydraulic pump <b>10</b> is mounted at a location having the second diameter D<b>2</b>. A cylindrical member <b>46</b> is fit into an outer circumference of the second diameter D<b>2</b>. The cylindrical member <b>46</b> comprises a large diameter section <b>48</b> and small diameter sections <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> disposed on both ends of the large diameter section <b>48</b>. A ring cam <b>52</b> is mounted on the outer circumference of the large diameter section <b>48</b> and pump bearings <b>54</b>, <b>54</b> are mounted on stepped portions between the large diameter section <b>48</b> and the small diameter sections <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">(Hydraulic Pump Structure)</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">A detailed structure of the hydraulic pump <b>10</b> (hydraulic pump unit) is explained in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The ring cam <b>52</b> is fixed to the outer circumference of the large diameter section of the cylindrical part <b>46</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the ring cam <b>52</b> is formed by mounting a plurality of cam pieces <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b</i>, etc. on the outer circumferential side of the large diameter section <b>48</b> of the cylindrical part <b>47</b> in the circumferential direction thereof by means of pins <b>55</b> or bolts (not shown). A plurality of the ring cams <b>52</b> may be arranged in the axial direction. The preferred embodiment shows an exemplary case wherein four ring cams <b>52</b> are arranged on the large diameter section of the cylindrical part <b>47</b>. But the number of ring cams can be adequately changed depending on the capacity of the hydraulic pump.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">Further, the ring cam <b>52</b> may have a cam surface defining a plurality of waves but not limited thereto. The ring cam <b>52</b> may be an eccentric cam that has a uniform cam surface and is disposed eccentrically with respect to a shaft center of the main shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">The piston <b>58</b> supports a roller <b>56</b> arranged on the bottom thereof as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The roller <b>56</b> comes in contact with the cam surface of the ring cam <b>52</b>. The piston <b>58</b> moves slidingly in the cylinder <b>60</b> to guide the roller along the cam surface. Further, the cylinders <b>60</b> are arranged in the radial direction with respect to the shaft center of the main shaft <b>12</b> and radially arranged in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the rollers <b>56</b> come in contact with the cam surface formed on the outer circumference of the ring cam <b>52</b>. In conjunction with the rotation of the main shaft <b>12</b>, the pistons move inward and outward along the cam surface of the ring cam <b>52</b>. During this process, the operating oil is repeatedly introduced to or discharged from a pressure chamber inside each of the cylinders <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">A low pressure control valve <b>64</b> is arranged in an intake line to the pressure chamber <b>62</b> to allow the inflow of oil to the pressure chamber <b>62</b>. Each low pressure control valve <b>64</b> is controlled to determine whether each corresponding pressure chamber operates as a pump or not (the low pressure control valve <b>64</b> is closed at the point of maximum volume to function as a pump and left open to disable the function as the pump), and thus the outflow volume of the oil is controlled. Further, a high pressure control valve <b>66</b> is arranged in a discharge line to permit discharge of the oil to the high pressure line <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">The above discharge control of the pressure chamber <b>62</b> in the cylinder <b>60</b> is performed respectively for each of the plurality of cylinders arranged in the circumferential direction. The rest of the ring cams <b>52</b>, the rollers <b>56</b> and the pistons for each of the remaining ring cams and the cylinders <b>60</b> are arranged so as to operate in the same manner as the above. A controller (not shown) is arranged to control the state of each of the cylinders <b>60</b> for each array between a working state or disabled state so as to control a pressure and an amount of the discharge oil to be supplied from the cylinders <b>60</b> to the hydraulic motor <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">Each of the cylinders <b>60</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>60</b> are supported in the pump housing <b>34</b> by a cylinder supporting member <b>68</b>. The cylinder supporting member <b>68</b> has an intake line and a discharge line formed therein to communicate with the pressure chamber <b>62</b> of each of the cylinders <b>60</b> and houses the low pressure control valves <b>64</b> and the high pressure control valves <b>66</b>. Further, each of the cylinders <b>60</b> may be directly formed in the cylinder supporting member <b>68</b>. Specifically, the cylinder supporting member <b>68</b> may be configured such that the cylinders are formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">Furthermore, the low pressure control valve <b>64</b> is configured such that the operating oil is supplied from a low pressure oil line <b>65</b> formed outside of the cylinder supporting member <b>68</b> to the low pressure control valve <b>64</b>, and the high pressure control valve <b>69</b> is configured such that the operating oil having been compressed in the pressure chamber <b>62</b> is discharged from the high pressure control valve to the hydraulic motor <b>14</b> side via a high pressure oil line <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">The pump housing <b>34</b> is constituted of a front side wall <b>70</b>, a rear side wall <b>72</b> and a outer circumferential wall <b>74</b> and formed into a cylindrical shape having a top and a bottom. To the rear side wall <b>72</b>, hydraulic pipes and so on are connected so that the pipes communicate with each line formed in the cylinder supporting member <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">The front side wall <b>70</b> and the rear side wall <b>72</b> are respectively supported at inner circumference parts thereof by the pump bearings <b>54</b>, <b>54</b> mounted on the stepped portions between the large diameter section <b>48</b> and the small diameter sections <b>50</b> of the cylindrical member <b>46</b>. And thus, the pump housing <b>34</b> is rotatably mounted on the cylindrical member <b>46</b>. Further, the pump housing <b>34</b> is fixed to the frame <b>22</b> of the nacelle <b>4</b> via the torque arm <b>36</b> which is disposed on an outer side of the pump housing <b>34</b>. For example, the torque arm <b>36</b> couples to the rear side wall <b>72</b>. In other embodiments the torque arm <b>36</b> might couple to the front side wall <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">As described above, the pump bearings <b>54</b>, <b>54</b> are respectively mounted on the stepped portions between the large diameter section <b>38</b> and the small diameter sections. Thus, the positioning of the pump bearings <b>54</b>, <b>54</b> is easier and the mounting position of the pump bearings <b>54</b>, <b>54</b> is stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">Further, the front side wall <b>70</b> and the rear side wall <b>72</b> of the pump housing <b>34</b> are respectively guided and arranged against the stepped portions between the large diameter section <b>48</b> and the small diameter sections <b>50</b>. Specifically, the front side wall <b>70</b> and the rear side wall <b>72</b> of the pump housing <b>34</b> slidingly contact the surfaces of the stepped portions between the large diameter section <b>48</b> and the small diameter sections <b>50</b> to be arranged there and thus, the pump housing <b>34</b> can be firmly arranged around the main shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">As described above, the pump housing <b>34</b> is secured to the first frame part <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the nacelle <b>4</b> via the torque arm <b>36</b> and the damper mechanism <b>38</b>. Thus, the rotation of the main shaft <b>12</b> generates the relative difference of the rotation speed between the pump housing <b>34</b> and the cylindrical member <b>46</b>. The hydraulic pump mechanism operated by the relative difference of the rotation, is formed in the pump housing <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">A hydraulic pump body <b>76</b> is arranged on the outer circumferential side of the cylindrical member. The hydraulic pump body <b>76</b> is constituted of the ring cams <b>52</b> mounted on the outer circumference of the cylindrical member <b>46</b>, the pump bearings <b>54</b>, the pump housing <b>34</b> supported rotatably with respect to the cylindrical part <b>46</b> via the pump bearings <b>54</b> and fixed to the nacelle <b>4</b> side, the pistons <b>58</b> housed in the pump housing <b>34</b> and actuated by the ring cam <b>52</b> rotated by the rotation of the main shaft <b>12</b>, the plurality of cylinders <b>60</b> guiding the pistons <b>58</b> in the radial direction and arranged in the circumferential direction and the cylinder supporting member <b>68</b> supporting the cylinders <b>60</b> and having the oil lines formed therein. The hydraulic pump is the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> constituted of the cylindrical member <b>46</b> and the hydraulic pump body <b>76</b> on the outer circumference of the cylindrical member <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">Further, a tip section of the tip of the cylindrical member <b>46</b> comes in contact with the stepped portion <b>42</b> so as to position the cylindrical member <b>46</b>. The cylindrical member <b>46</b> is fixed to the main shaft <b>12</b> by a shrink disk connection <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">Furthermore, the cylindrical member <b>46</b> may be fixed to the main shaft <b>12</b> by a flange coupling, a key connection, an involute spline connection or the like. With this connection structure, the cylindrical member <b>46</b> can be not only press fit with respect to the main shaft <b>12</b> but also securely fixed to the main shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">(Mounting Process)</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">In the above structure of the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b>, the main shaft <b>12</b>, the first main shaft bearing <b>20</b> and the second main shaft bearing <b>21</b>, a method of mounting the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b>, the first main shaft bearing <b>20</b> and the second main shaft bearing <b>21</b> on the main shaft <b>12</b> is explained in reference to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">First, in a step S<b>1</b> the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> is assembled in advance in a preliminary step. The hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> here refers to a completed hydraulic pump <b>10</b> which is already assembled by fitting therein the hydraulic pump body <b>76</b> which is to be arranged on the outer circumferential side of the cylindrical member <b>46</b> as described above. The hydraulic pump should be assembled before being mounted on the main shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095">Next, in a step S<b>2</b> the first main shaft bearing <b>20</b> which rotatably secures the main shaft to the first frame part <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the nacelle <b>4</b>, is insertably fixed to the main shaft <b>12</b>. Specifically, the main shaft <b>12</b> is placed upright and the first main shaft bearing <b>20</b> is pressed from above onto a section having the first diameter D<b>1</b> of the main shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096">In a step S<b>3</b>, the hydraulic pump unit already assembled in the step S<b>1</b>, is pressed onto the main shaft <b>12</b> from above so that the inner circumferential part of the cylindrical member <b>46</b> is fit to a section having the second diameter D<b>2</b> of the main shaft <b>12</b>. Meanwhile, the tip section of the cylindrical part <b>46</b> contacts a first stepped portion <b>42</b> to be positioned there, thereby making the mounting position precise and stable.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">In a step S<b>4</b> the hydraulic pump is unitized with respect to the main shaft <b>12</b> by fixing the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> to the main shaft <b>12</b> by means of a fixing member. The fixing member may be the shrink disk connection <b>80</b> described above so as to secure the cylindrical member <b>46</b> to the main shaft <b>12</b>. By this, the fixing of the cylindrical member <b>46</b> to the main shaft <b>12</b> is further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">In a step S<b>5</b> the second main shaft bearing <b>21</b> is insertably fixed to the main shaft <b>12</b>. During the step, front end portion of the second main shaft bearing <b>21</b> comes in contact with the second stepped portion <b>44</b> and positioned. Thus, the mounting position becomes more precise and stable.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">Then, in a step S<b>6</b> the main shaft <b>12</b> is fixed to the nacelle <b>4</b> in such a state that the first main shaft bearing <b>20</b>, the second main shaft bearing <b>21</b> and the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> are mounted on the main shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100">In the step of fixing the main shaft <b>12</b> to the nacelle <b>4</b> on the body side of the wind turbine generator or the tidal current generator, the pump housing <b>34</b> of the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> is fixed to the nacelle <b>4</b> on the body side of the wind turbine generator or the tidal current generator via a damper mechanism <b>38</b> which has a damping effect against vibration and prevents deformation of the pump housing <b>34</b> and an assembling difference while maintaining an axial center of the pump housing <b>34</b> of the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> with respect to the nacelle <b>4</b>, and the damper mechanism <b>38</b> is mounted on a flange portion <b>26</b> protruding in a radial direction from both side of the torque arm <b>36</b> arranged on an outer circumference of the pump housing <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">Therefore, the pump housing <b>34</b> is fixed to the nacelle via the damper mechanism <b>38</b> and thus, the deformation and the assembling difference can be prevented while mounting the pump housing <b>34</b> to the nacelle <b>4</b> and further a damping effect is exerted against the vibration from the hydraulic pump side.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102">In this manner, the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> is formed by unitizing the hydraulic pump including the cylindrical member <b>46</b> and the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> is insertable onto the main shaft <b>12</b> via the cylindrical member <b>46</b>, thereby improving the ease of mounting the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> to the main shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0103">Further, the performance of the hydraulic pump can be checked per unit before mounting the hydraulic pump to the main shaft <b>12</b>. The performance of the hydraulic pump can be firmly ensured to improve the reliability of the product.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104">In such a conventional case that the hydraulic pump is mounted on the main shaft while being assembled, the completed hydraulic pump is already mounted on the main shaft as an actual machine, and thus a detailed confirmation test of the hydraulic pump is hard to perform due to the limited extent of the performance test, limited test facilities and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0105">Moreover, in this case wherein the hydraulic pump <b>10</b> is already assembled before being mounted on the main shaft, the hydraulic pump unit can be assembled in a different place and then fixed to the main shaft <b>12</b>. As a result, the restrictions on assembling facilities or test facilities are removed and the assembling of the hydraulic pump unit can be performed efficiently.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Second Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0105" num="0106">A second preferred embodiment is explained in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The main shaft of the second preferred embodiment has different structure and arrangement from that of the first preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0107">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, only the first main shaft bearing <b>90</b> is provided to support the main shaft <b>12</b> instead of both the first and second main shaft bearings in the first preferred embodiment. One main shaft bearing is provided on the hub side and the structure of the first main shaft bearing is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0108">A plurality of arrays of self-aligning roller bearings are used as the first main shaft bearing <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0109">Further, the first main shaft bearing <b>90</b> is surrounded by a first main shaft bearing cover <b>92</b> and secured onto the supporting rail <b>28</b> by a flange member <b>94</b> provided on both sides in the radial direction. The supporting rail <b>28</b> is formed along the direction of the main shaft on both sides in the width direction of the first frame part <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0110">The self-aligning roller bearing has a high radial load capability, and is capable of withstanding heavy load and impact load, being subjected to axial load in both direction to a certain extent and self-aligning itself. Thus, one self-aligning roller bearing is arranged as the first main shaft bearing <b>90</b> on the hub side and on the side opposite to the hub, the hydraulic pump unit is supported on the nacelle <b>4</b> via the pump bearings <b>54</b>, <b>54</b> of the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0111">In such a case that the main shaft <b>12</b> is supported by only the first main shaft bearing <b>90</b> as shown in the second preferred embodiment, the hydraulic pump unit can be fit onto the main shaft <b>12</b> in one step unlike the first preferred embodiment in which the pump unit is fit onto the main shaft <b>12</b> in two separate steps. As a result, the assembling process is simplified and can be performed with higher efficiency. As the second main shaft bearing is omitted, the entire structure can be smaller and lighter. Further, it is possible to remove the hydraulic pump unit from the main shaft <b>12</b> without removing any bearing from the main shaft <b>12</b>, nor removing the main shaft <b>12</b> from the supporting rail <b>28</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Third Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0111" num="0112">A third preferred embodiment is explained in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The main shaft of the third preferred embodiment has different structure and arrangement from that of the second preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a third main shaft bearing <b>100</b> and a fourth main shaft bearing <b>102</b> arranged between the pump unit <b>10</b> and the hub <b>6</b>. The third main shaft bearing <b>100</b> and the fourth main shaft bearing <b>102</b> secure the main shaft <b>12</b> rotatably on the body side of the wind turbine generator or the tidal current generator. The main shaft <b>12</b> is supported and fixed to the nacelle <b>4</b> side only by the third main shaft bearing <b>100</b> and the fourth main shaft bearing <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0114">The assembling is performed by inserting and fixing the third main shaft bearing <b>100</b> to the main shaft <b>12</b>, then inserting and fixing the fourth main shaft bearing <b>102</b> to the main shaft <b>12</b> adjacent to the third main shaft bearing <b>100</b> or with a distance from the third main shaft bearing <b>100</b>, then fitting the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> having been assembled beforehand on the main shaft <b>12</b> via the cylindrical member of the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b>, and then fixing the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> to the main shaft <b>12</b> by means of a fixing member which is a shrink disk connection <b>80</b> so as to be unitized.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0115">The third main shaft bearing <b>100</b> and the fourth main shaft bearing <b>102</b> are surrounded by a bearing cover <b>104</b> which is arranged to slide over the third main shaft bearing <b>100</b> and the fourth main shaft bearing <b>102</b> and secured onto a supporting rail <b>28</b> by a flange member <b>106</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) provided on both sides in the radial direction. The supporting rail <b>28</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is formed along the main shaft <b>12</b> on both sides in the width direction of the first frame part <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0116">According to the third preferred embodiment, prior to fitting the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> onto the main shaft <b>12</b>, the third and fourth main shaft bearings <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> are inserted and fixed to the main shaft. Specifically, two main shaft bearings are inserted but the step of inserting and fixing the main shaft bearings is performed before the step of inserting the large hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b>. Thus, the fixing of the hydraulic pump unit to the main shaft can be securely performed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0117">Further, the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> is supported on an axial end of the main shaft <b>12</b> and two main shaft bearings are arranged on the hub side. Thus, the distance for inserting the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> can be shorter and, unlike the case of the structure of the unitized hydraulic pump structure, it is easy to mount the hydraulic pump unit onto the main shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">Furthermore, the rest of the structure and operation effect is the same as the first preferred embodiment and the second preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0119">The disassembly procedure for any of the first, second and third preferred embodiments is the reverse of the assembly procedures just described. Assembly or disassembly procedures may be carried out in a factory, at a wind turbine installation side, or even after erection of the wind turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0120">As described above, the first, second and third preferred embodiments use the exemplary case in which the present invention is applied to a wind turbine generator. But the present invention is also applicable to the tidal current generator. The tidal current generator refers to a generator which is installed in places such as sea, a river and a lake, and utilizes tidal energy for power generation. The tidal current generator has the same structure as the wind turbine generator <b>1</b> except that the blade <b>8</b> is rotated by the movement of water instead of the wind.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0121">The tidal current generator comprises the main shaft <b>12</b> rotated by the tidal current, the hydraulic pump (hydraulic pump unit) <b>10</b> mounted on the main shaft <b>12</b>, the hydraulic motor <b>14</b> to which the hydraulic pressure generated by the hydraulic pump <b>10</b> is introduced and the generator <b>18</b> for generating electric power. The same reference numbers are used here to explain the components that are common to the first preferred embodiment. The hydraulic pump <b>10</b> forms a unitized hydraulic pump unit.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0122">Further, the hydraulic pump (hydraulic pump unit) <b>10</b> comprises, in the same manner as the hydraulic pump structure of the wind turbine generator <b>1</b>, a cylindrical member <b>46</b> being fit on the outer circumference of the main shaft <b>12</b> and the hydraulic pump body <b>76</b> arranged on the outer circumferential side of the cylindrical member <b>46</b>. It is possible to insert and fix the hydraulic pump unit <b>10</b> to the main shaft <b>12</b> via the cylindrical member <b>46</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0122" num="0123">According to the present invention, the hydraulic pump which is mounted on the main shaft of the wind turbine is configured so as to improve the easy of mounting the unit to the main shaft and to achieve a simplified mounting process. As a result, this can be highly applicable to a hydraulic pump of a wind turbine generator.</p>
