<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Priority is claimed from commonly assigned, U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/375,980, filed Aug. 23, 2010, entitled &#x201c;LOCKING DEVICE FOR MOBILE X-RAY SYSTEM&#x201d;, in the name of Evan P. Carmichael, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to the field of medical imaging, and in particular to portable radiographic imaging apparatus. More specifically, the invention relates to a mobile radiography apparatus including securable access to at least one portable radiographic detector.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mobile carts are employed in medical facilities to move medical equipment between locations. One type of mobile cart includes an x-ray source used to capture (e.g., digital) x-ray images on x-ray detector. Medical x-ray images can be captured using various digital or analog techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Refer also to U.S. Pat. No. 7,611,282 (Koren) and WO 2007/139638 (Jadrich), and WO 2007/078684 (Dhurjaty), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,844,961 (McEvoy).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mobile x-ray apparatus are of particular value in intensive care unit (ICU) and other environments where timely acquisition of a radiographic image is important. Because portable carts can be wheeled around the ICU or other area and brought directly to the patient's bedside, a portable x-ray imaging apparatus allows an attending physician or clinician to have recent information on the condition of a patient and helps to reduce the risks entailed in moving patients to stationary equipment in the radiological facility.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there is a need for improvements in mobile x-ray apparatus design to allow such devices to be more easily transported, deployed and/or operated.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An aspect of this application is to advance the art of mobile radiography.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Embodiments according to the application can provide various advantages for a mobile x-ray apparatus including selectable secured access to visible multiple sized portable radiographic detectors. Embodiments according to the application can provide constant accessibility to secured portable detectors at the mobile x-ray apparatus where edges of the detectors are always accessible. Further, using recessed storage (e.g., of different sizes) can reduce a volume storage requirement for the secured detectors at the mobile x-ray apparatus, which can reduce a footprint of the mobile x-ray apparatus. Additionally, recessed storage for secured detectors (e.g., preferably displaced from each other) can provide a low profile extending above a surface of the mobile x-ray apparatus. However, recessed storage can be difficult to secure and even more difficult when secured using a staggered descending profile.</p>
