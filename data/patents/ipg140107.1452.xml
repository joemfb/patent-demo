<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A connector includes an insulating seat defining a receiving cavity opening forwards, an optical module movably received in the receiving cavity and an actuating device. The optical module defines lenses at a front mating face thereof and a first touch portion at a rear face thereof. The actuating device is located behind the rear face of the optical module to urge the optical module moving forwards. The actuating device includes a spring coil and a connecting member defining a second touch portion which is urged by the spring coil to contact with the first touch portion. One of the first touch portion and the second touch portion provides a vertex and the other provides a planar so as to arrive a vertex-to-planar contact relationship between the first touch portion and the second touch portion.</p>

The second metal shell <b>22</b> bend two barbs <b>221</b> from a front edge thereof and a notch disposed in said two barbs <b>221</b>. The barbs are retained in corresponding openings <b>211</b> defined on the first metal shell <b>21</b>. The notch <b>222</b> are retained with a barb <b>212</b> defined on the first metal shell <b>21</b>. The second metal shell defines a cable retaining wing <b>223</b> at a rear edge thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the seat defines a receiving cavity <b>13</b> at a front of the lower surface <b>111</b> which separates from the terminals to receive the optical module <b>3</b> at a front thereof. The optical module <b>3</b> includes lenses <b>31</b> at a front mating surface <b>301</b>, which at a rear edge thereof connect with optical fiber cables <b>32</b> received in the grooves <b>113</b> in the lower surface of the seat. The actuating device <b>4</b> is received in a rear of the receiving cavity <b>13</b> behind the optical module. A retaining board <b>5</b> is disposed to limit the actuating device in the upper to lower direction, wherein a pair of short post <b>51</b> best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are inserted in and retained in the holes <b>114</b> and a slot <b>52</b> are used for spring coil <b>41</b>. The short posts <b>51</b> define a pair of rib <b>511</b> at an outer periphery to increase interference with the holes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The receiving cavity <b>13</b> is larger than the optical module <b>3</b> in the front-and-rear direction, so the optical module can move in the front-and-rear direction. In a free or original statute no exterior force exerted on the lenses, the optical module is forwardly biased so as to be in a front-most of the receiving cavity <b>13</b> by the actuating device <b>4</b> and limited by the V-shape notch <b>33</b> of the lens being lodged against a boss <b>131</b> projecting upright from a bottom of the receiving cavity <b>13</b> so as to prevent the optical module <b>4</b> forwardly separating from the receiving cavity <b>13</b>. When the optical module <b>3</b> is mated with a counter optical module, the optical module is driven to inwardly move wherein a rear face <b>302</b> are blocked against the inside rear wall <b>132</b> of the receiving cavity <b>13</b>. The counter module also will partially slide in the receiving cavity <b>13</b> to increase alignment of said two modules. The actuating device <b>4</b> will be introduced hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The optical module <b>4</b> project a first connecting post <b>34</b> from a middle position of the rear face <b>302</b> thereof. The first connecting post defines a convex circular surface <b>341</b> such as a hemi-sphere at a front free end thereof which is functioned as a first touch portion. The convex circular surface <b>341</b> has a vertex at a rear most thereof. The seat defines a recess <b>14</b> near to the receiving cavity <b>13</b> at the lower surface <b>111</b> and a positioning post <b>15</b> forwardly extending from a forward inside wall of the recess <b>14</b> in the front and rear direction. The positioning post <b>15</b> does not arrive to the inside rear face <b>132</b> of the receiving cavity. The recess <b>14</b> is shaped with semi-cylinder inside face. A spring coil <b>41</b> is set in the recess <b>14</b> and connects with the positioning post <b>15</b> at one end thereof. A connecting member <b>42</b> includes a large head <b>422</b> and a cylinder second connecting post <b>421</b>. The head <b>422</b> is constructed with a plane top face <b>423</b> which is functioned as a second touch portion. The second connecting post <b>421</b> connects with another end of the spring coil <b>41</b>. The spring coil <b>41</b> and the connecting member <b>42</b> are commonly formed as said actuating device. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first touch portion is just pressed against a second touch portion biasing by the spring coil <b>41</b> to arrive a contact relationship of the actuating device and the optical module. The elastic force of the spring coil <b>41</b> pushes the optical module <b>3</b> to separate from the inside rear face <b>132</b> of the receiving cavity with a distance which is called said original statute. In response to the optical module <b>3</b> shifted rearward by the counter optical module, the first touch portion pressing against the second touch portion <b>423</b> urge the spring coil <b>41</b> rearwards move so that the optical module has forward moving tendency. Please notes, the spring coil <b>41</b> is just slidingly located in the recess <b>14</b> to arrive an only front-and-rear shift. The inside walls <b>141</b> at two side of the positioning post <b>15</b> benefit the spring coiling in the positioning post.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As aforementioned, a vertex-planar contact pattern of the first and the second touch portion is formed to decrease lateral decomposed forces, thereby avoiding undesired skew of the optical module <b>3</b>. A small skew of the first connecting post <b>34</b> also will be revised by the spring coil <b>41</b>. Combination with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the forward slot <b>52</b> of the retaining board <b>5</b> allows the spring coil shift therein with no inference or a small interfere. The dimension of the second connecting post <b>421</b> and the positioning post <b>15</b> along the front and rear direction should match spring coil <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an approximate embodiment of the first embodiment. The second connecting post <b>421</b> of the actuating device <b>4</b> becomes smaller, while the positioning post <b>151</b> becomes larger to define a hole <b>151</b> to receive the second connecting post <b>421</b>, thereby arriving a fitly connection between second connecting post, spring coil and the positioning post. The second connecting post <b>421</b> slides in the holes <b>151</b> in the front and rear direction. Alternatively, the second connecting post can designed larger to define said hole <b>151</b> which is inserted with a smaller positioning post <b>421</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Other embodiments will be given hereinafter wherein same constructs will omit.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> show a second embodiment of the present invention. The rear face <b>302</b> of optical module <b>3</b> is shaped in a planar and provides a first touch portion. The head <b>422</b> of the connecting member <b>42</b> is shaped with a circular surface <b>423</b> at a front free end thereof which is functioned as a second touch portion. The second touch portion has a vertex at a front most thereof. Therefore, a vertex-to-planar contact relationship is formed by the optical module <b>3</b> and the actuating device <b>4</b>. The spring coil <b>41</b> is engaged with the second connecting post <b>421</b> and the positioning post <b>15</b> at two ends thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an approximate embodiment of the second embodiment. The second connecting post <b>421</b> becomes larger so that the second connecting post <b>421</b> is same to the head in diameter. The enlarged second connecting post opens a hole <b>4211</b> to be inserted with the positioning post <b>15</b>. Besides the circular surface, the second touch portion can be formed by a cone or dimples projecting from a planar surface.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> showing a third embodiment of the present invention, the connecting member <b>43</b> is construed with a ball which is located at one end of the spring coil <b>41</b>. An opposite side of the ball to a position connecting with the spring coil provides a second touch portion <b>433</b>. The rear face <b>302</b> of the optical module <b>3</b> provides a first touch portion. Therefore, a vertex-to-planar contact relationship also is formed. The receiving cavity <b>13</b> defines a recessed groove <b>133</b> at a bottom face thereof to accommodate with parts of the ball to limit the ball's movement.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>showing a forth embodiment of the present invention. The rear face <b>302</b> of the optical module project a cylinder second connecting post <b>34</b> which has a concave circular surface <b>345</b> at free end. The a concave circular surface <b>345</b> is functioned as a first touch portion. The head <b>422</b> of the connecting member <b>42</b> has a convex circular surface <b>423</b> which is functioned as a second touch portion <b>4221</b>. Therefore the first touch portion and the second touch portion is constructed with face-to-face contact pattern. A multi-direction contact relationship is formed between the optical module and the actuating device through the face-to-face contact. The multi-direction contact also can decrease lateral decomposed forces, thereby avoiding undesired skew of the optical module <b>3</b>.</p>
