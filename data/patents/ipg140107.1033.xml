<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed generally to keepsake arrangements and in particular, to an improved keepsake arrangement that utilizes a seal for sealing an impressible material and a pressfitted and/or otherwise releasably coupleable frame to assist in keeping the impressible material in the cavity once the seal is removed. In this way, and with the preferred embodiments set forth herein, an improved and more user friendly keepsake arrangement is provided. An improved method of making a keepsake utilizing an improved keepsake arrangement is also provided.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Keepsake arrangements are known in the art. One such arrangement is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,591,565. In particular, this '565 patent describes the use of clay that is kept impressible while inside a receptacle. Prior to making an impression in the clay, a moisture proof cover is removed. However, after the impression is made, the receptacle containing the clay must be clamped to the back of a frame using a plurality of components, such as clamping elements, nuts and bolts. In addition, the arrangement as described depends in part on the pressure of the hand (or other) print for causing the clay to sufficiently be displaced so as to rise above the edges of the pan. Among other things, such an arrangement is perceived to be cumbersome, time-consuming and/or less than very easy to construct and hence, less than very user friendly. Accordingly, deficiencies in the art are believed to exist.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is thus desirable to overcome the deficiencies in the prior art. For example, it would be advantageous and desirable to provide a keepsake arrangement that is easy to use, that can be easily and quickly constructed and that is aesthetically pleasing. Such a construction and method of use is provided by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is thus evident that the present invention overcomes the perceived deficiencies in the prior art noted above and further achieves the aforementioned and below mentioned objectives.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY AND OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a keepsake arrangement that overcomes the deficiencies in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a keepsake arrangement that is easy to use, that can be easily and quickly constructed and that is aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, another objective of the present invention is to provide a keepsake that can be quickly created, does not require complicated assembly components and is very easily and quickly ready to provide to the person desiring the keepsake memorabilia.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another objective is to provide such a keepsake arrangement that can be economically manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still a further objective is to provide a keepsake arrangement that can act as a shadow box for aesthetics.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of making a keepsake using the keepsake arrangement as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combination of elements, arrangement of parts and sequence of steps which will be exemplified in the construction, illustration and description hereinafter set forth, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Generally speaking, in accordance with the present invention, an improved keepsake arrangement and method of making a keepsake is provided. In a first embodiment, the keepsake arrangement comprises a cavity defined by at least one cavity wall, the cavity having an opening; an impressible material disposed in the cavity; a seal, sealingly coupled to a lip about the cavity, for sealing the impressible material in the cavity and for maintaining moisture in the impressible material while the seal is sealingly coupled to the lip about the cavity; a frame releasably coupleable to at least a portion of the lip that extends about the cavity, the frame comprising a shoulder section that extends over at least part of the opening when the frame is coupled to the at least one cavity wall; wherein the shoulder section is dimensioned to assist in retaining the impressible material in the cavity when the seal is removed from the lip about the cavity and the moisture is removed from the impressible material.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an alternative embodiment, the keepsake arrangement comprises a cavity defined by at least one cavity wall, the cavity having an opening; an impressible material disposed in the cavity; a seal, sealingly coupled to a lip about the cavity, for sealing the impressible material in the cavity and for maintaining moisture in the impressible material while the seal is sealingly coupled to the lip about the cavity; a frame pressfittedly coupleable to at least a portion of the lip that extends about the cavity, the frame comprising a shoulder section that extends over at least part of the opening when the frame is coupled to the at least one cavity wall; wherein the shoulder section is dimensioned to assist in retaining the impressible material in the cavity when the seal is removed from the lip about the cavity and the moisture is removed from the impressible material.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In yet another embodiment, a method of making a keepsake utilizing a keepsake arrangement as disclosed herein is provided. In such a preferred embodiment, the method comprises the steps of removing the seal from the lip about the cavity; making an impression in the impressible material; and coupling the frame to the at least portion of the lip; whereby the shoulder section assists in retaining the impressible material in the cavity when the seal is removed from the lip about the cavity and the moisture is removed from the impressible material.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the impressible material is an air dry modeling compound and the impression is that of a paw print of a pet.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference is made to generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> in connection with preferred embodiments of the present invention, which include preferred constructions of the keepsake arrangement and methods of making a keepsake using the keepsake arrangements disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in the figures, the preferred embodiments are generally directed to a keepsake arrangement, generally indicated at <b>10</b>, constructed in accordance with the present invention. In a first preferred embodiment, keepsake arrangement <b>10</b> comprises a cavity <b>12</b> defined by at least one cavity wall, generally indicated at <b>14</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for example, four (4) walls define cavity <b>12</b>. Walls <b>14</b> may be separate walls, or, as in the preferred embodiment, are integrally molded walls preferably from plastic. On this point, it should also be understood that while in this first embodiment, cavity <b>12</b> is rectangular in shape, this is by example and not limitation, as it should be understood that cavity <b>12</b> can be any number of shapes, including round, oval, among others. It will also be noted that the claims are not limited by the shape of the cavity. Cavity <b>12</b> has an opening that is indicated by reference number <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a completed keepsake arrangement, an impressible material <b>18</b> will be disposed in the cavity <b>12</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the impressible material is an air dry modeling compound. Through extensive experimentation it has been found that an air dry modeling compound sold under the brandname DELIGHT works the best in connection with the objectives of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In connection therewith, a seal <b>20</b> is sealingly coupled to a lip <b>22</b> about the cavity, for sealing the impressible material <b>18</b> in the cavity <b>12</b> and for maintaining moisture in the impressible material <b>18</b> while the seal <b>20</b> is sealingly coupled to the lip <b>22</b> about the cavity. In a preferred embodiment, the seal <b>20</b> is heat-sealed to the lip <b>22</b> about the cavity, but other means of sealing are well within the purview of one skilled in the art, such as through the use of adhesives or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Keepsake arrangement <b>10</b> further comprises a frame, generally indicated at <b>30</b>, that is releasably coupleable to at least a portion of the lip <b>22</b> that extends about the cavity <b>12</b>. In a preferred embodiment, frame <b>30</b> is releasably coupleable to the lip <b>22</b> that extends about the cavity. That is, preferably frame <b>30</b> extends around the entire cavity as clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that while preferred, frame <b>30</b> need not extend all the way around.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Frame <b>30</b> includes a shoulder section <b>32</b> that preferably extends about the entire frame. Here too, although preferred, those skilled in the art will recognize that shoulder section need not extend all the way around. In the preferred embodiment, shoulder section <b>32</b> extends over at least a part of the opening <b>16</b> when the frame <b>30</b> is coupled to the cavity wall(s).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As illustrated and preferred, the shoulder section <b>32</b> is dimensioned to assist in retaining the impressible material <b>18</b> in the cavity <b>12</b> when the seal <b>20</b> is removed from the lip <b>22</b> about the cavity <b>12</b> and the moisture is removed from the impressible material. By this it is meant that exposure to the air will cause the impressible material to lose its moisture and contract in size. Therefore, without some means of retaining the material <b>18</b> within the cavity, it is more likely to fall out undesirably. The use of a shoulder section that extends at least partially into the opening reduces and/or eliminates this possibility.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a specific embodiment, frame <b>30</b> may be hingedly coupled to the at least one cavity wall <b>14</b> such that the frame <b>30</b> can be coupled and decoupled from the lip <b>22</b> about the cavity by pivoting of the frame relative to the cavity. To achieve this, a hinge <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be provided to hingedly couple the frame <b>30</b> to the at least one cavity wall <b>14</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the frame <b>30</b> and the hinge <b>40</b> are integrally formed from plastic. Further, as the entire keepsake arrangement is preferably molded from plastic, hinge <b>40</b>, lip <b>22</b> and frame <b>30</b> may all be integrally formed from molded plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a preferred usage of the present invention is in connection with pet memorabilia, and in particular, wherein the air dry modeling compound is impressed with the paw print of a pet. However, as should be understood, this is by way of a preferred example of an imprint and not by limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In connection with further optional but preferably includable details in connection with the objectives set forth herein, keepsake arrangement <b>10</b> may further comprise a housing, generally indicated at <b>60</b>, wherein the housing comprises at least (i) a base <b>62</b> for supporting the cavity <b>12</b> and (ii) a flap <b>64</b>, coupled to the base such as by member <b>64</b>, for covering the frame <b>30</b> when the flap <b>64</b> is in a closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and for exposing the frame <b>30</b> and the impressible material <b>18</b> when the flap <b>64</b> is in an open position (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>). In a preferred embodiment, housing could be made from leather or faux leather or another aesthetically appealing material.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In connection with the objectives set forth herein, a preferred embodiment of the present invention also provides for flap <b>64</b> to comprise a transparent sleeve <b>68</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>). In this way, and by way of example and not limitation, a photo or picture (e.g. of the pet) and/or a spiritual, emotional and/or inspirational writing <b>70</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can be inserted (and removed if desired) into the sleeve <b>68</b>. As illustrated and preferred, writing <b>70</b> is viewable through the sleeve <b>68</b> and is readable by a person when the flap is in the opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With a preferred embodiment of the keepsake arrangement now disclosed, reference may also be had to the figures in connection with another preferred embodiment of the invention, namely a method of making a keepsake utilizing a keepsake arrangement. Preferably, the keepsake arrangement used in connection with such a preferred method is illustrated herein, but for completeness and non-ambiguousness, comprises a cavity <b>12</b> defined by at least one cavity wall <b>14</b>, the cavity having an opening <b>16</b>; an impressible material <b>18</b> disposed in the cavity <b>12</b>; a seal <b>20</b>, sealingly coupled to a lip <b>22</b> about the cavity, for sealing the impressible material <b>18</b> in the cavity <b>12</b> and for maintaining moisture in the impressible material <b>18</b> while the seal <b>20</b> is sealingly coupled to the lip <b>22</b> about the cavity; a frame <b>30</b> releasably coupleable to at least a portion of the lip that extends about the cavity, the frame <b>30</b> comprising a shoulder section <b>32</b> that extends over at least part of the opening <b>16</b> when the frame <b>30</b> is coupled to the at least one cavity wall <b>14</b>; wherein the shoulder section <b>32</b> is dimensioned to retain the impressible material <b>18</b> in the cavity when the seal <b>20</b> is removed from the lip <b>22</b> about the cavity <b>12</b> and the moisture is removed from the impressible material.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Therefore and in accordance with a preferred embodiment, the method comprises the steps of removing the seal <b>20</b> from the lip <b>22</b> about the cavity <b>12</b>, making an impression in the impressible material <b>18</b> and coupling the frame <b>30</b> to the at least portion of the lip <b>22</b>, whereby the shoulder section <b>32</b> assists in retaining the impressible material <b>18</b> in the cavity <b>12</b> when the seal <b>20</b> is removed from the lip <b>22</b> about the cavity <b>12</b> and the moisture is removed from the impressible material.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a specific embodiment, and as disclosed above, the keepsake arrangement <b>10</b> may comprise comprising a housing <b>60</b> comprising a base <b>62</b> for supporting the cavity <b>12</b>, and a flap <b>64</b> coupled to the base <b>62</b> for covering the frame <b>30</b> when the flap <b>64</b> is in a closed position and for exposing the frame <b>30</b> and the impressible material <b>18</b> when the flap <b>64</b> is in an open position, wherein, and prior to the step of removing the seal <b>20</b> from the lip <b>22</b> about the cavity, the method comprises the steps of placing the flap <b>64</b> of the housing <b>60</b> in the open position; decoupling the frame <b>30</b> from the at least portion of the lip <b>22</b> and thereafter making an impression in the impressible material <b>18</b>; and then press-fittingly coupling the frame to the at least portion of the lip.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another specific embodiment, the frame <b>30</b> may be is hingedly coupled to the at least one cavity wall <b>14</b> such that the frame <b>30</b> can be coupled and decoupled from the lip <b>22</b> about the cavity <b>12</b> by pivoting of the frame relative to the cavity <b>12</b>, wherein the method comprises the steps of decoupling the frame from the at least portion of the lip by rotating the frame about the hinge <b>40</b> and press-fittingly coupling the frame to the at least portion of the lip by rotating the frame about the hinge <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In each of the aforementioned embodiments, frame <b>30</b> may merely be releasably coupled and releasably locked onto wall(s) <b>14</b> by a pressfit engagement, with or without a hinge. However, frame <b>30</b> could also (or alternatively) be releasably coupled to wall(s) <b>14</b> by means of a snap, lock, latch or other types of securing means, all of which is well within the purview of the skilled artisan. Such additional locking could be used to further ensure that the impressible material <b>18</b> does not undesirably or prematurely fall out of cavity <b>12</b>. Likewise, as the present invention is preferably directed to the imprinting of a pet's paw print, the method may also comprise the step of making an impression in the impressible material with the paw print of a pet.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, and to be sure, the keepsake arrangement may comprise a cavity defined by at least one cavity wall, the cavity having an opening; an impressible material disposed in the cavity; a seal, sealingly coupled to a lip about the cavity, for sealing the impressible material in the cavity and for maintaining moisture in the impressible material while the seal is sealingly coupled to the lip about the cavity; a frame pressfittedly coupleable to at least a portion of the lip that extends about the cavity, the frame comprising a shoulder section that extends over the opening when the frame is coupled to the cavity; wherein the shoulder section is dimensioned to assist in retaining the impressible material in the cavity when the seal is removed from the lip about the cavity and the moisture is removed from the impressible material. In this pressfitting arrangement, the frame may likewise be hingedly coupled to the at least one cavity wall such that the frame can be coupled and decoupled from the lip about the cavity by pivoting of the frame relative to the cavity. Hinge <b>40</b> as disclosed herein, may be used to achieve this construction.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As alluded to above, a preferred material for keepsake arrangement <b>10</b> is plastic, but other materials, dictated by cost and other relevant factors, can be used in place thereof. Such is the case with the optional but preferred housing <b>60</b> as set forth above. In addition, frame <b>30</b> is shown herein as being open within shoulders <b>32</b>, but if a further layer of material is desired, for example, so as not to contact material <b>18</b> after the impression has been done, glass or transparent (and presumably hard) plastic could also be provided and is within the scope of the invention. In addition, the use of a frame and shoulder section <b>32</b> that extends into the opening as disclosed herein can conceal uneven edges of the impressible material <b>18</b> that may form as the material dries, contracts and hardens. In this way, keepsake arrangement <b>10</b> as illustrated for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is even more aesthetically pleasing and ready to be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It can thus be seen that the present invention provides numerous advantages not found in the prior art. For example, the present invention provides an improved keepsake arrangement that overcomes the deficiencies in the prior art. Moreover, the present invention is easy to use, can be easily and quickly constructed and is aesthetically pleasing, all of which are improvements over the prior art. For example, the present invention can be quickly created, does not require complicated assembly components and is very easily and quickly ready to provide to the person desiring the keepsake memorabilia. Also, because of the sealed impressible material, storage of the present invention, for example in a Veterinarian's office for long periods of time prior to its opening and use, is possible with the invention as constructed. As would also now be understood by those skilled in the art, the present invention can be economically manufactured. The present invention also provides for an improved method of making a keepsake using the keepsake arrangement for the reasons disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with respect to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.</p>
