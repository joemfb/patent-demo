<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An insert for establishing a desired spacing between a pair of succeeding vertebrae and having a body including an extending end for supporting a location associated with a first selected lumbar vertebrae. An opposite extending end supports a spaced apart and opposing location associated with a second successively positioned lumbar vertebrae. Upon pre-positioning the body in an open space established between the vertebrae, an actuating input causes the first extending end to displace outwardly relative to the second end and into contacting support with the vertebrae.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention claims the priority of provisional application Ser. No. 61/107,851, filed Oct. 23, 2008.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention teaches a number of improved spinal vertebrae support implants. In particular, the present inventions disclose and include an ergonomically fitting and elevating jack insert, such as for insertion between succeeding lower lumbar vertebrae. In combination with selective cushioning implants and/or additional supporting/reinforcing structures established between the vertebra, the elevating jack inserts operate to establish a desired vertical spacing (as well as also optionally providing a further degree of lateral/torsional support) between selected lumbar vertebra. The provision of the insertable/elevatable jack insert also serves to prevent pain to the user (such as resulting from the pinching or contacting of nerves in the spinal column and due to spinal column misalignment, scoliosis and the like. Additional variants include the provision of both fixed and linearly extensible brace supports for installation about succeeding vertebral processes</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The prior art is well documented with various examples of spinal column immobilizing and bracing assemblies. A typical example of a spinal brace includes a titanium or like metal plate screwed or otherwise affixed to any plurality of spinal vertebrae and for the purpose of fixing and immobilizing the vertebrae in a specified arrangement and in order to compensate for damage existing in particular along an interface between succeeding vertebrae. The downsides of such existing immobilizing techniques include the discomfort and pain associated with the implanting of the brace, as well as significantly limiting the individual's flexibility of motion.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention discloses a jack insert for establishing a desired spacing between a pair of succeeding lumbar vertebrae having a body including a first extending end for supporting a first location associated with a first selected lumbar vertebrae and a second and opposite extending end for supporting a second spaced apart and opposing location associated with a second successively positioned lumbar vertebrae. Upon pre-positioning the body in an open space established between the vertebrae, an actuating input triggers an internal mechanism which causes the first extending end to displace outwardly relative to the second end and into contacting support with the vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additional features include the body being constructed of a plastic exhibiting at least one different durometer rating, and with the first and second ends further including cup shaped portions separated by an intermediate stem. In another application, the upper and lower halves can each further exhibit an outermost and softest durometer portion and an inner and hardened durometer portion. A key insert location within the stem actuator a length displacement rod to outwardly displace the cup shaped ends.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other features include the plastic body exhibiting at least one different durometer rating and including an upper half and a lower half nestingly engaged in a closed position. The actuating input can further include a displacement mechanism established between the upper and lower halves and, upon actuating, causing the upper half to outwardly displace. The upper and lower half of the body can each further include a recessed seating configuration for engaging the opposing vertebral locations, with such recessed configurations each including at least one of serrations, ridges and grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other features include the displacement mechanism exhibiting a stationary rotatable drive screw contained within the lower half, a lift screw arranged in crosswise and upwardly displaceable fashion relative to the drive screw and for upwardly displacing the upper half. One or more inflatable and cushioning inserts can each include a hardened ring exterior and a biasing fluidic interior, such that the insert is supported at a location between the vertebrae additional to a mounting location associated with the jack insert body.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional contemplated features include the provision of clips for securing between the vertebrae and to prevent misalignment of the cushioning insert. Also, a mounting screw can extend from the lower body half to engage a lower selected vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another variant, a central supporting jack insert can also be positioned at a central location between the vertebrae, with a pair of auxiliary jack inserts engaging extending process locations of the vertebrae. Such a jack displacement mechanism can include, without limitation, any of a screw lift worm gear, a screw lift bevel gear, a screw lift ratchet, a rotating screw lift, a rack gear pinion lift, and a rack gear ratchet lift. The jack displacement mechanism may also include, without limitation, any of a step slot spring lift, a step ring spring lift, a screw scissor lift, a cam lift ratchet lock, a push in wedge block lift, screw wedge block lift, displaceable wedge or key hole, pump lift air compressor, pump lift filler plastic, pump lift hydraulic, and a balloon ring filter plastic lift.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional variants include the provision of spinal brace supports, these providing both upper/lower and side assembleable variants and which upon installation, operate to positionally support successive extending processes associated with adjoining vertebrae. The spinal braces can also be used cooperatively or independently with the various spinal jacks and either can be provided in a fixed or expandable construction.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As will be described throughout the following detailed description, the present invention discloses a variety of ergonomically fitting and elevating jack inserts, such as for insertion between succeeding lower lumbar vertebrae but not limited in application to any location associated with a spinal cord. In combination with selective cushioning implants and/or additional supporting/reinforcing structures established between the vertebra, such as including process supporting bracing assemblies, the elevating jack inserts operate to establish a desired vertical and dynamic spacing support (as well as also providing degrees of lateral/torsional support) between specified vertebra.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The provision of the insertable/elevatable jack inserts and process supporting braces as described throughout the succeeding views also serves to prevent pain to the user, such as resulting from the pinching or contacting of nerves in the spinal column and due to spinal column misalignment, scoliosis and the like. Also, and while again not limited to any specific vertebral installation, the various jacks and bracing inserts disclosed herein are particularly applicable to lower lumber vertebrae which will be illustrated in a number of the views provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As are also known in the prior art, lower lumbar vertebrae are the largest segments of the movable part of the vertebral column, and are characterized by the absence of the a foramen transversarium (this forming a portion of other spinal vertebrae most typically associated with the main thoracic vertebrae). Lower lumbar vertebrae are designated L<b>1</b> to L<b>5</b>, starting at the top, and are very robust in construction, in that they must support more weight than other vertebrae associated with the spinal column. The lower vertebrae allow significant flexion and extension, moderate lateral flexion (sidebending), and a small degree of rotation. The discs between these vertebrae additionally create a lumbar lordosis (curvature that is concave posteriorly) in the human spine. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustration of a human spinal column according to the prior art and identifying the various types of spinal vertebrae including the atlas cervical <b>1</b>, axis cervical <b>2</b>, main cervical <b>3</b>, thoracic <b>7</b>, lower lumbar <b>5</b>, sacrum <b>6</b> and coccygeal <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Typical vertebra consists of two essential parts: an anterior (hunt) segment, which is the vertebral body; and a posterior part, otherwise known as the vertebral (or neural) arch which encloses the vertebral foramen. When the vertebrae are articulated with each other, the bodies form a strong pillar for the support of the individuals head and body (or trunk). As is also known, the vertebral foramina (or bone aperture) constitutes a canal for the protection of the medulla spinalis (or spinal column). In between every pair of vertebrae are two apertures, an intervertebral foramina exists, one on either side, for the transmission of the spinal nerves and vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Applying the above general explanation, a description will now follow of the several variants of spinal column jacks and spinal process support braes employed with any inter-vertebral interfaces, including again specifically lower lumbar vertebrae, and which function to provide a desired degree of supported and inter-vertebral spacing between succeeding vertebrae in order to establish dynamic support within limited ranges of motion. Advantages associated with the spinal jacks and braces includes the ability to install and maintain the components in any desired position relative to any number of vertebrae (as well as to install in a much less invasive fashion than associated with vertebral fusing plates of titanium and the like), this further such as to avoid pinching of spinal nerves associated with the spinal column as well as compensating for other structural misalignments in the spine, such as resulting from scoliosis or other deformities.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As will be further described in reference to the numerous succeeding views, a non-limiting objective of the present inventions is in providing for significantly less invasive inter-vertebral support at desired locations. This again, while retaining a desired (usually minor) remaining degree of inter-movable support between the associated vertebrae, allows for much greater range of motion than associated with absolute fusing or fixing techniques further associated with prior art fixed titanium plates and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The above said, and referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a front plan view is generally shown at <b>10</b> of a first installation arrangement of a human spinal location including such as a plurality of three consecutive lower lumbar vertebrae and in which a spinal insert jack, further generally shown at <b>12</b>, seats in abutting fashion between opposing and central body locations of a selected pair of the lumbar vertebrae. Also shown in addition to the central insert jack <b>12</b> is the provision of a pair of secondary auxiliary jack supports, at <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, these being supported between opposite and spaced apart pairs of transverse process portions, see at <b>18</b> &#x26; <b>20</b> and <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>20</b>&#x2032;, associated with succeeding lumbar vertebrae <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, these also constraining therebetween the generally centrally positioned jack <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The main vertebral body of each lumbar vertebra, further shown at <b>26</b> for vertebrae <b>22</b> and at <b>28</b> for vertebrae <b>24</b>, exhibits is enlarged relative to the other types of spinal vertebrae (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and is wider from side to side than from front to back, as well as a little thicker in front than in back. The vertebrae are also flattened or slightly concave above and below, concave behind, and deeply constricted in front and at the sides.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> in combination, the central installed spinal jack <b>12</b> and peripheral located auxiliary jacks <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are each material constructed (without limitation) from such as a sanitary plastic or metal material, or admixed composite thereof. As is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the spinal jack insert <b>12</b> exhibits a two piece body construction, including an ergonomically configured upper piece <b>30</b> (see concave inner exposed profile <b>31</b>) and an inter-assembled lower and likewise configured piece <b>32</b> (this further including a like concave inner profile <b>33</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As will be described in additional detail with reference to the succeeding variants of the two piece jack, and upon pre-locating the jack <b>12</b> such as in the inter-vertebral process location identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and by which the opposing concave surfaces <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> seat opposing profile surfaces of upper and lower illustrated superior articular processes <b>27</b> and <b>29</b>, a key tool portion (not shown in this view) is inserted into a key location, see at <b>34</b> in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, defined in a central actuating location of the jack body. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each of the upper piece <b>30</b> and lower assembled piece <b>32</b> further include aligning and overlapping extending portions, see further at <b>37</b> and <b>39</b>, these further exhibiting opposing pluralities of serrated teeth (see at <b>37</b>&#x2032; and <b>39</b>&#x2032; respectively for aligning/overlapping extending portions <b>37</b> and <b>39</b>) and which is communicated by the key <b>34</b>. The key <b>34</b> typically includes an inner engaging portion which seats selected teeth <b>37</b>&#x2032; and <b>39</b>&#x2032; and, upon being rotated by the external tool, results in separating displacement of the upper <b>30</b> and lower <b>32</b> pieces (see arrow <b>35</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), this corresponding with a desired spacing to be established between the lumber vertebrae <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and typically following the jack <b>12</b> being pre-located in its desired inter-vertebral environment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As again illustrated in the variant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the main jack <b>12</b> is seated within an open spaced defined between vertebral body portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> (this generally defined as being an open area existing between opposing spinal disc annulus associated with each vertebrae). Also provided are a pair of arms <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, these extending laterally from the upper body portion <b>30</b> and engaging projecting locations of a given vertebrae interface (such as understood to include mamillary process portions <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> as referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In cooperation with the main/central jack <b>12</b>, the secondary/auxiliary jack supports <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are secured between the transverse process portions <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> of the succeeding lumbar vertebrae <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The auxiliary jacks <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> each include intermediate extending and stem shaped bodies, of which opposite and arcuate (or cup shaped) ends engage associated locations of the selected process portions <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> of the lumbar vertebrae <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As with the central and main jack <b>12</b>, each of the auxiliary jacks <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> includes a key insert location, see at <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> respectively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and which, upon being accessed by a suitable key (also not shown in this view), operates to adjust an overall length of each of the auxiliary/secondary jacks <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, thereby achieving a desired spatial and supporting arrangement of the spaced apart process portions <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> in cooperating fashion with the biasing displacement provided by the centrally inserted jack <b>12</b>. As is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a centrally extending spinal cord <b>48</b> associated with the patient includes branching sets of nerves <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, the arrangement and configuration of the main spinal jack <b>12</b> and auxiliary jacks <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> being such that they do not interfere with the arrangement of the spinal cord and nerves relative the spinal column.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As will also be disclosed in reference to succeeding embodiments throughout the description, it is also envisioned that the main jack <b>12</b> and auxiliary jacks <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> can be anchored to either or both of the succeeding vertebrae by any collection of drill hole and insertable fasteners, ring supports and the like. It is also envisioned that the exposed jack surfaces (such as again the concave patterns <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) can also employ any desired textured or undercut pattern which promotes the generation and adhesion of naturally occurring bone marrow between the inserted jack and the mounting surfaces of the spinal vertebrae, such marrow generation/adhesion being used additional or alternative to any one of a plurality of possible fastening schemes.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Referring now to the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and succeeding rear view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, generally shown at <b>54</b> are a pair of succeeding lower lumbar vertebrae <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, and illustrating one potential arrangement and variation of an elevating jack insert with a central stem <b>60</b> establishing a generally elongated shape and which is installed between spaced apart superior articular processes <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> associated with the vertebrae <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>. The jack is similar in regards to the design of the auxiliary jacks <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in that it provides each of a pair of opposite vertebral (inwardly cup or arcuate shaped) engaging end portions, see at <b>61</b> and <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the end portions <b>61</b> and <b>63</b> are seated in displaced and separating fashion relative to the central and intermediate stem <b>60</b>, such that an overall length can be modified with the implementation of a key (see portion <b>65</b> defined in sleeve <b>60</b> and operating in similar arrangement to that illustrated and described previously in relation to auxiliary jacks <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>) in order to extend the overall length of the jack <b>60</b>. Otherwise, the jack <b>60</b> is similarly configured as previously shown at <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, with the exception in this instance that it is enlarged and reinforced to operate as the main supporting and separating insert at an inserting location between the selected superior articular processes of the spinal vertebrae <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, these extending rearwardly in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> from a forward location of the vertebral bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also illustrates a forward located and fluid filled cushioning insert <b>66</b> (see also side and rotated top inset views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>) which is disposed between the main/central body portions associated with each of the vertebrae <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>. The cushion inserts <b>66</b> are illustrated as exhibiting a solid ring shape exterior (such as constructed of a selected softened/lubricating/antibiotic plastic rating), within which is contained a liquid (or other fluidic/gelationous) mixture of softer plastic and typically also antimicrobial material according to any degree of three dimensional size or internal pressurization, see cushion <b>68</b> encircled by the outer plastic ring <b>66</b>, and for establishing the desired cushioning properties when installed in the open space established between the succeeding vertebrae <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Clips <b>67</b> and <b>69</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and are typically constructed of a flexible plastic or like material which engage, such as by undercut drilled recesses or the like, main body locations of each succeeding vertebrae. The clips <b>67</b> and <b>69</b> can exhibit any desired properties of flex and are mounted in connecting fashion between the succeeding lumbar vertebrae to assist in maintaining in interiorly positioned fashion between the vertebrae <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, the harder outer ring <b>66</b> and softer inner supported cushion <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As again shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the extending portions <b>61</b> and <b>63</b> respectively exhibit cup shaped ends which <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, respectively, define a softest (lowest durometer) rated plastic, with the intermediate extending stem <b>60</b> further defining a more rigid (intermediate durometer) plastic. A rigid interior is contained within the stem <b>60</b>, and which can include such as one or more overlapping rods, see at <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>, these associated with the extending portions <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> and further being of a highest rated durometer (most rigid material). The keyway access point, see as previously shown at <b>65</b> again can include an interior rotatable engaging feature for displacing the rods <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>, such as upon receipt of an insert portion of a tool (not shown) which is then rotated, such as along directional arrows <b>78</b>, in order to separate rods <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> and associated end positioned rods <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> outwardly relative to the stem <b>60</b> and until they abut the spaced apart articular processes <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> (again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in a fashion that the spinal vertebrae is supported in a desired spatial arrangement.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are the provision of forward and side installed retaining clips, see as identified at <b>94</b> and <b>96</b>, these assisting in retaining in place the inserts (with reference to selected insert again shown at <b>82</b>) and so that the same does not move or otherwise displace/slip out of desired position following installation. The clips <b>94</b> and <b>96</b> are similar in construction as those previously described at <b>67</b> and <b>69</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, such as which are constructed of a durable plastic and selected ones of which may exhibit desired flexural properties. Alternatively, the designs of the clips may further be such that that they may be adjustable in length and/or tension (see connecting portion <b>98</b> associated with conjoined pair of forward positioned clip <b>94</b>) to achieve a desired degree of give and bend depending upon a desired application.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a rotated side view is shown at <b>100</b> of a selected pair of lower lumbar vertebrae <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, and further showing a two piece elevating jack insert <b>106</b> according to a further configuration asecured between respective superior articular processes <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> of the vertebrae according to a further preferred embodiment. As is described in a number of applications herein, the jack <b>106</b> exhibits a two piece ergonomically configured and plasticized body (such as exhibiting process receiving concave surfaces such as previously shown at <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and which, following installation, is expandable to achieve a desired separation distance between a pair of the lumbar vertebrae. As further shown at <b>112</b>, one or more arms or clips extend from the jack <b>106</b> to secure the same to a given location associated with either of the lumbar vertebrae. As further again shown at <b>82</b>, an cushioning style insert with soft plastic consistency and bias-able construction is again provided and in order to maintain a desired spacing of the vertebrae <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an illustration generally shown at <b>112</b> of a two piece spinal vertebrae jack insert exhibiting first <b>114</b> and second <b>116</b> extending and undercut engaging support arms, as well as surface located undercut (contact) teeth (see at <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> applied over concave ergonomic surfaces associated with each of the upper and lower body portions) and for positionally locating and restraining the jack <b>112</b> when pre-installed at the desired location between succeeding lower lumbar or other specified vertebrae. A keyway adjusting location is generally referenced by rotatable input location <b>122</b> and, when engaged by a suitable tool, outwardly displaces the upper and lower body portions in the manner shown and such as in an expanding direction indicated by bi-directional arrow <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a corresponding illustration of a two piece elevating spinal insert jack, see generally shown at <b>124</b>, according to a further possible variant and which again illustrates a pair of undercut arms <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> extending from a first upper piece <b>130</b> (similar to that shown at <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), as well as a pair of mounting pins <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> extending from a second interconnected lower piece <b>136</b>, these for securing the jack <b>124</b> in place. As will be further described, the mounting pins can also exhibit a flexible/arcuate profile and can further include a serrated/undercut engaging end, see as further described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42-44</figref>, for fixedly anchoring into a designated bone location of the associated vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">A key receiving and separating portion is again referenced by rotatable component <b>138</b>, this likewise including an interiorly extending portion which engages opposing and serrating edges of inner aligning and overlapping extending portions, again at <b>135</b> and <b>137</b>, associated with the upper <b>130</b> and lower <b>136</b> assembled and expandable pieces. The jack <b>124</b> operates under the same principle as described above in related variants of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 9</figref> for separating the halves of the plasticized (or other suitable material constructed) jack to exert a suitable and desired separating force between the abutting locations of the lower lumbar vertebrae upon installation.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>, a further variant, generally at <b>140</b>, is shown of a two piece expandable spinal insert jack, this including upper ergonomically configured piece <b>142</b> and lower likewise ergonomically configured piece <b>144</b>. The upper configured piece <b>142</b> can include a tapered and overlapping lower edge <b>146</b> relative to the assembled lower piece <b>144</b> and, as shown in the several environmental applications already described, the jack <b>140</b> is installed at a desired location between configured portions of succeeding lower lumbar vertebrae, the purpose again being to establish a secure and desired spacing between the vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">As shown in the assembled view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the upper piece <b>142</b> and lower piece <b>144</b> each exhibits a desired recess configuration (see at <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>, respectively) for assisting in seating the jack <b>140</b> between the vertebrae. The central body portions of each of the upper piece <b>142</b> and lower piece <b>144</b> exhibit a moderate to hardened plastic durometer construction. As further shown, uppermost <b>156</b> and correspondingly opposite lower most <b>158</b> contact locations of both the upper piece <b>142</b> and lower piece <b>144</b> exhibit a softer durometer construction, this intended to contact and abuttingly engage the opposing surfaces of the vertebrae in use. As will be reference in succeeding embodiments, it is further understood that both the upper and lower recessed abutting surfaces can further exhibit teeth surfaces, ridged patterns or the like, all of which are intended to assist in frictionally engaging the jack insert <b>140</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Proceeding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a tool <b>160</b> is illustrated for engaging a jack initiating keyway location <b>162</b> associated with the two piece spinal jack <b>140</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a rotated and underside perspective of the spinal jack of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, with both the underside recess configuration of the selected jack portion as well as the provision of a plastic or metal screw <b>164</b> extending through a recess profile location <b>166</b> in the lower piece <b>146</b>, such as for mounting the jack to a lower vertebral location.</p>

The pull screw <b>242</b> is linearly retracted from the housing at the location shown at <b>248</b>, this causing the compression of the pairs of spring portions <b>244</b> and <b>246</b> to raise and lower the upper jack half <b>241</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, an illustration is generally shown at <b>250</b> of a cam lift ratchet lock jack variant.

A ratcheting arrangement is established between the inwardly facing serrated portions <b>252</b> and opposing outward serrations <b>253</b> defined upon a downwardly extending stem portion <b>254</b> associated with upper half <b>255</b>. A cam <b>256</b> is rotatably mounted in crosswise fashion between inner side walls associated with the lower jack half <b>251</b> and seats at a location approximate a bottom surface <b>258</b> of the lower half inner pocket. A tool (not shown) is employed to rotate the cam <b>256</b>, and so that it's profiled edge upwardly biases and displaces the upper body <b>255</b> via its stem portion <b>254</b>. This is further caused by the ratcheting upward displacement of its serrated portions <b>254</b> relative to the inwardly facing serrations <b>252</b> of the lower half receiving sleeve (and further concurrent outward deflection of the walls associated with the lower sleeve (see at <b>252</b>&#x2032;) which can further be designed so as not extend about an entire interconnected perimeter and which allows, via its outward biasing deflection and subsequent retraction, to elevate the top half <b>255</b> relative to the bottom <b>251</b>.</p>

Upon, pulling the screw <b>272</b> outwardly from the lower jack half body <b>271</b>, the wedge block <b>274</b> is laterally displaced (via directional arrow indicated) and, upon its teeth <b>276</b> coacting with the downwardly facing teeth <b>270</b>, causes the upper jack half <b>269</b> to upwardly displace.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is an illustration, generally at <b>278</b>, of a pump lift air compress lift jack variant, this employing a combination of fluid actuating upward lifting, combined with mechanical ratchet engagement between coacting portions of upper <b>279</b> and lower <b>281</b> jack body halves. In particular, an air injection hole <b>280</b> communicates through the lower jack half <b>281</b> to an inner pocket location (at <b>283</b>) defined within upwardly extending sleeve walls <b>282</b>.

The lever <b>302</b> is reciprocated within a cylinder pocket <b>304</b> defined in the lower (base) jack half <b>305</b>, this in turn building pressuring within an interior and stem supporting pocket <b>306</b>, within which is sealingly supported the upper jack half inserting stem <b>308</b>. Upon achieving a desired interior pressure, an upper jack half <b>309</b> is caused to upwardly displace and so that the opposing recess configurations of both the upper <b>309</b> and lower <b>305</b> jack halves biasingly engage the desired seating locations of any select pair of lumbar vertebrae.</p>

The design of the textured surfaces, this including any manner of roughening or serrating of the outer body locations associated with the upper and lower concave and ergonomically defined recesses, assists in locating and gripping opposing vertebral locations. As will be subsequently described in reference to succeeding embodiments, the design of the surface texturing is intended to promote both the initial frictional location of the exterior jack surfaces against desired mounting surfaces of vertebrae (such as concurrent to the installation of mounting anchors or fasteners), as well as promoting the natural phenomena of encouraging the generation of natural bone marrow growth at the contact locations, this promoting long term engagement of the jack with or without the use of separate fasteners.</p>
