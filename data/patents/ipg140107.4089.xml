<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention generally relates to an apparatus, a method, and a computer program product for forming images, and specifically relates to a colorizing technology in Page Description Language (PDL).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 5-64022 discloses a color image transmission system in which image data are transmitted based on an output system supported by a plotter, such as a frame sequential system or a dot sequential system, when a data transmitting device transmits image data to the plotter (i.e., a printer engine). There are two types of color image transmission systems used in an image forming apparatus, namely, a frame sequential system (or also called a &#x201c;component interleave system&#x201d;) and a dot sequential system (block interleave system). In the frame sequential system (component interleave system), color components (i.e., &#x201c;R, G, and B&#x201d;) constituting an image (a frame) are transmitted per component in the frame. That is, a unit having one-dimensionally arranged signals of each color component (R, G, or B) is transmitted per frame. In the dot sequential system (block interleave system), signals of color components (R, G, and B) are transmitted per pixel. That is, a unit having one-dimensionally arranged signals of color components (R, G, and B) is transmitted per pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, in the image forming apparatus, various image adjustments may be carried out on image data transmitted to a plotter based on print condition settings in order to achieve a high quality printing result a user desires. For example, in printing tagged image file format data (TIFF data), &#x201c;brightness&#x201d;, or &#x201c;contrast&#x201d; for the printing result may be adjusted. Moreover, image conversion such as enlargement or reduction in size of the image may also be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there are the following drawbacks in color adjustments in the related art image forming apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, there is an image forming apparatus that employs a dot sequential system for transmitting TIFF monochrome data to a plotter. In the dot sequential system, it is relatively easy to carry out image adjustments and image conversion on the image data or easy to handle the image data compared to the image adjustments and image conversion or the image handling in the frame sequential system and easier so that higher processing ability may be realized in the dot sequential system. However, if the TIFF color data are transmitted in a frame sequential manner in the above image forming apparatus having the dot sequential system, the image forming apparatus needs to have an extended function to carry out image adjustment-image conversion on the TIFF color data for adjusting colors of the image. That is, the image forming apparatus needs to have an image adjustment-image conversion function for colors (i.e., the extended function) in addition to an existing monochrome image adjustment-image conversion function.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If the image transmission system is not unified into in a color transmission system or a monochrome transmission system in the image forming apparatus, processing flows such as the image adjustment and image conversion or image rendering need to be further branched in each of the color and monochrome image transmission systems.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Unifying the image transmission system for color and monochrome data is cumbersome for developers and workload for such tasks on the developers even increases if the image forming apparatus has numerous models. Moreover, the extended function may result in increases in complication of maintenance and in development cost for manufacturers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, it is desirable that a monochrome image adjustment-image conversion function that carries out the dot sequential image data processing be made capable of carrying out the frame sequential image data processing on color image data in the image forming apparatus.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the following, preferred embodiments of the invention (hereinafter simply called an &#x201c;embodiment&#x201d;) are described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">&#x3c;Hardware Configuration&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a hardware configuration example of an image forming apparatus <b>100</b> according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> mainly includes a controller <b>110</b>, an operations panel <b>120</b>, and a plotter (printer engine) <b>130</b> that are mutually connected via a bus B.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The operations panel <b>120</b> includes a display section and an input section via which a user receives various pieces of information such as apparatus information and inputs various user operations such as operational settings and operational instructions. The plotter <b>130</b> is configured to form an output image on a sheet based on transmitted printing data. The output image may be formed in an electrophotographic process or an ink-jet system.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The controller <b>110</b> includes a central processing unit (CPU) <b>111</b>, a storage device <b>112</b>, a network IF <b>113</b>, and an external storage IF <b>114</b> that are mutually connected via the bus B.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The CPU <b>111</b> controls the entire image forming apparatus <b>100</b> by executing installed computer programs. The storage device <b>112</b> stores the above computer programs or various data such as image data. Examples of the storage device <b>112</b> includes a volatile random access memory (RAM), a non-volatile read only memory (ROM), and a hard disk drive (HDD) having a storage region with large capacity. The RAM serves a working area of the CPU <b>111</b>, that is, a storage area in which the computer programs and data are temporarily held. The ROM and HDD are storage destinations of the computer programs and various data. With this configuration, the computer programs stored in the ROM are retrieved into the RAM to be executed in the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The network IF <b>113</b> serves as an interface to connect the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> to a predetermined data transmission path such as a network. The external storage IF <b>114</b> serves as an interface to connect the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> to a recording medium <b>114</b><i>a </i>that is an external storage device. Examples of such a recording medium <b>114</b><i>a </i>include a SD memory card and a universal serial bus (USB) memory. With this configuration, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is capable of retrieving the computer programs and data stored in the recording medium <b>114</b><i>a </i>via the external storage IF <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">&#x3c;Software Configuration&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating a software configuration example of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> according to the embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> includes an OS (basic software) <b>11</b>, a rendering platform (page renderer) <b>12</b>, and a PDL (RTIFF) <b>13</b>. The software is executed by the CPU <b>111</b> residing in the controller <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The OS <b>11</b> is embedded basic software such as Linux (Trademark or Registered Trademark) to control the entire image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The rendering platform <b>12</b> is software to provide a rendering function to the OS <b>11</b>. For example, the rendering platform <b>12</b> carries out rendering using a paging memory based on a specified rendering instruction, to carry out various processing before printing on the OS <b>11</b> when rendering using the paging memory is finished. The rendering platform <b>12</b> includes various modules serving as functions of an apparatus model information acquisition library, a rendering library, a graphics engine, and a color matching module in addition to main body modules.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The PDL <b>13</b> is software configured to analyze PDL data to generate printable (processable by the plotter) data (printing data). The PDL <b>13</b> reads the PDL data, decodes the read PDL data, and generates the printing data. The PDL <b>13</b> then carries out image adjustment-conversion processing on the printing data based on print condition settings. Thereafter, the PDL <b>13</b> transfers the processed printing data to the rendering platform <b>12</b>. Note that in this embodiment, an RTIFF configured to process TIFF data is provided as an example of the PDL <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The PDL <b>13</b> includes a main layer <b>21</b> and a lib image draw layer <b>22</b>. In the main layer <b>21</b>, the PDL data are analyzed and printing data are generated, and in the lib image draw layer <b>22</b>, data are relayed between the rendering platform <b>12</b> and the main layer <b>21</b>. Note that the data relay is carried out via a rendering IF provided from the rendering platform <b>12</b>. Further, the data relayed include PDL data and printing data and the data relay is carried out in an image transmission system such as a dot sequential system or a frame sequential system. For example, in this embodiment, the rendering IF provided by the rendering platform <b>12</b> is for RGB color data, so the rendering IF is configured to have a specification to receive dot sequential data having non-compressed 8 bit data for each color (one pixel=24 bits).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The main layer <b>21</b> includes modules to serve functions including an initialization section <b>211</b>, an event receiving section <b>212</b>, a data analyzing section <b>213</b>, and a decoding-rendering section <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The initialization section <b>211</b> includes a function to acquire unique apparatus model information (see (<b>1</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>)) from the rendering platform <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The event receiving section <b>212</b> includes a function to receive various control events such as startup/end/cancel events (see (<b>3</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), or an open/close data buffer function (see (<b>3</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) from the rendering platform <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The data analyzing section <b>213</b> includes a function to analyze PDL data received from the data buffer to acquire various pieces of information. More specifically, the data analyzing section <b>213</b> includes functions of a data format-type analyzing section <b>2131</b>, a header-tag analyzing section <b>2132</b>, and print option/print condition analyzing section <b>2133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The data format-type analyzing section <b>2131</b> includes a function to analyze PDL data received from the data buffer to acquire data format information or PDL data type information (see (<b>4</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The acquired data type information includes TIFF, Sun (Trademark or Registered Trademark) Raster, XWD, and CALS Raster.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The header-tag analyzing section <b>2132</b> includes a function to analyze the header or tags in the data when the PDL data are TIFF data to acquire PDL data information (see (<b>5</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The acquired PDL data information includes a data size, a compression type, data width and height, and color unit and depth.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The print option/print condition analyzing section <b>2133</b> includes a function to analyze PDL data to acquire print option setting information added to the data or to acquire print condition setting information set in the image forming apparatus (see (<b>6</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The acquired setting information includes a brightness specification, a contrast specification, and an enlargement-reduction specification.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> includes a function to generate, after receiving PDL data from the data buffer, printing data to render an image based on the generated printing data (see (<b>7</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> is configured to carry out decode processing based on the compression type of the acquired PDL data information. The decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> is configured to carry out the image adjustment-conversion processing on the decoded data based on the acquired print option/print condition setting information. Thereafter, the decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> transfers the processed printing data to the rendering platform <b>12</b> via the lib image draw layer <b>22</b>. The transferred printing data include decoded RAW data. Thus, a rendering instruction is sent to the rendering platform <b>12</b> (rendering is to be performed).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">More specifically, image forming processing illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is carried out. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sequence diagram illustrating a processing example in forming an image in the image forming apparatus according to the embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the PDL <b>13</b> initially sets apparatus model information in the rendering platform <b>12</b> (step S<b>11</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the apparatus model information is set in the rendering platform <b>12</b>, the rendering platform <b>12</b> requests the OS <b>11</b> to create a rendering frame (step S<b>12</b>). As a result, the OS <b>11</b> secures a work memory used for rendering, that is, to create the rendering frame in the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The rendering platform <b>12</b> waits for the rendering frame creation result and verifies whether the rendering frame has been created (memory has been secured) (step S<b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Subsequently, the PDL <b>13</b> starts carrying out band processing on each page for the rendering platform <b>12</b> (steps S<b>14</b> and S<b>15</b>). Subsequently, the PDL <b>13</b> transfers printing data (transfers rendering instruction) per band unit to the rendering platform <b>12</b> (step S<b>16</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the transfer of the printing data is started, the rendering platform <b>12</b> sends page information to the OS <b>11</b> (step S<b>17</b>), and requests the OS <b>11</b> to carry out frame printing (step S<b>18</b>). As a result, the OS <b>11</b> controls the plotter <b>130</b> based on the page information and starts printing image data written in the rendering frame.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The PDL <b>13</b> repeatedly carries out the processing of step S<b>16</b> and ends, when the printing data per page unit has been transferred, the band processing for each page in the rendering platform <b>12</b> (steps S<b>18</b> and S<b>19</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of the image forming processing for one page. Thus, if plural pages are subject to image forming processing, the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is repeated for the plural pages.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As described above, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> having the above hardware and software configurations may provide image forming services (image forming functions).</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">&#x3c;Image Forming Function&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An image forming function of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> according to the embodiment is described. In the image forming function according to the embodiment, the following processing is carried out in the decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> of the PDL <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> decodes the PDL data retrieved from the data buffer to generate the printing data. Subsequently, the decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> carries out image adjustment-conversion processing on the printing data based on print condition settings. The decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> then transfers the processed (image adjusted and converted) printing data to the rendering platform <b>12</b>. In a process prior to the image adjustment-conversion processing, the decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> converts various PDL data into unified data in the dot sequential system and generates the dot sequentially unified data as the printing data.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, it is desirable that a monochrome image adjustment-conversion function carrying out dot sequential monochrome data processing be made compatible with color data in the frame sequential system such that the monochrome image adjustment-conversion function is used as a shared function to serve a monochrome/color image adjustment-conversion function.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, in the image forming function in the embodiment, since various PDL data are converted into unified data in the dot sequential system (hereinafter also called &#x201c;dot sequentially unified data&#x201d;) as the printing data, the monochrome image adjustment-conversion function may be used as a shared monochrome/color image adjustment-conversion function.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus, in the image forming apparatus according to the embodiment, the monochrome image adjustment-conversion function is also used as a shared monochrome/color image adjustment-conversion function for color data processing in the frame sequential system to form images, thereby simplifying color image adjustment-conversion processing.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, a functional configuration and operations of the decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> are described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating a functional configuration example of the decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> according to the embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the decoding-rendering section <b>214</b> includes a decode processing determination section <b>31</b>, a print data generator section <b>32</b>, an image adjustment-conversion processing section <b>33</b>, and a rendering processing section <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The decode processing determination section <b>31</b> serves as a function to determine decode processing to be executed on PDL data D<b>1</b> to generate printing data.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The print data generator section <b>32</b> serves as a function to generate dot sequential printing data D<b>2</b> by carrying out the decode processing determined by the decode processing determination section <b>31</b> on the PDL data D<b>1</b>. The print data generator section <b>32</b> includes plural (N) decode functions (decodeFuncN) F to generate, after the PDL data D<b>1</b> are decoded, dot sequential printing data D<b>2</b> corresponding to the PDL D<b>1</b> that are supported (printable) in the image forming function.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a table illustrating a PDL data type in association with a decode function name in the image forming apparatus according to the embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, The PDL data D<b>1</b> are classified based on a combination of a data format and a data type and a decode function F for generating the corresponding printing data D<b>2</b> from the classified PDL D<b>1</b> associated with the combination of the data format and data type.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Note that the data format indicates a data format that the PDL <b>13</b> may be processed for, examples of which include TIFF, Sun Raster, XWD, and CALS Raster formats. Note also that the data type indicates features of data such as color/monochrome, and data sequences, examples of which include color data, monochrome data, grayscale data, dot sequential data, and frame sequential data.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The association between the PDL data type (data format information and data type information) and the decode function F (decode function name) is determined in advance based on PDL data D<b>1</b> to be supported by the image forming function.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the decode processing determination section <b>31</b> selects an appropriate decode function F from plural (N) decode functions F based on the PDL data type information. Note that the PDL data type information is obtained as a result of analysis carried out in the data format-type analyzing section <b>2131</b> in the software configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The decode processing determination section <b>31</b> selects the appropriate decode function F corresponding to the received PDL data D<b>1</b> based on the association between the PDL data type and the decode function name in the table in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, on receiving the PDL data D<b>1</b> having &#x201c;TIFF color data (frame sequential)&#x201d;, the decode processing determination section <b>31</b> selects a decode function F having a function name &#x201c;decodeFunc011( )&#x201d; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Further, on receiving the PDL data D<b>1</b> having &#x201c;Sun Raster full color data&#x201d;, the decode processing determination section <b>31</b> selects a decode function F having a function name &#x201c;decodeFunc021( )&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">That is, the decode processing determination section <b>31</b> selects an appropriate decode functions F from N decode functions residing in the print data generator section <b>32</b> based on the data type of PDL data D<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the image forming function is capable of converting the various types of PDL data D<b>1</b> into dot sequentially unified data to be generated as dot sequentially unified printing data D<b>2</b>. Further, since the image forming function generates the dot sequentially unified printing data D<b>2</b> based on the various types of the PDL data D<b>1</b> in the processing prior to the image adjustment-conversion processing, the image adjustment-conversion processing and the rendering processing may be carried out on various types of the PDL date D<b>1</b> in a shared function (see a shared function &#x201c;S&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For example, in the image forming function, even if the received PDL data D<b>1</b> are &#x201c;TIFF color data in the frame sequential system&#x201d;, the received TIFF color data in the frame sequential system (i.e., received PDL data D<b>1</b>) are converted into data in the dot sequential system to be generated as dot sequential printing data D<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the monochrome image adjustment-conversion function capable of carrying out processing on dot sequential data (data in the dot sequential system) may be used for processing the TIFF color data in the frame sequential system. That is, the monochrome image adjustment-conversion function may be used as a shared function of the color/monochrome image adjustment-conversion function.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, in the image adjustment-conversion processing, data in the dot sequential system may be easier to manage and maintain intact performance to convert a color model RGB to a color model CMYK. In the RGB color data in the frame sequential system, signals corresponding to color components R, G, and B are one-dimensionally arranged by the color component in one image face. That is, the RGB color data in the frame sequential system are composed of three units of image data corresponding to the color components R, G, and B. By contrast, in the RGB color data in the dot sequential system, signals corresponding to color components R, G, and B are one-dimensionally arranged in one pixel. That is, the RGB color data in the dot sequential system are composed of one unit of image data containing the color components R, G, and B. As can be understood from the difference in the arrangement of the color signals, color signal values (R value, G value, and B value) of one pixel are discontinuously acquired from one image data element in the frame sequential system, whereas the RGB values are continuously acquired from the image data in the dot sequential system. Thus, using data in the dot sequential system it may be easier to carry out the image adjustment-conversion processing than using those in the frame sequential system. Thus, it is effective to generate the dot sequentially unified printing data D<b>2</b> in the processing prior to the image adjustment-conversion processing in order to acquire processing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The image adjustment-conversion processing section <b>33</b> in the shared function S (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) has a function to carryout various image adjustment-conversion processing on the dot sequential printing data D<b>2</b> based on the print option setting and/or the print condition setting. Note that the print option setting and/or the print condition setting are information items obtained as a result of analysis carried out in the data format-type analyzing section <b>2131</b> in the software configuration. For example, the print conditions in this embodiment include &#x201c;brightness&#x201d;, &#x201c;contrast&#x201d;, &#x201c;inverse pixel&#x201d;, and &#x201c;size reduction&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition, the rendering processing section <b>34</b> in the shared function S (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) has a function to transfer the image adjustment-conversion processed image data to the rendering platform <b>12</b>. The rendering processing section <b>34</b> retrieves the rendering IF provided by the rendering platform <b>12</b> via the lib image draw layer <b>22</b> and transfers the image data per predetermined unit (i.e., band unit).</p>
