<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A remote browsing and searching process is directed to the management of a remote browse session at a network computing provider. Responsive to a search request, the network computing provider provides search results corresponding to historical content representations associated with content previously requested by the client computing device, search results corresponding to content representations associated with current content, or to data about changes in the content. The network computing provider may determine the search results based on a navigation path associated with a previous request for content, navigation paths of other client computing devices, relationships or differences between various versions of content, or based on any number of other factors. Interactive displays may be provided to client computing devices, allowing a user to refine the search results, zoom and manipulate content representations, and view relationships, similarities, and differences in content representations.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Generally described, computing devices and communication networks can be utilized to exchange information. In a common application, a computing device can request content from another computing device via the communication network. For example, a user at a computing device, such as a personal computing device, can utilize a software browser application, typically referred to as a &#x201c;browser,&#x201d; to request a Web page from a server computing device via the Internet. In such embodiments, the requesting computing device can be referred to as a client computing device and the server computing device can be referred to as a content provider.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With reference to an illustrative example, a requested Web page, or original content, may be associated with a number of additional resources, such as images or videos, that are to be displayed with the Web page. In one specific embodiment, the additional resources of the Web page are identified by a number of embedded resource identifiers, such as uniform resource locators (&#x201c;URLs&#x201d;). In turn, software on the client computing devices, such as a browser, typically processes embedded resource identifiers to generate requests for the content. Accordingly, in order to satisfy a content request, one or more content providers will generally provide client computing devices data associated with the Web page as well as the data associated with the embedded resources.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Once the client computing device obtains the Web page and associated additional resources, the content may be processed in a number of stages by the software browser application or other client computing device interface. For example, and with reference to the above illustration, the software browser application may parse the Web page to process various HTML layout information and references to associated resources, may identify and process Cascading Style Sheets (&#x201c;CSS&#x201d;) information, may process and instantiate various Javascript code associated with the Web page, may construct a native object model to represent one or more components of the Web page, and may calculate various layout and display properties of the processed content for presentation to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although many browsers maintain a historical record of Web pages and network resources viewed at the client computing device, browsers tend to maintain limited data about the previously viewed content, often due to storage constraints at the client computing device. In one aspect, stored information about a previously viewed Web page can include storing or archiving a URL or other reference to the page, a page title, and/or other basic identifying information. Accordingly, accessing a record of a previously viewed Web page may cause the browser to retrieve the most current version of the Web page or network resource corresponding to the stored URL. In another aspect, a user can store a static image of Web page by copying and storing content associated with the Web page. In both aspects, however, accessing a previously viewed Web page based on the stored URL or a stored version of a Web page will not allow the user to view data about changes to the Web page over time, or to view the actual changes themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Searching for Web pages is typically limited to text-based entry of keywords, which are then used to retrieve Web pages that include the keywords in the content or the meta data associated with the Web site. Search results, whether for previously viewed versions of Web pages or for current versions, are also typically provided as text. The search results displayed to the user may include a portion of text in an HTML tag of the web page, a digest of the text displayed on the page, or a portion of text that the search provider determines to be relevant to the search. Some search results may include a static image of the search result. Refinement of search results typically involves entry of additional search terms, and the refined results are likewise typically text-based with static images.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Generally described, the present disclosure is directed to the generation and management of a remote browsing session, including browsing of historical content, searching of both current and historical content, and display of information about changes in content or other browsing related data over time. Specifically, aspects of the disclosure will be described with regard to the generation and management of historical browse content records between the client computing device and the network computing provider, the indexing and searching of historical browse content records, the searching of current network content, and the generation of interactive displays of the historical content and search results. Additional aspects of the disclosure will be described with regard to providing contextual search results, associating geographic identifiers with browsing records, and providing geographic displays of browsing data. Although aspects of the embodiments described in the disclosure will focus, for the purpose of illustration, on the management of a remote browse session and a historical browse storage component, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the techniques disclosed herein may be applied to any number of software processes or applications, and may be applied to preserving historical content of any number of different document and data types. Further, although various aspects of the disclosure will be described with regard to illustrative examples and embodiments, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the disclosed embodiments and examples should not be construed as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to an illustrative example, a user may cause a client computing device to load a software browser application (henceforth referred to as a &#x201c;browser&#x201d;) for accessing content provided by one or more content providers. In one embodiment, the browser may have a content display area or pane for displaying the accessed network content in addition to one or more local interface components, such as toolbars, menus, buttons, or other user interface controls. Local interface components may be managed and controlled by the software browser application or any other process executing or implemented locally at the client computing device. Illustratively, managing user interface controls locally may allow for a responsive user interface, as interactions by the user are processed locally on the client computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Subsequent to the browser being loaded, a user or automated browser process may cause the client computing device to transmit a request to access content from a content provider by establishing a browse session with a network computing provider across a private or public network. The browse session request may include information identifying one or more sources for the requested content. For example, the user may select or enter a URL, (e.g., http://www.xyzwebsite.com) into a browser window, causing the client computing device to transmit a request for a new browse session to the network computing provider, including the selected URL. The browse session request may further include identification information, such as information identifying the user, browser, or client computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an illustrative embodiment, the network computing provider may process the identification information included in the browse session request to determine a historical browse storage component to associate with the browse session. The historical browse storage component may store historical resource representations, including representations of content requested by the client computing device. Further, and responsive to the browse session request received from the client computing device, the network computing provider may instantiate or cause to have instantiated one or more computing components associated with the network computing provider that will host a browser software application. For example, the network computing provider can instantiate, or cause to have instantiated, an instance of a virtual machine that includes a software browser application capable of requesting resources from a communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Using the instantiated network computing components, the network computing provider may request the identified network resource(s) from one or more content providers, a content delivery network, or a local or associated cache component or data store. For example, the browser software application on the instantiated network computing component can process a primary network resource and then generate additional content requests for content identified in one or more embedded resource identifiers (e.g. pictures, video files, etc.). Illustratively, in the case of other non-browser applications, network resources, or content, may include any file type or format known in the art and supported by the specific software application.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Having obtained the requested content (e.g., the requested network resource and embedded resources), the network computing provider may identify a client remote session browse configuration specifying a remote session communication protocol for use in transmitting the requested content, user interaction data, intermediate processing results, and other information between the browser being executed on the client computing device and the browser being executed at the instantiated network computing component on the computing and storage provider. The information exchanged between the browser on the instantiated network computing component and the browser on the client computing device can be generally referred to as &#x201c;browser session information.&#x201d; The network computing provider may additionally make any number of further content requests and/or cause the instantiation of additional remote sessions in order to retrieve and process any content referenced by the requested content (e.g., Web pages linked to by the requested Web page). Any number of linked resources up to a specified or determined depth may be retrieved and provided to the historical browse storage component for storage and indexing.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition to specifying a remote session communication protocol for transmitting information between the client computing device and the instantiated network computing component, in one embodiment, the identified client remote session browse configuration may specify that one or more processing actions to be performed on the requested content are to be performed at the network computing provider rather than, or in addition to, at the client computing device A Web page, for example, may be parsed and processed to process various HTML layout information and references to associated resources or embedded content, such as CSS style sheets and Javascript, as well as embedded content objects such as images, video, audio, etc. Each object or piece of code may be parsed and processed before a representative object model corresponding to the web page may be constructed and processed further for layout and display. The client remote session browse configuration may identify which of these actions are to be performed at a network computing component and which are to be performed at the client computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The historical browse storage component associated with the remote session may specify an additional historical remote session browse configuration. This historical remote session browse configuration may specify a remote session communication protocol for encapsulating and providing intermediate processing results from the network computing component to the historical browse storage component, and may further specify any processing actions to be performed at the network computing component as described above with reference to the client remote session browse configuration. Illustratively, processing results corresponding to a representation of content stored at a historical browse storage component may be referred to as a historical content representation. Illustratively, remote session communication protocol and/or split of processing specified in the historical remote session browse configuration may be the same or different as the determined client remote session browse configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The client computing device and the instantiated network computing component may exchange processing results via browser session information (e.g., state data or display data representing the requested content result) in accordance with the client remote session browse configuration. The network computing component may further provide historical content representation of the requested content to the historical browse storage component for storage in accordance with the client remote session browse configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At a subsequent point in time, the client computing device may search the stored content at the historical browse storage component. In one embodiment, a client computing device may search the stored content based on a specific cached resource or a historical browse session of interest. In a further embodiment, a client computing device may search only stored content that the user did not view in the original browse session (e.g., resources linked to by viewed resources and stored at the historical browse storage component).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The display of historical content search results may include visual indicia of changes in the various versions of a network resource. Illustratively, a single network resource, such as a Web page, may have several representations stored at the historical browse storage component. Responsive to a historical content search request from a client computing device, the network computing provider may prepare a display of search results including the various versions of the network resource. Illustratively, the differences between versions, or the versions themselves, may be presented by utilization of underlines, outlines, highlights or other indicia that indicate portions of the network resource that have changed from version to version. The search results may be presented to the user in a timeline format, with consecutive versions displayed adjacent to each other. The search results may also be presented overlapping each other, and may utilize transparency or other visual effects to call the user's attention to changes in the various versions.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The visual displays can also be utilized for search results that include both historical and current versions of network resources, or to results including only current versions of network resources having no historical representation stored at the network computing provider. Additional display configurations can be provided. Illustratively, search results containing only current versions of network content can display the search results grouped by similarities in the network content. The displays may be interactive, allowing a user to view other related content that does not satisfy the specific search for which results are being displayed, historical versions of the search results from the user's own history or from the history of other users, contextual results accessed in the same time period as historical search results, etc. Additionally, visual displays can be utilized to display information about changes between versions of network content, rather than displaying the changes themselves. Some visual displays can be utilized to display summaries of changes in other browsing related data, such as the adoption rate of new technologies, etc. Furthermore, geographical indicators stored with browsing data can be incorporated into visual displays.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the process can begin with the generation and processing of a browse session request from a client computing device <b>102</b> to a network computing provider <b>107</b>. Illustratively, the client computing device <b>102</b> may load a browser for viewing network content in response to an event or user request. Subsequent to the browser being loaded, the browser may be implemented to request a new browse session. From the perspective of the user of the client computing device, the request for the new browse session corresponds to the intended request to transmit the request to one or more corresponding content providers <b>104</b>. Illustratively, this request may be generated automatically as a result of the browser loading (e.g., a request for a default or &#x201c;home&#x201d; page), or may be generated as a result of a user following a link or entering a network address into an address bar. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the browse session request may be transmitted first to a network computing provider <b>107</b>. In an illustrative embodiment, the network computing provider <b>107</b> utilizes a registration application program interface (&#x201c;API&#x201d;) to accept browse session requests from the client computing device <b>102</b>. The browse session request can include network address information corresponding to a requested network resource, which may be in any form, including, but not limited to, an Internet Protocol (&#x201c;IP&#x201d;) address, a URL, a Media Access Control (&#x201c;MAC&#x201d;) address, etc. The browse session request may further include information identifying a user, browser, client computing device <b>102</b>, and/or any other browsing entity.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Subsequent to the receipt of the browse session request, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may select an associated network computing component (hereinafter &#x201c;NCC&#x201d;) point of presence (hereinafter &#x201c;POP&#x201d;) such as NCC POP <b>142</b> to service the browse session request, and may identify a historical browse storage component based on the identifying information in the browse session request. The selection of the NCC POP may determine the processing and network resources available to the instantiated virtual machine. The selection of processing and network resources and the provisioning of software at the NCC POP instance may be done, at least in part, in order to optimize communication with content providers <b>104</b> and client computing devices <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an illustrative interaction for generation and processing of a request for a network resource from a network computing provider <b>107</b> to a content provider <b>104</b> will be described. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the selected NCC POP <b>142</b> may generate a browse session corresponding to one or more content providers based on a browse session request, such as the illustrative browse session request depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> above. Illustratively, instantiating a new browse session instance may include loading a new virtual machine instance and/or browser instance at the NCC POP <b>142</b>, reserving or allocating device memory, storage or cache space, processor time, network bandwidth, or other computational or network resources for the new browse session.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Subsequent to initializing a new browse session instance, NCC POP <b>142</b> may provide a request for a network resource to a content provider <b>104</b> based on a network address included in the browse session request. For example, a browse session request may include a URL for a Web page, such as &#x201c;http://www.xyzsite.com/default.htm.&#x201d; NCC POP <b>142</b> may resolve the URL to an IP address through a DNS resolver associated with the network computing provider (not shown), and may request the Web page from the content provider <b>104</b> at the resolved IP address. In various embodiments, a network resource may be retrieved from any combination of content providers, content delivery network (hereinafter &#x201c;CDN&#x201d;) servers, or data stores associated with the network computing provider <b>107</b>. For example, the network computing provider may check if a resource is stored in a local cache or in another server or service provider associated with the network computing provider <b>107</b>. If a network resource is stored in a local or associated location, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may retrieve the network resource from the local or associated location rather than from the third party content provider <b>104</b> or CDN service provider <b>106</b>. Illustratively, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may provide requests for any number of network resources as included in the browse session request, and may obtain these network resources from any number of different sources, sequentially or in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the content provider <b>104</b> receives the resource request from the NCC POP <b>142</b> and processes the request accordingly. In one embodiment, the content provider <b>104</b> processes the resource request as if it were originally provided by the client computing device <b>102</b>. For example, the content provider <b>104</b> may select the type of content, ordering of content, or version of content according to the requirements of the requesting client computing device <b>102</b>. In another embodiment, the content provider <b>104</b> may be provided with information that provides information associated with the NCC POP <b>142</b> for utilization in providing the requested content (e.g., an available amount of processing resources or network bandwidth).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Subsequent to obtaining the requested network resource from the content provider <b>104</b> (or other source designated by the content provider), the NCC POP <b>142</b> may process the network resource to extract embedded resource identifiers and gather information for determination of a client remote session browse configuration. For example, a network resource such as a Web page may include embedded CSS style information and Javascript as well as embedded resource identifiers to additional resources such as text, images, video, audio, animation, executable code, and other HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. In the process of extracting the embedded resource identifiers, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may gather information about the processed network resources for later use in the determination of a client remote session browse configuration as discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an illustrative interaction for generation and processing of one or more requests corresponding to one or more embedded resources from a network computing provider to a content provider and content delivery network is disclosed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the selected NCC POP <b>142</b> may provide resource requests to one or more sources of content such as content provider <b>104</b> and CDN POP <b>116</b>. The resource requests may correspond to embedded resources based on one or more embedded resource identifiers extracted from a requested network resource (e.g., a Web page) as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> above. In various embodiments, embedded resources may be retrieved from any combination of content providers, CDN servers, or data stores associated with the network computing provider <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, the network computing provider may check if an embedded resource is stored in a local cache or in another data store or service provider associated with the network computing provider <b>107</b>. If an embedded resource is stored in a local or associated location, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may retrieve the embedded resource from the local or associated location rather than the third party content provider or CDN. Illustratively, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may provide requests for any number of embedded resources referenced by a network resource, and may obtain these embedded resources from any number of different sources, sequentially or in parallel. Subsequent to obtaining the requested resources, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may process the resources and requested content to determine a client remote session browse configuration for the processing and communication of content to the client computing device <b>102</b>. The NCC POP <b>142</b> may further identify references in any of the retrieved content and determine any additional resource requests for retrieval and caching at the historical browse storage component.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an illustrative interaction for generation and processing of a historical content representation, browse session data, and user interaction data between a network computing provider and client computing device is disclosed. As previously described, in one embodiment, the respective browsers on the instantiated network computing component and the client computing device <b>102</b> can exchange browsers' session information, such as client remote session browse configuration information, related to the allocation and processing of the requested resources at the instantiated network computing component and client computing device. In one embodiment, a historical browse storage component may be additionally be associated with historical remote session browse configuration information, which may be the same or different as the client remote session browse configuration information discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the selected NCC POP <b>142</b> may generate initial processing results based on the client and historical remote session browse configuration information as discussed above. If the client and historical remote session browse configuration information each specify different formats and/or processing of processing results, the selected NCC POP <b>142</b> may generate two different processing results. Illustratively, a processing results generated based on the historical remote session browse configuration may be referred to as a historical content representation. The NCC POP <b>142</b> may provide the processing results generated according to the historical remote session browse configuration information (i.e., the historical content representation) to the identified historical browse storage component. Illustratively, the historical browse storage component may be implemented over one or more NCC POP of the network computing provider <b>107</b>, or may include any other network storage location or component.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The selected NCC POP <b>142</b> may provide an initial processing result to the client computing device <b>102</b> over the network <b>108</b>. The initial processing result may correspond to requested network content, such as a Web page, along with associated embedded resources processed by the NCC POP <b>142</b> in accordance with a selected client remote session browse configuration as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> above. The NCC POP <b>142</b> also makes a determination of which additional processes will be conducted at the NCC POP <b>142</b>, at the client computing device <b>102</b>, or both. Subsequent to receiving an initial processing result and the allocation of processes, the client computing device <b>102</b> may perform any remaining processing actions on the initial processing result as required by the selected client remote session browse configuration, and may display the fully processed content in a content display area of a browser. The client computing device <b>102</b> may process any local user interactions with local interface components or content elements locally, and may provide user interactions requiring remote processing to the network computing provider <b>107</b>. The network computing provider <b>107</b> may provide updated processing results to the client computing device in response to changes to the content or remote user interaction data from the client computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a block diagram of the content delivery environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrating the generation and processing of an additional new browse session request from a client computing device to a network computing provider is disclosed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a second new browse session request may be sent to network computing provider <b>107</b> from client computing device <b>102</b> across network <b>108</b>. In an illustrative embodiment, the network computing provider <b>107</b> utilizes a registration API to accept browse session requests from the client computing device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The additional browse session request may be generated by a client computing device <b>102</b> in response to a user opening up a new browser window with a new content display area, opening a new content display area in an existing browser window (e.g., opening a new tab in a browser), requesting new network content in an existing content display area (e.g., following a link to a new network resource, or entering a new network address into the browser), or any other user interaction. For example, a user browsing a first Web page corresponding to a first browse session instance may follow a link that opens a new tab or browser window to view a second Web page. In one embodiment, any required steps of obtaining and processing content associated with the second Web page may be performed by the currently instantiated network computing component in which the browser can handle the processing of both resource requests. In another embodiment, the client computing device <b>102</b> request may be processed as a new browse session request to the network computing provider <b>107</b>, including the network address of the second Web page. In this embodiment, the browser on the client computing device may not specifically request a separate browse session, and a user's interaction with the browser on the client computing device <b>102</b> may appear to be part of a same browsing session. As described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may cause an instantiation of a network computing component for obtaining and processing content associated with the second web page. In other embodiments, a new browse session request may be generated by the client computing device <b>102</b> corresponding to sections of a network resource (e.g., frames of a Web page), individual network resources, or embedded resources themselves, data objects included in a set of content, or individual network resources.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Illustratively, the additional browse session request may include any number of pieces of data or information including, but not limited to, information associated with a user, information associated with the client computing device <b>102</b> (e.g., hardware or software information, a device physical or logical location, etc.), information associated with the network <b>108</b>, user or browser preferences (e.g., a requested remote session browse protocol, a preference list, a decision tree, or other information), information associated with the network computing provider <b>107</b>, information associated with one or more pieces of requested network content (e.g., the network address of a network resource), etc. Requested content may include any manner of digital content, including Web pages or other documents, text, images, video, audio, executable scripts or code, or any other type of digital resource.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Subsequent to the receipt of the browse session request, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may determine a historical browse storage component based on identification information included in the browse session request and select an associated network computing component such as NCC POP <b>142</b> to service the browse session request. As discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a network computing provider <b>107</b> may select an NCC POP to service a browse session request based on any number of factors, including, but not limited to, available NCC POP resources (e.g., available memory, processor load, network load, etc), a financial cost of servicing the browse session request at the NCC POP, the NCC POP location respective to a client computing device <b>102</b>, content provider <b>104</b>, or CDN POP <b>116</b>, an NCC POP cache status (e.g., whether a requested resource is already stored in an NCC POP cache or data store), etc. In one embodiment, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may select a number of NCC POPs to service a browse session request. Illustratively, although the network computing provider <b>107</b> is depicted here, for purposes of illustration, as selecting NCC POP <b>142</b>, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may select any extant NCC POP to service the browse session request. For example, a single client computing device <b>102</b> may simultaneously or sequentially provide three different browse session requests to the network computing provider <b>107</b> corresponding to different network resources. The network computing provider <b>107</b> may select different NCC POPs for each browse session request, the same NCC POP for all three browse session requests, or any combination thereof. As discussed above, the decision whether to select a different NCC POP than was utilized for a previous or simultaneous browse session request may be made on the basis of available system resources, randomly, or according to any other factor as discussed above and with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a user interface diagram depicting an illustrative browser interface and display of browse session content. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a browser <b>700</b> may have a content display area <b>702</b>, as well as one or more one or more local interface components. These local interface components may include toolbars, menus, buttons, address bars, scroll bars, window resize controls, or any other user interface controls. Illustratively, local interface components may be displayed as separate from the content display area or may be overlaid or embedded in the content display area.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Interactions with local interface components may be treated as local user interactions or remote user interactions depending on the processing required by the interaction and the client remote session browse configuration. For example, the selection of a preferences option in a browser menu may be handled entirely as a local user interaction by a browser. The processing required to display the menu, provide visual feedback regarding the selection, display the preferences window, and process the changes made to the browser preferences may be performed locally. As discussed above, processing user interactions locally may provide greater responsiveness at the browser as opposed to sending user interaction data to the NCC POP <b>142</b> for processing. As another example, when using a client remote session browse configuration that specifies extensive processing on the NCC POP <b>142</b> (e.g., a client remote session browse configuration using a remote session communication protocol such as RDP), the selection of a content refresh button in a browser toolbar may be handled both as a local user interaction and a remote user interaction. The limited processing required to provide interface feedback corresponding to the button selection may be handled at the client computing device <b>102</b> in order to provide the appearance of interface responsiveness, while the refresh command, which may require processing of the network content displayed in the content display area of the browser, may be sent as user interaction data to the NCC POP <b>142</b> for processing. The NCC POP <b>142</b> may then transmit updated processing results corresponding to the refreshed network content back to the client computing device <b>102</b> for display.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Illustratively, the browser <b>700</b> may include one or more content display areas <b>702</b> organized in content tabs <b>708</b>A-C. Illustratively, a content display area <b>702</b> may display a representation of content corresponding to a processing result provided by an NCC POP <b>142</b> as the result of a live browsing session, or may display a representation of content corresponding to a historical content representation. Tabs <b>708</b>A and <b>708</b>C associated with historical content representations may have one or more indicia that a historical content representation is being viewed, and may further include a date, time, or other associated or identifying information.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Illustratively, the browser <b>700</b> may provide an input element that gives a user access to historical content representations without requiring the user to enter search terms or access a separate interface. For example, a popup menu <b>710</b> may appear when a user manipulates a displayed cursor (e.g., right-clicking a mouse) on a network resource displayed in a content display area <b>702</b>. In response to a user selecting an option from the popup menu <b>710</b> to display previous versions, several versions of historical content can be displayed at once, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. Historical content representations <b>712</b><i>a</i>, <b>712</b><i>b</i>, and <b>712</b><i>c </i>may be presented, and in some cases the representations may contain additional visual elements highlighting any differences in the separate representations. In some embodiments, the historical content representations <b>712</b><i>a</i>, <b>712</b><i>b</i>, and <b>712</b><i>c </i>can be loaded into separate tabs instead of, or in addition to, being displayed in a single content display area <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Illustratively, a browser <b>700</b> may include any number of other controls not shown herein, but associated with the viewing, processing, or maintenance of a historical content representation. For example, a browser <b>700</b> may include a control to show the current version of content corresponding to a historical content representation, controls to move back and forward in the historical navigation path, controls to show historical content representations and/or the historical navigation path in a list or tree view such as that shown, for purposes of illustration, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>. A browser <b>700</b> may further include control to allow searching of the historical browse storage component based on a current piece of displayed content or historical content representation as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. In various other embodiments, a browser <b>700</b> may visually indicate whether resource references (e.g., hyperlinks) within the displayed historical content representation are associated with full historical content representations stored at the historical browse storage component. In a still further embodiment, a browser <b>700</b> may visually indicate a level of popularity of a resource reference within a displayed historical content representation based, for example, on a number of other users that followed or continued to browse from the referenced resource.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram depicting illustrative browser content processing actions as a series of processing subsystems <b>800</b>. In many embodiments, a browser may process sets of content (e.g., network resources such as web pages and associated embedded resources) in a series of processing actions. Illustratively, and as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, a client or historical remote session browse configuration may specify a split between processing actions performed at a network computing provider (e.g., an NCC POP) and processing actions performed at a client computing device <b>102</b>. This split may designate some processing actions to be performed by each of the NCC POP and client computing device <b>102</b>, or may assign all processing actions to a single device or component. For example, an NCC POP may perform all of these various processing actions at the browse session instance, and send fully processed RDP processing results to the client computing device <b>102</b> for bitmap assembly and display. Illustratively, a single browse session instance may have different or the same client and historical remote session browse configurations. Further, any number of different client or historical remote session browse configurations may be used by one or more browse sessions instances running at an NCC POP.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">One of skill in the relevant art will appreciate that the subsystems shown here are depicted for the purpose of illustration, and are not intended to describe a necessary order or a definitive list of browser subsystems. Various browser software components may implement additional or fewer browser subsystems than are shown here, and may order the subsystems or corresponding processing actions in any number of different ways. Although the processing subsystems <b>800</b> depicted here for purposes of illustration are directed at the processing of Web pages or other Web content, one of skill in the relevant art will appreciate that the processing of other file types or network resources may be broken up in a similar manner. For example, one of skill in the relevant art will appreciate that similar schema may be developed for the processing of images, video, audio, database information, 3d design data, or any other file format or type of data known in the art. Similar schema may also be developed for any number of device operating system or software framework processing operations, such as scheduling, memory or file management, system resource management, process or service execution or management, etc. Further, although the HTML protocol and RDP remote session communication protocols are discussed herein for the purposes of example, one of skill in the relevant art will appreciate that a client or historical remote session browse configuration may implement any number of remote communication protocols for any number of specified processing actions, and that a client or historical remote session browse configuration may be formulated to perform any fraction or combination of the actions identified below at any combination of the client computing device <b>102</b> and network computing provider <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Illustratively, the first processing subsystem involved in the processing and display of network content is the networking subsystem <b>802</b>. Illustratively, the networking subsystem <b>802</b> may be responsible for all communication between the browser and content provider, including local caching of Web content. The networking subsystem is generally limited by the performance of the user's network. A client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at the networking subsystem <b>802</b> might include a client or historical remote session browse configuration utilizing an HTML remote session communication protocol, where one or more caching or resource retrieval actions were performed at the NCC POP, but parsing and processing of the content was performed at the client computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As network resources such as HTML documents are downloaded from the server they may be passed to an HTML subsystem <b>804</b> which parses the document, initiates additional downloads in the networking subsystem, and creates a structural representation of the document. Modern browsers may also contain related subsystems which are used for XHTML, XML and SVG documents. A client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at the HTML subsystem <b>804</b> might include a client or historical remote session browse configuration utilizing an HTML remote session communication protocol, where an initial HTML page is processed at the NCC POP in order to extract embedded resource identifiers, but additional parsing and processing of the content is performed at the client computing device. In another embodiment, a client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at the HTML subsystem <b>804</b> might perform initial processing to create the structural representation of the HTML document, and provides a processing result including the structural representation and associated embedded resources.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When CSS is encountered, whether inside an HTML document or an embedded CSS document, it may be passed to a CSS subsystem <b>806</b> to parse the style information and create a structural representation that can be referenced later. Illustratively, a remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at a CSS subsystem <b>806</b> may construct a processing result including the CSS structural representation and HTML structural representation, optionally including any associated embedded resources.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">HTML documents often contain metadata, for example the information described in a document header or the attributes applied to an element. The collections subsystem <b>808</b> may be responsible for storing and accessing this metadata. A client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at a collections subsystem <b>808</b> may construct a processing result including processed metadata along with any other structural representations discussed above, optionally including any associated embedded resources.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">When Javascript is encountered, it may be passed directly to a JavaScript subsystem <b>810</b> responsible for executing the script. The JavaScript subsystem <b>810</b> has been examined fully over the years, and may be one of the most well known browser subsystems in the art. A client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at a Javascript subsystem <b>810</b> may construct a processing result including an internal representation of one or more Javascript scripts, including, but not limited to, state data or a representation of the script in a native or intermediate form, as well as any other processed structures or data discussed above, optionally including any associated embedded resources.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Because many JavaScript engines are not directly integrated into the browser, there may be a communication layer including the marshalling subsystem <b>812</b> between the browser and the script engine. Passing information through this communication layer may generally be referred to as marshalling. A client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at a marshalling subsystem <b>812</b> may construct a processing result including marshalling data as well as any other processed structures, scripts, or data discussed above, optionally including any associated embedded resources.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, JavaScript interacts with an underlying network resource such as a Web document through the Document Object Model APIs. These APIs may be provided through a native object model subsystem <b>814</b> that knows how to access and manipulate the document and is the primary interaction point between the script engine and the browser. Illustratively, a client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at a native object model subsystem <b>814</b> may construct a processing result including native object model state data or API calls as well as any other processed structures, scripts, or data discussed above, optionally including any associated embedded resources.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Once the document is constructed, the browser may needs to apply style information before it can be displayed to the user. The formatting subsystem <b>816</b> takes the HTML document and applies styles. Illustratively, a client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at a formatting subsystem <b>816</b> may construct a processing result including an HTML representation with applied styles, as well as any other processed state data, API calls, structures, scripts, or data discussed above, optionally including any associated embedded resources.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one embodiment, CSS is a block based layout system. After the document is styled, the next step, at a block building subsystem <b>818</b>, may be to construct rectangular blocks that will be displayed to the user. This process may determine things like the size of the blocks and may be tightly integrated with the next stage, layout. A client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at a block building subsystem <b>818</b> may construct a processing result including block information, as well as any other processed state data, API calls, structures, scripts, or data discussed above, optionally including any associated embedded resources.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Subsequent to the browser styling the content and constructing the blocks, it may go through the process of laying out the content. The layout subsystem <b>820</b> is responsible for this algorithmically complex process. Illustratively, a client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at a layout subsystem <b>820</b> may process the various state data, API calls, structures, scripts, or data discussed above to construct a processing result including layout information for the client computing device. Illustratively, an NCC POP may make use of various data or settings associated with the client computing device or browser (e.g., as provided in the initial browse session request) in order to generate a suitable layout for the client computing device. For example, a mobile device may provide a screen resolution and a display mode to the NCC POP. The NCC POP may base layout calculations on this screen resolution and display mode in order to generate a processing result corresponding to a content representation suitable for a browser running on the mobile device. Illustratively, in various embodiments, any other subsystem implemented by the NCC POP may make use of data associated with the client computing device or browser in generating a processing result for the client.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The final stage of the process may occur inside the display subsystem <b>822</b> where the final content is displayed to the user. This process is often referred to as drawing. A client or historical remote session browse configuration that splits processing actions at the networking subsystem <b>802</b> might include a client or historical remote session browse configuration utilizing an RDP remote session communication protocol, where nearly all processing is performed at the NCC POP, and a processing result including bitmap data and low level interface data are passed to the client computing device for display.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow diagram illustrative of a new browse session routine <b>900</b> implemented by network computing provider <b>107</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. New browse session routine <b>900</b> begins at block <b>902</b>. At block <b>904</b>, the network computing provider <b>107</b> receives a new browse session request from client computing device <b>102</b>. As previously described, the client computing device <b>102</b> may load a browser for viewing network content in response to an event or user request. Subsequent to the browser being loaded, the browser may be implemented to request a new browse session. From the perspective of the user of the client computing device, the request for the new browse session corresponds to the intended request to transmit the request to one or more corresponding content providers <b>104</b>. Illustratively, this request may be generated automatically as a result of the browser loading (e.g., a request for a default or &#x201c;home&#x201d; page), or may be generated as a result of a user following a link or entering a network address into an address bar. This browse session request may include one or more addresses or references to various network resources or other content requested by the client computing device <b>102</b>. The browse session request may further include identifying information including, but not limited to, a user identifier, a browser identifier, a historical cache or data store identifier, a physical or logical location identifier, or a device identifier. In an illustrative embodiment, the browse session request is transmitted in accordance with an API.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">At block <b>906</b> the network computing provider <b>107</b> may identify a historical browse storage component associated with one or more aspects of identifying information included in the browse session request. Illustratively, the historical browse storage component may be associated with the network computing provider <b>107</b> (e.g., implemented on one or more NCC POP), or associated or provided by a third party network storage component or data store.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">At block <b>908</b> the network computing provider <b>107</b> may select an associated NCC POP to instantiate a new browse session based on the browse session request. As discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a network computing provider <b>107</b> may include any number of NCC POPs distributed across any number of physical or logical locations. A network computing provider <b>107</b> may select a NCC POP to service a browse session request based on any number of factors, including, but not limited to, available NCC POP resources (e.g., available memory, processor load, network load, etc.), a financial cost of servicing the browse session request at the NCC POP, the NCC POP location respective to a client computing device <b>102</b>, content provider <b>104</b>, or CDN POP <b>116</b>, a NCC POP cache status (e.g., whether a requested resource is already stored in an NCC POP cache or data store), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In one embodiment, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may select a number of NCC POPs to service a browse session request. For example, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may select two NCC POPs with different logical locations in the network. Each NCC POP may independently request and process network content on the behalf of the client computing device <b>102</b>, and the client computing device <b>102</b> may accept data from the first NCC POP to return a processing result. Subsequent to being selected by the network computing provider <b>107</b>, NCC POP <b>142</b> may obtain the browse session request. In one embodiment, NCC POP <b>142</b> may have the browse session request forwarded to it by a component of network computing provider <b>107</b>. In another embodiment, NCC POP <b>142</b> or client computing device <b>102</b> may receive connection information allowing the establishment of direct communication between NCC POP <b>142</b> and client computing device <b>102</b>. Illustratively, NCC POP <b>142</b> may be provided with the browse session request originally provided to network computing provider <b>107</b>, may be provided with a subset of information (e.g., just a network address of requested content), or may be provided additional information not included in the original browse session request.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Subsequent to the NCC POP <b>142</b> being selected, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may cause the NCC POP <b>142</b> to instantiate a new browse session. Illustratively, instantiating a new browse session instance may include loading a new virtual machine instance and/or browser instance at the NCC POP <b>142</b>, reserving or allocating device memory, storage or cache space, processor time, network bandwidth, or other computational or network resources for the new browse session. Illustratively, one or more characteristics of the new browse session instance and/or browser instance may be based on client computing device <b>102</b> information included in the browse session request. For example, the browse session request may include a device type or browser type, a device screen resolution, a browser display area, or other information defining the display preferences or capabilities of the client computing device <b>102</b> or browser. The NCC POP <b>142</b> may accordingly instantiate a virtual machine instance and/or a browser instance with the same or similar capabilities as the client computing device <b>102</b>. Illustratively, maintaining a virtual machine instance and/or browser with the same or similar capabilities as the client computing device <b>102</b> may allow the NCC POP <b>142</b> to process network content according to the appropriate dimensions and layout for display on the particular client computing device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some embodiments, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may utilize an existing virtual machine instance and/or browser instance in addition to, or as an alternative to, instating a new browse session. For example, subsequent to the NCC POP <b>142</b> being selected, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may cause the NCC POP <b>142</b> to associate an existing browser instance and/or virtual machine instance, such as one or more instances previously instantiated at the NCC POP <b>142</b>, with the new browse session request. Illustratively, an existing browser session and/or virtual machine instance may correspond to another browse session, remote application session, or other remote process associated with the user or client computing device <b>102</b>, or may be a previously instantiated software instance from an unrelated browse session or remote process. In other embodiments, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may instantiate a new browser or other application process in an existing virtual machine instance, or may combine the utilization of previously instantiated and newly instantiated software processes in any number of other ways. In still further embodiments, the network computing provider or NCC POP <b>142</b> may instantiate any number of new virtual machine instances and/or browser instances (or make use of existing instantiated instances) based on a single browse session request.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">At block <b>910</b> the network computing provider <b>107</b> may provide a request for one or more network resources to a content provider or CDN service provider based on a network address included in the browse session request. In various embodiments, one or more network resources may be additionally or alternately retrieved from a cache or data store local to the NCC POP <b>142</b> or otherwise associated with the network computing provider <b>107</b>. One of skill in the art will appreciate that, in the case of other embodiments, the link or network address may correspond to a document or file stored in a digital file locker or other network storage location or at a cache component associated with the network computing provider <b>107</b> or client computing device <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the new session request may include a document or file in addition to or as an alternative to a network address.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">At block <b>912</b>, the network computing provider <b>107</b> obtains the one or more network resources. Subsequent to obtaining the requested network resource, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may process the network resource to extract embedded resource identifiers. The network computing provider <b>107</b> may provide resource requests based on the embedded resource identifiers to one or more sources of content such as content providers, CDN service providers, and caches or data stores. The network computing provider <b>107</b> may obtain these embedded resources from any number of different sources, sequentially or in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">At block <b>914</b>, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may process the network resources obtained in block <b>912</b> above to determine any additional resource requests for the historical browse storage component. In one embodiment, network computing provider <b>107</b> may be configured to process network resources directly or indirectly referenced by a requested network resource and provide corresponding historical content representations to a historical browse storage component. An illustrative example of requested and referenced network resources is provided with regards to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">For example, a client computing device <b>102</b> may provide a request for a new browse session instance corresponding to a Web page. As described above, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may retrieve the Web page and associated embedded resources. Illustratively, the Web page may reference any number of other Web pages or other resources through HTML tags embedded in the Web page. For the purposes of the example, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may be configured to retrieve all referenced resources up to three levels deep. In this example, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may process the requested Web page to extract URLs of referenced Web pages or other resources. The network computing provider <b>107</b> may then send requests for the referenced Web pages or other resources. These requested Web pages may be processed, and historical content representations corresponding to the requested Web pages may be provided to the historical browse storage component for storage and indexing. The network computing provider <b>107</b> may in turn process these referenced Web pages or other resources to determine and request any secondarily referenced Web pages or other resources. Accordingly, historical content representations corresponding to the secondarily requested Web pages may be provided to the historical browse storage component for storage and indexing. The process of requesting referenced resources and processing the requested resources to determine further references to resources may be repeated any number of times. Specifically, with reference to the above example, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may follow references in the secondarily referenced Web pages to obtain and cache tertiary referenced Web pages in order to satisfy the three level deep setting described in the example.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The determination of how many levels to follow references may be predetermined by a user, browser, historical browse storage component, network computing provider <b>107</b>, or other entity or device. In another embodiment, the determination of how many levels to follow references may be dynamically determined based on a characteristic associated with a requested resource, a time of day or date, a level of interest or importance assigned to the remote session, or any other factor.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In one embodiment, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may cause the instantiation additional browse sessions to request and process referenced resources. Illustratively, these additional browse sessions may instantiate further browse sessions to process secondarily references resources, and so forth, recursively, until the appropriate level of reference retrieval is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Illustratively, in various embodiments, different factors may influence which resources are processed into historical content representations and stored at the historical computing and storage component. For example, a network computing provider <b>107</b> may not process and store a resource and/or follow references from a referenced resource based on any number of factors including, but not limited to, a content type of the resource, a tag or other metadata associated with the resource, a text term appearing within the resource, a popularity of a resource based on the preferences of other users browsing via the network computing provider <b>107</b>, etc. In one embodiment, a network computing provider <b>107</b> may ignore previously encountered network resources or circular references when obtaining referenced network resource. In other embodiments, the historical browse storage component may retrieve referenced network resources in addition to or as an alternative to the network computing provider <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In one embodiment, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may only retrieve and/or process limited aspects of resources past a determined or specified depth threshold of references. For example, after following two levels of references, a network computing provider <b>107</b> may only request, process, and/or provide a corresponding historical content representation to the historical browse storage component for html and other textual content, and not include any representations of images or other embedded resources. Illustratively, a network computing provider <b>107</b> may be configured with any number of thresholds corresponding to limited content requests, processing and/or storage. Further, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may limit requests, processing, and/or storage to any number of different aspects of retrieved content including, but not limited to, html, text, metadata, URLs or references, or any other category or type of content, information, or characteristic of a resource.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">At block <b>916</b>, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may process the one or more network resources and associated embedded resources to determine a client remote session browse configuration for the processing and communication of content to the client computing device <b>102</b>. Illustratively, a historical remote session browse configuration may additionally be determined by the network computing provider as described here, or may be predefined for a network computing provider, user, browser, historical browse storage component, or other entity. As discussed above, a historical remote session browse configuration and a client remote session browse configuration may be the same or different in any aspect. A non-specific client and/or historical remote session browse configuration may be described herein as a generic &#x201c;remote session browse configuration&#x201d; and any discussion thereof may relate to either a historical remote session browse configuration or a client remote session browse configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Illustratively, a remote session browse configuration may include any proprietary or public remote protocol allowing exchange of data and user interactions or requests between a client and a remote server. The remote session browse configuration may illustratively include both a remote session communication protocol and a processing schema for providing processed (or unprocessed) content to a client computing device for display in the content display area of a browser.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In one embodiment, a remote session browse configuration may define or specify a remote session communication protocol, including, but not limited to, a network protocol, signaling model, transport mechanism, or encapsulation format for the exchange of state data, user interactions, and other data and content between the network computing provider and the client computing device. Examples of remote session communication protocols known in the art include Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), X-Windows protocol, Virtual Network Computing (VNC) protocol, Remote Frame Buffer protocol, HTML, etc. For example, RDP illustratively specifies a number of processing mechanisms for encoding client input (e.g., mouse movement, keyboard input, etc.) into protocol data units for provision to a remote computing device, and corresponding mechanisms for sending bitmap updates and low level interface information back to the client device. As another example, the HTML protocol illustratively provides a mechanism for providing files defining interface information and containing resource references from a server to a client, and a corresponding mechanism for a client computing device to provide requests for additional files and resources to the server. In one embodiment, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may provide an initial communication to the client computing device <b>102</b> after determining the remote session communication protocol. This initial communication may allow the client computing device <b>102</b> to prepare to receive communications in the selected remote session communication protocol, and, in the case of pull remote session communication protocols like HTTP, may cause the client computing device to send an initial resource request to the browse session instance running on the NCC POP <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Each remote session browse configuration may additionally define a split of processing actions between the network computing and storage service (e.g., NCC POP <b>142</b>) and the client computing device (e.g., client computing device <b>102</b>). In one embodiment, a particular split of processing actions may be based on or mandated by a particular remote session communication protocol. In another embodiment, a remote session communication protocol may allow several different splits of processing actions depending on the implementation or configuration of the protocol. For the purpose of illustration, many pieces of network content (e.g., Web pages, video, Flash documents) may require various processing actions before being displayed on a computing device. A Web page, for example, may be parsed to process various HTML layout information and references to associated resources or embedded content such as CSS style sheets and Javascript, as well as embedded content objects such as images, video, audio, etc. The HTML and each referenced object or piece of code will typically be parsed and processed before a representative object model corresponding to the Web page may be constructed. This object model may then be processed further for layout and display in a content display area of a browser at the client computing device <b>102</b>. Illustrative browser processing actions are described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. One of skill in the art will appreciate that, in the case of other embodiments or applications, various other processing actions may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">A remote session browse configuration may specify that various of the processing actions required for display of a piece of network content be performed at the remote computing device, such as the NCC POP <b>142</b>, rather than at the client computing device <b>102</b>. Network content partially (or wholly) processed at the network computing provider may be referred to as a processing result. As discussed below, the split of processing actions may be associated with or linked to the remote session communication protocol used for exchanging data and client input between the NCC POP <b>142</b> and client computing device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">For example, a remote session communication protocol, such as RDP, that transmits a processing result including low level interface information and bitmaps to the client computing device <b>142</b> for display may be associated with a remote session browse configuration that specifies performing all, or nearly all, of the necessary content processing actions at the NCC POP <b>142</b>. While using RDP, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may, for example, run a full instance of a browser at the NCC POP <b>142</b> and transmit a processing result consisting of bitmap updates corresponding to a representation of the displayed content to the client computing device <b>102</b>. The client computing device <b>102</b>, in this example, may merely be required to assemble the transmitted bitmap updates for display in the content display area of the browser, and may perform none of the processing of the actual HTML, JavaScript, or data objects involved in the display of an illustrative piece of network content. As another example, a remote session browse configuration utilizing a remote session communication protocol such as HTML may transmit network content in a largely unprocessed form. The client computing device <b>102</b> may thus perform all of the processing actions required for display of network content while the NCC POP <b>142</b> performs little or no processing.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The NCC POP <b>142</b> may base its determination of a remote session browse configuration on any number of factors, including, but not limited to, one or more characteristics of one or more of the requested resources, content provider <b>104</b>, or CDN service provider <b>106</b>, one or more characteristics of the content address or domain, one or more characteristics of the client computing device <b>102</b>, browser or application, user, one or more characteristics of the NCC POP <b>142</b>, or one or more characteristics of the network or network connection, etc. Characteristics of requested resources may include, but are not limited to, a data format, a content type, a size, processing requirements, resource latency requirements, a number or type of interactive elements, a security risk, an associated user preference, a network address, a network domain, an associated content provider, etc. Characteristics of a content provider <b>104</b>, CDN service provider <b>106</b>, computing device <b>102</b>, or NCC POP <b>142</b> may include, but are not limited to, processing power, memory, storage, network connectivity (e.g., available bandwidth or latency), a physical or logical location, predicted stability or risk of failure, a software or hardware profile, available resources (e.g., available memory or processing, or the number of concurrently open software applications), etc. The NCC POP <b>142</b> may further consider perceived security threats or risks associated with a piece of content or domain, preferences of a client computing device or a content provider, computing or network resource costs (e.g., a financial cost of processing or bandwidth, resource usage, etc.), predetermined preferences or selection information, any additional processing overhead required by a particular remote session browse configuration, a cache status (e.g., whether a particular resources is cached or stored at a NCC POP <b>142</b>, at the client computing device <b>102</b>, or at other network storage associated with the network computing provider), a predicted delay or time required to retrieve requested network content, a preferred content provider or agreements with a content provider for a particular remote session browse configuration or level of service, a remote session browse configuration being used for another (or the current) browse session by the same user, or any other factor.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, an NCC POP <b>142</b> may base a determination of a remote session browse configuration on past behavior or practice. For example, an NCC POP <b>142</b> that has determined a remote browse session configuration for a particular resource in the past may automatically select the same remote browse session configuration when the resource is requested by the same (or potentially a different) user. As another example, a user that has a history of frequently accessing Web sites with extensive processing requirements may automatically be assigned a remote session browse configuration that performs the majority of processing at the NCC POP <b>142</b>. In other embodiments, an NCC POP <b>142</b> may base a determination of a remote browse session configuration on predictions of future behavior. For example, an NCC POP <b>142</b> may base its determination of a remote browse session configuration for a particular resource on an analysis of past determinations made for a particular Web site, network domain, or set of related resources. A content provider that historically has provided video-heavy Web pages may be associated with a remote session browse configuration that emphasizes video performance at the client computing device <b>102</b>. Illustratively, past historical analysis and future predictions may be considered as one or more of a number of factors on which to base the remote session browse configuration determination process, or may be definitive in the decision making process. For example, once an NCC POP <b>142</b> determines a remote session browse configuration for a particular content provider, it may skip the remote session browse configuration determination process for any future resources served from the content provider. Illustratively, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may re-determine a remote session browse configuration to be associated with the content provider after a fixed period of time, or after the NCC POP <b>142</b> has identified or determined a change in the content being served by the content provider.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In other embodiments, a network resource, Web site, network domain, content provider, or other network entity may specify or otherwise request the use of a particular remote browse session configuration in a resource tag, metadata, or other communication with an NCC POP <b>142</b>. The NCC POP <b>142</b> may treat the request as definitive, or may consider the request as one of multiple factors to be considered in the decision making process.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">For example, a remote session browse configuration utilizing a remote session communication protocol such as RDP may specify extensive processing to occur at the network computing provider <b>107</b> (e.g., at NCC POP <b>142</b>) rather than at the client computing device <b>102</b>. The remote session browse configuration may thus leverage the processing power of the NCC POP <b>142</b> to achieve lower latencies and presentation delay when dealing with network content that requires a great deal of pre-processing (e.g., content with a great deal of CSS or JavaScript information defining page layout). The NCC POP <b>142</b> may therefore select a remote session browse configuration that performs a substantial amount of processing at the network computing provider <b>107</b> and utilizes RDP or a similar remote session communication protocol for communication of processing-intensive content. Conversely, a remote session browse configuration that utilizes a remote session communication protocol, such as HTML, may specify extensive processing at the client computing device <b>102</b> rather than at the network computing provider <b>107</b>. The remote session communication protocol may thus achieve smaller delays and smoother presentation when presented with simple network content that requires very little processing or network content that requires rapid change in displayed content after its initial load. For example, a Web page with embedded video may exhibit better performance when performing the majority of processing locally and utilizing HTML rather than RDP as a remote session communication protocol. A remote session browse configuration specifying extensive processing at the network computing provider <b>107</b> must process the video at the NCC POP <b>142</b> and rapidly send screen updates (e.g. by RDP) to the client computing device <b>102</b>, potentially requiring a great deal of bandwidth and causing choppy playback in the browser, while a remote session browse configuration specifying local processing may provide raw video information directly to the client computing device <b>102</b> for display (e.g. by HTML), allowing for client side caching and a smoother playback of content.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As a further example, the NCC POP <b>142</b> in communication with a client computing device <b>102</b> with extremely limited processing power may elect to use a remote session browse configuration that requires very little processing by the client computing device, for example, using RDP to transmit NCC POP <b>142</b> processed results. Conversely, an NCC POP <b>142</b> providing an extremely interactive Web page may elect to use a remote session browse configuration that allows the client computing device <b>102</b> to handle user interactions locally in order to preserve interface responsiveness, for example, using HTML to transmit substantially unprocessed data. As a still further example, an NCC POP <b>142</b> may base the determination of a remote session browse configuration on preferences provided by the client computing device <b>102</b>. A client computing device <b>102</b> may illustratively include preferences for a remote session browse configuration in an initial browse session request, or at any other time. The NCC POP <b>142</b> may utilize these preferences as an alternative to, or in addition to any other factor or decision metric. Illustratively, allowing the client computing device <b>102</b> to set or influence the selection of a remote session browse configuration allows the NCC POP <b>142</b> to take user preferences into account when determining a remote session browse configuration. For example, a user worried about initial page load times may prefer to use a remote session browse configuration heavy on remote processing and utilizing an RDP remote session communications protocol, while a user wishing to maintain an extremely responsive interface may prefer using a remote session browse configuration that performs the majority of the processing on the client computing device <b>102</b>, for example, using an HTML remote session communication protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Illustratively, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may base a determination of a remote browsing configuration on any factor or combination of factors. For example, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may select a remote session browse configuration based on a single factor, or may assign weights to one or more factors in making a determination. In some embodiments, the determination process of the NCC POP <b>142</b> may change based on one or more factors described above. For example, an NCC POP <b>142</b> communicating with a client computing device <b>102</b> over a network with a surplus of unused bandwidth may give a low weight to factors such as the network requirements of a remote browse session, and may give a higher weight to factors such as the latency of page interactions, while an NCC POP <b>142</b> communicating with a client computing device <b>102</b> over a limited bandwidth network may give a higher weight to factors dealing with the efficiency of the remote session browse protocol over a network.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In one embodiment, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may select a single remote session browse configuration for a set of network content. For example, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may select a single remote session browse configuration for a requested network resource such as a Web page. The NCC POP <b>142</b> may thus process the Web page together with all embedded content based on the selected remote browsing session protocol, and utilize the remote browsing session protocol to exchange user interaction data and updated browse session data for all embedded content associated with the Web page. In another embodiment, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may select different remote session browse configurations for one or more resources in a set of network content. For example, a network resource such as a Web page may reference processing intensive embedded JavaScript or CSS resources, as well as embedded video resources. The NCC POP <b>142</b> may select a first remote session browse configuration for the Web page and all embedded resources, excluding the embedded video resource, and a second remote session browse configuration for the embedded video resource. Illustratively, this may result in the NCC POP <b>142</b> utilizing RDP to send a processing result to the client computing device <b>102</b> for display of the Web page and associated embedded resources, while utilizing HTTP to send the embedded video as a separate, unprocessed file. In one embodiment, the client computing device <b>102</b> may perform the minimal processing required to display the RDP processing result corresponding to the Web page and embedded resources, and may also perform additional processing necessary to display the embedded video, for example, overlaying the video on top of the displayed RDP representation of the Web page. Any number of remote session browse configurations may be selected to correspond to any number of resources or objects included in a set of network content, regardless of whether resources or objects are obtained from a content provider <b>104</b> or CDN service provider <b>106</b> in one or more logical files or data structures.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Although the selection of a remote session browse configuration is illustratively depicted herein as occurring after all network resources and associated embedded content have been obtained by the NCC POP <b>142</b>, one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the selection of a remote session browse configuration may be performed at any time. For example, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may select a remote session browse configuration after receiving a new browse session request or related information from the client computing device, may select a remote session browse configuration after obtaining a network resource, but before obtaining any associated embedded resources, or at any other time. In some embodiments, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may switch to a new remote session browse configuration at some time subsequent to the client computing device <b>102</b> obtaining an initial processing result. Illustratively, the NCC POP <b>142</b> selecting a new remote session browse configuration may occur automatically after a certain time period or event or in response to a change in network conditions, NCC POP <b>142</b> or client computing device <b>102</b> load or computing resources, or any other factor described above as potentially influencing the choice of remote session browse configuration. Illustratively, an NCC POP <b>142</b> dealing with other types or formats of information may select a remote session protocol based on any number of similar factors. For example, one of skill in the relevant art will appreciate that a similar schema may be developed for the processing of images, video, audio, database information, 3d design data, or any other file format or type of data known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The client computing device <b>102</b> may, in various embodiments, further instantiate a parallel browsing process sequentially or simultaneously with the request for a remote browse session. In one embodiment, a client computing device <b>102</b> may instantiate a traditional local browse session as known in the art (e.g., providing content requests from the browser and processing obtained resources locally) in addition to one or more remote browse instance executing at an NCC POP <b>142</b>. In another embodiment, a client computing device <b>102</b> may be provided with unprocessed network resources by the NCC POP <b>142</b>. Illustratively, the network resources may have been retrieved from one or more content providers, CDNs, or cache or storage components by the NCC POP <b>142</b>. The resources may be provided to the client computing device <b>102</b> to process locally in parallel with the remote browse instance executing at the NCC POP <b>142</b>. In still further embodiments, the network computing provider or NCC POP <b>142</b> may instantiate any number of new virtual machine instances and/or browser instances (or make use of existing instantiated instances) to process resources and/or send processing results to the client computing device <b>102</b> in parallel. Illustratively, the local browse session at the client computing device <b>102</b> and the remote browse session instance at the NCC POP <b>142</b> may execute in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In one embodiment, a local browse session executing at the client computing device <b>102</b> may obtain unprocessed content (e.g., html Web pages, embedded content, and other network resources) from the NCC POP <b>142</b> responsive to a browse session request. Illustratively, the content may have been retrieved by the NCC POP <b>142</b> from a content provider, CDN, cache, or data store in response to the browse session request. The unprocessed content provided by the NCC POP <b>142</b> may include all the content associated with the browse session request or may supplement content existing in a cache or data store of the client computing device, retrieved from a content provider or CDN, or obtained from some other source. In one embodiment, a client computing device <b>102</b> may obtain all requested content from a local cache or data store, and may not obtain any unprocessed resources or content from the NCC POP <b>142</b>. Subsequent to obtaining the unprocessed content, client computing device <b>102</b> may process the requested content in parallel with a remote browse session executing at the NCC POP <b>142</b>. For example, as the local browse session executing at the client computing device <b>102</b> is processing the requested content, a remote browse session executing at the NCC POP <b>142</b> may be processing the same content at substantially the same time. Once the NCC POP <b>142</b> has performed a set of processing actions on the content to generate a processing result (e.g., as specified by a determined remote session browse configuration), the NCC POP <b>142</b> may provide the processing result to the client computing device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">For the purpose of illustration, a client computing device <b>102</b> may require a longer load time to obtain and process requested network resources than a browse session instance running at the NCC POP <b>142</b>. For example, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may obtain and process content quickly due to its position on the network and the relative processing power of the local client computing device as compared to the NCC POP <b>142</b>. Even if the NCC POP <b>142</b> provides the client computing device <b>102</b> with all requested network content, the client computing device <b>102</b> may still obtain a processing result from NCC POP <b>142</b> before the local browse session has fully completed processing the requested resources. The client computing device <b>102</b> may complete any further processing steps and display the obtained processing result before completing local processing and display of the content. Illustratively, this may allow the client computing device <b>102</b> to take advantage of an NCC POP <b>142</b>'s quicker content load time relative to a traditional local browse session. Prior to the local browse session completing the processing of all requested resources, the browser may process any user interactions locally and/or remotely as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Once the local browse session has fully obtained and processed resources corresponding to the requested content, the computing device <b>102</b> may determine whether to continue to display results obtained from the NCC POP <b>142</b> (and process user interactions at the NCC POP <b>142</b>) using the determined remote session browse configuration, or switch to processing user interactions locally. Switching to process user interactions locally may include replacing a displayed representation of the requested resources based on a processing result obtained from the NCC POP <b>142</b> with a local display of the requested resources. For example, a browser may display a representation of a Web page corresponding to a processing result from the NCC POP <b>142</b> (e.g., RDP display information representing the rendered page) until the browser is finished processing and rendering the Web page locally. The browser may then replace the representation from the NCC POP <b>142</b> with the locally rendered representation of the Web page. Illustratively, replacing one representation with another representation may be transparent to the user. For example, the local and NCC POP <b>142</b> representations of the Web page may be identical or substantially identical. In one embodiment, when the NCC POP <b>142</b> representation of the web page is displayed, the browser may send various user interactions with the displayed page to the NCC POP <b>142</b> for processing. When the locally rendered version of the Web page is displayed, user interactions may be processed locally at the browser. Illustratively, the determination of which representation of the requested resources to display (e.g., local or from the NCC POP <b>142</b>) may be based on any of the same factors described with reference to determining a remote session browse protocol in above.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In one embodiment, the client computing device <b>102</b> may switch to processing user interactions locally as soon as local resources are fully loaded. Illustratively, the remote browse session instance running at the NCC POP <b>142</b> may be terminated after switching to local processing, or the remote browse session instance may be maintained as a backup in case of unresponsiveness or a failure with regards to the local browse session. For example, the client computing device <b>102</b> may process user interactions locally, as well as sending remote user interaction data to the NCC POP <b>142</b> in accordance with the selected remote session browse configuration. The remote user interaction data may be used by the NCC POP <b>142</b> to keep the remote browse session instance fully in parallel with the local browse process being executed by the browser at the client computing device <b>102</b>. As long as the local browse session continues to handle user interactions, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may either refrain from sending updated processing results, or may send updated processing results ignored by the client computing device <b>102</b>. If a problem develops with the local browse session at the client computing device <b>102</b>, updated processing results may be provided to the client computing device <b>102</b> from the NCC POP <b>142</b> for processing and display in lieu of the local browse session. Illustratively, this switch from the local browse session to remote processing may be transparent to the user. In some embodiments, the client computing device <b>102</b> may switch from a local browse session to a remote browse session instance based on factors other than unresponsiveness or failure at the local browser. For example, the client computing device <b>102</b> or network computing and storage component <b>107</b> may select between a remote and local browse session based on any of the factors enumerated with regard to determining a remote session browse protocol above.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In another embodiment, the client computing device <b>102</b> may continue to process and display updated processing results from the NCC POP <b>142</b> even after the local browse session has fully loaded the requested content. The client computing device <b>102</b> may terminate the local browse session or may run the local browse session in parallel as a backup process, in the converse of the example provided above. It should be appreciated that although the local browse session is described here, for the purpose of illustration, as being slower to load than the remote browse session instance, in some embodiments the local browse session may load the content faster than the remote browsing session, in which case the browser may process user interactions locally until the remote browse process has fully loaded the requested content. In some embodiments, the client computing device <b>102</b> may display and process user interactions through whichever browse session, local or remote, loads the requested content first.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In various other embodiments, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may instantiate multiple remote browse session instances to run in parallel in addition to, or as an alternative to, instantiating a local browse session. Illustratively, these parallel browse session instances may utilize any of the same or different remote session browse protocols, and may act as backups in the manner described above with regard to a local browse session, or may be used and switched between as alternatives in order to maximize browser performance at the client computing device <b>102</b>. For example, in response to one or more browse session requests, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may instantiate a browse session instance running on a first NCC POP and utilizing an RDP protocol, as well as a browse session instance running on a second NCC POP utilizing an X-Windows protocol. The client computing device <b>102</b> or the network computing provider <b>107</b> may determine which browse session instance and protocol should be used based on performance or resource usage considerations as described with regard to determining a remote session browse protocol above.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, at block <b>918</b>, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may process the obtained content, including the one or more requested network resources and embedded network resources, according to the client determined remote session browse configuration to generate an initial processing result. The network computing provider <b>107</b> may further process the obtained content, including the one or more requested network resources and embedded network resources according to the determined historical remote session browse configuration to generate an initial processing result corresponding to a historical content representation. In one embodiment, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may only process the obtained content one time. For example, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may perform processing steps specified by the client remote session browse configuration to obtain a first processing result, and then may perform any remain processing steps to obtain the historical content representation, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In one embodiment, the historical content representation may include additional information, including, but not limited to, information associated with the network resource request, the network resource, content associated with the network resource, the client computing device <b>102</b>, a user, the network computing provider <b>107</b> or any other entity, content, or component. In one embodiment, the historical content representation may include information associated with a position on a browsing or navigation path as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. For example, a second historical content representation may include information specifying that the client computing device followed a reference from a first network resource (e.g., corresponding to a first historical content representation) to get to a network resource corresponding to the second historical content representation.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In further embodiments, the historical content representation may include any number of types of information including, but not limited to: an amount of time spent viewing or interacting with content corresponding to the historical content representation; notes, markups, or other user generated content or information associated with the historical content representation; resource usage or performance metrics associated with processing of the content corresponding to the historical content representation at a network computing provider <b>107</b> or client computing device <b>102</b>; a latency or other network performance metric associated with the transmission of the content corresponding to the historical content representation; a physical or logical location associated with the request for the network resource; an identifier associated with the content corresponding to the historical content representation; advertisements associated with the content corresponding to the historical content representation; and/or any other type of information. For example, in one embodiment, a user may be provided with an interface for adding notes to a Web page. Illustratively, these notes may be stored with or included within the historical content representation of the Web page, along with any other type of information associated with the Web page as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">At block <b>920</b>, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may provide the initial processing result to the client for further processing and display in the content display area of the browser. For the purposes of further example, an illustrative client new browse session interaction routine <b>1000</b> implemented by client computing device <b>102</b> is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In one embodiment, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may determine whether to refrain from processing content to generate a historical content representation and/or providing the processed historical content representation to the historical browse storage component based on any number of factors. Illustratively, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may refrain from processing and/or storing a historical content representation based on factors including, without limitation, any of the factors discussed above with reference to determining a remote browse session configuration as discussed in block <b>916</b>, etc. For example, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may refrain from storing historical content representations corresponding to a particular Web site or domain on a network. In another example, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may refrain from storing historical content representations associated with secure or sensitive information associated with a user of the client computing device <b>102</b>. In a further embodiment, the determination of whether to process or store a historical content representation may be made by a historical content filter component or service associated with the network computing provider <b>107</b>, the historical browse storage component, or any other third party.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">At block <b>922</b>, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may provide the historical content representation to the historical browse storage component.

<p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow diagram illustrative of a client new browse session interaction routine <b>1000</b> implemented by client computing device <b>102</b>. New browse session interaction routine <b>1000</b> begins at block <b>1002</b> in response to an event or user request causing the client computing device <b>102</b> to load a browser for viewing network content. At block <b>1004</b>, the client computing device loads locally managed components of the browser, including all local interface components. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, local interface components may include toolbars, menus, buttons, or other user interface controls managed and controlled by the software browser application or any other process executing or implemented locally at the client computing device. At block <b>1006</b>, the client computing device <b>102</b> provides a request for a new browse session instance to the network computing provider <b>107</b>. From the perspective of the user of the client computing device, the request for the new browse session corresponds to the intended request to transmit the request to one or more corresponding content providers <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, the new session request may correspond to a request to load a file or other document (e.g., a request to load an image in a photo-editing application, etc.). Illustratively, the request may be generated automatically as a result of the browser loading (e.g., a request for a default or &#x201c;home&#x201d; page), or may be generated as a result of a user following a link or entering a network address into an address bar. As illustrated with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the browse session request is transmitted first to a network computing provider <b>107</b>. In an illustrative embodiment, the network computing provider <b>107</b> utilizes a registration API to accept browse session requests from the client computing device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">A browse session request may include any number of pieces of data or information including, but not limited to, information associated with a user, information associated with the client computing device <b>102</b> or software on the client computing device (e.g., hardware or software information, a device physical or logical location, etc.), information associated with the network <b>108</b>, user or browser preferences (e.g., a requested remote session browse protocol, a preference list, a decision tree, or other information), information associated with the network computing provider <b>107</b>, information associated with one or more pieces of requested network content (e.g., the network address of a network resource), etc. For example, a browse session request from the client computing device <b>102</b> may include information identifying a particular client computing device hardware specification or a hardware performance level, latency and bandwidth data associated with recent content requests, a desired security level for processing different types of content, a predetermined preference list of remote session browse protocols, and one or more network addresses corresponding to requested network resources, among others. In another example, the browse session request can include information identifying a client computing device <b>102</b> screen resolution, aspect ratio, or browser display area in the browse session request, which may allow the network computing provider <b>107</b> to customize the processing of network content for display on the client computing device. As previously described, the browse session request can include network address information corresponding to a requested network resource, which may be in any form including, but not limited to, an Internet Protocol (&#x201c;IP&#x201d;) address, a URL, a Media Access Control (&#x201c;MAC&#x201d;) address, etc. In one embodiment, the request for a new browse session instance may correspond to the network computing provider receiving a request for a new browse session instance at block <b>904</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> above.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">At block <b>1008</b>, the client computing device <b>102</b> obtains an initial processing result from the network computing provider <b>107</b>. Illustratively, the format and data included in the initial processing result may vary based on the remote session browse configuration selected by the network computing provider <b>107</b>. In one embodiment, the initial processing result may include or be preceded by data informing the client computing device <b>102</b> of the choice of remote session browse configuration and/or establishing a connection over the remote session communication protocol corresponding to the selected remote session browse configuration. As discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the obtained initial processing result may include requested content with one or more processing actions performed by the network computing provider <b>107</b>. Subsequent to obtaining the initial processing result, the client computing device <b>102</b> may perform any remaining processing actions on the initial processing result at block <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">At block <b>1012</b>, the client computing device <b>102</b> displays the content corresponding to the processed initial processing result. For example, the client computing device <b>102</b> may display the processed client in the content display area <b>702</b> of a browser <b>700</b> as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> above. In one embodiment, the processing result may only include display data corresponding to content displayed by a browser, and may not include display data corresponding to, for example, the interface controls of a browser instance at the NCC POP <b>142</b>, the desktop of a virtual machine instance corresponding to the browse session, or any other user interface of the NCC POP <b>142</b>. For example, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may process a Web page and associated content for display via RDP in a browser instance running in a virtual machine instance at the NCC POP <b>142</b>. The browser instance may have one or more interface elements such as toolbars, menus, scroll bars, etc., in addition to the displayed Web page. The NCC POP <b>142</b> may send an RDP processing result corresponding to the displayed Web page only, without any of the interface elements associated with the browser. Illustratively, including an RDP processing result corresponding to the displayed Web page only may allow the browser at the client computing instance <b>102</b> to display the Web page by assembling the RDP processing result in the content display area of the browser without any further processing. In another embodiment, the RDP processing result may include a full virtual machine desktop and browser window corresponding to the full interface displayed at the NCC POP <b>142</b> browse session instance. The client computing device may automatically identify the area of the RDP processing result corresponding to the requested content, and may display only this area in the content display area of the browser.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">At block <b>1014</b>, the client computing device <b>102</b> processes local and remote user interactions. An illustrative routine for processing user interactions is provided below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. At block <b>1016</b> the routine ends. Illustratively, a browse session instance instantiated by the network computing provider <b>107</b> may terminate when a browser window or content display area is closed, may terminate when a remote session browse protocol is replaced by a parallel process at the client computing device <b>102</b>, or may terminate in accordance with a timer or other event. Illustratively, if a browse session has terminated automatically due to a time-out, but has associated content still displayed in a browser at the client computing device <b>102</b>, later attempts by the user to interact with the content may result in a new browse session request being provided to the network computing provider <b>107</b> to start a new browse session according to the last state of the terminated session. Illustratively, terminating a remote browse session after a time-out may allow the network computing provider <b>107</b> to save computing resources at the NCC POP. In one embodiment, this process may be transparent to the user at client computing device <b>102</b>, even though the remote browse session has been terminated during the intervening period.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow diagram illustrative of a process user interaction routine <b>1100</b> implemented by a client computing device <b>102</b>. Process user interaction routine <b>1100</b> begins at block <b>1102</b> in response to an interaction by a user. Illustratively, process user interaction routine <b>1100</b> may begin subsequent to the display of content in a content display area of a browser interface. For example, process user interaction routine <b>1100</b> may correspond to block <b>1014</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> above.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Illustratively, the displayed content may have one or more interactive elements, such as forms, buttons, animations, etc. User interaction with these interactive elements may require processing and display of updated content in the content display area. For example, selecting an element in a drop-down menu on a Web page may require processing and may change the configuration or visual appearance of the Web page or embedded resources. Illustratively, the processing required by user interaction with the displayed content may be handled as a local user interaction at the client computing device <b>102</b>, or as a remote user interaction at the NCC POP <b>142</b>, depending on the remote session browse configuration in use. For example, if a remote session browse configuration utilizing substantial local processing (e.g., sending unprocessed files over HTML) is utilized, user interactions with displayed content may typically be handled as local user interactions at the client computing device <b>102</b>. Illustratively, handling user interactions with displayed content as local user interactions at the client computing device <b>102</b> may allow for better responsiveness and fewer delays with simple user interactions (e.g., selection of a radio button, or typing text into a field), as interaction data corresponding to the interaction does not need to be sent to the NCC POP <b>142</b> for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As a further example, if a remote session browse configuration utilizing heavy remote processing of content (e.g., sending processed bitmap data over RDP) is being used as the remote session browse configuration, all user interactions with displayed content may be handled as remote user interactions. For example, user input (e.g., keyboard inputs and cursor positions) may be encapsulated in RDP protocol data units and transmitted across network <b>108</b> to the NCC POP <b>142</b> for processing. Illustratively, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may apply the user interactions to the network content and transmit processing results consisting of updated bitmaps and interface data corresponding to an updated representation of the content back to the client computing device <b>102</b>. Illustratively, handling user interactions with displayed content as remote user interactions at the NCC POP <b>142</b> may have a negative impact on interface responsiveness, as data is required to pass over the network and is limited by network latency; however, user interactions that require a substantial amount of processing may perform better when handled as remote user interactions, as the processing latency of the NCC POP <b>142</b> may be substantially lower than the processing latency of the client computing device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In addition to a content display area for displaying network content, a browser may have one or more local interface components, such as toolbars, menus, buttons, or other user interface controls. Interactions with local interface components may be treated as local user interactions or remote user interactions depending on the processing required by the interaction and the remote session browse configuration, as further depicted in illustrative <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. For example, some local interface components may be managed locally by browser code running on the client computing device, while other local interface components may have one or more locally managed aspects (e.g., button click feedback, scroll bar redraw, etc), and one or more remotely managed aspects treated as remote user interactions (e.g., page refresh, requesting a page at an address in an address bar, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">At block <b>1104</b>, the client computing device <b>102</b> obtains a user interaction from the user. This user interaction may be an interaction with local interface components as described above and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, or may be an interaction with any interactive elements of the content displayed in the content display area of the browser, such as form fields, buttons, animations, etc. User interaction with these local interface components or interactive elements of displayed content may require local and/or remote processing, depending on the nature of the component or element and the processing split specified by the remote session browse configuration as described above and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. At block <b>1106</b>, the client computing device <b>102</b> determines the interaction processing requirements for the obtained user interaction. At decision block <b>1108</b>, if the user interaction has local aspects (e.g., button click feedback, a change to a local browser state, a content element being processed at the client computing device, etc.), the routine <b>1102</b> moves to block <b>1110</b> to process the local aspect or aspects of the user interaction at the client computing device <b>102</b> and subsequently update the local interface components at block <b>1112</b>. Illustratively, and as discussed above, aspects of the interaction and updating interface components and elements locally allows a browser to provide responsive user interfaces and content. Subsequent to processing local aspect(s) of the user interaction, or if the user interaction has no local elements (e.g., a user interaction with a content element displayed in the content display area when using a remote session browse configuration processing entirely on the server side and utilizing an RDP remote session communication protocol) the routine <b>1102</b> moves to decision block <b>1114</b>. If the user interaction has remote aspects that require processing, the routine <b>1102</b> moves to block <b>1116</b> and provides remote user interaction data to the network computing provider <b>107</b>. Illustratively, in the case of a heavily server side remote session browse configuration utilizing an RDP remote session communication protocol, the remote user interaction data may include input data such as a cursor position or keyboard input encapsulated in one or more RDP protocol data units. In some embodiments of remote session browse configurations utilizing RDP or other remote session communication protocols, particular aspects of remote user interaction data, such as cursor positions, may be provided to the network computing provider <b>107</b> on a continuous basis, while in other embodiments of remote session browse configurations, remote user interaction data may only be provided to the network computing provider <b>107</b> when associated with a user interaction that requires remote processing.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">At block <b>1118</b>, the client computing device <b>102</b> obtains an updated processing result from the network computing provider <b>107</b>, the network computing provider <b>107</b> having processed the remote user interaction data to generate an updated representation of the content. At block <b>1120</b>, the client computing device <b>102</b> performs any additional processing required on the updated processing result (based on the remote session browse configuration), and at block <b>1122</b> displays the updated processing result in the content display area of the browser. At block <b>1124</b> the process user interaction routine <b>1102</b> ends. Illustratively, the routine may be executed again any number of times in response to further user interactions with the browser and displayed content.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a block diagram of the content delivery environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrating the generation and processing of a new historical content request from a client computing device <b>102</b> to a network computing provider <b>107</b> will be described. The process can begin with the generation and processing of a historical content request from a client computing device <b>102</b> to a network computing provider <b>107</b>. Illustratively, this request may be generated automatically as a result of a search for historical content, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> below, or may be generated as a result of a user following a reference to a piece of historical content, selecting historical content from a list or tree diagram, or in response to any other user interaction or system or browser request. For example, in one embodiment a first user may provide a reference such as an identifier or network address information corresponding to a historical content representation to a second user at a client computing device <b>102</b>. Illustratively, the historical content representation may correspond to a Web page or other network resource previously accessed or viewed by the first user. With regards to this example, the client computing device <b>102</b> may process the reference to generate a historical content request.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, subsequent to the client computing device <b>102</b> generating or obtaining a historical content request, the historical content request may be transmitted first to a network computing provider <b>107</b>. In an illustrative embodiment, the network computing provider <b>107</b> utilizes a registration application program interface (&#x201c;API&#x201d;) to accept historical content requests from the client computing device <b>102</b>. The historical content request can include an identifier or network address information corresponding to a historical content representation, which may be in any form, including, but not limited to, an alphanumeric code consisting of any combination of characters, an Internet Protocol (&#x201c;IP&#x201d;) address, a URL, a Media Access Control (&#x201c;MAC&#x201d;) address, etc. The historical content request may further include information identifying a user, browser, client computing device <b>102</b>, and/or any other browsing entity.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Subsequent to the receipt of the browse session request, the network computing provider <b>107</b> may identify a historical browse storage component based on any combination of the identifying information and identifier or network address information corresponding to the historical content representation in the browse session request. In one embodiment, the network computing and storage component may process the identifying information or request additional information from the client computing device <b>102</b> to determine that the client computing device <b>102</b> is authorized to request the historical content representation.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Illustratively, and for the purposes of example with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, we may assume that the network computing provider identifies a historical browse storage component implemented at a NCC POP <b>142</b>. As discussed above, a historical browse storage component may, in various embodiments, be implemented, associated, and/or provided by any combination of devices and/or entities. In one embodiment, the NCC POP <b>142</b> may provide historical remote session browse configuration information to the client computing device <b>102</b> related to the forthcoming transmission and processing of the requested historical content representation.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The NCC POP <b>142</b> may provide the requested historical content representation to the client computing device on the basis of the historical remote session browse configuration information. The historical content representation may correspond to requested historical content, such as a Web page. In one embodiment, the historical content representation may include representations of any embedded resources associated with the historical content (e.g., embedded content on the requested Web page). In another embodiment, the historical content representation may contain embedded references to other historical content representations associated with embedded content for retrieval by the client computing device <b>102</b>. Subsequent to receiving the historical content representation, the client computing device <b>102</b> may perform any remaining processing actions on the initial processing result as required by the historical remote session browse configuration, and may display the fully processed content in a content display area of a browser.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In another embodiment, a historical content request may correspond to a request to delete or otherwise remove a historical content result. For example, a client computing device <b>102</b> may provide a request to delete a historical content result from storage. Illustratively, responsive to the request to delete the historical content result, the network computing and storage provider <b>107</b> and/or NCC POP <b>142</b> may delete the specified historical content result from one or more data stores and/or delete an association between the client computing device <b>102</b> or associated user and the historical content result.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a branch diagram illustrative of a network resource navigation path <b>1300</b> will be described. Illustratively, as described above, a client computing device <b>102</b> may obtain and display representations of network content such as network resources <b>1302</b>-<b>1314</b>. In one embodiment, one or more of network resources <b>1302</b>-<b>1304</b> may include one or more references to other network resources. For the purposes of a specific example, network resource <b>1302</b> may, in one embodiment, be a Web page with a number of hyperlinks to other Web pages. In one embodiment, a user may follow a reference from a network resource from a browser to obtain a representation of the referenced network resource. As discussed above, each network resource <b>1302</b>-<b>1314</b> may be associated with one or more same or different remote browse sessions at the network computing provider <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Illustratively, a user may sequentially follow a link in a browser at client computing device <b>102</b>. For example, a user may click a link at a representation of network resource <b>1302</b> that may cause the browser to replace the representation of network resource <b>1302</b> in the content display area of the browser with a representation of network resource <b>1304</b>. In this manner, the user may sequentially browse through network content. Illustratively, we may refer to this chain of references as a browsing path or navigation path. For example, the user may follow a sequential navigation path by viewing a representation of network resource <b>1302</b>, followed by network resource <b>1304</b>, followed by <b>1306</b>, and followed by <b>1308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In another embodiment, a user may follow a link in parallel to a sequential navigation path <b>1302</b>-<b>1308</b>. For example, a user may follow a link on a Web page to open up a new tab, frame, window, or other organizational grouping on a browser at client computing device <b>102</b>. Accordingly, a user may follow a reference from a network resource <b>1304</b> to open a new tab displaying a representation of network resource <b>1312</b>, and may subsequently sequentially follow a reference to a network resource <b>1314</b>. As another example, a user may follow a reference from a network resource <b>1306</b> to open a new tab displaying a representation of a network resource <b>1310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In one embodiment, a historical browse storage component may obtain and store data allowing the recreation of logical browse paths such as the browse path depicted for purposes of illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In one embodiment, references followed to and/or from a piece of content may be stored with a historical content representation corresponding to the content. In another embodiment, a historical browse storage component may independently maintain a reference and/or path associated with a historical navigation path.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Illustratively, a browser at a client computing device <b>102</b> may, in one embodiment, have an interface control or function that allows the display of a historical browse path. Illustratively, a historical browse path may be displayed as a branch or tree diagram as depicted here for purposes of illustration, a list, a table, or in any other representation as known in the art. In one embodiment, references between network resources or representations of the network resources themselves may be displayed with visual indications of a type of content, the appearance of one or more search terms, a previously viewed status, a popularity based on the viewing behavior of other users, or any other characteristic or related aspect of information.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a branch diagram illustrative of a network resource navigation path <b>1400</b> depicting network resource reference levels will be described. Illustratively, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a user browsing network content at a client computing device <b>102</b> may follow references between network resources in a navigation path. In one embodiment, each network resource may have any number of references to other network resources. As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a network computing and storage component <b>107</b> or historical browse storage component may be configured to retrieve and store representations of network resources directly or indirectly referenced by a network resource requested by a client computing device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">For the purpose of illustration, a user at a browser at client computing device <b>102</b> may browse network resources in a browse path from network resource <b>1402</b> to network resource <b>1406</b> to network resource <b>1418</b> to network resource <b>1430</b>. In one embodiment, representations of each of these network resources <b>1402</b>, <b>1406</b>, <b>1418</b>, and <b>1430</b> may be stored and indexed at a historical browse storage component. Each network resource <b>1402</b>, <b>1406</b>, <b>1418</b>, and <b>1430</b> may reference any number of other network resources, such as one or more of network resources <b>1404</b>, <b>1408</b>, <b>1416</b>, <b>1420</b>, <b>1432</b>, and <b>1434</b>.

In one embodiment, references between network resources or representations of the network resources themselves may be displayed with visual indications of a type of content, the appearance of one or more search terms, a previously viewed status, a popularity based on the viewing behavior of other users, or any other characteristic or related aspect of information.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, a user interface diagram depicting an illustrative historical browse search interface <b>1500</b> is described. In one embodiment, the search interface <b>1500</b> may be accessible from a browser running on client computing device <b>102</b>, or any other application or service. Various aspects of functionality corresponding to the search interface <b>1500</b> may be provided by any number of different software applications, network components, and/or service providers through one or more interfaces, APIs, browser plugins, or other means of access. In one embodiment, the search interface <b>1500</b> may allow a user to search for historical content representations stored at a historical browse storage component and corresponding to past viewed and/or referenced network resources.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may include fields for searching any number of characteristics of stored historical content representations or corresponding network resources. Fields for searching characteristics of stored historical content representations may include, but are not limited to, a text search field <b>1502</b>, and a date search field <b>1504</b>. In various other embodiments, the search interface <b>1500</b> may further include means (not shown) for searching based on any combination of content type, specific browse session, software browser, user, metadata, tags, or any other characteristic associated with a network resource.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may include a browsing device search field <b>1506</b> for specifying a client computing device originally used to view the network resource. For example, a user may originally have viewed and/or requested a network resource on his home computer. The user may subsequently search for a historical content representation of the network resource filtering the results by content that he originally viewed on his home computer. Illustratively, a client computing device may be identified in any number of ways as known in the art, including, but not limited to, identification by a MAC ID or IP address, a serial number, a browser cookie, and/or any number of identifiers associated with client computing device hardware or software. In one embodiment, one or more alternate identifiers (e.g., descriptions, names, icons, etc.) may be associated with one or more devices in order to allow a user to easily specify a particular device.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may further include a location search field <b>1508</b> for specifying a location at which a network resource was originally viewed or requested. In various embodiments, the location search field may allow a user to enter a physical or logical location. Illustratively, search results may be filtered for content that was originally viewed at the specified location. In one embodiment, one or more alternate identifiers (e.g., descriptions, names, icons, etc.) may be associated with one or more physical or logical locations in order to allow a user to easily specify a particular location. In other embodiments, a user may enter any number of other location identifiers, including, but not limited to, Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, latitude and longitude, address, IP address, network domain, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may further include a control <b>1510</b> for searching based on a specific historical content representation or network resource. For example, in one embodiment, a user may right-click on a historical content representation or a representation of a network resource displayed in a browser and select a search based on page option. Illustratively, identifying information for the network resource provided in the control <b>1510</b> may be accompanied by a network resource preview <b>1514</b> or other representation of the network resource in the search interface <b>1500</b>. Illustratively, a search based on a page may return historical content representations associated with any number of characteristics or information shared or similar to the searched page. These characteristics or information may include text content, dates, content types, a browse session in which the network resource was encountered, tags, metadata, user ID, a browser, a client computing device, a common sequential or parallel navigation path, etc. For example, illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may further include a navigation path results control <b>1512</b>. Illustratively, the navigation path results control <b>1512</b> may allow a user to filter search results by historical content representations of content originally in the same navigation path as a network resource or historical content representation selected in control <b>1510</b>. In one embodiment, the user may filter the search results for historical content representations of content either prior or subsequent to the selected network resource or historical content representation in a navigation path.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Although not shown here for purposes of clarity, the illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may further include an option or control allowing a user to restrict or filter results to past versions of a page selected in control <b>1510</b>. For example, a user may have visited a Web page dedicated to breaking news a number of times in the past. Accordingly, the Web page may have contained different information each time it was viewed. Illustratively, the user may choose to limit a search to stored historical content representations of past versions of the Web page in order to find a specific story or news item.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may further include a control <b>1512</b> allowing a user to select between returning only historical content representations and returning a mix of historical content representations and current content from the network (e.g., a current Web search). In one embodiment, a depth of search field <b>1514</b> may allow a user to specify how many levels of referenced network resources to search, as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 14</figref>. For example, zero levels may indicate that the search should only return historical content representations corresponding to actually viewed network resources.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Still further, illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may include a recommended results control <b>1516</b> for specifying that only recommended results should be returned by a search. In one embodiment, recommended results may correspond to historical content representations of network resources that have been ranked highly by other users, by a network computing and storage component <b>107</b>, by the user at client computing device <b>102</b>, by the historical browse storage component itself, or any other entity. In a further embodiment, recommended results may be based on the browsing behavior of past users.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may further include an unseen results control <b>1518</b> for specifying that only unseen results should be returned by a search. Illustratively, selecting this option may cause the search to return only historical content representations corresponding to referenced network resources (e.g., up to a level of references specified in control <b>1514</b> above), and not to display historical content representations corresponding to network resources that the client computing device <b>102</b> actually displayed (e.g., network resources on a user's historical browse path).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Although not depicted here for purposes of clarity, illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may further include one or more controls or user interface options allowing a user to filter by a number of times a network resource or other piece of content has been viewed by a user or client computing device in the past. Illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may still further include one or more controls or user interface options allowing a user to search by an amount of time spent viewing or interacting with a network resource or other piece of content. Illustrative search interface <b>1500</b> may still further allow a user to filter search results by a dominant color or color scheme, an association or inclusion of one or more advertisements in a network resource or piece of content, an association or inclusion of one or more pieces or types of embedded content in a network resource, or any other type of search filter or term.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> illustrates an alternative user interface <b>1550</b> for searching historical browse content. The search interface <b>1550</b> may include fields for searching based on any number of characteristics of stored historical content representations or corresponding network resources. Fields for searching characteristics of stored historical content representations may include, but are not limited to, a text search field <b>1552</b>, an image search field <b>1554</b>, a page type field <b>1558</b>, and a date range field <b>1560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In image search field <b>1554</b>, a user may enter a description of an image or other visual element for which to search. For example, if a user recalls seeing a picture of a man next to a dog on the specific web page that the user is searching for, that information may lead to more relevant search results than standard textual content searching. The search results can be filtered such that only historical content representations or corresponding network resources that have an image of a man next to a dog will be returned. This filtering can be facilitated by automated computer vision software. In some embodiments, the historical content representations can be stored with meta data describing the visual elements of the content. In such cases, the meta data can be searched using standard textual keyword searching techniques to retrieve pages with the desired image. In some cases, the user may enter an image into a specialized image search field <b>1554</b>, such as by copying the image from a source and pasting the image into the image search field <b>1554</b>. The network computing provider <b>107</b> may then match the image to the visual content representations in storage.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">A user may use page type field <b>1558</b> to limit the search results to a particular type of page. For example, a user may recall that the specific web page the user is searching for presented the full text of single news story, such as a detail web page. This is in contrast to a typical landing web page, or the first web page that a user encounters when navigating to a web site. For example, a typical landing page may be the default.html or index.html web page that is returned to a user navigating to http://www.xyzwebsite.com. Such a landing page may contain a number of clickable headlines of the news stories of the day, and by clicking a headline the user may be taken to a detail web page, such as http://www.xyzwebsite.com/story1, to view the full text of the story. In some cases, as described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a user may never have seen the landing page, instead navigating directly to the detail page, such as when clicking a link on a web page of search results. By selecting the type of web page in the page type field <b>1558</b>, the user can potentially receive more relevant results and fewer irrelevant results.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">A user may use date range field <b>1560</b> to further narrow the search results to a more relevant set. For example, the user may recall viewing a web page within the past week, but before today. By utilizing sliders <b>1562</b>, <b>1564</b> to select the data range on the date range field <b>1560</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the user can eliminate results out of that data range and therefore known to be irrelevant, and instead focus the search within the date range that the user knows to be correct. The data range field <b>1560</b> is not limited to ranges within the past month. In some embodiments, different date ranges can be programmed into the date range field <b>1560</b>, selected by the user, dynamically determined based on other parameters or previous searches, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> illustrates a user interface <b>1600</b> depicting sample historical search results. In one embodiment, the search results interface <b>1600</b> may be accessible from a browser running on client computing device <b>102</b>, or any other application or service. Various aspects of functionality corresponding to the search results interface <b>1600</b> may be provided by any number of different software applications, network components, and/or service providers through one or more interfaces, APIs, browser plugins, or other means of access.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In one embodiment, the search results interface <b>1600</b> may display multiple versions of a network resource, such as a web page. The results may come from a search initiated by a user through a search interface, such as the interface illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, from a historical version request initiated by a user, for example through a popup menu <b>710</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, or from any other appropriate source. The results may include any number of versions of a single web page, and may be presented on a timeline <b>1604</b>, thereby providing the user with a visual representation of the time period covered by the versions. The timeline <b>1604</b> may also provide a means, such as a slider control <b>1606</b>, to manipulate which versions are shown. The search results interface <b>1600</b> can also highlight differences in the various versions displayed. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, the first version, chronologically, is version <b>1602</b><i>a</i>. Differences between version <b>1602</b><i>a </i>and version <b>1602</b><i>b</i>, the next version chronologically, can be indicated with an underline <b>1608</b>. Likewise, differences between the last version chronologically, version <b>1602</b><i>c</i>, and the first version chronologically, version <b>1602</b><i>a</i>, can be indicated with an underline <b>1608</b>. Other configurations are possible. For example, the differences between version <b>1602</b><i>a </i>and version <b>1602</b><i>b </i>can be indicated on version <b>1602</b><i>a</i>. The differences can be indicated by circling, highlighting, or alerting the color of the changed portion, by displaying a comment or image near the changed portion, or by any other appropriate manner of calling a user's attention to differences in content.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The differences between the versions need not be textual; the search results interface <b>1600</b> can be utilized to illustrate differences in color, images, structure, meta data, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> illustrates the search interface <b>1600</b> highlighting differences in the visual layout of various versions of a web page. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, the various versions can be displayed over a timeline <b>1604</b> and arranged in chronological order. Layout differences can be indicated by displaying a box or circle around a changed portion of the web page. For example, version <b>1602</b><i>e </i>has a box <b>1608</b> around a portion of the page, and the box <b>1608</b> represents a portion that has changed when compared to version <b>1602</b><i>d</i>. In some embodiments, the displayed content representations may be of different yet related web pages, providing a user with a means to see differences in the content of the related web pages, to scroll through a time period, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> illustrates a user interface <b>1700</b> depicting sample historical search results. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, described above, and all user interface illustrations and discussions contained herein, the search results interface <b>1700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> may be accessible from a browser running on client computing device <b>102</b>, or any other application or service. Various aspects of functionality corresponding to the search results interface <b>1700</b> may be provided by any number of different software applications, network components, and/or service providers through one or more interfaces, APIs, browser plugins, or other means of access.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The search results interface <b>1700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> can be used to present historical versions of multiple web pages simultaneously. In one embodiment, each web page can occupy its own portion of the visible screen, and can consist of a stack containing any number of versions of the web page. For example, two different web sites, such as a news site <b>1702</b> and an image-sharing site <b>1704</b>, can both be included in the results of a historical browsing search or any other type of search. Some number of versions of each web site can be returned, and the number can be specified by the user, by a parameter of the search, by system properties of the network computing provider <b>107</b>, etc. The various representations of the versions of a web page can overlap each other partially or completely to conserve display space and to present the user with a way to view differences between the various versions. For example, the representations of the pages can be partially transparent, either by a measurement of the transparency of the representation or by which portion of the representation is transparent. Such transparency can allow the user to view the representations of versions below the representation at the top of the stack, and therefore to see differences in the versions.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, the versions of the image-sharing web site <b>1704</b> include at least two images of a star. One image is larger and positioned lower on the page than the other. A user may wish to view the versions of the image-sharing web site <b>1704</b> separately, in order to view the differences side-by-side rather than overlapping. The user may tap <b>1706</b> on the stack of representations of the image sharing site <b>1704</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, to spread out the representations for closer inspection, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>. In some embodiments, the user may click a mouse, speak a voice command, enter a keyboard command, select a menu option, or initiate any other appropriate input to indicate selection of the stack <b>1704</b>. The various versions <b>1704</b><i>a</i>, <b>1704</b><i>b </i>may then be partially or completed uncovered and spread out over the area of the display. In such a display, a user can visually confirm which versions of the web page are different from each other. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the user can confirm that the current version of the image-sharing web site, version <b>1704</b><i>a</i>, has the larger, lower-set star image. Other data about the versions can be displayed, including indicia of the differences between the two versions <b>1704</b><i>a</i>, <b>1704</b><i>b </i>as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> illustrates a user interface <b>1800</b> depicting sample search results which may or may not include historical content. The search results illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> can be sized and arranged to emphasize various aspects of each web page <b>1802</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>1802</b><i>n</i>. For example, representations of web pages accessed, modified, or created more recently than the others can be sized larger than the others. In another example, representations of web pages more relevant to the search, with more browsing traffic, etc. can be sized larger. In some embodiments, rather than altering the size of the representations, they can be positioned in a three-dimensional layered format, which representations of web pages which are more recent, relevant, and/or popular being positioned at the top layer. In some embodiments, the color saturation, contrast, transparency, or any other visible property of each representation of a web page <b>1802</b><i>a</i>-<b>1802</b><i>n </i>included in the search results may be varied based on the web page's contemporaneousness, relevancy, and/or popularity.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Additionally, visible indicia of similarities, relationships, or other associations between the web pages <b>1802</b><i>a</i>-<b>1802</b><i>n </i>may be displayed. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, various outline effects can be applied to the representations of web pages <b>1802</b><i>a</i>-<b>1802</b><i>n </i>to indicate a similarity. Outline effect <b>1804</b> may identify all web pages which have been viewed today, or all web pages which are news-related. Outline effect <b>1806</b> can indicate some similarity between web pages, some difference with web pages incorporating outline effect <b>1804</b>, or some other category or association. For example, the pages incorporating outline effect <b>1806</b> may have been viewed more than one month ago, or may not be news-related, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">A user can interact with the interface <b>1800</b>, for example to filter the search results, select a specific web page to view more closely, etc. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the user can perform a reverse-pinch <b>1808</b> touch screen gesture to zoom the display on a portion of the results. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> illustrates a sample result of this reverse-pinch <b>1808</b> zoom action. The viewable area of the interface <b>1800</b> has been filled with only a portion of the representations web pages <b>1802</b><i>a</i>-<b>1802</b><i>n </i>returned as search results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>. Additionally, the zooming can facilitate the addition of features to the display. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, the representations of web pages <b>1802</b><i>a</i>-<b>1802</b><i>n </i>in the zoomed portion can be spread apart, and previous versions of some or all of the web pages can be shown in a three-dimensional stack, as described above. The example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> shows a stack <b>1810</b> which may contain previous versions of a web page included in the search results. In some embodiments, the stack <b>1810</b> may include representations of different but related web pages instead of, or in addition to, previous versions of the web page.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> illustrates the zoomed display of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> with the addition of a search dialog <b>1812</b>. While viewing the zoomed display of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, or any other display of search results, a search dialog <b>1812</b> or other input area may be provided so that the user can refine the search to obtain more relevant results. For example, the user may enter additional search terms in a text box <b>1814</b>, edit the search terms originally submitted, or use another method of inputting search refinements. The search refinement terms can be transmitted to the network computing provider <b>107</b>, which can update the display with the refined search results. In some embodiments, the display can be updated in substantially real-time, at the same time the user is typing refinements into the search dialog <b>1812</b>. For example, irrelevant results can be animated off of the screen, as indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, resulting in the updated display of search results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref> illustrates sample search results displayed as detailed representations of the web pages <b>1802</b><i>a</i>-<b>1802</b><i>n </i>returned in the results, and can include indicia <b>1822</b> of differences or similarities between them, as described above. Some or all of the representations of web pages <b>1802</b><i>a</i>-<b>1802</b><i>n </i>can additionally include historical versions <b>1820</b>, as described above. A user can tap <b>1816</b>, click, speak, or otherwise input a command to select a specific web page <b>1818</b> for closer inspection, or to view representations of historical versions <b>1820</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref> illustrates a sample interface showing a single web page <b>1818</b>, as chosen by the tap <b>1816</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref>. In some embodiments, multiple web pages can be displayed, some or all with corresponding historical versions <b>1820</b><i>a</i>-<b>1820</b><i>n</i>. The example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref> shows a detailed representation of a single chosen web page <b>1818</b>, with a number of representations of previously browsed web pages <b>1820</b><i>a</i>-<b>1820</b><i>n </i>arranged nearby. In some embodiments, differences or similarities between the versions can be indicated as described above. In some embodiments, the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref> can be combined with other interfaces described herein, such that a user may be able to obtain a detailed view of a web page <b>1818</b> and a satellite view of previous versions <b>1820</b><i>a</i>-<b>1820</b><i>n </i>or related pages by clicking, tapping, or otherwise selecting any of the representations of web pages displayed in a search results interface.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> illustrates a user interface <b>1900</b> depicting sample search results which may or may not have a historical component. The user interface <b>1900</b> illustrates sample search results with representations of similar or otherwise related web pages grouped together by category. For example, group <b>1902</b> may contain representations of multiple versions of a single web page, stacked on top of each other, with optional transparency as described herein, or with other visual effects. Group <b>1904</b> may contain representations of several different yet related web pages, arranged adjacent to and overlapping each other, or in some other logical manner. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, any number of separate groups or clusters can be displayed to organize search results, browsing history, and the like. A user can interact with the interface using touch screen taps, mouse clicks, voice commands, keyboard or menu commands, or any other appropriate input method. For example a user may alter the view to bring group <b>1904</b> into the foreground by performing a touch screen gesture such as a swipe <b>1906</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> illustrates what the interface <b>1900</b> might look like in response to such user input. As shown, the display size of group <b>1902</b> has been reduced, and the group <b>1902</b> has been rotated to the right of the screen. Group <b>1904</b> has been rotated to the center of the screen and enlarged. In some embodiments, the web pages represented by the group <b>1904</b> graphic may be shown in any level of detail, and may include indicia of similarities, changes, or other parameters. A user may interact with the interface <b>1900</b>, for example by performing a reverse-pinch <b>1906</b> to zoom on group <b>1904</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> illustrates a user interface <b>2000</b> depicting sample search results which may or may not have a historical component. The interface <b>2000</b> can be displayed as the initial view of search results or as a way to view browsing history. The interface <b>2000</b> can also show a zoomed portion of search results displayed in another interface, such as a zoomed group or cluster of web pages as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>. The sample search results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> utilize varied outlines <b>2004</b>, <b>2006</b> as visual indicators of similarities or associations between web pages. Other visual indicators are possible, such as shading the background of the representations of related web pages, applying a texture to representations of related web pages, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> illustrates yet another visual indicator of similarities or associations between web pages. Line connectors <b>2010</b> and <b>2012</b> provide a visual indication that several of the web pages represented in the interface <b>2000</b> are related. The difference in the appearance of the line connectors <b>2010</b>, <b>2012</b> indicates that they each represent different web page associations. As in other interfaces described herein, a user may zoom on a portion of the display by using a reverse pinch <b>2008</b> touch screen gesture or any other appropriate input method.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref> illustrates what the interface <b>2000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> may look like as a result of the reverse pinch <b>2008</b> zooming gesture. Zooming on a portion of the interface <b>2000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> facilitates the display of additional data regarding the similarities or associations between the web pages represented in the search results. Descriptive text <b>2014</b> may be added to the line connectors <b>2010</b>, <b>2012</b> to inform the user about the association or similarity that the line connector represents. For example, line connector <b>2010</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref> connects two pages which have been found to be associated with each other on social network profiles. The use of text in addition to differentiated line connectors provides an additional measure of flexibility in displaying information about similarities and associations without requiring the user to view the web pages.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> illustrates an interface <b>2100</b> for displaying a browsing path with embedded historical or otherwise related content. The interface <b>2100</b> may be used to display to a user the current browsing path, a browsing path taken to get to a specific web page, a historical browsing path, etc. Each node of the browsing path can represent a web page <b>2102</b><i>a</i>-<b>2102</b><i>n</i>, and the nodes can be connected by arrows, such as arrow <b>2106</b>, indicating the order in which the web pages <b>2102</b><i>a</i>-<b>2102</b><i>n </i>were browsed. Additionally, each node may be a stack or cluster of related or historical web pages, as described above. For example, a user may click, tap, or otherwise indicate the selection of a node representing a web page, and be taken to an interface such as the historical version view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref>. In another example, a user may click, tap, or otherwise indicate selection of a node and be taken to an interface displaying content that other users have browsed to next, such as the interface illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, described below.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref> illustrates an interface <b>2100</b> for displaying content related to a content selection. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref> may be used to illustrate web pages that other users have browsed to immediately before or after a web page which the active user has browsed. Any number of related pages can be displayed, and additional browsing paths continuing from the related pages may be displayed. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, arrows such as arrow <b>2016</b> may be utilized to indicate a browsing path, or any other appropriate method of displaying browsing paths may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates a navigation path from a landing page <b>2202</b> to two detail pages <b>2206</b>, <b>2210</b>, and from a search engine <b>2208</b> to a detail page <b>2210</b>. As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, some web sites have different types of pages. For example, a news web site, such as XYZWebsite illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, may have a landing page <b>2202</b>. The landing page <b>2202</b> may be the default page that a user is presented with when navigating to a web site, such as by entering the URL http://www.xyzwebsite.com. The entered URL does not specify a particular page of XYZWebsite to retrieve, and therefore the user may be presented with the default.html page, index.html page, or some other default page for the specific web site.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The landing page may contain general information about the site and links to other portions of the site (not shown for clarity). One link may take users to a top stories page <b>2204</b>, which may include a number of headlines, a news story digest, etc. Links on this secondary page <b>2204</b> may take users to pages with full text of news stories, such as detail pages <b>2206</b> and <b>2210</b>. However, users may navigate to such detail pages <b>2206</b>, <b>2210</b> without initially viewing the landing page <b>2202</b>. For example, the user may click a link on a page of search results from a search engine <b>2208</b> and be taken directly to detail page <b>2210</b>, or a user may enter a URL of a detail page, such as http://www.xyzwebsite.com/story<sub>&#x2014;</sub>1 for detail page <b>2206</b>. Therefore, including the landing page <b>2202</b> in search results may not be appropriate for a particular user or a particular search, even though such landing pages may ordinarily be included in search results in lieu of including a large number of secondary pages <b>2204</b> or detail pages <b>2206</b>, <b>2210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, a page type field <b>1558</b> can be provided in an interactive search interface <b>1550</b> for a user to specify which type of pages, e.g., landing pages, secondary pages, and detail pages, to include in the search results. For such a feature to be implemented effectively, the search provider will need to know which web pages fit into those categories. In some embodiments, an automated process, such as a server process, can run continuously, storing meta data about web pages including whether they are landing pages, detail pages, etc. In other embodiments, a machine learning algorithm or component can be used to determine, for a particular web site, which page is the landing page, which pages are detail pages, etc. The machine learning algorithm can be provided with access to historical browsing data in order make the determinations, such as by analyzing the URLs of the web pages to determine patterns, or it can monitor browsing requests in real time or substantially real time. In some embodiments, types of web pages other than, or in additional to, landing pages and detail pages can be defined, determined, and included in the search parameters. For example, other types of web pages might include site maps, contact us pages, help pages, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a user interface diagram depicting search results grouped into clusters and displayed in quadrants. The user interface <b>2300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> can be used to display both historical and current search results. The grouping of search results into quadrants <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b>, <b>2306</b>, and <b>2308</b> can be based on common properties of the search results. For example, all search results with a common subject matter, such as news web sites, can be grouped together. In another example, all search results from the same time period can be grouped together. The grouping parameters can be programmed into the interface, customized by the user, dynamically determined based on the search and results, or any other appropriate grouping method, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, described above. As with other search result displays described herein, a user may interact with the search results interface <b>2300</b>, such as by clicking a mouse, entering a keyboard or menu command, speaking a voice command, performing a touch screen gesture, etc. The specific group which has been selected may then be zoomed to fill up the interface, presenting a single group of search results as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>, described above.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> illustrates a user interface <b>2400</b> for displaying historical content search results combined with associated contextual results. The search results displayed in user interface <b>2400</b> may be bundled with contextual resources so that the user can see which resources were browsed contemporaneously with the search result. For example, a user may remember that not only was the desired target of the search a news web site with certain keywords, but also that the user browsed the news web site immediately after viewing a video on a video hosting web site. By presenting the search results with a view of which sites were browsed immediately before and after the result, the user can more accurately determine which result is correct. In some embodiments, the interface <b>2400</b> can be used to present non-historical search results instead of, or in addition to, historical content search results.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">As with other user interfaces described herein, a user may select a specific result for closer inspection. For example, a user may perform a mouse click, enter a keyboard or menu command, speak a voice command, or perform a touch screen gesture <b>2406</b> to select a specific search result <b>2402</b> to view. The search result <b>2402</b> can then be zoomed such that the search result <b>2402</b> and the contextual search results <b>2404</b> can be inspected more closely. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> illustrates such a user interface diagram <b>2450</b> zoomed to display contextual search results. The user interface <b>2450</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> may show more detail than in the contextual search results illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>. For example, the user interface <b>2450</b> may include visual connections between the contextual results to represent browsing paths (not shown). The user may be permitted to scroll through the contextual results and zoom on them using touch screen gestures or other input techniques as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is illustrates a user interface <b>2500</b> depicting a quantitative chart <b>2502</b> of changes to network resource content over time. In some cases, a user may want to view summary data about changes to a network resource rather than the actual changes themselves. For example, a user researching how often and by how much the content of a particular web site changes may prefer a quantitative summary of the changes. In addition to the line chart <b>2502</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the user interface <b>2500</b> can be configured to display a bar chart, pie chart, scatter plot, or any other graphical representation of quantitative data.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The data upon which the user interface <b>2500</b> bases its chart <b>2502</b> can come from any number of sources. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a user may have requested to view a chart of the percentage that the content of a particular web page changed, on a bi-weekly basis, from January through October. In one embodiment, the interface <b>2500</b> itself may be configured to retrieve search results in the form of historical content representations, and then compare the historical content representations over time to determine when, and by how much, the content of the represented web site changed. In some embodiments, another component of the network computing provider <b>107</b> can be configured to perform the difference analysis. In some embodiments, a server process can run without requiring interaction, processing historical content representations and saving data about the differences for use by other processes, such as the interface <b>2500</b>. The differences that form the basis of the quantitative data can include differences in the textual content of the different versions of the corresponding web site, as well as differences in the visual layout, structure, source, meta data, network traffic, or any other appropriate property.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates a user interface <b>2600</b> for depicting relationships between network resources. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the relationships are indicated by arrows, although any appropriate connection graphic may be used, or none at all if no display of relationships is desired. The interface <b>2600</b> can also include graphical elements indicating how much each network resource has changed, as indicated by the different colors and patterns on the content representations. Such a user interface <b>2600</b> may be accessed by users researching which portions of a related set of network resources have experienced the most change over a period of time. In one embodiment, the interface <b>2600</b> may depict a comprehensive graph of each page of a web site, such as a news web site. Each web page may be represented by an icon <b>2602</b>, <b>2604</b>, <b>2606</b>, by an image of the web page, or by some other appropriate visual indicator, and connected by an arrow to illustrate which web pages link to other web pages within the web site. Properties of the visual indicators can be varied based on how much the web page has changed in a period of time. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the web pages which have changed the most dramatically, e.g., have the highest percentage of difference between one version of the web page and an older version of the web page, can be represented by black icons <b>2602</b>. The web pages which have changed a moderate amount can be represented by striped icons <b>2604</b>. The web pages which have changed little, if at all, can be represented by white icons <b>2606</b>. Other configurations, colors, patterns, and the like are possible. In some embodiments, the user may configure which icons are to be used. In some embodiments, the web pages in the graph may not be part of the same web site, but rather are related in some other way, such as by subject matter, the browsing history of the current user, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, described above, the data upon which the user interface <b>2600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> bases its graph can come from any number of sources. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, a user may have requested to view a graph of each web page in the user's recent browsing history in order to see which pages have changed the most over a period of time. The graph can indicate the exact browsing path taken by the user, which may be stored as meta data with the historical content representations. The differences between versions of the historical content over a period of time can be determined by programs associated with the interface <b>2600</b> itself, by a separate component of the network computing provider <b>107</b>, by background server processes, etc. The differences that form the basis of the quantitative data can include differences in the textual content of the different versions of the corresponding web site, as well as differences in the visual layout, structure, source, meta data, network traffic, or any other appropriate property.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a user interface diagram depicting a geographical grouping of network resource related data. For example, the user interface <b>2700</b> may be used to present the adoption of a particular technology among users of client computing devices in various geographical regions. In another example, the interface <b>2700</b> may be used to present an overview of which web sites or other network content is most popular in different geographic areas. In some embodiments, the interface <b>2700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> can be used to present a geographic profile of server side information, as well as any other information for which geographic data is available.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the regions <b>2704</b> shaded black can indicate the highest adoption rate relative to other geographical regions, or they can represent a specific quantitative adoption rate, such as 50%. The striped regions <b>2706</b> can indicate the next highest adoption rate relative to other geographical regions, or they can represent a specific quantitative adoption rate, such as 10%. Any number of different patterns, colors, and the like can be used, and can represent any number of different quantitative or relative levels.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The data to determine the geographic adoption rates can be received in the normal course of network resource request processing by the network computing provider <b>107</b>. For example, client computing devices <b>102</b> can transmit technology profile data along with the network resource requests, and the profile data can be processed and stored. In addition, the network computing provider <b>107</b> can determine the geographic location of the client computing device <b>102</b> using IP address geolocation techniques, or by receiving the data from the client computing device <b>102</b>, etc.</p>
