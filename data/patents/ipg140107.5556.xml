<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure is directed generally to systems and methods for protecting sensitive financial information from theft and fraud. In particular, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for securing payment instruments, such as checks, with improved security and fraud protection means.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Safeguarding customer financial information against criminal fraudsters, forgers and cybercriminals represents a ongoing battle for consumers, businesses and financial institutions. Financial fraud can assume many forms including swindling, payment instrument fraud, debit or credit card fraud, real estate fraud, identity theft, deceptive telemarketing, or even money laundering. Personal computers continue to be a favorite target for fraudsters as they are typically poorly protected. Common attacks against consumers include the use of mirror or phishing sites, pharming sites, carding or skimming techniques, and crimeware such as Trojans. Although advancements in computer technology have offered more robust security features to consumers, businesses and financial institutions, they have also offered an easier operating environment for criminal fraudsters to manipulate financial instruments, such as payment instruments, in such a way as to deceive innocent victims expecting value in exchange for their money.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular, payment instrument fraud is one of the largest challenges facing businesses, consumers and financial institutions today Annual losses due to payment instrument fraud are estimated in the billions of dollars. This problem affects consumers who face financial losses and anxiety from the instant theft and also from the possible future repercussions with credit bureaus. The Uniform Commercial Code has placed increasing emphasis on the role of businesses and financial institutions in ensuring that their issued payment instruments are secure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Victims of payment instrument fraud include financial institutions, businesses who accept and issue payment instruments, and the consumer. These crimes may begin with the theft of a financial document, for example, the theft of a blank check from a consumer's home or vehicle during a burglary, searching for a canceled or old check in the garbage, or removing a check a consumer may have mailed to pay a bill from the mailbox.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Common types of payment instrument fraud include forgery where an individual, such as a disgruntled employee of a financial institution or business, issues a check without proper authorization, counterfeiting where a payment instrument may be fabricated as a whole or duplicated, alteration where chemicals are used to remove or modify information on the payment instrument, paperhanging where consumers purposefully write checks on closed accounts, or kiting where a fraudster opens accounts at two or more financial institutions and uses &#x201c;the float time&#x201d; of available funds to create fraudulent balances. In particular, payment instrument compilations, such as paper checkbooks, are particularly prone to fraud due to check number guessing and limited controls placed on the physical paper checks within the checkbook.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional systems and methods have utilized transaction specific information, such as a transaction amount or a particular type of transaction, to permit independent verification of a transaction and a payment instrument. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,630,201 to White discloses a paper check security feature in which the checks include unique transaction numbers. When a check is cleared, the bank compares the unique transaction number to a stored number to determine if the check number is being duplicated. White further discloses that a password protected portable device generates the transaction numbers. Additionally, U.S. Patent Publication Ser. No. 2005/0149439 to Suisa discloses a paper check security feature in which the checks include unique transaction numbers generated for a particular type of transaction. When a check is cleared, the bank compares the unique transaction number to a stored number to determine if the check number is being duplicated. Further by way of example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,754,653 to Canfield discloses a paper check security feature that uses a security code that is unique for each check and for each transaction involving a check. The security code is generated from the check sequence number preprinted on the check or the total transaction amount and a customer selected base code. Still further, U.S. Pat. No. 4,958,066 to Hedgcoth discloses a checkbook in which each check has a randomly assigned number. The number is used to verify the authenticity of the check by comparing it to digits on the payor's ATM card or separate dedicated, disposable card, but is not compared to a stored bank number during check clearing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional technologies instituted by financial institutions to minimize fraud and secure financial information have also included implementing procedures to actively monitor for customer check sequence numbers that are used out of sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, some financial institutions have established policies to only process check sequence numbers that they know have been sent to a consumer. However, there remains a need in the art to overcome conventional limitations and provide a novel system and method for securing payment instruments, such as checks, with improved security and fraud protection capability.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for securing financial information including generating a pseudorandom number sequence, generating an activation code, including a unique pseudorandom number of the sequence with each payment instrument of a plurality of payment instruments, issuing the plurality of payment instruments with the activation code to a first party and activating the plurality of payment instruments with the activation code. The method may include verifying the authenticity of a payment instrument of the plurality of payment instruments using the activation code. The method may also include verifying the authenticity of a payment instrument of the plurality of payment instruments using the unique pseudorandom number of the sequence included with the payment instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment of the present invention provides a system for securing financial information, including a computer processor having a computer readable storage medium, the computer readable storage medium having instructions stored therein for executing on the processor, the instructions including generating an activation code for a plurality of payment instruments, generating a pseudorandom number sequence, including a unique pseudorandom number of the sequence with each payment instrument of the plurality of payment instruments, associating the activation code with each of the unique pseudorandom numbers of the pseudorandom number sequence included with each payment instrument of the plurality of payment instruments, associating the activation code with information for identifying the first party, storing the activation code with each of the unique pseudorandom numbers of the pseudorandom number sequence included with each payment instrument of the plurality of payment instruments and the information for identifying the first party in a file of a second party and activating the plurality of payment instruments with the activation code. The system may also include a means for issuing the plurality of payment instruments with the activation code to a first party. The computer readable storage medium may also include instructions stored therein for executing on the processor, the instructions including verifying the authenticity of a payment instrument of the plurality of payment instruments using the activation code and verifying the authenticity of a payment instrument of the plurality of payment instruments using the unique pseudorandom number of the sequence included with the payment instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further embodiment of the present invention provides a method for authenticating a check including generating a pseudorandom number sequence, generating an activation code, including a unique pseudorandom number of the sequence with each check of a plurality of checks issuing the plurality of checks with the activation code to a first party, associating the activation code with each unique pseudorandom number of the pseudorandom number sequence included with each check of the plurality of checks, associating the activation code with information for identifying the first party, storing the activation code with the pseudorandom number sequence and the information for identifying the first party in a file of a second party, receiving a check of the plurality of checks having at least a portion of the information for identifying the first party and the unique pseudorandom number of the sequence included with the check, determining a status of activating the plurality of checks using the at least a portion of the information for identifying the first party, the stored activation code, and at least a portion of the stored information for identifying the first party, authenticating the first party with the received at least a portion of the information for identifying the first party and at least a portion of the stored information for identifying the first party, authenticating the unique pseudorandom number of the sequence included with the check with the received at least a portion of the information for identifying the first party, the stored information for identifying the first party and the stored unique pseudorandom numbers of the pseudorandom number sequence and authenticating the received check of the plurality of checks if the first party and the unique pseudorandom number of the sequence included with the check are authenticated and if the plurality of checks have been activated.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to the Figures where like elements have been given like numerical designations to facilitate an understanding of the present invention, the various embodiments of a system and method for securing financial information in payment instruments, such as checks, is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present disclosure may be utilized to secure financial information in payment instruments provided to customers of financial institutions. A financial institution may be, but is not limited to, a bank or other similar entity. The present disclosure may utilize a computer-based system and method that provides financial institution customers access to numerous online banking services offered by online banking service providers based on customer information profiles that may be developed over time as described below. &#x201c;Online&#x201d; may mean connecting to or accessing account information from a location remote from the financial institution or a branch of the financial institution. Alternatively, &#x201c;online&#x201d; may refer to connecting or accessing an electronic network (wired or wireless) via a computer as described below. In exemplary embodiments, the method and system are web-based, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The Internet is a worldwide system of computer networks&#x2014;a network of networks in which a user at one computer or other device connected to the network can obtain information from any other computer and communicate with users of other computers or devices. The most widely used part of the Internet is the World Wide Web (often-abbreviated &#x201c;WWW&#x201d; or called &#x201c;the Web&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One of the most outstanding features of the Web is its use of hypertext, which is a method for cross-referencing. In most Web sites, certain words or phrases appear in text of a different color than the surrounding text. This text is often also underlined. Sometimes, there are hot spots, such as buttons, images, or portions of images that are &#x201c;clickable.&#x201d; Clicking on hypertext or a hot spot causes the downloading of another web page via a protocol such as hypertext transport protocol (HTTP). Using the Web provides access to millions of pages of information. Web &#x201c;surfing&#x201d; is done with a Web browser, the most popular of which presently are Apple Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer. The appearance of a particular website may vary slightly depending on the particular browser used. Versions of browsers have &#x201c;plug-ins,&#x201d; which provide animation, virtual reality, sound, and music. Interpreted programs (e.g., applets) may be run within the browser.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an online banking access system <b>150</b> connected to a plurality of interconnected computer system networks <b>102</b> and devices <b>110</b>. Each computer system network <b>102</b> may include a corresponding local computer processor unit <b>104</b>, which is coupled to a corresponding local data storage unit <b>106</b> and to local network user terminals <b>108</b>. A computer system network <b>102</b> may be a local area network (LAN) or part of a wide area network (WAN), for example. The online banking access system <b>150</b> and local computer processor units <b>104</b> are selectively coupled to a plurality of user devices <b>110</b> through Internet <b>114</b>. Each of the plurality of user devices <b>110</b> and local user terminals <b>108</b> (collectively, user terminals) may have various devices connected to their local computer systems, such as scanners, barcode readers, printers, finger print scanners, mouse devices, keyboards, and other interface devices <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Online banking access system <b>150</b> includes a processing unit <b>152</b> coupled to one or more data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. The processing unit <b>152</b> provides front-end graphical user interfaces (GUI), e.g., customer GUI <b>158</b> and online banking service provider GUI <b>160</b>, as well as back-end GUIs <b>162</b> to a user's terminal <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or to local computer <b>164</b>. The GUIs can take the form of, for example, a webpage that is displayed using a browser program local to the user terminal <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, or to local computer <b>164</b>. It is understood that the online banking access system <b>150</b> may be implemented on one or more computers <b>164</b>, servers <b>166</b>, or like devices. Front- and back-end GUIs <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are preferably portal pages that includes various content retrieved from the one or more data storage devices <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;portal&#x201d; is not limited to general-purpose Internet portals, such as YAHOO! or GOOGLE but also includes GUIs that are of interest to specific, limited audiences and that provide the user access to a plurality of different kinds of related or unrelated information, links and tools as described below. &#x201c;Webpage&#x201d; and &#x201c;website&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A user may gain access to online banking access system <b>150</b> by using a user device <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>164</b>, programmed with a Web browser or other software, to locate and select (such as by clicking with a mouse) a particular webpage. The content of the webpage is located on the one or more data storage devices <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. The user devices <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may be microprocessor-based computer terminals, pagers that can communicate through the Internet using the Internet Protocol (IP), Kiosks with Internet access, connected personal digital assistants or PDAs (e.g., a PALM device manufactured by Palm, Inc., IPAQ device available from Compaq, iPHONE from Apple or BLACKBERRY from RIM), or other devices capable of interactive network communications, such as an electronic personal planner. User devices <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may also be wireless devices, such as a hand-held unit (e.g., a cellular telephone or a portable music player such as an iPod) that connect to, and communicate through, the Internet using a wireless access protocol (WAP).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The system and method described herein may be implemented by utilizing at least a part of the system <b>150</b> described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the system may be incorporated in a LAN, in a WAN, or through an Internet <b>114</b> based approach, such as through a hosted or non-hosted application service, or through a combination thereof. The functionality of the method may be programmed and executed by at least one computer processor unit <b>152</b>, with necessary data and graphical interface pages as described below stored in and retrieved from a data storage unit <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. A user can access this functionality using a user device <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As mentioned above, online banking access system <b>150</b> may provide separate features and functionality for front-end users, including customers and online banking service provider users, as well as back-end users that manage the online banking access system <b>150</b>. For the purposes of this document, a &#x201c;customer&#x201d; is an individual or organization that signs up for or otherwise takes advantage of an online banking service, and an &#x201c;online banking service provider&#x201d; is an individual or organization, such as a financial institution, that provides one or more online banking services to customers. Accordingly, the customers are actual customers of the online banking service providers.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With attention now drawn to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a flow diagram <b>200</b> for a method for securing financial information according to an embodiment of the disclosure is presented. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at block <b>201</b> a customer may contact a financial institution to request or order a compilation of payment instruments, such as a checkbook, from the financial institution. For example, the checkbook may be a paper checkbook or an electronic checkbook. As can readily be appreciated, the present disclosure is applicable to a number of payment instruments and compilations of payment instruments, and that a check and compilation of a plurality of checks commonly referred to as a checkbook are only an exemplary form of a payment instrument or a compilation of payment instruments that are contemplated by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">One skilled in the art will recognize that the customer may order a checkbook by contacting the financial institution through a wide variety of methods including, but not limited to, telephone, electronic mail, physical mail or by entering the financial institution's electronic system for online check ordering. As described above, the financial institution's electronic system for online check ordering may be a website provided by the financial institution's online banking access system <b>150</b> that the customer may access via a public or private network. The customer may enter the website a number of ways (i.e., the customer's entrance into the financial institution's website may be &#x201c;path sensitive&#x201d;, which may have implications as discussed further below) such as via a public network, via a link from another account the customer may have with the financial institution, via a notice or alert sent to the customer by the financial institution, via an e-mail advertisement sent to the customer by the financial institution, in response to a receipt of a promotional advertisement, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At block <b>203</b>, a determination may be made as to whether the customer is an existing client of the financial institution. In an embodiment, a determination may be made as to whether the customer is an existing online client of the financial institution. This determination may be based on information from block <b>201</b> or other information provided by the customer or from another source, including records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. In an embodiment, the determination at block <b>203</b> may be made as to whether the customer is an existing offline client of the financial institution or both an online and offline client of the financial institution. An offline client may include the situation where the customer currently does business with the financial institution but not through the financial institution's online system.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If the customer is an existing online client of the financial institution, then at block <b>205</b>, the customer enters information (which may sometimes be referred to herein as information for identifying a party or information for identifying a customer) such as, for example, a username and password. This information may typically be entered and transmitted to the financial institution using a computer such as, for example, through customer's terminal <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or local computer <b>164</b>. Alternatively, as would be understood by those of skill in the art, other information may be entered or used in place of a username and password. For example, the information for identifying a customer may include the customer's name, the customer's mailing address, the customer's electronic mailing address, the customer's account number, the customer's social security number, the customer's bank's name, the customer's bank's identification number, the customer's bank's routing transit number, the website login information assigned to the customer by the financial institution or selected by the customer when creating an online account with the financial institution, a digital signature, information stored in a security token such as a soft token, hard token, key fob, or the like, a personal identification number (PIN), source IP address, a session identification, a session start time, a knowledge based authentication (KBA) status or any combination thereof. In an embodiment, since the customer is an existing online client of the financial institution only a limited amount or portion of information need be entered by the customer. In an exemplary embodiment, the information sent between the customer and the financial institution is encrypted using a network security protocol known in the art such as, for example, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). If the customer is an existing offline client of the institution, the customer provides identifying information, at block <b>205</b>, such as, for example, the customer's name, customer's mailing address, the customer's electronic mailing address, the customer's account number, the customer's social security number, the customer's bank's name, the customer's bank identification number, the customer's bank's routing transit number, telephone call-in information assigned to the customer by the financial institution or selected by the customer during account set-up, a call-in password, a call-in PIN, or any combination thereof. In an embodiment, since the customer is an existing offline client of the financial institution, only a limited amount or portion of information need be entered by the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At block <b>207</b>, the information provided by the customer at block <b>205</b> may be authenticated by any appropriate method known in the art. For example, the information provided by the customer at block <b>205</b> may be compared to information stored for the customer in records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. If the information provided by the customer at block <b>205</b> is not authenticated, the financial institution may inform the customer that the information provided at block <b>205</b> is incorrect by any appropriate method known in the art including, for example, by displaying an error message on the customer's computer screen at block <b>209</b> and looping the process back to block <b>205</b>. If the information provided by the customer at block <b>205</b> is authenticated, then the financial institution may, at block <b>211</b>, present to the customer (e.g. by displaying information on a webpage presented to the customer) at, for example, the customer's terminal <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or local computer <b>164</b>, information for ordering a compilation of payment instruments. In an embodiment, the financial institution may provide to the customer, at block <b>211</b>, information for ordering a checkbook by telephone, electronic mail, physical mail, or any other correspondence mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The information for ordering a checkbook presented to the customer at block <b>211</b> may be dynamically presented based at least partially on the information provided by the customer at block <b>201</b> or <b>205</b> or from another source, including records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. For example, the information for ordering the checkbook may include a type of account held by the customer at the financial institution including, but not limited to, a savings account, checking account, money market account, etc. In an embodiment, the information for ordering the checkbook may include the name of the primary account holder, the name of a joint account holder, an account number of a checking, savings, money market or other account, a physical or electronic mailing address of the customer, terms and conditions for ordering the checkbook, etc. The terms and conditions, as is known in the art, typically includes information appropriate for a product to be selected or ordered by a customer, in this case at block <b>211</b>, and may include information, such as, but not limited to, minimum balance requirements, payment rules, interest rates charged, overdraft charges, late fee applicability, etc. In an embodiment, the information for ordering the checks may include an option for renewal of a previous order or request made by the customer. In an embodiment, the customer may be asked to verify the accuracy of the information presented at block <b>211</b> and/or accept terms and conditions presented at block <b>211</b> prior to ordering or requesting the checkbook. In a further embodiment, the customer may perform edits to the information presented at block <b>211</b> to ensure accuracy. In another embodiment, the information for ordering the checkbook may include a link to a third party provider site, including but not limited to, a check provider or check printing service provider. At block <b>213</b>, the customer makes a selection from the information for ordering the checkbook provided or presented at block <b>211</b> and orders or requests the checkbook.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Upon receipt of the request or order from the customer, at block <b>215</b>, an activation code is generated by the financial institution. As used herein, an activation code is a random or pseudorandom code generated by any appropriate method known in the art, including at least one or more of a number, letter or symbol, or combination thereof, and that is unique to the checkbook ordered or requested by the customer at block <b>213</b>. For example, an activation code for a requested checkbook may be generated as &#x201c;e429ab&#x201d;. In an embodiment of the present invention, computer processing unit <b>152</b> may be programmed to execute an activation code generating algorithm that returns a sequence of apparently non-related numbers, letters, symbols or combinations thereof each time the program is called. In an alternate embodiment, the activation code may be generated by a third party check provider or check printing service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of an architecture of a computer processing unit <b>152</b> configured to implement the algorithms associated with the present disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, computer processor unit <b>152</b> may include one or more processors <b>302</b>. The processor <b>302</b> is connected to a communication infrastructure <b>306</b> (e.g., a communications bus, cross-over bar, or network). As discussed above, computer processing unit <b>152</b> may include a display interface <b>422</b> that forwards graphics, text, and other data from the communication infrastructure <b>406</b> (or from a frame buffer not shown) for display on the front- and back-end GUIs <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> and as retrieved from the one or more data storage devices <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Computer processing unit <b>152</b> may also include a main memory <b>304</b>, such as a random access memory (RAM), and a secondary memory <b>308</b>. The secondary memory <b>308</b> may include, for example, a hard disk drive (HDD) <b>310</b> and/or removable storage drive <b>312</b>, which may represent a floppy disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, an optical disk drive, or the like. The removable storage drive <b>312</b> reads from and/or writes to a removable storage unit <b>316</b>. Removable storage unit <b>316</b> may be a floppy disk, magnetic tape, optical disk, or the like. As will be understood, the removable storage unit <b>316</b> may include a computer readable storage medium having stored therein computer software and/or data.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In alternative embodiments, secondary memory <b>308</b> may include other similar devices for allowing computer programs or other instructions to be loaded into computer processing unit <b>152</b>. Secondary memory <b>308</b> may include a removable storage unit <b>318</b> and a corresponding interface <b>314</b>. Examples of such removable storage units include, but are not limited to, USB or flash drives, which allow software and data to be transferred from the removable storage unit <b>318</b> to computer processing unit <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Computer processing unit <b>152</b> may also include a communications interface <b>320</b>. Communications interface <b>320</b> allows software and data to be transferred between computer processing unit <b>152</b> and external devices. Examples of communications interface <b>320</b> may include a modem, Ethernet card, wireless network card, a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) slot and card, or the like. Software and data transferred via communications interface <b>320</b> may be in the form of signals, which may be electronic, electromagnetic, optical, or the like that are capable of being received by communications interface <b>320</b>. These signals may be provided to communications interface <b>320</b> via a communications path (e.g., channel), which may be implemented using wire, cable, fiber optics, a telephone line, a cellular link, a radio frequency (RF) link and other communication channels.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this document, the terms &#x201c;computer program medium&#x201d; and &#x201c;computer readable storage medium&#x201d; refer to media such as removable storage drive <b>312</b>, or a hard disk installed in hard disk drive <b>310</b>. These computer program products may provide software to computer processing unit <b>152</b>. Computer programs (also referred to as computer control logic) are stored in main memory <b>304</b>, secondary memory <b>308</b> and/or data storage devices <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. Computer programs may also be received via communications interface <b>320</b>. Such computer programs, when executed by a processor, enable the computer processing unit <b>152</b> to perform features of the methods discussed herein. For example, main memory <b>304</b>, secondary memory <b>308</b>, data storage devices <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> or removable storage units <b>316</b> or <b>318</b> may be encoded with computer program code for performing the activation code algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an embodiment implemented using software, the software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into computer processing unit <b>152</b> using removable storage drive <b>312</b>, hard drive <b>310</b>, or communications interface <b>320</b>. The software, when executed by a processor <b>302</b>, causes the processor <b>302</b> to perform the functions of the activation code algorithm described herein. In another embodiment, the activation code algorithm may be implemented primarily in hardware using, for example, hardware components such as a digital signal processor comprising application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In yet another embodiment, the activation code algorithm is implemented using a combination of both hardware and software.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As discussed above, at block <b>215</b>, the financial institution may generate an activation code by any appropriate method known or used in the art. For example, it is well-known in the art to program and execute a standard C RAND or RANDS function, or the PHP hyperext preprocessor functions microtine or mt_rand, or the Unix function /dev/random, or the Java function SecureRandom, to return a pseudorandom number or alphanumeric sequence within a specified range. It is understood that a pseudorandom number or alphanumeric sequence generator should produce a pseudorandom sequence with a period that is long enough so that a finite sequence of reasonable length is not periodic. It is also well known that all pseudorandom number or alphanumeric sequence generators have an internal memory or state and that the size of the state is the value that determines the strength of the pseudorandom number or alphanumeric sequence generator, where an n-bit state can produce at most 2<sup>n </sup>different values. The strength, or ability of the pseudorandom sequence generator to resist a brute force attack by a cryptanalyst, of the output of the pseudorandom number or alphanumeric sequence generator is also commonly associated with the information entropy of the process that produced the pseudorandom sequence. This information entropy (H) is conventionally measured in bits and is commonly calculated as: H=L log<sub>2 </sub>N where L is the number of letters, numbers or symbols in the sequence and N is the number of possible letters, numbers or symbols. See, e.g. National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-63, Electronic Authentication Guideline, Appendix A; Bruce Schneier, Applied Cryptography, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, 1996, Chapter 11, Mathematical Background, p. 233-237. For example, in a pseudorandom alphanumeric sequence, where each alphanumeric character in the sequence is produced independently, and where the number of possible letters, numbers or symbols includes all letters in the Latin alphabet from a-z (26), A-Z (26) and all Arabic numerals from 0-9 (10), the entropy per symbol would be calculated as H=log<sub>2 </sub>N or log<sub>2 </sub>(52) or 5.70 bits per symbol. It is well known in the art to select L and N based on a desired information entropy, thus, one skilled in the art would understand to select those values for the activation code based on a desired information entropy.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is also understood that to be cryptographically secure, a pseudorandom sequence must be unpredictable where a secret key, or seed, is used to set the initial state of the pseudorandom sequence generator. Key management of the secret key or seed may be implemented by the financial institution in any method known in the art and should be at least in compliance with the financial industry standards set forth by the Accredited Standards Committee X9. In addition to employing a secret key, there are a wide variety of known methods to generate the seed for pseudorandom sequence generation. For example, the standard C function RAND may be seeded using the time function, although time of day is often not used as a seed due to its susceptibility to cryptographic attacks. Additionally, by way of example, Open SSL may use the function RAND_screen( ) to hash the contents of the screen to generate a seed. Further by way of example, the Linux random number generator may collect data from a variety of sources, including mouse, keyboard and other interrupts to seed a random number generator. Furthermore, it is well known in the art to combine the seed and a counter output and hash the output with a one-way hashing functions such as MD5 or SHA-1 to generate a cryptographically secure pseudorandom sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment, at block <b>215</b>, a third party check provider or check printing service provider may generate an identical activation code for the customer requested checkbook at block <b>213</b>. It is understood that the financial institution and third party check provider or check printing service provider should use identical activation code algorithms, identical pseudorandom sequence generators in synchronism and an identical seed previously supplied in advance of the activation code generation. In an embodiment, the activation codes generated by the financial institution and third party check provider or check printing service provider may be verified by any secure communication method known in the art including secure communication methods employing asymmetric or symmetric encryption techniques, message authentication codes, secure hashing algorithms, and/or, as discussed above, a combination thereof using, for example, a network security protocol known in the art such as SSL or TLS where the information sent between the financial institution and third party check provider or check printing service provider is encrypted. In an alternate embodiment, a third party check provider or check printing service provider may generate the activation code for the customer requested checkbook at block <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a flow chart illustrating a method for securing payment instruments according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment and as discussed above, the customer may order or request a checkbook at block <b>213</b>. Upon receipt of the request or order from the customer, at block <b>215</b>, an activation code is generated by the financial institution using any appropriate method known or used in the art. As discussed above, in an alternate embodiment, the activation code, or an identical activation code, may be generated by a third party check provider or check printing service provider. At block <b>417</b>, in embodiments including a compilation of paper payment instruments, such as a paper checkbook, each of the plurality of paper checks in the checkbook is printed, assembled and united into a booklet form by the financial institution, third party check provider or third party check printing service provider as requested by the customer at block <b>213</b>. In embodiments including a compilation of electronic financial instruments, such as an electronic checkbook, each of the plurality of electronic checks is created, electronically assembled and electronically united into an electronic checkbook file by the financial institution or third party check provider at block <b>417</b>, as requested by the customer at block <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an embodiment, at block <b>419</b>, the activation code is issued to an address of the customer stored or possessed by the financial institution at, for example, records or files at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. The address of the customer may include, but is not limited to, a physical mailing address or electronic mailing address. In an embodiment, the customer may be requested to verify the physical mailing address or electronic mailing address that is stored or possessed by the financial institution prior to requesting or ordering a checkbook at block <b>213</b>. In an exemplary embodiment using a paper checkbook, at block <b>419</b>, the activation code may be mailed to an address of the customer stored by the financial institution, third party check provider or third party check printing service provider with the printed checkbook that was ordered by the customer at block <b>213</b>.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a flow chart for authenticating a received payment instrument according to an embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated. At block <b>1001</b>, a financial institution receives a customer's check. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the check may include a customer name <b>1102</b>, a customer address <b>1104</b>, a customer account number <b>1106</b>, a check sequence number <b>1108</b>, a unique pseudorandom check code <b>1110</b>, and transaction-related information such as a payee name <b>1112</b>, a date <b>1114</b>, and an amount <b>1116</b>. As discussed above, the check may be a paper check or an electronic check. In an embodiment, a customer may have previously provided the check to a third party. The third party may be a company or person to whom the customer owes a debt or desires to make a payment. For example, the customer may provide a paper check to a utility company to cover a monthly bill or to a friend or relative as a gift. In an embodiment, the customer may provide an electronic check to one or more payees to satisfy a debt or make a payment. One skilled in the art will recognize that the customer may provide a check through a wide variety of methods including, but not limited to, telephone, electronic mail, physical mail, by submitting a bill payment request through a financial institution's electronic system for online bill payment, or by providing a check directly to a third party. In an embodiment using electronic systems for online bill payment, a financial institution or check service provider may provide a paper check or electronic check based on the customer's online bill payment request to a third party on behalf of the customer. In an another embodiment, the customer may submit a request to create a paper check from an electronic check through a financial institution's website displayed on, for example, a customer's terminal <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or to local computer <b>164</b> at the customer's home, office or other location. In an embodiment, the third party may deposit the check in a financial institution of the third party, such as for example, a bank of first deposit. One skilled in the art would understand that a bank of first deposit may include any financial institution where a customer's check is initially deposited to an account. For example, if the check is drawn on another financial institution or bank, the collecting bank may present the check directly to a paying financial institution or the collecting bank may present the check to a correspondent bank or clearinghouse corporation, or to the Federal Reserve Bank for settlement against a paying financial institution's reserve account. One skilled in the art would also understand that a Federal Reserve Bank may be any of the regional banks in the Federal Reserve System. In an embodiment, the bank of first deposit may scan the deposited check and send an electronic image of the deposited check, or a substitute check, to a paying financial institution or Federal Reserve Bank as appropriate. In an embodiment including a Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank may process the check and send an electronic image, or substitute check, to the paying bank through, for example, the Federal Reserve's Automated Clearing House (ACH) system. In an embodiment, a correspondent bank or clearinghouse corporation may process the check through an electronic check processing system such as, for example, FedWire or Clearing House Interbank Payment System (CHIPS).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At block <b>1003</b>, the financial institution may authenticate the customer identifying information on the received check <b>1100</b> by any appropriate method known in the art. For example, the customer identifying information on the received check <b>1100</b> may be compared to identifying information for the customer in records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. If the customer identifying information on the received check <b>1100</b> is not authenticated, the financial institution may reject the check at block <b>1005</b> by any appropriate method known in the art. In an embodiment, the financial institution may send a received substitute check, or received scanned image of the electronic check, back to its originator such as, for example, the bank of first deposit, Federal Reserve Bank, correspondent bank or clearinghouse corporation that processed the check. If the financial institution rejects the check, the financial institution may, at block <b>1007</b>, notify the customer of the rejected check by any appropriate method. In an embodiment, the financial institution may take additional measures to enhance the security of the customer's account. For example, the financial institution may review a risk assessment stored for the customer or force the customer to modify customer identifying information to include, for example, a username, a password, website login information assigned to the customer by the financial institution or selected by the customer when creating an online account with the financial institution, a personal identification number (PIN), telephone call-in information assigned to the customer by the financial institution or selected by the customer during account set-up, a call-in password, or a call-in PIN.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the customer identifying information on the received check <b>1100</b> is authenticated, the financial institution may, at block <b>1009</b>, determine the status of activating a checkbook for the authenticated customer. In an embodiment, the financial institution may determine the status of activating a checkbook for the authenticated customer by comparing at least a portion of the customer identifying information for the authenticated customer stored in records or files possessed by the financial institution with at least a portion of the customer identifying information on the received check and by reviewing the status of the stored activation code. In an exemplary embodiment, the financial institution may determine the status of activating a checkbook for the authenticated customer by determining if the activation code stored in records or files possessed by the financial institution has been updated to indicate that it was activated by the authenticated customer as described above. For example, the financial institution may determine the status of activating a checkbook for the customer by comparing the customer's name and account number on the received check to the stored customer name and customer account number to determine that the customer is authentic and by determining if the stored activation code has been updated to indicate that it was activated by the associated customer that was previously authenticated. In an alternate embodiment, the financial institution may simply determine the status of activating a checkbook for the authenticated customer using the stored activation code associated with the authenticated customer. If the authenticated customer is determined to not have an activated checkbook, the financial institution may reject the check by looping back to block <b>1005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the authenticated customer is determined to have an activated checkbook, the financial institution may, at block <b>1011</b>, authenticate the unique pseudorandom check code on the received check using the stored information for identifying the customer, at least a portion of the information for indentifying the customer on the received check and by comparing the unique pseudorandom check code on the received check with the stored unique pseudorandom check codes of the pseudorandom sequence associated with the authenticated customer. In an exemplary embodiment, the financial institution may authenticate the unique pseudorandom check code on the received check by comparing it with the stored unique pseudorandom check codes of the pseudorandom sequence associated with the authenticated customer to determine if the received check pseudorandom check code matches one of the stored unique pseudorandom check codes for the activated checkbook. If the received check pseudorandom check code does not match one of the stored unique pseudorandom check codes for the activated checkbook associated with the authenticated customer, the financial institution may reject the check by looping back to block <b>1005</b>. However, if the customer identifying information and the unique pseudorandom check code included on the received check are authenticated, and the checkbook for the authenticated customer is determined to be activated, then the received check is determined to be authentic.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In an embodiment, and as discussed above, a customer may be provided with the capability to actively reconcile each of the plurality of checks in the activated checkbook through a financial institution or check service provider, including the capability to stop payment of a check, void a check, or cancel one or more of the plurality of outstanding checks in the activated checkbook online or offline using, for example, the financial institution's online banking website. If the customer has previously communicated to the financial institution his desire to void, cancel or stop payment for the received check, the financial institution may determine this fact, at block <b>1013</b>, by comparing check identifying information including, for example, the check sequence number for the received check, at least a portion of the customer identifying information on the received check, and/or the unique pseudorandom check code number for the received check with the corresponding information stored in records or files possessed by the financial institution for the authenticated customer. If the authenticated customer is determined to have previously voided, cancelled or ordered payment stopped for the received check, the financial institution may reject the check by looping back to block <b>1005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In an embodiment, if the authenticated customer is determined to have taken no prior action to reconcile the received check, and if the received check has been authenticated, the financial institution may, at block <b>1017</b>, debit or release the amount of the authenticated customer's funds from the account associated with the received authenticated check. In another embodiment, at block <b>1015</b>, the amount <b>1116</b> on the received authenticated check is compared with an account balance for the authenticated customer to determine if the authenticated customer has sufficient funds in the appropriate account to cover the received authenticated check. If the balance is determined to be insufficient, the financial institution may reject the check by looping back to block <b>1005</b>. However, if the balance is determined to be sufficient, the financial institution may then, at block <b>1017</b>, debit or release the amount of the customer's funds from the customer's account associated with the received authenticated check. As discussed above, the customer may be able to obtain information and details of each check of the plurality of checks in the activated checkbook by contacting the financial institution through a wide variety of methods including, but not limited to, telephone, electronic mail, physical mail or by entering and accessing the financial institution's electronic system for online banking. The customer may also be able to obtain information and details of the status of each of the customer's accounts by using similar methods known in the art.</p>
