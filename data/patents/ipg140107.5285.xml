<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to improve riding feel and comfort of an automobile, there is a need for a contrivance so that engine vibrations are not transmitted to the driver compartment. Heretofore, there has been proposed a technique for reducing automobile body vibration by imparting a vibration absorbing function to the mounting mechanism that supports an engine, or by forced excitation with use of an actuator (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. S61-220925, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. S64-083742).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional techniques, in order to control an actuator, sensors are used for detecting relative displacement, relative velocity, and relative acceleration between the actuator movable section and the fixation section. However, the sensors need to be installed in the vicinity of the engine where they are exposed to a high temperature environment, and consequently there is a problem of a lack of reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, in the case of using plate springs or the like in order to ensure durability of a movable element supporting means of the actuator, a resonance system is constituted by a movable section mass and plate spring constant. However, in controlling automobile vibration, there is a problem of negative impact on vibration suppression control in that in the case where the resonance magnification is high, if the resonance frequency changes even slightly due to temperature changes or age related changes, the response of the actuator to command signals changes significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, there is known a vibration suppression apparatus that can actively reduce vibrations of the vibration prevention target object over an entire wide frequency bandwidth by; detecting vibrations of the vibration prevention target object, passing this detection signal through a filter to thereby generate vibration waveforms that interfere with the vibrations of the vibration prevention target object and cancel out the vibrations, and applying signals based on these vibration waveforms to the actuator (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. H03-219140).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Control is performed to automobiles of recent years that aims to improve fuel economy by stopping cylinders of a six cylinder engine as required so as to drive the engine with fewer cylinders (for example, with three cylinders). If the cylinders are stopped, there is a possibility that engine vibrations may increase compared to the vibrations in a six cylinder operation. For solving such problems, as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. H03-219140, a vibration suppression apparatus that actively reduces vibrations across a wide frequency bandwidth is effective.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the conventional damping apparatus performs only a control to suppress vibrations being generated. Therefore, there is a problem in that in an automobile to which control is performed to stop a predetermined number of cylinders in a six cylinder engine, all vibrations are suppressed so that it is difficult to sense that the engine is driving, and hence the driver experiences discomfort. It is desirable the driver experiences no discomfort, by suppressing the vibrations without letting the driver feel the switch from six cylinder driving to a cylinder stop operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is also known a vibration control apparatus for an automobile that uses an actuator that uses reaction force occurring as a result of driving a movable section, to thereby generate a damping force according to engine revolution speed (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. S61-220925). According to this apparatus, vibrations of the automobile body can be predicted from the revolution speed of the automobile engine, and a force applied to the automobile body from the engine can be canceled by the actuator. Therefore, it is possible to reduce vibrations of the automobile body. Such a damping apparatus uses a linear actuator that performs reciprocation, to vibrate an auxiliary mass to thereby reduce vibrations of the damping target. On the other hand, as a linear actuator, there is known a linear actuator in which an elastic supporting section (plate spring) supports a movable element at a fixed position and elastically transforms itself to thereby support the movable element (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2004-343964). In this linear actuator, no wear or sliding resistance occurs on the movable element, and even after use for a long period of time, the precision of the bearing support does not decrease, and a high level of reliability can be attained. Furthermore, there is no power consumption loss caused by sliding resistance, and an improvement in the performance can be achieved. Moreover, the elastic supporting section avoids interference with a coil and is supported on a stator in a position that is away from the coil with the movable element as a base point. Thus, it becomes possible to arrange the voluminous coil and the elastic supporting section in close proximity to each other, and therefore, a reduction in the size of the linear actuator can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, there is known a damping apparatus which, in order to optimize damping control, prepares a plurality of data maps of amplitude and phase data according to the operating state of the automobile, and generates signals for driving the actuator that dampens vibrations based on the amplitude/phase data from the data maps which is taken out according to the operating state of the automobile (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. H11-259147). Moreover, adaptive filters are a technique for performing damping while following the changes in the state of an automobile, and as examples of which, there are known adaptive filters realized in time domain (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. H10-49204, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-51703) and adaptive filters realized in frequency domain (for example, refer to &#x201c;Application techniques of adaptive filters&#x201d;, Toshifumi Kosaka, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of Japan, volume 48, No. 7, P. 520). In any method that uses adaptive filters, control is performed such that the amplitude phase for suppressing vibrations is found by itself based on error signals (for example, acceleration signals) at a specific measuring point.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, there is a problem in that since the operation of adaptive filter processing takes a long time, the damping effect is degraded if sudden changes occur in engine revolution speed, and in particular, the method realized in the frequency domain takes a long time for processing. There is also a problem in that if there are characteristic changes or age related changes that would cause changes in the transfer function from the command values for the actuator to the signals at the measuring point (acceleration), the damping characteristic is degraded. On the other hand, with the method that makes reference to the map data to perform control, processing time can be reduced and it is therefore possible to improve response. However, there is a problem in that individual differences or age related changes of the actuator used for the control or the damping target engine cause degradation in the damping performance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, in the case where an auxiliary mass (weight) is attached to the linear actuator, and the reaction force that occurs when vibrating this auxiliary mass is used to perform damping control for suppressing vibrations of the target device, an amplitude command value and frequency command value are found based on the vibration state value of the control target device, and the value of current to be applied to the linear actuator is controlled according to this amplitude command value and frequency command value. By attaching such a damping apparatus to the body of an automobile, the force from the engine of the automobile being applied to the automobile body can be cancelled out, and therefore it is possible to reduce vibrations of the automobile body.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, there is a problem in that if there is occurring an external force (disturbance) that is close to the natural frequency determined from the auxiliary mass fixed on the movable element and the plate spring that holds this movable element, or if a driving command value that is close to the natural frequency is inputted, then excessive amplitude occurs due to resonance, and a force greater than the required reaction force for damping occurs, making the linear actuator unable to perform appropriate vibration suppression control.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, there is a problem in that since there is structurally provided a stopper of the movable element in order to limit the movable range of the movable element, in the case where changes in the behavior of the automobile become significant as a result of the automobile suddenly accelerating or traveling over a rough road surface, an external force acts on the auxiliary mass. Consequently, excessive amplitude occurs so that there is a problem in that a phenomena where the movable element collides with the stopper occurs. Furthermore there is a problem in that, in the case where changes in the behavior of the automobile are significant, changes in current for driving the linear actuator also becomes more significant proportionately, and the movable element consequently collides with the stopper. If the movable element collides with the stopper, the sound of collision occurs as an abnormal noise. Also there is a problem in that if too many collisions occur between the movable element and the stopper, there will be a greater chance of reduced lifetime of the components that constitute the linear actuator.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention takes the above circumstances into consideration, and its object is to provide a damping apparatus for an automobile and a control method thereof, capable of ensuring a high level of reliability while obtaining an excellent damping effect with a simple configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, an object is to provide a damping apparatus and a vibration suppression method, capable, even when the state of the excitation source changes, of maintaining vibrations in a state the same as that before the change occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, an object is to provide a damping apparatus for an automobile and a vibration control method, capable of reducing negative impact of individual differences or age related changes on damping performance while being capable of maintaining excellent damping performance even for sudden changes in engine revolution speed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Moreover, an object is to provide a damping apparatus and a control method of the damping apparatus, capable of suppressing resonance phenomena and maintaining the vibration amplitude of the auxiliary mass within an appropriate range to thereby realize ideal vibration suppression.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, an object is to provide a damping apparatus and a control method of the damping apparatus, capable of suppressing generation of an abnormal noise by limiting the vibration amplitude of the auxiliary mass within an appropriate range.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention provides a damping apparatus for an automobile that reduces vibrations of an automobile body, including: an actuator that is attached to the automobile body and drives an auxiliary mass; a current detector that detects a current flowing through an armature of the actuator; a section that detects a terminal voltage applied to the actuator; a calculation circuit that calculates an induced voltage of the actuator, and further calculates at least one of a relative velocity, a relative displacement, and a relative acceleration of the actuator, based on a current detected by the current detector and the terminal voltage; and a control circuit that controls activation of the actuator, based on at least one of the relative velocity, the relative displacement, and the relative acceleration of the actuator calculated by the calculation circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the present invention, the current flowing through the actuator that is attached to an automobile body and drives the auxiliary mass is detected, the terminal voltage applied to the actuator is detected, then based on the detected current and the detected terminal voltage, the induced voltage of the actuator is calculated, and at least one of the relative velocity, relative displacement, and relative acceleration of the actuator is further calculated, and based on at least one of the calculated relative velocity, relative displacement, and relative acceleration of the actuator, the actuator is drive-controlled. Therefore, for detecting the calculated relative velocity, relative displacement, and relative acceleration between the movable section of the actuator and the fixation section, there is no need for using sensors that are exposed to a high temperature environment. As a result, a high level of reliability can be ensured. Moreover, with use of displacement information such as relative velocity, relative displacement, and relative acceleration of the actuator, a spring effect can be obtained. Furthermore, with use of calculated velocity information, a damper effect can be obtained. Moreover, by performing a feed back control with use of velocity information (relative velocity) obtained in calculation, it is possible to make the resonance characteristic of the actuator gradual, so that even if the resonance frequency of the actuator changes, since the gain characteristic and phase characteristic are gradual, changes in response with respect to command signals are small, and influence on the control performance can be made small.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention provides a damping apparatus that suppresses unwanted vibrations and generates predetermined vibrations as necessary, including: an excitation section that excites a damping target object by vibrating an auxiliary mass supported by a linear actuator; a frequency detection section that detects a frequency of an excitation source that oscillates the damping target object; a vibration detection section that detects vibrations at a measuring point; a calculation section that finds command values of vibrations to be suppressed and vibrations to be generated, based on a frequency of the excitation source and a vibration detected at the measuring point; and a control signal output section that outputs a control signal, in which the command value of vibrations to be suppressed and the command value of vibrations to be generated are superimposed, to the excitation section.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the present invention, it is possible to suppress unwanted vibrations while generating predetermined vibrations as necessary, and therefore there an effect can be obtained where there is no imparting of discomfort associated with vibration control.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention provides a damping apparatus for an automobile including: an excitation section that vibrates an auxiliary mass; a state information acquisition section that acquires information indicating an operating state of an automobile; a mapping control section that reads out an excitation force command value according to the operating state information acquired by the state information acquisition section from a damping information table where the operating state information and a command value for generating an excitation force by the excitation section are associated with each other, and that controls the excitation section based on the excitation force command value; a vibration detection section that detects a vibration state value indicating a vibration state of a damping target at a measuring point; an adaptive control section that finds an excitation force command value by using an adaptive filter according to the vibration state detected by the vibration detection section, and controls the excitation section based on the excitation force command value; and a control switching section that switches to control of the excitation section by the adaptive control section in a case where a vibration state value detected by the vibration detection section exceeds a predetermined value during control of the excitation section by the mapping control section.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the present invention, control is switched to an adaptive filter in the case where damping control performance of the mapping control is degraded due to the influence of individual differences or age related changes. Consequently, the damping performance can be improved. Moreover, since the mapping data of mapping control is updated according to the control with an adaptive filter, the damping performance with mapping control can be recovered. Furthermore, since the type is switched according to the revolution speed change rate while performing adaptive filter, it is possible to select an appropriate adaptive filter when changes occur to the engine revolution speed, to perform damping control. Furthermore, since the transfer function required in the time domain adaptive filter is updated with the calculation process of the frequency domain adaptive filter, it is possible to prevent the characteristics of the time domain adaptive filter from being degraded due to changes in the transfer function.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention provides a damping apparatus that includes an actuator that drives an auxiliary mass held by spring elements, with respect to a damping target section, and that suppresses vibrations of the damping target section by using a reaction force at the time of driving the auxiliary mass, the damping apparatus further including a resonance suppression section of the actuator based on an ideal actuator inverse characteristic that uses a transfer function of a vibration velocity with respect to an excitation force of a vibrating system of the actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the present invention, since there is provided the resonance suppression section of the actuator based on the ideal actuator inverse characteristic that uses the transfer function of the vibration velocity with respect to an excitation force of the vibrating system of the actuator, it is possible to achieve an effect where the actuator characteristic can be adjusted to an arbitrary characteristic by setting the ideal actuator inverse characteristic based on a desired characteristic. As a result, by increasing the damping characteristic of the desired characteristic, it is possible to attain a characteristic such that resonance in the movable section of the actuator is unlikely to be generated by an external force that acts on the actuator main unit. Therefore, an appropriate reaction force can be generated to thereby realize ideal vibration suppression. Moreover, since it is possible to reduce the apparent natural frequency of the actuator by reducing the natural frequency of the desired characteristic, then even in the vicinity of the natural frequency of the actual actuator, it is possible to realize stable damping control without receiving the influence of the spring characteristic and the like. Furthermore, since it is possible to maintain the movable range of the movable element of the actuator within an appropriate range, the movable element does not collide with the stopper. As a result, generation of collision sound can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention provides a damping apparatus including: an auxiliary mass member supported by a spring element; an actuator that vibrates the auxiliary mass member; and a control section that controls a current applied to the actuator in order to suppress vibrations of a vibration damping target by using a reaction force when vibrating the auxiliary mass member with the actuator, wherein the control section further includes an amplitude amount control section that performs control for limiting a value of a current applied to the actuator, so that a vibration amplitude of the auxiliary mass member does not exceed a predetermined value in a case of controlling current applied to the actuator based on an amplitude command value and a frequency command value of vibrations to be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the present invention, in the case of controlling the current applied to the actuator based on the amplitude command value and the frequency command value of the vibrations to be generated, the value of current applied to the actuator is limited so that the vibration amplitude of the auxiliary mass member does not exceed a predetermined value. Therefore, it is possible to obtain an effect where the movable element of the actuator can be constantly driven within an appropriate movable range. As a result collision between the movable element and the stopper is eliminated, and hence generation of a collision sound can be suppressed.</p>

Reference symbol <b>40</b> denotes an engine of an automobile that is fixed on an automobile body frame <b>41</b>. Reference symbol <b>42</b> denotes wheels of the automobile.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Rather than slidably and reciprocatably supporting the movable element as conventionally practiced, each of the plate springs <b>3</b> supports the movable section <b>1</b> in two positions on the tip end side and the rear end side of the shaft <b>11</b>, and they elastically deforms themselves to thereby support the movable section <b>1</b> while allowing it to reciprocate in the axial direction of the shaft <b>11</b>. Pre-adjustments such as increasing the distance between the through hole <b>3</b><i>a </i>for supporting the shaft <b>11</b> and the small hole <b>3</b><i>d </i>or <b>3</b><i>e </i>(the length of the plate spring itself, not the direct distance) to the possible maximum length, or reducing the plate thickness, are performed, so that the amount of deformation in each of the plate springs <b>3</b> when the movable section <b>1</b> reciprocates, becomes smaller than the amount of deformation that leads to a possibility of breakage due to the fatigue caused by repetitive forced elastic deformation thereof. However, when the entire linear actuator is seen from the axial direction of the shaft <b>11</b>, the outer shape of each of the plate springs <b>3</b> is in a size that does not allow it to stick out from the outer shape of the yoke <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The behavior of an operation of the linear actuator configured in this way is described below. If an alternating current (sinusoidal current, square-wave current) is applied to the coils <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> in a state where a current flows through the coils <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> in a predetermined direction, a magnetic flux is guided, in the permanent magnet <b>24</b>, from the south pole to the north pole, and a magnetic flux loop that circulates through an outer circumference section of the yoke <b>21</b>, the magnetic pole section <b>21</b><i>a</i>, the permanent magnet <b>24</b>, the movable element <b>12</b>, the shaft <b>11</b>, and the outer circumference section of the yoke <b>21</b>, in this order is thereby formed. As a result, a force acts on the movable section <b>1</b> in the axial direction from the rear end to the tip end of the shaft <b>11</b>, and the movable section <b>1</b> is pushed by this force and moved in the same direction. On the other hand, in a state where a current flows through the coils <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> in a direction opposite to the above mentioned predetermined direction, a magnetic flux is guided, in the permanent magnet <b>25</b>, from the south pole to the north pole, and a magnetic flux loop that circulates through the outer circumference section of the yoke <b>21</b>, the magnetic pole section <b>21</b><i>a</i>, the permanent magnet <b>25</b>, the movable element <b>12</b>, the shaft <b>11</b>, and the outer circumference section of the yoke <b>21</b>, in this order is thereby formed. As a result, a force acts on the movable section <b>1</b> in the axial direction from the tip end to the rear end of the shaft <b>11</b>, and the movable section <b>1</b> is pushed by this force and moved in the same direction. The flow directions of the currents flowing into the coils <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> are alternately changed by the alternating current, and the movable section <b>1</b> thereby repeats the above operation and reciprocates in the axial direction of the shaft <b>11</b> with respect to the stator <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the above linear actuator, rather than slidably and reciprocatably supporting the movable section, each of the plate springs <b>3</b> supports the movable section <b>1</b> in two positions on the tip end side and the rear end side of the shaft <b>11</b>, and they elastically deforms themselves to thereby support the movable section <b>1</b> while allowing it to reciprocate in the axial direction of the shaft <b>11</b>. As a result, no wear or sliding resistance occurs on the movable section <b>1</b>. Therefore, even after use for a long period of time, the precision of the bearing support does not decrease, and a high level of reliability can be attained. Furthermore, there is no power consumption loss caused by sliding resistance, and an improvement in the performance can be achieved. Moreover, in the above linear actuator, each of the plate springs <b>3</b> avoids interference with the coils <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> and is supported by the stator <b>2</b> in a position that is away from the coils <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> with the movable element as a base point. As a result, it becomes possible to arrange the voluminous coils <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> and the two plate springs <b>3</b> in close proximity to each other. Therefore, a reduction in the size of the linear actuator can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, a modified example of the damping apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is described, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> differs from the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that instead of having the relative velocity sensor <b>33</b>, there is provided a current detector <b>51</b> that detects a driving current, and stabilization is realized based on the current detected by the current detector <b>51</b>. A stabilizing controller <b>61</b> estimates an induced voltage generated by the linear actuator <b>31</b> according to a coil current (driving current) of the linear actuator <b>31</b>, a voltage command or a terminal voltage output from a power circuit <b>71</b>, or the like, and based on this, it estimates a relative velocity between the linear actuator <b>31</b> and the auxiliary mass <b>32</b>. This estimation value is fed back and a damping force is thereby generated in the linear actuator <b>31</b>. As a result, the influence of disturbance vibrations can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For the terminal voltage, a signal found by multiplying a voltage command by a voltage amplifier gain may be used in a voltage amplifier included in the power circuit <b>71</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the case where induced voltage feed back is absent, then with respect to changes in the resonance frequency of the actuator, changes in the gain characteristic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (<i>a</i>) and the phase characteristic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (<i>b</i>) are steep. On the other hand, it can be seen that in the damping apparatus for an automobile according to the present embodiment, by performing induced voltage feed back (feed back control with use of velocity information), the gain characteristic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (<i>a</i>) and the phase characteristic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (<i>b</i>) are moderate even if the resonance frequency of the actuator changes, and therefore changes in the response with respect to the command signal become smaller and an influence on control performance becomes smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Moreover, by performing a feed back control with use of velocity information obtained by calculation, the resonance characteristic of the actuator becomes moderate.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, a configuration of a damping apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of the damping apparatus according to the second embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the damping apparatus is connected to an automobile body frame (main system mass) <b>41</b> serving as a control object, and controls (damps) vibrations in the vertical direction (gravitational direction) that occur in the body frame (main system mass) <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The damping apparatus in the present embodiment is a so-called active dynamic vibration absorber, and includes a current detector <b>63</b> that detects driving current to a linear actuator <b>31</b>, a terminal voltage detector <b>64</b> that detects terminal voltage of the linear actuator <b>31</b>, and the linear actuator <b>31</b> that drives based on detection results of the current detector <b>63</b> and the terminal voltage detector <b>64</b>. The damping apparatus uses the driving force of the linear actuator <b>31</b> to drive the auxiliary mass <b>32</b> in the vertical direction (the direction of vibrations to be damped), and applies to the main system mass <b>41</b> an inertial force of the auxiliary mass including the auxiliary mass <b>32</b> as a reaction force, thereby suppressing vibrations of the main system mass <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The current detector <b>63</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> detects the current supplied to the linear actuator <b>31</b> and supplies this to a controller <b>62</b>. Moreover, the terminal voltage detector <b>64</b> detects the terminal voltage applied to the linear actuator <b>31</b>, and supplies this to the controller <b>62</b>. In the case where the linear actuator <b>31</b> is driven, the linear actuator <b>31</b> generates an induced electromotive force proportional to velocity. By calculating this induced electromotive force, a velocity signal can be obtained. Moreover, it is possible to obtain a vibration displacement signal by integration processing it, and to obtain vibration acceleration by differentiation processing it.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a terminal voltage V and a current i are detected, and are output as an induced voltage E through an amplifying circuit and a differentiating circuit. In this case, gains K<b>1</b> and K<b>2</b> corresponding to a wire wound resistance R and a wire wound inductance L need to be set. This setting is adjusted by applying a current of a predetermined frequency while the movable section of the linear actuator (movable element, auxiliary mass) is in a state of being restrained so that the output becomes zero. Since the relationship E=V&#x2212;R&#xb7;i&#x2212;L(di/dt) holds for the induced voltage E, it is possible to find the induced voltage E by detecting the terminal voltage V and the current i.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the case where a spring constant close to an optimum value for the dynamic vibration absorber can be obtained by means of the magnetic spring characteristic or mechanical spring element, then by adjusting the damping force that the linear actuator <b>31</b> generates, a high level of damping effect can be achieved without supplying energy for damping. The damping force can be adjusted by connecting a load resistance to both ends of the coil of the linear actuator <b>31</b> and by changing the level of this load resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The controller <b>62</b>, based on the induced voltage calculated from the current and terminal voltage detected by the current detector <b>63</b> and the terminal voltage detector <b>64</b>, calculates the relative velocity, relative displacement, or relative acceleration of the linear actuator <b>31</b>, and derives an optimum driving amount (control amount) of the linear actuator <b>31</b> for the damping apparatus to obtain an optimum spring characteristic and damping characteristic for vibration-damping the main system mass <b>41</b>, and the derived result is output to a power amplifier <b>72</b> as a command signal. Electric power is supplied from a power supply circuit <b>90</b> to the power amplifier <b>72</b>. The power amplifier <b>72</b>, according to the command signal of the controller <b>62</b>, drives the linear actuator <b>31</b>, and the linear actuator <b>31</b> drives (vibrates) the auxiliary mass <b>32</b> in the vertical (gravitational) direction to thereby damp the main system mass <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to the above embodiment, without use of a sensor for detecting the relative displacement, relative velocity, and relative acceleration between the movable section and the fixation section of the actuator, the relative velocity, relative displacement, or relative acceleration of the linear actuator <b>31</b> are calculated based on the induced voltage calculated from the current and the terminal voltage of the linear actuator <b>31</b>, and the linear actuator <b>31</b> is controlled based on the relative velocity, relative displacement, or relative acceleration. As a result, a high level of reliability can be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Moreover, by making use of displacement information obtained by calculation, a spring effect can be obtained. Furthermore, by making use of velocity information obtained by calculation, a damping effect can be obtained.</p>

The method of detecting induced electromotive force shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> differs from the method of detecting induced electromotive force shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in that in order to limit the control bandwidth for suppressing resonance with the feed back of an estimated velocity value to be in the vicinity of the resonance frequency of the linear actuator <b>31</b>, there is provided a band-pass filter (BPF). This band-pass filter is a filter for obtaining a damping effect only within the vicinity of the resonance frequency of the linear actuator <b>31</b> (frequency close to the natural frequency), and the phase of this band-pass filter is set so that it becomes 0&#xb0; in the vicinity of the resonance frequency of the actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">By providing the band-pass filter, the noise component of direct current can be suppressed and it is possible to adjust the phase. Therefore, the certainty of an estimated induced voltage can be improved.</p>

The cutoff frequency of these low pass filters is set to a frequency higher than the resonance frequency (natural frequency) of the linear actuator <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">By providing the low pass filters, the high frequency noise component can be removed, and therefore generation of an abnormal noise caused by the noise component can be suppressed.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Moreover, the linear actuator <b>31</b> is an actuator that uses electromagnetic force, and is effective if it uses a reciprocating motor for example.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As described above, in the actuator in which the movable section is supported with a spring element, even if an external excitation force due to the uneven road surface acts on the actuator while the automobile is traveling, it is possible to suppress generation of excessive displacement caused by the external excitation force or resonance phenomena. Therefore, it is possible to prevent generation of an abnormal noise caused, for example, by the movable section of the actuator colliding with a stopper. Moreover, since it is possible to detect resonance phenomena on the driving circuit side, there is no need to provide a sensor or the like in the actuator main unit, and the actuator main unit can be miniaturized. Furthermore, even in the case where an error occurs in the coil constant due to individual differences or age related changes in the actuator, it is possible to prevent generation of a direct current component of unwanted current in the damping control. Moreover, since the high frequency noise component is not to be amplified, it is possible to reduce the generation level of undesired sound or abnormal noises. Furthermore, since the band-pass filter and low pass filter are provided in the vibration velocity feed back, and are made independent from a current feed back circuit, it is possible to prevent their influence on the response of the actuator with respect to high frequency driving commands.</p>

Thus, vibrations that need to be suppressed can be reduced and vibrations that need to be emphasized can be increased. Therefore, for example, it becomes possible to perform a control such that engine vibrations are suppressed while increasing bass sound vibrations generated from audio speakers when playing music, based on audio signals of music being played. Moreover, by suppressing engine vibrations, it becomes possible to reduce muffleness of sound within the interior of the automobile.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Thus, in order to suppress unwanted vibrations while generating predetermined vibrations as necessary, in the damping apparatus including a means for exciting the automobile body frame <b>41</b> by vibrating the auxiliary mass <b>32</b> supported by the linear actuator <b>31</b>, the frequency of the engine <b>40</b> that vibrates the automobile body frame <b>41</b> and the vibrations at the seat <b>44</b> are detected, and command values for vibrations to be suppressed and for vibrations to be generated are found based on the frequency of the engine <b>40</b> and the vibrations at the seat <b>44</b>, and a control signal in which these command values are superimposed, is output to the linear actuator <b>31</b>. As a result, it is possible to suppress unwanted vibrations and to generate predetermined vibrations as necessary, and to prevent discomfort due to the vibration control from being given to the driver.</p>

The power circuit <b>70</b>, based on these command values, controls vibrations of the excitation section to thereby reduce vibrations of a damping target (automobile body).</p>

The power circuit <b>70</b>, based on these command values, controls vibrations of the excitation section to thereby reduce vibrations of a damping target (automobile body).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a diagram showing an operation of the frequency domain adaptive filter section <b>605</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The frequency domain adaptive filter section <b>605</b> receives the input of a measuring point acceleration signal and engine pulse signal, finds a force command value of the force to be generated based on the frequency component of the damping target obtained with use of Fourier transform, finds sine wave exciting force command values (amplitude command value and phase command value) obtained based on this force command, and outputs these sine wave exciting force command values to the power circuit <b>70</b>. The power circuit <b>70</b>, based on these command values, controls vibrations of the excitation section to thereby reduce vibrations of a damping target (automobile body).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Next, an operation of the damping apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is described. First, when the engine of an automobile is started, the control switching section <b>607</b> selects the mapping control section <b>604</b>. Thus, mapping control is performed. In this state, the control switching section <b>607</b> compares an acceleration signal at the measuring point on the automobile body frame <b>41</b> with an acceleration reference value stored in the acceleration reference value table <b>608</b>, and if the detected acceleration exceeds the acceleration reference value, it performs switching from the mapping control to an adaptive filter. In the case where switching is made from the mapping control to the adaptive filter, the control switching section <b>607</b> makes reference to the output of the revolution speed change rate measuring section <b>609</b>, and it switches to the time domain adaptive filter section <b>606</b> if the change rate is significant and switches to the frequency domain adaptive filter section <b>605</b> if the change rate is small. Moreover, when the frequency domain adaptive filter section <b>605</b> is being operated, during the course of an adaptive filter calculation, the estimated transfer function of the signal transfer characteristic ((S(n)&#x2212;S(n&#x2212;1))/(M(n)&#x2212;M(n&#x2212;1)) that is essential in the time domain adaptive filter section <b>606</b> is found. This estimated transfer function corresponds to 1/G&#x2032; (s), and therefore the estimated transfer function G&#x2032; (s) of the time domain adaptive filter <b>6</b> is updated based on this result.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Having shifted to the adaptive filter, the control switching section <b>607</b> performs switching from the adaptive filter back to the mapping control at the point in time when acceleration is below the acceleration reference value. At this time, in the frequency domain adaptive filter section <b>605</b> or the time domain adaptive filter section <b>606</b>, sine wave exciting force commands that enable effective damping are found by means of the operation of the adaptive filter. Therefore the frequency domain adaptive filter section <b>605</b> or the time domain adaptive filter section <b>606</b>, based on the found excitation force command value, updates the mapping data held in the mapping control section <b>604</b>. With this operation, the mapping data is updated to the optimum mapping data at the present moment. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the damping performance from being degraded due to the influence of individual differences or age related changes, while maintaining appropriate execution of the damping control process.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, timings at which the control switching section <b>607</b> switches the respective controls are described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram showing operations for switching control types based on state values. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, based on the engine revolution speed N and the operating state value D<b>0</b>, the reference values obtained upon reference to the acceleration reference value table <b>608</b> are shown as A<b>1</b> (N, D<b>0</b>) or A<b>2</b> (N, D<b>0</b>). A<b>1</b> (N, D<b>0</b>) is a reference value for shifting from the mapping control to the adaptive filter, and A<b>2</b> (N, D<b>0</b>) is a reference value for shifting from the adaptive filter to the mapping control, where a relationship A<b>2</b> (N, D<b>0</b>)&#x2266;A<b>1</b> (N, D<b>0</b>) is satisfied. Moreover, reference values for performing shifting between adaptive filter types are shown as W<b>1</b> to W<b>4</b>. W<b>1</b> is a reference value for shifting from the frequency domain adaptive filter to the time domain adaptive filter, based on engine revolution speed change rate dN/dt. W<b>2</b> is a reference value for shifting from the time domain adaptive filter to no control, based on engine revolution speed change rate dN/dt. W<b>3</b> is a reference value for shifting from the time domain adaptive filter to the frequency domain adaptive filter, based on engine revolution speed change rate dN/dt. W<b>4</b> is a reference value for shifting from no control to the time domain adaptive filter, based on engine revolution speed change rate dN/dt. Reference values W<b>1</b> to W<b>4</b> satisfy relationships W<b>1</b>&#x3c;W<b>2</b>, W<b>3</b>&#x3c;W<b>4</b>, W<b>1</b>&#x2267;W<b>3</b>, and W<b>2</b>&#x2267;W<b>4</b>. Moreover, the mapping control state (initial state) is shown as C<b>0</b>=1, the control state with the frequency domain adaptive filter is shown as C<b>0</b>=2, the control state with the time domain adaptive filter is shown as C<b>0</b>=3, and the state without adaptive filter control is shown as C<b>0</b>=4. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, by selecting and executing a control type optimum at the present moment based on the reference values A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> found from the engine revolution speed N and the revolution speed change rate dN/dt and the reference values W<b>1</b> to W<b>4</b> for adaptive filter switching, an optimum damping control becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Reference values A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> may be the same value. However, these values may be set such that A<b>2</b>&#x3c;A<b>1</b> is satisfied, and after the acceleration reference value has been exceeded and a shift to adaptive filter control has been made, a hysteresis is provided when returning to the mapping control, so that the control returns to the mapping control if acceleration is below the acceleration reference value by the hysteresis width. Thus, the damping performance can be further improved, and the mapping data can be updated to have higher quality. Moreover, when returning to the mapping control, the control may return to the mapping control in the case where acceleration is below the acceleration reference value while revolution speed change rate is above the predetermined value. Thus, the control stays in the adaptive filter control as long as possible, and the mapping data can be updated while the damping performance is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Moreover, when updating the mapping data, only the engine revolution speed data for when the control has shifted from the mapping control to the adaptive filter control may be updated, and all of the revolution speed data while acceleration is below the acceleration reference value during the performance of the adaptive filter control may be updated. Furthermore, the timing of updating the mapping data is such that the mapping data is updated when the control returns to the mapping control, and in addition, the mapping data may be updated every time acceleration is below the acceleration reference value by a predetermined value while performing the adaptive filter control. Moreover, the timing of updating the transfer function is such that the transfer function is updated at constant time intervals, and in addition, it may be updated every time the revolution speed becomes a revolution speed away from a previously updated revolution speed by a predetermined interval. Moreover, in the case where the revolution speed change rate during the performance of the adaptive filter control is too significant, the operation of the adaptive filter may be stopped (no control) in order to avoid its adverse influence.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As described above, in the case where the damping performance with the mapping control is degraded due to individual differences and age related changes, the control is switched to the adaptive filter to thereby improve the damping performance and update the mapping data of the mapping control. Therefore, it is possible to recover the damping performance with the mapping control. Moreover, when performing the adaptive filter, it is switched to any one of the frequency domain, time domain, and no control, according to the revolution speed change rate and response. Therefore, when the revolution speed changes, it is possible to prevent vibrations from being made adversely significant by the adaptive filter. Furthermore, since the transfer function required in the time domain adaptive filter is updated with the calculation process of the frequency domain adaptive filter, it is possible to prevent the characteristic of the time domain adaptive filter from being degraded due to the changes in the transfer function.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Here, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the detailed configuration of the excitation section <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a diagram showing the detailed configuration of the excitation section <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In this diagram, reference symbol <b>32</b> denotes an auxiliary mass (weight) to be attached to the automobile body frame <b>41</b>. Reference symbol <b>34</b> denotes stators that constitute a linear actuator (reciprocating motor), and these stators <b>34</b> are fixed to the automobile body frame <b>41</b>. Reference symbol <b>12</b> denotes a movable element that constitutes the linear actuator (reciprocating motor), and this movable element reciprocates, for example, in the gravitational direction (in the vertical direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The excitation section <b>30</b> is fixed on the automobile body frame <b>41</b> so that the direction of the vibrations of the automobile body frame <b>41</b> to be suppressed matches the direction of the reciprocation (thrust direction) of the movable element <b>12</b>. Reference symbol <b>3</b> denotes a plate spring that supports the movable element <b>12</b> and the auxiliary mass <b>32</b> while allowing them to move along the thrust direction. Reference symbol <b>11</b> denotes a shaft that joins the movable element <b>12</b> to the auxiliary mass <b>32</b>, and is supported by the plate spring <b>3</b>. Reference symbol <b>35</b> denotes stoppers that limit the movable range of the movable element <b>12</b>, and limit the movable range on both ends of the movable element <b>12</b> (upper limit and lower limit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). This excitation section <b>30</b> constitutes a dynamic vibration absorber.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Next, an operation of the excitation section <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is described. In the case where an alternating current (sinusoidal current, square-wave current) is applied to a coil (not shown in the drawing) that constitutes the linear actuator (reciprocating motor), in a state where a current in a predetermined direction flows through the coil, magnetic flux is, in the permanent magnet, guided from the south pole to the north pole, forming a magnetic flux loop. As a result, the movable element <b>12</b> moves in the direction opposite to that of gravity (upward direction). On the other hand, if a current in the direction opposite to that of the predetermined direction flows through the coil, then the movable element <b>12</b> moves in the gravitational direction (downward direction). The direction of the current flow into the coils is alternately changed by the alternating current, and the movable element <b>12</b> thereby repeats the above operation and reciprocates in the axial direction of the shaft <b>11</b> with respect to the stator <b>34</b>. Thus, the auxiliary mass <b>32</b> joined to the shaft <b>11</b> vibrates in the vertical direction. By controlling the acceleration of the auxiliary mass <b>32</b> based on control signals output from the current control section <b>65</b>, the control force is adjusted and vibrations of the automobile body frame <b>41</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Next, an operation of the damping apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is described, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. First, the current detection section <b>631</b> detects the current supplied to the excitation section <b>30</b>, and supplies this to the current control section <b>65</b> and the actuator vibration velocity estimation section <b>66</b>. Moreover, the application voltage detection section <b>641</b> detects the voltage applied to the excitation section <b>30</b>, and supplies this to the actuator vibration velocity estimation section <b>66</b>. In the case where the linear actuator in the excitation section <b>30</b> is driven, the linear actuator generates an induced electromotive force proportional to velocity. By calculating this induced electromotive force, the actuator vibration velocity estimation section <b>66</b> can obtain a vibration velocity signal.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">For example, an application voltage V and a current i are detected, and are output as induced voltage E through an amplifying circuit and differentiating circuit. In this case, gains K<b>1</b> and K<b>2</b> corresponding to a wire wound resistance R and a wire wound inductance L need to be set. This setting is adjusted by applying a current of a predetermined frequency while the movable section of the linear actuator (movable element, auxiliary mass) is in a state of being restrained so that the output becomes zero. Since the relationship E=V&#x2212;R&#xb7;i&#x2212;L(di/dt) holds for the induced voltage E, it is possible to find the induced voltage E by detecting the terminal voltage V and the current i. Moreover, in the case where a spring constant close to an optimum value in the excitation section <b>30</b> can be obtained by means of the magnetic spring characteristic or mechanical spring element, then by adjusting the damping force that the linear actuator generates, a high level of damping effect can be achieved without supplying energy for damping. The damping force can be adjusted by connecting a load resistance to both ends of the coil of a linear actuator <b>11</b>A and by changing the level of this load resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The actual actuator output for a command value at the present moment is reflected on the output from the actuator vibration velocity estimation section <b>66</b>. On the assumption that the linear actuator is an ideal actuator, the current control section <b>65</b> receives the input of a command signal of a force required when the ideal actuator outputs a vibration velocity estimated by the actuator vibration velocity estimation section <b>66</b>. Therefore, the ideal actuator inverse characteristic section <b>67</b> outputs a command signal of a force required when the ideal actuator outputs the vibration velocity estimated by the actuator vibration velocity estimation section <b>66</b>. Expression (1) shows an example of the transfer function of the ideal actuator inverse characteristic.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The difference value between the actual command signal and the output of the ideal actuator inverse characteristic section <b>67</b> is fed back as a correction value of the command signal, and thereby the actual actuator can behave as the ideal actuator. The current control section <b>65</b>, based on the current detected by the current detection section <b>631</b> and the command signal output from the ideal actuator inverse characteristic section <b>67</b>, derives an optimum driving amount (control amount) of the linear actuator so that the optimum spring characteristic and damping characteristic for the excitation section <b>30</b> to damp the vibration of the automobile body frame <b>41</b> can be obtained, and outputs the derived result as a command signal to the power amplifier <b>72</b>. The power amplifier <b>72</b>, according to the command signal of the current control section <b>65</b>, drives the excitation section <b>30</b> so that the auxiliary mass <b>32</b> vibrates in the vertical (gravitational) direction. With the reaction force caused by the vibration of this auxiliary mass <b>32</b>, the vibrations occurring in the automobile body frame <b>41</b> are suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">There may be provided a band-pass filter that limits the ideal actuator inverse characteristic to a band in the vicinity of a resonance frequency of the actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Thus, by making the ideal actuator characteristic equal to that of an optimum dynamic vibration absorber, it becomes possible for an active dynamic vibration absorber to behave as the optimum dynamic vibration absorber. Therefore, in the damping apparatus for an automobile, it is possible to suppress resonance phenomenon to thereby to have the vibration amplitude of the auxiliary mass within an appropriate range, and to realize ideal vibration suppression. As a result, the vibration suppression performance can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Next, a modified example of the damping apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is described, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a modified example of the damping apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In this diagram, the same reference symbols are given to components the same as those of the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, and descriptions thereof are omitted. The apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> differs from the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> in that, instead of the predetermined value output section <b>68</b>, there is provided a control section <b>69</b> that acquires excitation source information (excitation timing, frequency, excitation force waveform, automobile body vibration, and so forth) and that outputs a command value for suppressing vibrations based on this excitation source information. A vibration suppression command value output by the control section <b>69</b> is generated from the excitation force of the excitation source or frequency information of the excitation force, and the vibration information or excitation force information of an automobile body (damping target device) <b>2</b>, and output. The excitation section <b>30</b>, based on this vibration suppression command value, drives the linear actuator. Other operations are similar to the operations described above, and the detailed descriptions thereof are therefore omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The damping apparatus for an automobile according to the present invention is effective if attached to the body frame of the automobile, to in the vicinity of the engine mount or radiator, or to under part of a rear luggage carrying section or trunk. By providing the low pass filters, the high frequency noise component can be removed, and therefore generation of an abnormal noise caused by the noise component can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Moreover, the linear actuator provided within the excitation section <b>30</b> is an actuator that uses electromagnetic force, and is effective if it uses a reciprocating motor for example. Furthermore, the actuator provided within the excitation section <b>30</b> may be a piezoelectric actuator that uses an element that causes displacement by applying a voltage thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As described above, since there is provided a resonance suppression means of the actuator based on the ideal actuator inverse characteristic that uses the transfer function of the relative vibration velocity with respect to the excitation force of the vibrating system of the actuator, it is possible to adjust the actuator characteristic to an arbitrary characteristic by setting the ideal actuator inverse characteristic based on a desired characteristic. As a result, by increasing the damping characteristic of the desired characteristic, it is possible to attain a characteristic such that resonance in the movable section of the actuator is unlikely to be generated by an external force that acts on the actuator main unit. Therefore, it is possible to realize ideal vibration suppression by generating an appropriate reaction force. Moreover, since it is possible to reduce the apparent natural frequency of the actuator by reducing the natural frequency of the desired characteristic, then even in the vicinity of the natural frequency of the actual actuator, it is possible to realize stable vibration control without receiving the influence of the spring characteristic and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Reference symbol <b>620</b> denotes a command value generation section that receives the input of a state value (for example, engine revolution speed) of the control target device <b>44</b>, and that calculates and outputs the amplitude command value and frequency command value of the vibrations to be generated for the auxiliary mass <b>32</b>. Reference symbol <b>621</b> denotes an amplitude upper limit clamp table in which there is defined the upper limit of applicable current value for each frequency that is decided upon the amplitude command value and frequency command value output from the command value generation section <b>620</b>. Reference symbol <b>622</b> denotes an application current generation section that receives the input of an amplitude command value and frequency command value, that makes reference to the amplitude upper limit clamp table <b>621</b> to perform correction for limiting the inputted amplitude command value within an appropriate movable range, and that, based on the inputted frequency command and the amplitude command value after this correction (limitation) has been performed, finds and outputs a command value of current to be applied to the reciprocating motor. Reference symbol <b>72</b> denotes a power amplifier that supplies current to the stator <b>34</b> of the reciprocating motor that constitutes the excitation section <b>30</b>, and that controls reciprocation of the movable element <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Next, an operation of the excitation section <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is described. In the case where an alternating current (sinusoidal current, square-wave current) is applied to a coil (not shown in the drawing) that constitutes the reciprocating motor, in a state where an current in a predetermined direction flows through the coil, magnetic flux is, in the permanent magnet, guided from the south pole to the north pole, forming a magnetic flux loop. As a result, the movable element <b>12</b> moves in the direction opposite to that of gravity (upward direction). On the other hand, if a current in the direction opposite to that of the predetermined direction flows through the coil, then the movable element <b>12</b> moves in the gravitational direction (downward direction). The direction of the current flow into the coils is alternately changed by the alternating current, and the movable element <b>12</b> thereby repeats the above operation and reciprocates in the axial direction of the shaft <b>11</b> with respect to the stator <b>34</b>. Thus, the auxiliary mass <b>32</b> joined to the shaft <b>11</b> vibrates in the vertical direction. By controlling the acceleration of the auxiliary mass <b>32</b> based on control signals output from the power amplifier <b>72</b>, the control force is adjusted and vibrations of the control target device <b>44</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the linear actuator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, rather than slidably and reciprocatably supporting the shaft <b>11</b>, each of the plate springs <b>3</b> supports the movable element <b>12</b> in two positions on the upper end side and the lower end side of the shaft <b>11</b>, and they elastically deforms themselves to thereby support the movable element <b>12</b> while allowing it to reciprocate in the axial direction of the shaft <b>11</b>. As a result, no wear or sliding resistance occurs on the movable element <b>12</b>. Therefore even after use for a long period of time, the precision of the bearing support does not decrease, and a high level of reliability can be attained. Furthermore, there is no power consumption loss caused by sliding resistance, and an improvement in the performance can be achieved. However, as mentioned above, in the case where changes in behavior of the automobile are significant as a result of sudden acceleration or traveling over rough road surface, changes in the current supplied to the stators <b>34</b> also become more significant. As a result, a phenomena where the movable element <b>12</b> collides with the stoppers <b>35</b> occurs. In the case of attaching the excitation section <b>30</b> to an automobile as a damping apparatus, it is preferable that there be no sound of collision (abnormal noise) caused by collisions between the movable element <b>12</b> and the stoppers <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">For this purpose, in the case where for each frequency of current being applied to the stators <b>34</b>, an upper limit value of current that can be newly applied at the present moment is pre-found, the relationship between this current frequency and the current upper limit value is stored in the amplitude upper limit clamp table <b>20</b>, while replacing the relationship between them with the relationship between the amplitude command value and the frequency command value, and then the application current generation section <b>622</b> finds a new application current command value, this amplitude upper limit clamp table <b>20</b> is referenced, the amplitude command value output from the command value generation section <b>620</b> is corrected, and based on this corrected amplitude command value and the frequency command value output from the command value generation section <b>620</b>, a new application current command value is found to be output to the power amplifier <b>72</b>. Thereby, it is possible to prevent the movable element <b>12</b> from colliding with the stoppers <b>35</b>. Moreover, since amplitude command value correction is performed by making reference to the table, the amount of calculation in the application current generation section <b>622</b> can be reduced. Therefore, it is possible to speed up the processing while allowing use of an inexpensive calculation apparatus to achieve a reduction in the cost.</p>
