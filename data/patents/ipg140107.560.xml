<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with still another aspect of the invention, there is provided a ready to assemble toe protector. The toe protector is placed at the foot end of a bed for supporting bed covers above a person's toes. This is important for people with arthritis or injury. It is also useful for a person who paints their toe nails at night and would have to wait an hour for them to dry before retiring; or purchase a heater which cost a lot more than the toe protector. The toe protector can be made from inexpensive stiff foam. It can be assembled and disassembled in less than a minute. Another use of the module is as a desk or as a bookcase, providing that shelves are added to the module. Each module stacked vertically may serve as another shelf in the bookcase. Further, drawers can be added to form a chest of drawers or a desk with drawers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there are provided a storage or toy chest, any kind of table, a footstool, a low work chair, a bench, as a module in a structure, a storage shed, a wall and a floor. The module can also be used as a playhouse for children by increasing the physical dimensions of all pieces and removing the bottom base and providing cut-outs for doors and windows to produce a large outdoor playhouse. A hallway can be assembled to connect two rooms of playhouse by using two structural members inserted into up facing slots of the walls of each room with doorways between the slots. The playhouse can be constructed from thick, soft foam pieces for small children who would enjoy falling into the walls and seeing the house move. Stiff foam and other materials can also be used for older children. They can build their own playhouses and furniture and toys using the simple repeatable assembly techniques illustrated and explained in this disclosure. A large number of toys can be designed and manufactured, especially with the use of injection molding. The outside surfaces of the support members and bases can have the shape of a train locomotive and cars, trucks, etc. The bottom base could have means for attaching wheels. Construction game puzzles are yet another use of this method of design and construction techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, there are provided module bases which can be of any geometrical shape such as, round, rectangular, square, octahedron and triangle shaped.

For example, such bases can be fastened together rigidly or semi-rigidly using the previously-mention threaded inserts in association with base <b>332</b> at positions indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> by dotted lines. When base <b>332</b> and <b>331</b> are mated, the joint may be secured by way of a bolt, thumb screw or other complimentary threaded fastener placed through a bore located in each of the two opposing lateral sides of base <b>331</b> in axial alignment with the threaded inserts of base <b>332</b>. Ultimately, placement of support members into the respective grooves of the bases will also contribute to maintaining the interconnection of the bases. Bracket <b>340</b> can also be used to provide additional structural rigidity when needed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64 and 65</figref> illustrate how the support members <b>342</b>, <b>344</b>, and <b>346</b> can be used to create multi-room or multi-cell structures.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The material used for manufacture of the structural members of the present invention can be anything from plastic to metal. Items <b>334</b> and <b>336</b> represent the interlocking slots of two structural members. The curved area of item <b>334</b> rides up over and centers on top of the raised area on item <b>336</b>. The curved area of item <b>334</b> can be formed by drilling a hole before cutting the slot. The raised area of item <b>336</b> could be the head of a pin or a small smooth rivet. Item <b>338</b> represents the edge of a support member which is inserted into a groove of a base. Item <b>338</b> has four rivets, two on each end near the two ends of the support member. Two holes are drilled in each end of the base before the groove is cut. The amount of rigidity obtained is dependent on the thickness of the support members, the size of the rivets and the mating curvature. Alternatively injection molding could form these areas in the plastic or material. The mating areas could then cover a large area end to end or side to side.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The various structural members can have decorative cuts for their shapes and cuts and designs on the surfaces. By adding drawers to the bookcase, it becomes a chest of drawers. Support members can also feature cut-outs for doors and windows to produce, for example, a large outdoor playhouse. A hallway can be assembled to connect two rooms of playhouse by using two structural members inserted into up facing slots of the walls of each room with doorways between the slots. The playhouse could be made of thick, soft foam pieces for small children who would enjoy falling into the walls and seeing the house move. Stiff foam and other materials could be used for older children.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The components of the present invention can be injection molded. The outside surfaces of the structural members can have the shape of a train locomotive and cars, trucks, etc. The bottom base could have means for attaching wheels. Construction game puzzles are yet another use of this method of design and construction techniques. The bases can have groove patterns of any geometrical shape. Also the structural members could have no grooves at all. They could be like a cover or lid with a perimeter which fits on the outside of the structural members. Also, the base could be flat with a center section that fits inside the structural members.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Some or all of the grooves in the structural members may, in some instances, be V-shaped. This shape is self centering and helps in locating the grooves. All the grooves could be V-shaped or any other of many possible shapes. All sharp edges can be rounded for ease of assembly. There are applications when tables or other objects need to be moved on smooth floors, or kept off of delicate surfaces. In such cases, bottom members <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> or <b>144</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-17</figref>) can be applied to the bottom or feet of the object to be moved to protect the surface.</p>
