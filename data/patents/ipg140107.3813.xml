<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a portable electronic device <b>200</b> is disclosed. The portable electronic device <b>200</b> includes a main body <b>202</b> and a rotation sensing device <b>100</b> set inside the main body <b>202</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the portable electronic device <b>200</b> is a mobile phone. The rotation sensing device <b>100</b> is mounted on the backside of the portable electronic device <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, the rotation sensing device <b>100</b> includes a capacitor module <b>10</b> and a pointing module <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The capacitor module <b>10</b> includes a lower substrate <b>12</b> and an upper substrate <b>14</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the lower substrate <b>12</b> is symmetrical to the upper substrate <b>14</b>. The lower substrate <b>12</b> and the upper substrate <b>14</b> are circular and substantially flat. The lower substrate <b>12</b> includes a plurality bottom plates <b>122</b> mounted thereon. The bottom plates <b>122</b> are uniformity distributed into a circle. A first blind hole <b>124</b> is defined in the middle of the lower substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The upper substrate <b>14</b> includes a plurality top plates <b>142</b> mounted thereon. The top plates <b>142</b> are uniformity distributed in a circle, and each of the top plates <b>142</b> is symmetrical to and corresponding with one of the bottom plates <b>122</b>. A second blind hole <b>144</b> is defined in the middle of the upper substrate <b>14</b>, and is coaxial to the first blind hole <b>124</b> of the lower substrate <b>12</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, there are 100 bottom plates <b>122</b> and 100 top plates <b>142</b>. Therefore, there is approximately 3.6&#xb0; of arc between any two adjacent top of bottom plates.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The pointing module <b>20</b> is located between the top substrate <b>14</b> and the lower substrate <b>12</b>, and includes an axle <b>22</b> and a pointer <b>24</b> rotatably connected to the axle <b>22</b>. The diameter of the axle <b>22</b> is equal to the inner diameter of the first blind hole <b>124</b> and the inner diameter of the second blind hole <b>144</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The pointer <b>24</b> is located between the lower substrate <b>12</b> and the top substrate <b>14</b>. The pointer <b>24</b> includes a connection portion <b>242</b>, a first portion <b>244</b> and a second portion <b>246</b> opposite to the first portion <b>244</b>. The first portion <b>244</b> and the second portion <b>246</b> protrude from opposite ends of the connection portion <b>242</b> respectively. An axle hole <b>248</b> is defined in the middle of the connection portion <b>242</b>. The inner diameter of the axle hole <b>248</b> is equal to the diameter of the axle <b>22</b>, so that the axle <b>22</b> passes through the axle hole <b>248</b> for rotatably connecting the pointer <b>24</b> to the axle <b>22</b>. The distance between the center of the axle hole <b>248</b> and the end of the first portion <b>244</b> or the end of the second portion <b>248</b> is greater than the radius of the lower substrate <b>12</b>. The width of the first portion <b>244</b> or the second portion <b>246</b> is equal to the distance between the bottom plate <b>122</b> and the top plate <b>142</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the pointer <b>24</b> is magnetic, the first portion <b>244</b> is configured for indicating the north pole (N pole) of the pointer <b>24</b>, and the second portion <b>246</b> is configured for indicating the south pole (S pole) of the pointer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when assembling the rotation sensing device <b>100</b>, first one end of the axle <b>22</b> is inserted into the first blind hole <b>124</b>, thereby fixing the axle <b>22</b> into the first blind hole <b>124</b>. Second, the pointer <b>24</b> is rotatably connected to the axle <b>22</b> by the axle hole <b>248</b>. Finally, another end of the axle <b>22</b> is inserted into the second blind hole <b>144</b>, thereby fixing the axle <b>22</b> into the second blind hole <b>144</b>. Accordingly, one of the bottom plates <b>122</b>, one of the top plates <b>142</b>, and the space between one of the bottom plates <b>122</b> and the top plates <b>142</b> form a flat capacitor. So, the rotation sensing device <b>100</b> includes a plurality of flat capacitors formed by the plurality of the bottom plates <b>122</b> and the top plates <b>142</b> and the space between the plurality of the bottom plates <b>122</b> and the top plates <b>142</b>. Each of the flat capacitors has a same initial capacitance. The first portion <b>244</b> and the second portion <b>246</b> have an initial position between the bottom plates <b>122</b> and the top plates <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the capacitor module <b>10</b> rotates relative to the pointer <b>24</b> or vice versa. That is, the pointer <b>24</b> rotates relative to the capacitor module <b>10</b>. That is, the first portion <b>244</b> and the second portion <b>246</b> horizontally rotate in the space between the bottom plates <b>122</b> and the top plates <b>142</b> to change a current capacitance of the flat capacitor between one of the bottom plates <b>122</b> and one of the top plates <b>142</b> where the first portion <b>244</b> and the second portion <b>246</b> are currently located. The change of the capacitance relative to the initial capacitance produces a pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The rotation sensing device <b>100</b> further includes a detection circuit <b>30</b>. The detection circuit <b>30</b> electronically connects to the bottom plates <b>122</b> and the top plates <b>142</b>. The detection circuit <b>30</b> is configured for detecting the pulses during the rotation of first portion <b>244</b> and the second portion <b>246</b>, and determining a position change of the first portion <b>244</b> and the second portion <b>246</b> relative to the initial position according to the pulse, and determining a rotation orientation of the capacitor module <b>10</b> according to the determined position change of the first portion <b>244</b> and the second portion <b>246</b>. For example, as previously mentioned, the distance between adjacent bottom or top plates is 3.6&#xb0; of arc. Therefore, it the detection circuit <b>30</b> detects ten pulses, there has been a rotation angle of 36&#xb0;, which triggers a corresponding movement of an object being controlled in a game being played on the device <b>200</b>. Various angles of rotation are associated with various commands and need not be limited to turning or rotating a controlled object in a game.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the motion sensing function is desired by the user they can activate the function and then must set an initial position of the capacitor module <b>10</b> by placing the portable electronic device <b>200</b> on a flat surface (or at least hold it flat and steady). Then the user can, for example play a game, and when they rotate the main body <b>202</b>, the capacitor module <b>10</b> rotates with rotation of the main body <b>202</b>. Because the pointer <b>24</b> is kept in its original position by the magnetic field, the capacitor module <b>10</b> rotates relative to the pointer <b>24</b>. Thus, positions of the first portion <b>244</b> and the second portion <b>246</b> change causing changes in capacitance, which causes electrical pulses that can be read by the detection circuit. The pluses are interpreted as changes in orientation as a result of a degrees of rotation and associated commands are then executed. For example, if the device <b>200</b> is rotated clockwise 36 degrees, then an associated command might be to turn a car in a game right 36 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another exemplary embodiment, the pointer <b>24</b> only includes a first portion <b>244</b>. The first portion <b>244</b> is configured for indicating the south pole (S pole) of the pointer <b>24</b>. The bottom plates <b>122</b> and the top plates <b>142</b> may be elliptical shape, square shape, etc. The distance between at least one end of the pointer <b>24</b> and the middle of the axes of the axle <b>22</b> is greater than that of between the bottom plates <b>122</b> and the middle of the axes of the axle <b>22</b>, or that of between the top plates <b>142</b> and the middle of the axes of the axle <b>22</b>, so that, at least one end of the pointer <b>24</b> locates between the bottom plates <b>122</b> and the top plates <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>, a rotation sensing device <b>100</b><i>a </i>in a second exemplary embodiment is provided. The axle <b>22</b><i>a </i>has a threaded end <b>244</b><i>a </i>adjacent to the upper substrate <b>14</b><i>a</i>.

One threaded end <b>244</b><i>a </i>of the axle <b>22</b><i>a </i>extends through the second blind hole <b>144</b><i>a</i>, and screws onto the threaded bolt <b>226</b><i>a</i>, so that, the upper substrate <b>14</b><i>a </i>is rotatably connected between the ring <b>222</b><i>a </i>and the threaded bolt <b>226</b><i>a</i>. The pointer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is fixed into the axle <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and another end of the axle <b>22</b><i>a </i>is rotatably inserted into the first blind hole <b>124</b><i>a</i>. The rotation sensing device <b>100</b><i>a </i>further includes two connection portions <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The two connection portions <b>16</b><i>a </i>are configured for fixedly connecting the upper substrate <b>14</b><i>a </i>to the lower substrate <b>12</b><i>a</i>, so that, the upper substrate <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the lower substrate <b>12</b><i>a </i>are rotatable relative to the pointer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the axle <b>22</b><i>a</i>. Then, the rotation sensing device <b>100</b><i>a </i>is assembled into the portable electronic device, the axle <b>22</b><i>a </i>is fixed into the main body <b>202</b>, and the upper substrate <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the lower substrate <b>12</b><i>a </i>are rotatably connected to the main body <b>202</b>. When using the portable electronic device, the upper substrate <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the lower substrate <b>12</b><i>a </i>rotate relative to the main body <b>202</b>, the axle <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the pointer <b>24</b><i>a</i>, and thus the user can operate the portable electronic device <b>200</b> to accurately control displayed objects according to the rotation orientation of the capacitor module <b>10</b>.</p>
