No. 12/884,764, filed Sep. 17, 2010 and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-066950, filed Mar. 23, 2010; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, miniaturization of semiconductor devices has led to a reduction in the line width of circuit patterns. Thus, there has been an increasing reduction in the distance between an active area serving as a diffusion layer and a channel and another adjacent active area. As a result, the withstand voltage between an active area in which a contact section is formed and another adjacent active area has been decreasing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, it has been difficult to form a semiconductor device with an appropriate withstand voltage between an active area in which a contact section is formed and another adjacent active area.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A related technique has been proposed in which a void portion is formed between adjacent floating gates and/or between adjacent control gates (see, for example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2006-302950). However, this technique is used for adjacent memory cell transistors. Hence, this technique fails to increase the withstand voltage between an active area in which a contact section is formed and another adjacent active area.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The basic configuration of the semiconductor device according to the embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are plan views schematically showing the basic configuration of the semiconductor device according to the embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view taken along line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, active areas AA and shallow trench isolation regions STI are alternately arranged and extend in a bit line BL direction (first direction). The shallow trench isolation regions STI electrically separate the adjacent active areas AA from each other. Striped word lines WL and select gate lines SGD and SGS extending in a word line WL direction (second direction) are formed on a plurality of the active areas AA and a plurality of the shallow trench isolation regions STI. A memory cell transistor MT is provided in an area where the word line WL and the active area AA cross. A select transistor ST<b>1</b> is provided in an area in which select gate line SGD and the active area AA cross. A select transistor ST<b>2</b> is provided in an area in which select gate line SGS and the active area AA cross. An impurity diffusion layer is formed in the active area AA between the word lines WL adjacent to each other in the bit line BL direction and in the active area AA between the word line WL and each of select gate lines SGD and SGS; the impurity diffusion layer serves as a source area or a drain area of the memory cell transistor MT or select transistor ST<b>1</b> or ST<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An impurity diffusion layer formed in the active area AA of select transistor ST<b>1</b> that is not adjacent to any memory cell transistor MT in the bit line BL direction functions as a drain area of select transistor ST<b>1</b>. A contact plug (contact section) CP<b>1</b> is formed on the drain area. Contact plug CP<b>1</b> is connected to one of the striped bit lines BL (not shown in the drawings) provided along the active area AA direction.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, an impurity diffusion layer formed in the active area AA of select transistor ST<b>2</b> that is not adjacent to any memory cell transistor MT in the bit line BL direction functions as a source area of select transistor ST<b>2</b>. A contact plug (contact section) CP<b>2</b> is formed on the source area. Contact plug CP<b>2</b> is connected to a source line SL (not shown in the drawings). For simplification of description, if contact plugs CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b> are not distinguished from each other below, the contact plugs may be simply referred to as the contact plugs CP. Similarly, if select transistors ST<b>1</b> and ST<b>2</b> are not distinguished from each other below, the select transistors may be simply referred to as the select transistors ST.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The width, in the word line WL direction, of the active area AA functioning as the drain area of select transistor ST<b>1</b> and the width, in the word line WL direction, of the active area AA functioning as the source area of select transistor ST<b>2</b> are each smaller than that, in the word line WL direction, of the active area AA in which the source or drain area of the memory cell transistor MT, the source area of select transistor ST<b>1</b>, or the drain area of select transistor ST<b>2</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the width, in the word line WL direction, of the top surface area of a portion of the active area AA (<b>100</b>) in which the contact plug CP is formed is smaller than that, in the word line WL direction, of the top surface area of the remaining portion of the active area AA. Furthermore, the upper portion of the active area AA in which the contact plug CP is formed is about 2 to 4 nm thinner than the lower portion. More specifically, the width, in the word line WL direction, of a projecting (exposed) portion of the active area AA, which is projected from the shallow trench isolation region STI and the vicinity of the projecting portion is smaller than that, in the word line direction, of the lower portion of the active area AA. For example, the active area AA is separate from the shallow trench isolation region STI in the vicinity of the projecting portion of the active area AA. In other words, the width, in the word line WL direction, of the projecting portion of the active area AA and the vicinity of the projecting portion is smaller than that, in the word line WL direction, of the active area AA in which (the channel of) the memory cell transistor MT, (the channel of) select transistor ST<b>1</b> or ST<b>2</b>, the source or drain area of the memory cell transistor MT, the source area of select transistor ST<b>1</b>, or the drain area of select transistor ST<b>2</b> is formed. Furthermore, the shallow trench isolation regions STI each comprising a high temperature oxide (HTO) film <b>10</b><i>a </i>and a polysilasane (PSZ) film <b>10</b><i>b </i>are formed so as to separate the active areas <b>100</b> from each other. Additionally, an interlayer insulating film <b>20</b> is formed so as to separate the contact plugs CP from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the above-described embodiment, the semiconductor device comprises the active area AA extending in the bit line BL direction, the contact plug CP located in the first portion of the active area AA, and the select transistor ST located on the second portion adjacent to the first portion of the active area in the bit line BL direction. The width of the top surface area of the first portion in the word line WL direction perpendicular to the bit line BL direction is smaller than that of the top surface area of the second portion in the word line WL direction. That is, the width, in the word line WL direction, of the active area AA functioning as the drain area of select transistor ST<b>1</b> and the width, in the word line WL direction, of the active area AA functioning as the source area of select transistor ST<b>2</b> are each smaller than that, in the word line WL direction, of the remaining portion of the active area AA. Thus, the adjacent active areas AA in which the respective contact plugs CP are formed are located sufficiently away from each other. As a result, effects are exerted which are similar to those of substantial increase in the pattern size between the adjacent active areas AA. This serves to increase the withstand voltage between the active area AA and of the contact plug CP formed in the adjacent active area AA.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Now, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b> B, <b>11</b>A, and <b>11</b>B, a basic method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present embodiment will be described in brief. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 10A</figref> are sectional views taken along the word line WL direction and schematically showing a basic method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B to 10B</figref> are sectional views taken along the bit line BL direction and schematically showing the basic method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> are sectional views taken along the word line WL direction and schematically showing the basic method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, a silicon oxide film serving as a gate insulating film <b>30</b> is formed on a semiconductor substrate (silicon substrate) <b>100</b>. Then, amorphous silicon (charge accumulation layer) <b>40</b> that is thermally converted into polysilicon is formed on the gate insulating film <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, a line-and-space-like mask pattern with a half pitch of about 19 nm (not shown in the drawings) is formed on the charge accumulation layer <b>40</b>. The charge accumulation layer <b>40</b>, the gate insulating film <b>30</b>, and the silicon substrate <b>100</b> are etched. Thus, shallow trenches are formed. Then, an HTO film <b>10</b><i>a </i>is formed on the inner wall and bottom surface of the shallow trenches. A PSZ film <b>10</b><i>b </i>is formed on the HTO film <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The excess potions of PSZ film <b>10</b><i>b </i>and HTO film <b>10</b><i>a </i>are removed by CMP process. As a result, a shallow trench isolation region STI is formed which comprises the HTO film <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the PSZ film <b>10</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the charge accumulation layer <b>40</b>, the PSZ film <b>10</b><i>b</i>, and the HTO film <b>10</b><i>a </i>are processed by etch-back. After the etch-back, an NONON film is formed all over the resultant surface as an inter-electrode insulating film <b>50</b>. The inter-electrode insulating film <b>50</b> in the select transistor portion is pre-patterned. Subsequently, an amorphous silicon film serving as a control gate electrode <b>60</b> is formed on the inter-electrode insulating film <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, areas corresponding to the word lines WL and select gate lines SGD and SGS in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are covered with a predetermined mask material pattern. Only in a space portion, the control gate electrode film <b>60</b>, the inter-electrode insulating film <b>50</b>, the charge accumulation layer <b>40</b>, the gate insulating film <b>30</b>, and the shallow trench isolation region STI are etched by the RIE method. Thus, in the space portion, the active area (semiconductor substrate) <b>100</b> may be exposed. As a result, a memory cell transistor MT structure is formed which comprises the gate insulating film <b>30</b> formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, the charge accumulation layer <b>40</b> formed on the gate insulating film <b>30</b>, the inter-electrode insulating film <b>50</b> formed on the charge accumulation layer <b>40</b>, and the control gate electrode <b>60</b> formed on the inter-electrode insulating film <b>50</b>. Furthermore, a select transistor ST structure is formed which comprises the gate insulating film <b>30</b> formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, the amorphous silicon film formed on the gate insulating film <b>30</b> so as to form the charge accumulation layer <b>40</b>, and amorphous silicon formed on the charge accumulation layer <b>40</b> so as to form the control gate electrode <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, a silicon oxide film serving as a protective insulating film <b>70</b> is formed on the active area <b>100</b>, the shallow trench isolation region STI, the memory cell transistor MT structure, and the select transistor ST structure. At this time, the film thickness of the silicon oxide film is such that the silicon oxide film is filled between the memory cell transistor MT structures adjacent to each other in the bit line BL direction and between the memory cell transistor MT structure and the select transistor ST structure but not between the select transistor ST structures adjacent to each other in the bit line BL direction. The protective insulating film <b>70</b> is used, for example, to protect the active area <b>100</b> and as an implantation spacer to be implanted later between the select transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the protective insulating film <b>70</b> between the select transistor ST structures adjacent to each other in the bit line BL direction is removed by etch-back. At this time, the etch-back is carried out in a slightly over-etching manner to allow recession of the upper portion of the shallow trench isolation region STI between the select transistor ST structures adjacent to each other in the bit line BL direction. Thus, on the side of the select transistor ST structure which is not adjacent to the memory cell transistor MT structure, the upper portion of the active area <b>100</b> is projected (exposed) from the top surface of the shallow trench isolation region STI by about 1 to 2 nm. The etch-back is carried so as to prevent the protective insulating film <b>70</b> from being removed from between the memory cell transistor MT structures adjacent to each other in the bit line BL direction, from between the memory cell transistor MT structure and the select transistor ST structure, and from the sidewall of the select transistor ST structure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, a thermal oxidation process is carried out with the upper portion of the active area <b>100</b> projected from the top surface of the shallow trench isolation region STI. Thus, the top surface and sidewall (side surface) of the projected (exposed) active area <b>100</b> is oxidized by about 1 to 2 nm to form a silicon oxide film <b>80</b>. As a result, the projected active area <b>100</b> is substantially slimmed to have the width thereof reduced in the word line WL direction. The degree to which the active area <b>100</b> is slimmed by oxidation is determined depending on contact resistance to a contact plug CP to be formed later. Any method may be used for this thermal oxidation process provided that the method allows the surface of the active area <b>100</b> to be oxidized.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the upper portion and sidewall of the projected active area <b>100</b> are oxidized, the thermal oxidation process is carried out at 750&#xb0; C. or higher for 30 seconds or longer. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, a low-temperature or short-time thermal oxidation process may reduce the film thickness of the oxide film in the corners of the projecting portion of the oxidized active area <b>100</b>; the projecting portion of the active area <b>100</b> may have acute angles. Thus, the upper portion and sidewall of the projected active area <b>100</b> may have acute angles. This may undesirably cause electric fields to concentrate in the corners of the projecting portion of the active area <b>100</b>. Thus, the process is desirably carried out at higher temperature for a longer time. For example, when the thermal oxidation process is carried out at a high temperature of about 850&#xb0; C. or for a long time of about 10 minutes, silicon can be oxidized with the stress of the active area <b>100</b> released. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the corners of the projecting portion of the oxidized active area <b>100</b> can be rounded.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thereafter, well-known techniques such as a thermal treatment step of crystallizing an amorphous silicon film into polysilicon and a step of forming a contact plug on the active area <b>100</b> are used to form a wiring layer and the like (not shown in the drawings) to complete a semiconductor device according to the present embodiment. Even if the insulating film <b>80</b> remains in the active area <b>100</b> or between contact plugs, the insulating film <b>80</b> need not particularly be removed because of its very small film thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the above-described embodiment, the thermal oxidation process is carried out with the upper portion of the active area <b>100</b> projected from the shallow trench isolation region STI. Thus, the top surface and sidewall of the projected active area <b>100</b> can be oxidized, enabling a reduction in the width of the active area <b>100</b> in the word line direction. As a result, effects are exerted which are similar to those of a substantial increase in the pattern size between the adjacent active areas <b>100</b>. This enables an increase in the withstand voltage between the active area AA and the contact plug CP formed in another active area AA adjacent to the above-described active area AA in the word line direction.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, active areas AA and shallow trench isolation regions STI are alternately arranged and extend in the bit line BL direction.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An impurity diffusion layer formed in the active area AA of select transistor ST<b>1</b> that is not adjacent to any memory cell transistor MT in the bit line BL direction functions as a drain area of select transistor ST<b>1</b>.

For example, the upper portion of the active area AA in which the contact plug CP is formed is about 2 to 4 nm thinner than the lower portion. Furthermore, the shallow trench isolation regions STI each comprising a HTO film <b>10</b><i>a </i>and a PSZ film <b>10</b><i>b </i>are formed so as to separate the active areas <b>100</b> from each other.
