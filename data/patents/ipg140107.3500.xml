<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the US national phase of PCT application PCT/EP2010/000750, filed 6 Feb. 2010, published 14 Oct. 2010 as 2010/115485, and claiming the priority of German patent application 102009017196.7 itself filed 9 Apr. 2009, whose entire disclosures are herewith incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a tap changer with semiconductor switching elements for uninterrupted switching over between winding taps of a tapped transformer. In that case the invention proceeds from a tap changer in accordance with the principle of an on-load tap changer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tap changers are known in various forms of embodiment; they can, in principle, be differentiated as on-load tap changers and apparatus with separate selectors for power-free selection of the new winding tap which is to be switched over to and separate on-load tap changers for the subsequent actual switching over. A good overview with respect to the various forms of construction is offered by the publication Axel Kr&#xe4;mer: On-Load Tap-Changers for Power Transformers, MR publication, 2000. The details are is explained on page 7f there. Regardless of the form of construction, all tap changers have a common load shunt which independently of the instantaneous setting of the tap changer produces a connection with the transformer, as a rule the main winding.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a tap changer is known from WO 99/60588, which, as is generally customary in accordance with the prior art, contains such a single load shunt. In the known solution this load shunt is constructed as an electrically conductive shunt ring concentrically surrounding a switch column. A part of a contact bridge wipes the shunt ring and the other part of the contact bridge electrically contacts the respective fixed tap contact.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A quite similar arrangement of a tap changer is already known from DE 38 33 126 A1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in particular, there, shows a continuous shunt, here in schematic illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For tap changers with mechanical contacts or also with vacuum switching cells as switching means these continuous shunt rings or, in the case of linear actuation of the tap changer, also shunt rails are not problematic; they make possible a constructionally simple format. Thereagainst, various disadvantages arise for tap changers with semiconductor switching elements. Due to the constant application of the operating voltage and the loading of the electronic power system by lightning shock voltage high insulation spacings are required, which is undesirable. Moreover, expensive high-voltage conduits through the transformer wall are needed. Overall, the known load shunts lead to a constant loading of the components of the electronic power system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the invention is to eliminate these is disadvantages and to indicate a tap changer with semiconductor switching elements which avoids the high loading of the switching elements and in static operation ensures an electrical separation of the tap changer from the transformer winding.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This object is fulfilled by a tap changer according to category with the features of the first patent claim. The subclaims relate to advantageous developments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The particular advantage of the solution according to the invention resides in the fact that in static operation all connecting lines of the components of the electronic power system are electrically separated from the transformer winding. The components of the electronic power system are thus reliably separated from lightning shock voltage and also from permanent loading by the operating voltage. Only during the switch-over phase, thus the actual load changeover, is there an electrical connection with the transformer winding.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A tap changer comprising a power-electronic on-load tap changer <b>1</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In that case two semiconductor switches <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are provided, which have a respective electrical input <b>4</b> or <b>5</b> and a common electrical output <b>6</b>. The on-load tap changer <b>1</b> thus consists of two current paths; one for the side to be switched off and one for the side taking over, respectively is realized by a semiconductor switch <b>2</b> or <b>3</b>. The electrical inputs <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> as well as the electrical output <b>6</b> are guided by means of conduits <b>7</b> in a mechanical contact system <b>8</b>. The mechanical contact system <b>8</b> comprises a contact carriage <b>9</b> which is indicated in the FIG. merely by a dashed line. The contact carriage <b>9</b> comprises contact bridges <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> which are fixedly arranged thereon. The contact bridges <b>10</b> to <b>13</b> are electrically conductive, but insulated relative to one another; they have at the ends thereof contact rollers, wiper arrangements or comparable means, which are known per se and which are shown only schematically in the figure. The contact bridges <b>10</b> to <b>13</b> as well as an additional articulated further contact roller <b>14</b> are discussed later in more detail. Each of the tap contacts <b>15</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> corresponds with a winding tap n, n+1, . . . , of the regulating winding of the tapped transformer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, provided in the mechanical contact system are three contact rails <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> which are each electrically conductive and which are electrically connected respectively with the electrical input <b>4</b>, the electrical input <b>5</b> and the electrical output <b>6</b> of the semiconductor switches <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the invention the load shunt is divided, i.e. it is not a continuous shunt rail or the like known from the prior art. Instead, individual shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>19</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>19</b>.<b>3</b>, <b>19</b>.<b>4</b>, <b>19</b>.<b>5</b> are arranged here and as seen in movement direction of the contact carriage <b>9</b> correspond in their length with the fixed tap contacts <b>15</b>. In other words: position and dimensioning of the shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>5</b> correspond, in another horizontal plane, with the position and dimensioning of the fixed tap changer contacts <b>15</b>. In the case of the form of embodiment shown here the contact rails <b>16</b> to <b>18</b> and the individual shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>5</b> are led parallel to one another; the contact carriage <b>9</b> in this regard executes a linear, translational movement for contact-making. The individual shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>5</b> are connected together by way of an electrical connection, i.e. a shunt <b>20</b>, and led to the main winding <b>21</b>. The shunt connection <b>20</b> can be carried out not only within, but also outside the tap changer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The first contact bridge <b>10</b> can be connected at one free end thereof with the tap changer contacts <b>15</b> and at the other free end thereof it runs on the contact rail <b>16</b>, which is electrically connected with the input <b>4</b> of the first semiconductor switch <b>2</b>. The second contact bridge <b>11</b> can be similarly connected at one free end thereof with the fixed tap changer contacts <b>15</b> and at the other free end thereof it runs on the further contact rail <b>17</b>, which is electrically connected with the input <b>5</b> of the second semiconductor switch. The third contact bridge <b>12</b> runs by one free end thereof on the contact rail <b>18</b>, which is electrically connected with the common electrical output <b>6</b> of the power-electronic power switch. Its other free end corresponds with the shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>5</b>. Provided physically between the two mentioned contact bridges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> is the further contact bridge <b>13</b>, i.e. the shunt contact bridge, which can be contacted at one free end with the fixed tap changer contacts <b>15</b> and at the other free end thereof with the shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>5</b>. In addition, arranged symmetrically with respect to the described contact bridge <b>12</b> is the roller contact <b>14</b>, which is electrically connected with the contact bridges <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> and can similarly be connected with the shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It can be seen that not only the contact bridge <b>12</b> and thus the common output <b>6</b> of the power-electronic on-load tap changer, but also the contact bridge <b>13</b> can be brought into electrical contact with one of the shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>5</b> depending on the respective setting of the switching carriage <b>9</b>. In static operation the contact bridge <b>13</b> takes over the direct electrical connection between the respectively connected tap changer contact <b>15</b> and the respective shunt contact; this is one of the shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>5</b> depending on the respective switch setting. The contact bridges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> which lead to the inputs of the power-electronic on-load tap changer <b>1</b> are, thereagainst, not connected; the semiconductor switches <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are switched to be free.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the case of a load changeover the contact carriage <b>9</b> is moved to the left or right depending on whether switching is to be in the direction of &#x2018;higher&#x2019; or &#x2018;lower&#x2019;. As a consequence, one of the two contact bridges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> runs onto the tap changer switch contact <b>15</b> to be newly connected and thus produces an electrical connection with the corresponding input <b>4</b> or <b>5</b> of the respective semiconductor switch <b>2</b> or <b>3</b>. At the same time the contact bridge <b>13</b> comes out of contact with one of the fixed tap changer contacts <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The switching over is concluded when the contact carriage <b>9</b> has been moved onward to such an extent that the contact bridges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> are both brought out of engagement again and the contact bridge <b>13</b> has again taken over constant current conduction.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a further form of embodiment of the invention with a circular arrangement. Here, too, semiconductor switches <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are provided, which each have a separate electrical input <b>4</b> or <b>5</b> and a common electrical output <b>6</b>. In this regard, contact rollers <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> are provided which each run on a respective contact ring <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>. These contact rings <b>25</b> to <b>27</b> correspond with respect to the function thereof with the contact rails <b>16</b> to <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The fixed tap changer contacts <b>15</b> are here provided on a concentric circle. The central switch shaft <b>28</b> is illustrated. In addition, shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>3</b> are shown here. These shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>3</b> are arranged in a horizontal plane different from the fixed tap changer contacts <b>14</b>. However, they have the same contact geometry and also vertical arrangement as the fixed tap changer contacts <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, a switching segment <b>29</b> of insulating material which is indicated only by dashed line is provided and for load changeover is rotatable by the switch shaft <b>28</b> through an angle which corresponds with the spacing between the two fixed tap changer contacts <b>14</b> or two shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> . . . <b>19</b>.<b>3</b>. Provided on the switching segment <b>29</b> in a first horizontal plane are contact rollers <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> which are contactable by the fixed tap changer contacts <b>15</b>. In addition, provided in a second horizontal plane are further contact rollers <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> which are contactable with one of the shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>3</b> depending on the respective setting of the switching segment. The contact rollers <b>30</b> are electrically connected by way of the contact ring <b>25</b> with the input <b>4</b> of the first semi-conductor switch <b>2</b>. The contact roller <b>32</b> is electrically connected with the input <b>5</b> of the second semiconductor switch <b>3</b> by way of the contact ring <b>26</b>. The lower contact rollers <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> are both connected by way of the contact ring <b>27</b> with the common output <b>6</b> of the two semiconductor switches <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. Finally, the upper contact roller <b>31</b> and lower contact roller <b>34</b> have an electrically conductive connection <b>36</b> of such a kind that the contact roller <b>31</b>, which is physically arranged between the contact rollers <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, can be directly connected by way of the lower contact roller <b>34</b>&#x2014;dependent on setting&#x2014;with one of the shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As explained, in this form of embodiment of the invention the switching segment <b>29</b> and with it the contact rollers <b>30</b> to <b>35</b> execute a rotational movement in each load changeover. However, the principle of function is the same: in static operation the is respectively connected fixed tap changer contact <b>15</b> is electrically connected directly with one of the shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>3</b> by way of the contact roller <b>34</b>, whilst the semiconductor switches <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are not only switched to be free, but also electrically separated form the transformer winding. Only in the case of a switching over, depending on the rotational direction, is in each instance one of the two inputs <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> of the power-electronic on-load changeover switch connected by means of the associated contact roller <b>30</b> or <b>32</b> briefly with the respective fixed tap changer contact <b>5</b> which is to be switched over to. At the same time, one of the contact rollers <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> then takes over, i.e. only during the switching over, in dependence on rotational direction the electrical connection with one of the shunt contacts <b>19</b>.<b>1</b> to <b>19</b>.<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a changed connection of the tap changer according to the invention with the transformer. Here, a tap changer <b>37</b> which is known per se and which switches in current-free manner is additionally provided in the transformer. By means of this tap changer <b>37</b> winding parts <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> of the transformer can be differently connected for increasing the total available number of voltage steps.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In all forms of embodiment the described tap changer according to the invention has by comparison with the prior art the substantial advantage that all connecting lines to and from the power-electronic on-load tap changer are electrically separated from the transformer winding. The oil paths between the individual contact bridges and the individual contact members in that case take over the insulation between these components. The power-electronic on-load tap changer is in the case of the invention separated not only from lightning strike voltage, but also from constant loading by the operating voltage. Only during the actual load changeover, namely a switching-over phase in the time range of is approximately 100 ms, is there an electrical connection with the transformer winding and thus application of the operating voltage. The insulation of the passages <b>7</b> as well as the insulating spacings in air can be executed to be smaller by comparison with the prior art.</p>
