<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">There is provided a toaster grill having a lower housing that supports a lower cooking surface and an upper housing that supports an upper cooking surface. The upper housing pivots with respect to a &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame that is hinged with respect to the lower cooking surface. A locking hinge allows the pivoting motion of the frame to be automatically arrested in an intermediate orientation between the fully closed and fully open grill orientations. The locking hinge automatically resets when the upper housing is rotated from the fully open grill orientation to the fully closed orientation.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention pertains to toaster grills and more particularly to a toaster grill that can safely assume a variety of cooking orientations and functions including a fully open grill orientation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A sandwich press has a lower housing that supports a lower cooking surface. The upper cooking surface is carried by an upper housing that pivots about a &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame. The &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame further comprises a transverse handle that allows the user to raise and lower the upper housing. In a typical sandwich press, the upper and lower cooking surfaces are flat.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Similar configurations are used in electric grills. The operating temperature of an electric grill is higher than that of a typical sandwich press. In these types of grills, both the top the upper and lower cooking surfaces include parallel ribs which provide cooked meat with characteristic sear marks and also promote the run off of cooking juices. However, neither prior art sandwich presses nor prior art meat grills are known to have sandwich press as well as grill functions, providing a fully open grill orientation in which both cooking surfaces are facing upward, generally co-planar and horizontal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an object to provide a combination sandwich press and grill comprising upper and lower housings and upper and lower cooking surfaces. The upper and lower cooking surfaces can assume a fully open grill orientation. In the fully opened grill orientation, the upper and lower cooking surfaces face upward, are generally co-planar and horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In other embodiments of the device, the lower cooking surface is tilt adjustable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet other embodiments of the device, the orientation of the upper housing and upper cooking surface orientations controlled by a user operated locking hinge.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particularly preferred embodiments, a track arm is used to control the movement of the tilting upper housing, particularly in the intermediate and fully open grill orientations.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">TOASTER GRILL OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a combination sandwich press and grill <b>100</b> has many of the external appearance attributes of a sandwich press. It comprises a lower housing <b>102</b> with a lower cooking plate <b>104</b>. In this embodiment, the cooking plate is shown as being flat although it may also be provided with ribs. To allow for the run-off of cooking liquids, a discharge spout <b>105</b> interrupts the elevated rim <b>140</b> that serves as a perimeter or barrier to the lower cooking plate <b>104</b>. The discharge spout <b>105</b> leads into a removable, full-length drip tray <b>106</b>. In preferred embodiments, the rear corners of the lower cooking surface <b>104</b> are each formed as functional components of the main hinge mechanism <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 9</figref>, the hinge components <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> that comprise the rear left corner area of the lower cooking plate <b>104</b> are formed as spaced apart flanges with concentric openings. These hinge components support the internal hinge locking mechanism <b>107</b>, <b>900</b> as well as one end of a generally &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame <b>204</b> that supports the upper housing <b>109</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, a pivot <b>205</b> attaches the upper housing <b>109</b> to each side arm of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame <b>204</b> at points approximately mid way along each arm <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref>, the upper housing <b>109</b> may be positioned into a number of different cooking orientations with respect to the lower cooking plate <b>104</b>. As will be further explained, the tilt position of the lower cooking plate <b>104</b> is also adjustable. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>, the device no has a fully closed orientation. An adjustment mechanism <b>120</b> (well known in sandwich presses) allows the upper and lower housings to be locked together for storage purposes. This same mechanism <b>120</b> allows the upper housing <b>109</b> and the upper cooking plate no to be spaced apart from and above the lower cooking plate <b>14</b> in a number of discreet steps. In these cooking and toasting configurations, the upper cooking surface no will tend to remain generally parallel with a lower cooking surface <b>104</b>. However, the pivot <b>205</b> allows it to accommodate irregularly shaped foods. The upper housing <b>109</b> is provided with an adjustment handle <b>130</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>) that can be used to manipulate or position the tilt angle of the upper housing <b>109</b> and its cooking plate no.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the upper housing <b>109</b> can be opened to an intermediate point where it rests against stops located within the hinge mechanism <b>107</b>. In this orientation, it is opened to about 110&#xb0; from horizontal and gravity tends to urge the upper housing <b>109</b> against the internal stops to keep the device in this intermediate orientation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> and as will be further explained, in this intermediate orientation, the lowest edge of the upper cooking surface no is automatically positioned over the lower cooking surface <b>104</b> so that it drips only onto the lower surface <b>104</b>. This positioning of the lower edge of the upper cooking surface is achieved by means of a track arm <b>928</b> as will be detailed in latter parts of this description.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>, the device <b>100</b> is also capable of assuming a fully open grill orientation primarily for higher temperature cooking. In this orientation, higher temperatures can be used to cook meats, eggs and other foods that would normally be fried or grilled. As will be further explained, this orientation is achieved by manually deactivating the locking mechanism <b>107</b>. In this open grill orientation, the handle of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped arm <b>204</b> serves as a foot. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 40</figref>, the cross-piece or handle <b>600</b> makes contact with the bench or counter top so as to better support the upper housing <b>109</b>. In preferred embodiments, the handle <b>600</b> may be slightly bowed or curved so that it makes contact in its centre. It should be noted that in the open grill orientation, the upper housing <b>109</b> and its upper cooking surface no are effectively immobilised. Any tendency for the cooking surface <b>110</b> to tilt is eliminated by mechanical features as will be further explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 47</figref> also illustrate that the liquid run-off of the upper plate no is collected by a discharge spout <b>230</b> located at the front of the upper cooking surface <b>110</b> (when fully opened). The spout <b>230</b> discharges into a rear portion of the drip tray <b>106</b> that protrudes through the back surface of the lower housing <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Hinge Locking Assembly Overview</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An overview of the locking mechanism <b>107</b>, <b>900</b> is presented here. The locking mechanism is built into one side of the hinge that interconnects the upper and lower housings. The locking mechanism comprises a single rotating knob with two user selectable positions that permit the upper housing to pass through the intermediate orientation into fully open position in which the upper cooking surface is supported in a horizontal grilling position. A more detailed discussion follows in the explanation of the operation sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> an appliance such as a toaster grill <b>100</b> has a lower cooking plate <b>104</b> that includes integral hinge components <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> formed as a backing plate <b>202</b> and a lock barrel retainer <b>201</b>. The backing plate has a journal opening <b>965</b> for receiving an enlarged distal head <b>970</b> of a lock shaft <b>925</b>. The lock barrel retainer <b>201</b> has openings <b>901</b> for admitting one or more set screws or roll pins <b>902</b> that are used to hold the lock barrel <b>903</b> in place and keep it from rotating. The barrel <b>903</b> has cooperating pin retaining openings <b>905</b>, <b>906</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>). The lock barrel <b>903</b> is covered by an ornamental lock facia <b>907</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). The facia <b>907</b> includes a recess <b>908</b> for receiving an operating knob <b>910</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The knob <b>910</b> includes a stub shaft <b>911</b> that passes through an opening in the facia <b>907</b> and is received by a first opening <b>912</b> in a lock coupling <b>913</b>. The coupling <b>913</b> extends to connect with a stub shaft <b>914</b> formed on the proximal end of the lock shaft <b>925</b>. The lock shaft <b>925</b> extends into or through the central axial opening <b>940</b> of the lock barrel <b>903</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The lock shaft carries two spring loaded pins. The first is the cam pin <b>980</b>. It operates on the underside of the toggle <b>1340</b> and controls the toggle in response to the user defined position of the control knob <b>910</b>. The reset pin <b>960</b> is engaged by cooperating cam surfaces formed into the lock barrel and the track arm so as to reset the lock shaft, control knob etc., when the user closes the device after using it in the fully open grilling orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The left arm <b>204</b> of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame terminates in a cylindrical shroud <b>926</b>. The shroud <b>926</b> has an internal bore in which is formed a tooth <b>927</b> that is used in limiting the range of motion of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame. The shroud conceals the internal components of the locking assembly. In this example the shroud <b>926</b> is part of the rotating frame <b>204</b>, but it may be formed as a portion of any rotating component over which manual rotational control, by a user, is sought.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, a track arm <b>928</b> is located between the base plate <b>202</b> and the shroud <b>926</b>. The track arm includes a pilot rim <b>929</b> that pilots into an expanded bore <b>930</b> of the shroud <b>926</b>. The track arm also includes a central opening <b>931</b> that acts as a cam surface for the spring loaded reset pin <b>960</b> and a step <b>950</b> that acts against the reset pin <b>960</b> during the reset phase of motion. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the reset pin <b>960</b> is rectangular and resides in a radial opening <b>961</b> in the lock shaft <b>925</b>. Offset from the rear face <b>1710</b> of the track arm is a retaining arm <b>1720</b> in which is formed an elongated slot <b>1730</b>. As shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-29</figref>, a pin <b>2100</b> formed, for example, on the upper housing or upper cooking plate and the pin rides in the slot <b>1730</b>. Thus, the position of the track arm determines aspects of the motion of the upper housing as will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the track arm <b>929</b> has a pilot rim <b>929</b> within which is formed a first bore <b>1610</b> and a smaller, deeper second bore <b>1620</b>. The first track arm bore <b>1610</b> has formed in it a first limit member <b>1615</b> and the second track arm bore has a second limit member <b>1630</b>. The limit members may be integral or inserted separately into the track arm body so that harder materials may be used as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>13</b>-<b>14</b>, the lock barrel <b>903</b> comprises a main body section <b>1301</b> in which are formed the pin retaining openings <b>905</b>, <b>906</b>. A mid-body <b>1305</b> with a half bore <b>1310</b> leads to an end plate <b>1320</b>. A pair of cooperating openings, one in the end of the main body <b>1325</b>, and one in the end plate <b>1330</b> support a toggle shaft <b>1335</b> that passes through an opening <b>1336</b> in the toggle <b>1340</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). As will be explained the toggle <b>1340</b> selectively limits the motion of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame and upper housing in response to the position of the control knob <b>910</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the inner face of the end plate <b>1320</b> includes an arcuate bumper <b>1340</b> having first <b>1342</b> and second <b>1344</b> rotational end stops. The second limit member <b>1630</b> within the track arm acts against the end stops <b>1342</b>, <b>1344</b> of the bumper <b>1340</b> to limit the absolute range of motion of the track arm <b>928</b>. The bumper also has an underside or cam surface <b>1350</b> that has the same profile as the cam surface <b>931</b> of the track arm <b>928</b>. When the track arm is carried into the fully closed position, the cam surfaces <b>931</b> and <b>1350</b> align as do the step <b>950</b> and the first rotational stop <b>1342</b> of the bumper <b>1340</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Operational Sequence of the Locking Mechanism</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The operational sequence of the locking hinge assembly <b>107</b>, <b>900</b> will now be explained with reference to drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-37</figref>. These drawing figures represent cross-sections taken through four distinct vertical planes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates the four planes that will be referred to. With reference to the axis of the locking mechanism <b>900</b>, the drawing figures the term &#x201c;inward&#x201d; describes a direction from the knob <b>910</b> toward the backing plate <b>202</b> and the term &#x201c;outward&#x201d; describes the reverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the section A-A, is a section through the toggle <b>1340</b> but outward of the cam pin <b>980</b>. Section B-B passes through the cam pin <b>980</b>. Section C-C passes through the reset pin <b>960</b> and the lock barrel bumper <b>1340</b>. Section D-D passes through the reset pin and track arm <b>928</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">A. Fully Closed</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a cross-section through the A-A plane of the hinge locking mechanism illustrating the arm <b>204</b> and therefore the upper housing in the fully closed orientation. As shown in this figure, the toggle <b>1340</b> is urged by the cam pin <b>980</b> into an extended position. In this position, the tail end <b>1910</b> of the toggle <b>1340</b> contacts the locking shaft <b>925</b> and the tip or head end <b>1920</b> of the toggle does not interfere with the inside diameter <b>1930</b> of the shroud <b>926</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is taken through plane B-B and shows the cam pin <b>980</b> impinging on the curved underside of the toggle <b>1340</b>. In this view it can be seen that the cam pin <b>980</b> is in a fully extended position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the reset pin is depressed by the underside <b>1350</b> or cam surface of the bumper <b>1340</b>. The reset pin is also depressed by the cam surface <b>931</b> of the track arm <b>928</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">B. Intermediate and Locked</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a cross-section through the hinge locking mechanism <b>107</b> through plane A-A. As shown here, the parallel arms <b>204</b> of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame and therefore the upper housing are in an intermediate orientation. The upper cooking surface <b>110</b> can not rotate away from the lower cooking surface <b>104</b> because the tooth <b>927</b> in the shroud <b>926</b> is interfered with or prevented from further rotation by the head <b>1920</b> of the toggle <b>1340</b>. A user can bring the upper and lower cooking surface closer together but not further apart. When the upper housing is inclined by more than 90&#xb0; gravity tends to keep the upper housing in this intermediate &#x201c;upright&#x201d; and intermediate orientation leaning against the stop provided by the toggle <b>1340</b>. In the upright and locked orientation the upper cooking surface is inclined from the horizontal by about 110&#xb0;. In the upright and locked orientation the upper cooking surface is inclined from the horizontal by about 110&#xb0;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, taken through plane B-B shows that the second limit member <b>1630</b> of the track arm <b>1928</b> also impinges against the inner portion of the head of the toggle <b>1340</b> when the upper housing is in the intermediate orientation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> (taken through planes C-C and D-D respectively) show that the lock shaft <b>925</b> is still in the &#x201c;locked&#x201d; position and that the step <b>950</b> of the track arm is rotated away from its closed position.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">C. Closed and Unlocked</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In order to position the upper housing and upper cooking plate <b>110</b> into a fully opened or grilling orientation, it is necessary to first close the device by using the handle <b>600</b> to bring the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame and the upper housing into a fully closed orientation. When fully closed, the control knob <b>910</b> is rotated counter clockwise (for example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 9</figref>). This has the effect of rotating the lock shaft <b>925</b> and the cam pin, thus urging the toggle into an &#x201c;unlocked&#x201d; position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-29</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-29</figref> are taken respectively through planes A-A, B-B, C-C and D-D. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the locking shaft <b>925</b> has been rotated into the retracted or &#x201c;unlocked&#x201d; position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, the cam pin <b>980</b> now impinges on the tail <b>910</b> of the toggle <b>1340</b>. This has the effect of rotating the head <b>1920</b> about the shaft <b>1335</b> into a position where it is clear of the rotational movement of the tooth <b>1630</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>, the reset pin <b>960</b> is now extending as the underside <b>1350</b> of the bumper <b>1340</b> nor the cam surface <b>931</b> of the track arm <b>928</b> release it. From this orientation, the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame and upper housing are free to be rotated, by the user, past the intermediate or upright orientation into a fully open or grill orientation.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">D. Grill Orientation</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Cross-sections of the lock mechanism <b>107</b> in the grill orientation are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-33</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-33</figref> are taken through planes A-A, B-B, C-C and D-D respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>, the tooth <b>927</b> and second limit member <b>1630</b> of the track arm <b>928</b> have rotated past the toggle <b>1340</b> without interference. In this orientation, the upper cooking surface is in a horizontal orientation and the handle <b>600</b> of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame is resting on the same surface that supports the lower housing. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>, the reset pin <b>960</b> is fully extended. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the track arm <b>928</b> is fully extended and prevented from further rotation away from the lower cooking surface because the first limit stop <b>1615</b> of the track arm <b>928</b> is up against the first rotational stop <b>1342</b> of the bumper <b>1340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Because the upper housing's pin <b>2100</b> is located within the slot <b>1730</b>, the upper cooking surface <b>110</b> is prevented from further clockwise rotation about its pivot (clockwise being relative to the depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>). Counter clockwise restraint of the upper cooking surface will be dealt with below.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">E. Reset</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">From the grill orientation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-33</figref>, the user can close and reset the hinge locking mechanism <b>107</b> simply by grasping the handle <b>600</b> and fully closing the unit. This motion of the upper housing, &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame and track arm <b>928</b> have the effect of resetting the locking mechanism so that subsequent attempts to open the unit encounter the mid point locking orientation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref>. This re-setting action is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34-37</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34-37</figref> are taken through planes A-A, B-B, C-C and D-D respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref> illustrate that the step <b>950</b> in the central bore of the track arm has caught the extended reset pin <b>960</b> and is thus rotating the reset pin <b>960</b> and the lock shaft <b>925</b> back toward its original position. As this is occurring the cam surface <b>1350</b> of the lock barrel guides the reset pin back into its bore, retracting it, as the rotation of the lock shaft continues under influence of the track arm.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When fully reset, the reset pin is retracted and clear of the track arm. As the lock shaft <b>925</b> and the cam pin <b>980</b> rotate cock wise in these views, it can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 35</figref> that the cam pin <b>980</b> is now allowed to extend and lift the toggle's head <b>1920</b> radially outward into a position where it will interfere with the tooth <b>927</b> and first limit <b>1615</b>. When the unit is reopened, the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame and upper housing will stop in the intermediate or upright orientation.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Restraining of Upper Housing</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In cooking orientations between the fully closed orientation and the upright orientation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> it is important that the upper housing is free to pivot within a limited range about the horizontal pivots <b>205</b>. This allows irregular objects to be contacted evenly by both the upper and lower cooking plates even if the object being cooked does not have a parallel top and bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">One limitation in this range of pivoting motion is the requirement that the upper cooking surface <b>110</b> be rigidised or restrained from pivoting when it is in the fully opened or grill orientation. As previously mentioned, a portion of the limitation of motion is accomplished by the interaction between the upper housing's pin and the track arm as explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-33</figref>. In these figures, the immobilisation of the track arm prevents the lower edge of the upper cooking surface to fall away from the lower cooking surface.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Limitations in the other direction of pivoting rotation in the grill orientation, are explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38-40</figref>. These figures illustrate the operation of a supporting finger that has no influence on the upper cooking surface <b>110</b> until the upper cooking surface is in, or nearly in, a fully extended or grilling orientation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, a curved supporting finger <b>3800</b> is retained by a rotating hub <b>3810</b> that is built into the right side arm <b>3820</b> of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame. An actuating rod <b>3830</b> is linked at one end <b>3840</b> to a point or pin on the pivoting hub <b>3810</b>. The other end or tracking end <b>3850</b> of the actuating arm <b>3830</b> extends into a cavity <b>3860</b> located within the rear shroud <b>3870</b> of the right side arm <b>3820</b>. Also located within the shroud <b>3870</b> is a cam surface <b>3880</b> that is integral with either the lower cooking plate <b>104</b> or the lower housing <b>102</b>. When the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped frame is partially opened and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, the tracking or following end <b>3850</b> of the actuating rod <b>3830</b> begins to impinge on the cam surface <b>3880</b>. This has the effect of driving the actuating rod <b>3830</b> forward or toward the handle <b>600</b>. Thus, separating the upper and lower cooking surfaces rotates the supporting finger <b>3800</b> into an evermore upright position. When the device is fully opened (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>), the supporting finger <b>3800</b> is full extended. An extension <b>3890</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>) of the upper cooking surface <b>110</b> comes to rest on and is supported by the finger <b>3800</b>. In this way, the action of the supporting finger <b>3800</b> together with the limits provided by the tracking arm prevent any rotation of the upper cooking surface <b>110</b> about the pivots <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Lower Cooking Surface Tilt Mechanism</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41-43</figref> illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention in which the lower cooking surface is tilt adjustable. Tilt adjustments of the lower cooking surface <b>104</b> allows the user to select between orientations where liquid run off is promoted or where the run off rate is de-emphasized in favour of a level cooking. A level surface may be more convenient where the user does not want food that rolls or flows to migrate toward the front edge of the lower cooking surface <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, the front of the toaster grill <b>100</b> comprises a control panel <b>4100</b>. An actuator such as a knob <b>4110</b> on the control panel is used to rotate a crank <b>4120</b> that has an extension <b>4130</b> that connects to a coupling or control arm <b>4140</b>. The other end of the control arm <b>4150</b> attaches to a pivot location <b>4160</b> located toward the front on the underside <b>4170</b> of the lower cooking surface <b>104</b>. Thus, rotation of the tilt adjustment control knob <b>4100</b> has the effect of raising and lowering the front edge <b>4180</b> of the lower cooking surface <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> illustrates the lower cooking surface <b>104</b> in a tilted position where the front edge <b>4180</b> is lower than the rear edge <b>4200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> shows that rotation of the control knob <b>4110</b> has caused a lifting of the front edge <b>4180</b> so that the surface (or rib tops) is approximately level.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Thermostat Linkage</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In preferred embodiments of the invention, an adjustable thermostat is mounted directly to the underside of the lower cooking surface <b>104</b>. So that this adjustable thermostat may be used or operated with a control knob located on the control panel <b>4100</b>, a mechanical linkage or coupling is required. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 and 45</figref> illustrate such a linkage. As shown in these figures, a control knob <b>4500</b> on the control panel <b>4100</b> is attached to a stub shaft <b>4400</b> that passes through the control panel <b>4100</b>. The distal end of the control shaft <b>4400</b> comprises a coupling portion <b>4410</b> that attaches to ball <b>4420</b> having retaining stubs <b>4430</b> that are snapped into cooperating grooves <b>4440</b> located in the stub shaft's coupling portion <b>4410</b>. The ball <b>4420</b> is part of a floating shaft <b>4450</b> having a similar ball arrangement <b>4460</b> at the other end. The second ball and stub arrangement <b>4460</b> is retained by a second coupling portion <b>4470</b> which has a bore <b>4480</b> for receiving the control shaft <b>4520</b> of the thermostat <b>4530</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Drip Control</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As mentioned, the toaster grill of the present invention is adapted for toasting and grilling. Toasting, for example of sandwiches, occurs at a cooking temperature of about 180&#xb0; C. Grilling of meats occurs at temperatures of about 230&#xb0; C. Higher temperature cooking, particularly of meats, results in a release of fats and juices from the meat. Further, cooking at higher temperatures may also require the use of cooking oils. Therefore, it is important to provide features for removing and collecting excess cooking liquids from the cooking surfaces. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> specifically illustrates an important relationship between the upper and lower cooking surfaces <b>110</b>, <b>104</b>. In this illustration, the toaster grill <b>100</b> is depicted in the intermediate orientation. Note that the elevated rim of the lower edge <b>4610</b> of the upper cooking surface <b>110</b> is located above a portion of the lower cooking surface <b>104</b>. This means that any cooking liquids dripping from the lower edge <b>4610</b> fall onto and are collected by the lower cooking surface <b>104</b>. Also shown in this view is a transverse gutter <b>4620</b> that extends along the lower edge of the upper cooking surface <b>110</b>. This gutter is surrounded by an elevated rim and leads into the discharge spout <b>230</b> (better seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>49</b> and <b>50</b>). As previously mentioned, the action of the track arm <b>928</b> prevents the undesirable rotation of the upper cooking assembly <b>109</b> in the direction of the arrow <b>4630</b>. Because of the rim <b>4640</b> along the rear edge of the lower cooking surface <b>104</b>, liquids discharged from the upper cooking surface are eventually discharged through the lower cooking surface's front spout <b>105</b> into the drip collection tray <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, when the upper housing <b>109</b> is in the grill orientation a slight inclination forward of the drainage surface below the rib tops, results in a discharge of cooking liquids through the discharge spout <b>230</b> into the rear <b>4710</b> of the drip collection tray <b>106</b>. In this way, drippings may be collected at the rear of the tray <b>4710</b> from the top spout <b>230</b> as well as into the front of the tray <b>4720</b> from the lower spout <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> illustrates that the drip collection tray <b>106</b> can be removed from the toaster grill <b>100</b> by sliding it horizontally out of the lower housing. Note that a bumper <b>4810</b> serves to limit the travel of the tray <b>106</b> and correctly positions it so that it can collect from both spouts <b>230</b>, <b>105</b>. The bumper <b>4810</b> may cooperate with a cooperating shoulder <b>4820</b> formed into the lower rear corner of the tray <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Details of Upper Cooking Surface</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49 and 50</figref>, the upper cooking surface no preferably comprises an aluminium casting which is coated with a non-stick material. In preferred embodiments, the upper cooking surface no carries a number of parallel ribs <b>4910</b> which are generally parallel with the sides of the toaster grill <b>100</b>. In particularly preferred embodiments and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, the ribs are tapered, being slightly higher at their fronts <b>4920</b> than at their rears <b>4930</b>. This allows the tips <b>4940</b> to remain generally horizontal when the surface is in the grilling orientation while still providing drainage toward the spout area <b>230</b> of the inclined surface that occupies the space <b>4950</b> between and around the ribs <b>4910</b>. Where the lower cooking surface <b>104</b> is provided with ribs, it is preferred that this same arrangement be maintained, that is, ribs that taper toward a maximum height adjacent to the spout area and that the rib tips or tops remain generally horizontal subject to the tilt action described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41-43</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Adjustment Handle</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, the upper cooking surface <b>109</b> has a front edge <b>5110</b> to which a handle <b>130</b> is attached. In preferred embodiments, the handle is attached from the obverse side of the front face <b>5110</b> by one or more fasteners <b>5120</b>. In this example, the handle <b>130</b> includes spacers <b>5130</b> that maintain a slight air gap between the front face <b>5110</b> and the handle <b>130</b>. The handle allows the tilt angle of the upper housing <b>109</b> to be adjusted, even when it is hot.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Circuit Configurations</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A first circuit diagram for a combination sandwich press and grill <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>. As shown by the circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, the electrical circuit includes a base plate heating element <b>5200</b> and a top plate-heating element <b>5202</b>. The base plate-heating element <b>5200</b> is preferably an 1100 W/240V element and the top element <b>5202</b> is preferably a 5200 W/240V. A thermal fuse <b>5204</b> prevents the device from over heating. A user controlled, variable thermostat <b>5206</b> provides an operating range of about 180 C to 220 C. When the variable thermostat <b>5206</b> reaches an operating temperature of 200 C, a remote micro switch <b>5206</b> bypasses the 200 C fixed thermostat <b>5210</b> of the top heating element in favour of a 220 C fixed thermostat <b>5212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Another embodiment of the invention utilises the circuitry depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>. In this embodiment, the circuitry includes a thermal fuse <b>5300</b> and a single 180/220 C variable thermostat <b>5304</b>. Note that the variable thermostat <b>5302</b> controls only the base plate-heating element <b>5304</b>, which is preferably an 1100 W/240V type element. The top plate-heating element <b>5306</b> is preferably a 1300 W/240V heating element that is regulated by a single 200 C fixed thermostat <b>5308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, a third embodiment of the invention incorporates an electronic circuit incorporating a user activated switch <b>5400</b> which allows for the disconnection of the top heating element <b>5402</b>. The top-heating element <b>5402</b> is preferably a 1300 W/240 V element that is regulated by a single 200 C fixed thermostat <b>5404</b>. The same user activated switch <b>5400</b> allows for power to be supplied to either of two base plate-heating elements <b>5406</b>, <b>5408</b>. The first heating element <b>5406</b> is an 1100 W/240 V element where as the second base plate element <b>5408</b> is a 1300 W/240 V element. Both base plate elements <b>5406</b>, <b>5408</b> are regulated by a 180/220 C variable thermostat <b>5410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A fourth embodiment is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>. In this embodiment, base plate heating elements <b>5500</b>, <b>5502</b> as well as the top plate-heating element <b>5504</b> are regulated by a 180/220 C variable thermostat <b>5506</b>. This embodiment also allows the user to selectively activate or deactivate the top plate cooking element <b>5504</b> (with the switch <b>5400</b>) while at the same time selecting between one or both base plate heating elements <b>5500</b>, <b>5502</b>. In this embodiment, the first base plate-heating element <b>5500</b> is preferably 1100 W/240V and the second base plate-heating element <b>5502</b> is preferably 1300 W/240V. The top plate element <b>5504</b> is preferably 1300 W/240 V.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A fifth and preferred circuit diagram for a combination sandwich press and grill <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>. As shown by the circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the electrical circuit includes a 15A main switch <b>5601</b>, a base plate heating element <b>5600</b> and a top plate heating element <b>5602</b> in parallel with the base plate. The base plate and the top heating elements <b>5200</b>, <b>5206</b> are both preferably 1200 W/240V. A thermal fuse <b>5204</b> in series with both plates prevents the device from over heating. A single user controlled, variable thermostat <b>5610</b> mounted on the lower plate provides a lower plate operating range of about 180 C to 230 C. A green LED <b>5620</b> indicates that the power is on. A red or other LED <b>5630</b> indicates that the bottom variable thermostat <b>5610</b> has reached the correct temperature and is ready for cooking. The top plate is controlled by a fixed thermostat <b>5650</b> set to about 235 C. This embodiment dispenses with the need for a top element variable thermostat. During toasting operations the higher temperature of the top element is moderated because the top cooking surface no has ribs <b>4910</b>.</p>
