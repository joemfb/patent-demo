<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A technique is known to illuminate a combined white color light to improve color reproduction for a liquid crystal display by utilizing multiple light sources, which illuminate different colors (red (R), green (G), blue (B) and so on) as a backlight source. An example of this technique is disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. H11-295689.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram of a display device in accordance with the related art. The configuration is the same as the one disclosed by Japanese patent publication No. JPH11-295689. In this conventional display device, a feedback control technique is adopted to maintain the value of a light emission amount equal to a predetermined value by detecting the light emission amount from multiple light sources, so as to maintain the white balance set at the time of shipment or user setting, regardless of temperature variation or other time dependent variation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A known technique to illuminate a liquid crystal element includes driving multiple light sources, which illuminate different colors (red (R), green (G), blue (B) and so on), sequentially on a time division basis. An example of this technique is disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. 2001-235729.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The technique disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. H11-295689 is able to provide a liquid crystal display device with fine color reproduction regardless of variations in environmental temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">White color is generated by illuminating multiple different color light sources simultaneously in Japanese patent publication No. H11-295689. Accordingly, multiple photo detectors are required to detect a light emission amount corresponding, respectively, to each color of the light sources. Furthermore, multiple operation circuits for feedback control are required corresponding to each of the light sources. This results in an increase of device size or cost.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, a technique to generate white light by driving multiple light sources sequentially is disclosed in Japanese publication No. JP2001-235729. In particular, a technique is disclosed to control an illumination period corresponding to a variation of ambient temperature, against a delaying caused in a low temperature circumstance. However, there is no disclosure about a technique to adjust a white balance in view of a temperature variation or a time dependent variation of the light sources themselves.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The details of one or more implementations of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some implementations, the disclosure provides a light emission driving device to drive multiple light sources sequentially on a time division basis, and an illumination device and a display device using the driving device which can maintain a fine color reproduction regardless of a temperature variation or a time dependent variation, without increasing the device scale or cost.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one aspect, a light emission driving device to drive multiple light sources sequentially on a time division basis calculates an light emission amount control parameter to control a light emission amount for one of the light sources. The parameter is calculated based on a detected light emission amount for a previous illumination of the same light source, a predetermined value for comparison to the detected light emission amount, and the light emission amount control parameter set for a previous illumination of the same light source.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some implementations, the light emission driving device includes a first storing part to store a detected light emission amount at a moment of a previous illumination for one of the light sources, and a second storing part to store a predetermined value for comparison to the detected light emission amount, a third storing part to store an light emission amount control parameter set for the previous illumination of the same light source, and an operation circuit to calculate an output to control the same light source according to outputs from foregoing three storing parts.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a display device <b>1</b> includes a light emission driving device <b>100</b>, a backlight <b>200</b>, a liquid crystal display panel <b>300</b>, and a photo detector <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The light emission driving device <b>100</b> can be implemented as a semiconductor device (a backlight driver IC) to drive multiple light sources sequentially on a time division basis by receiving an electrical signal from the photo detector <b>400</b>, wherein the backlight <b>200</b> includes the light sources. Internal construction of the light emission driving device <b>100</b> is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The backlight <b>200</b> is an illumination device to illuminate the liquid crystal display panel <b>300</b> from behind, and includes multiple light sources which emit different colors from one another. (In the illustrated embodiment, the light sources include a red light source <b>200</b>R, a green light source <b>200</b>G, a blue light source <b>200</b>B). These three light sources <b>200</b>R, <b>200</b>G, and <b>200</b>B are driven sequentially on a time division basis according to the control signals from the light emission driving device <b>100</b>, and, in combination, provide white light. In this embodiment, light emitting diodes are used as the three light sources <b>200</b>R, <b>200</b>G, and <b>200</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As an illumination output control parameter to determine a light emission amount (e.g., an illumination power), either a current value of the driving current which flows through each of the light sources or a control value for performing PWM (e.g., a value which sets a duty ratio for the period of PWM) is used.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following description, for simplicity of explanation, a current value of the driving current which flows through each of the light sources is fixed as a constant value. Variable control is described only for a control value for performing PWM.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The liquid crystal display panel <b>300</b> is an image output device which provides a light transmission of the liquid crystal as a picture element. The light transmission changes according to the input image signal.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The photo detector <b>400</b> can be implemented as a sole photoelectric converting device that convert light signals emitted sequentially on a time division basis from the light sources <b>200</b>R, <b>200</b>G, and <b>200</b>B, to corresponding electrical signals. A photo diode or a photo transistor can be used as the photo detector <b>400</b>. It is desirable for the photo detector <b>400</b> to detect each of the emitted light colors equally (i.e., not to have a directional characteristic biased to specific colors of red, green or blue light).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the display device <b>1</b> according to the illustrated example, the light emission driving device <b>100</b> includes an integration circuit <b>101</b>, an analog-to-digital conversion circuit <b>102</b>, a selector <b>103</b>, a first register <b>104</b> (a register <b>104</b>R for red color light emission amount, a register <b>104</b>G for green color light emission amount, a register <b>104</b>B for blue color light emission amount), a selector <b>105</b>, a light emission amount setting circuit <b>106</b>, an operation circuit <b>107</b>, a selector <b>108</b>, a second register <b>109</b> (including a red color PWM value register <b>109</b>R, a green color PWM value register <b>109</b>G, a blue color PWM value register <b>109</b>B), a selector <b>110</b>, a selector <b>111</b>, a driver <b>112</b> (including a red color driver <b>112</b>R, a green color driver <b>112</b>G, a blue color driver <b>112</b>B), and a timing control circuit <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The integration circuit <b>101</b> generates an analog signal by integrating an electrical signal obtained from the photo detector <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The analog-to-digital conversion circuit <b>102</b> converts an analog signal obtained from the integration circuit <b>101</b> to a digital signal, and provides a digital signal to the first register <b>104</b> via the selector <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The selector <b>103</b> sequentially on a time division basis connects an output terminal of the analog-to-digital conversion circuit <b>102</b> with input terminals of the register <b>104</b>R for red color light emission amount or the register <b>104</b>G for green color light emission amount or the register <b>104</b>B for blue color light emission amount, in accordance with a switching control signal from the timing control circuit <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first register <b>104</b> includes the register <b>104</b>R for red color light emission amount, the register <b>104</b>G for green color light emission amount, and the register <b>104</b>B for blue color light emission amount.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The register <b>104</b>R for red color light emission amount temporarily stores a value DET_R(k) corresponding to a signal detected by the photo detector <b>400</b> during illumination of the red light source <b>200</b>R at frame k.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The register <b>104</b>G for green color light emission amount temporarily stores a value DET_G(k) corresponding to a signal detected by the photo detector <b>400</b> during illumination of the green light source <b>200</b>G at frame k.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The register <b>104</b>B for blue color light emission amount temporarily stores a value DET_B(k) corresponding to a signal detected by the photo detector <b>400</b> during illumination of the blue light source <b>200</b>B at frame k.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The selector <b>105</b> sequentially on a time division basis connects the first input terminal of the operation circuit <b>107</b> with output terminals of the register <b>104</b>R for red color light emission amount or the register <b>104</b>G for green color light emission amount or the register <b>104</b>B for blue color light emission amount, in accordance with the switching control signal from the timing control circuit <b>113</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the following description, control of an light emission amount for the red light source <b>200</b>R is described. However, the same control technique also can be applied for both of the green source <b>200</b>G and the blue source <b>200</b>B.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">By the time the measurement period of the LED current is started, the switch SWa and the switches SWc to SWe are in an ON state, and the switch SWb is in an OFF state.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the states when the capacitor C<b>1</b> is selected.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the capacitor C<b>1</b> and the capacitor C<b>2</b> are selected, both switches SWd and SWe change to the ON state during the measurement period of the LED current and during the analog-to-digital conversion period.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Thus, the output gain can be changed for each of the light sources. This construction enables the dynamic range of the analog signal provided to the analog-to-digital conversion circuit <b>102</b> to stay within a constant range, regardless of a fluctuation between the current amount detected by the photo detector <b>400</b> for each of the light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As described above, the light emission driving device <b>100</b> in this embodiment drives multiple sources <b>200</b>R, <b>200</b>G, and <b>200</b>B sequentially on a time division basis.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The light sources <b>200</b>R, <b>200</b>G and <b>200</b>B are not simultaneously illuminated by adopting this construction. Thus, multiple photo detectors to detect light emission amounts corresponding to each color of the light sources are not required.

Accordingly, a fine color reproduction can be realized regardless of the temperature variation or time dependent variation of the light sources, without increasing size or cost.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Additionally, the light sources are not illuminated continuously all the time, and the disclosure can enable use of a field sequential method to drive the liquid crystal display panel <b>300</b>.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The light emission driving device <b>100</b> according to some embodiments adopts a method to detect the light emission amount according to each illumination period for the light sources, and a response speed for controlling the brightness of the backlight <b>200</b> is enhanced.
