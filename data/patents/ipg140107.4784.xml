<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method is provided of operating an image-based check processing system to detect a double feed condition of carrier envelopes. An example method includes attempting to read a magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) codeline from a first predefined area of an image of a document item, determining if the document item is a carrier envelope, concluding that the document item is not a double-fed item when a determination is made that the document item is a carrier envelope, and concluding that the document item is potentially a double-fed item when a determination is made that the document item is not a carrier envelope.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This present invention relates to processing document items in an image-based check processing system, and is particularly directed to methods of operating an image-based check processing system to detect a double feed condition of carrier envelopes and an apparatus therefor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Background</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A typical image-based check processing system includes a check processing transport which has a document track and a number of check processing modules positioned along the document track for performing specific document processing operations on document items including checks moving downstream along the document track. The check processing system also includes a transport processor which executes a transport application program which is stored in memory to control operation of devices contained within the check processing modules positioned along the document track and thereby to control operation of the check processing transport.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical check processing transport includes a hopper into which a stack of document items is placed. An operator initially prepares the document items (e.g., orienting document items properly (forwards and upside right), removing staples, removing paper clips, straightening bent corners, and the like) before they are placed into the hopper. A document feeder adjacent the hopper selectively feeds or drives each document item from the stack of document items in the hopper to transport the document item from the upstream end to the downstream end along the document track past a magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) reader and an image capture device. The MICR reader reads a codeline from each document item. The image capture device captures an image of the front of the document item and an image of the back of the document item. The document items are eventually transported to sorting pockets of a pocket device located at the downstream end of the document track. The pockets receive document items which have been sorted based upon the particular transport application program.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">From time to time, a double feed condition occurs (e.g., two overlapping document items) when only one document item should have been fed along the document track. The occurrence of a double feed condition causes an undesirable result. A double feed condition of document items would result in one of the document items being missed and not processed. Eventually at some later time during balancing, it takes up much time from a human operator to locate the unprocessed document item and then to reprocess it to complete the balancing function. This is time-consuming and costly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A particular type of document item which is used in check processing operations is a carrier envelope. A carrier envelope is a piece of opaque paper with a clear plastic cover on the front that forms a pocket to hold a damaged, foreign or other item that may require special handling. There is room at the bottom of the carrier envelope to allow encoding thereof. As an example, a torn or badly curled check would be placed into the pocket of the carrier envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A drawback in the use of carrier envelopes in a check processing operation is that they usually cause disproportionately more false double feed warnings as compared to other types of document items. This is simply due to the nature of carrier envelopes. Accordingly, human operators spend disproportionately more time in handling false double feed exceptions involving carrier envelopes than with other types of document items.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Sometimes an operator will disable a double feed detection feature when carrier envelopes are being processed to avoid having to waste time dealing with false double feed exceptions. This creates a problem though if the operator forgets to re-enable the double feed detection feature and leaves it off. The problem is that valid double-fed items will be missed. Missed double-fed items create &#x201c;day two&#x201d; work to find the missing document item and then to reprocess it. This is again time-consuming and costly. It would be desirable to provide methods of detecting a double feed condition of carrier envelopes in a check processing operation so that double feed detection is improved without having to take up more human operator time.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Summary</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with one embodiment, a method is provided of operating an image-based check processing system to detect a double feed condition of carrier envelopes. The method comprises attempting to read a magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) codeline from a first predefined area of an image of a document item. Based upon the attempted read of a MICR codeline from the first predefined area of the item image, a determination is made if the document item is a carrier envelope. A conclusion is made that the document item is not a double-fed item when a determination is made that the document item is a carrier envelope. A conclusion is made that the document item is potentially a double-fed item when a determination is made that the document item is not a carrier envelope. The method may further comprise attempting to read a MICR codeline from a second predefined area which is different from the first predefined area of the item image. Based upon the attempted read of a MICR codeline from the second predefined area of the item image, a determination is made if the item image has a valid MICR codeline. A conclusion is made that the document item is not a double-fed item when a determination is made that a valid MICR codeline has been read from the second predefined area of the item image. A conclusion is made that the document item is potentially a double-fed item when a determination is made that a valid MICR codeline has not been read from the second predefined area of the item image.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention is directed to methods of operating an image-based check processing system to detect a double feed condition of carrier envelopes. The specific construction and use of the image-based check processing system may vary. The check processing system may be, for example, a sorting machine or a proof machine wherein financial document items are processed in a bank. The financial document items may be in any number of forms. As examples, a financial document item may be in the form of a check, a deposit slip, a cash-in slip, or a cash-out slip.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An example image-based check processing system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and designated with reference numeral <b>10</b>. The check processing system <b>10</b> includes a check processing transport <b>12</b> having a document track <b>14</b> along which financial document items, such as checks, can be transported from an upstream end to a downstream end. The transport <b>12</b> includes a number of different check processing modules positioned along the document track <b>14</b>. Each check processing module includes a number of devices associated with the particular check processing module for performing specific document processing operations on document items moving along the document track <b>14</b>. The transport <b>12</b> includes a hopper <b>16</b> into which a stack of financial document items including checks are placed. A document feeder <b>18</b> adjacent the hopper <b>16</b> selectively feeds or drives each document item from the stack of document items in the hopper to transport the document item from the upstream end to the downstream end along the document track <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The check processing system <b>10</b> also includes a magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) codeline reader <b>20</b> located along the document track <b>14</b>. The MICR reader <b>20</b> reads a MICR codeline from the front of each physical document item being transported and processed along the document track <b>14</b>. The check processing system <b>10</b> includes electronic front and rear image capture devices <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>located along the document track <b>14</b>. The front image capture device <b>22</b><i>a </i>captures an electronic image of the front of each document item. Similarly, the rear image capture device <b>22</b><i>b </i>captures an electronic image of the rear of each document item. More specifically, the front image capture device <b>22</b><i>a </i>may include a front imaging camera, and the rear image capture device <b>22</b><i>b </i>includes a rear imaging camera. Structure and operation of MICR codeline readers and electronic imaging cameras are well known and, therefore, will not be described.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The check processing system <b>10</b> further includes front and rear optical character recognition (OCR) reader devices <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>located along the document track <b>14</b>. The front OCR reader <b>23</b><i>a </i>performs an OCR read of the front image captured by the front imaging camera <b>22</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the rear OCR reader <b>23</b><i>b </i>performs an OCR read of the rear image captured by the rear imaging camera <b>22</b><i>b</i>. Structure and operation of OCR readers devices are well known and, therefore, will not be described.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Although the above description describes the OCR readers <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>in hardware form, it is conceivable that the OCR readers be in software form, or a combination of both hardware and software. In the case of software OCR, the controlling software for OCR functionality may reside on a transport processor <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The controlling software for software OCR may reside on a different processor, or on a server, or on a combination of different processors and servers. For convenience, OCR readers in software form will be used in the description hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The check processing system <b>10</b> may optionally include an encoder <b>24</b>, an endorser <b>26</b>, or a bank stamper <b>28</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The encoder <b>24</b> encodes missing fields on each check. The endorser <b>26</b> applies an endorsement in a known manner to each check. The bank stamper <b>28</b> stamps each check to identify the bank institution processing the check. Structure and operation of encoders, endorsers, and bank stampers are well known and, therefore, will not be described.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The check processing system <b>10</b> also includes a pocket device <b>30</b> located at the downstream end of the document track <b>14</b>. The pocket device <b>30</b> has a number of different types of pockets into which processed document items are pocketed. Example types of pockets include on-us pockets, transit pockets, and reject pockets. Structure and operation of pockets in the pocket device <b>30</b> are well known and, therefore, will not be described.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The check processing system <b>10</b> further includes the transport processor <b>42</b> and a transport operator interface <b>43</b> which communicates via signals on line <b>44</b> with the transport processor. The operator interface <b>43</b> may include a keyboard, a mouse, and a display, all of which communicate via signals with the transport processor <b>42</b>. The transport processor <b>42</b> controls operation of the transport <b>12</b> via signals on line <b>45</b>. The check processing system <b>10</b> also includes a transport memory <b>46</b> which communicates via signals on line <b>47</b> with the transport processor <b>42</b>. The memory <b>46</b> may comprise a single memory unit or a plurality of different memory units. An executable transport application program is stored in the memory <b>46</b>. The transport application program is associated with a particular type of document processing work. For example, one type of work is proof of deposit. Another type of work is remittance processing. Still another type of work may be encoding and sorting of document items. Suitable processors and memories are readily available in the marketplace. Their structure and operation are well known and, therefore, will not be described.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When the transport application program is executed, the devices contained within check processing modules lying along the document track <b>14</b> are controlled to process document items moving downstream along the document track in accordance with the transport application program, as is known. The memory <b>46</b> may store sequence numbers, MICR codelines, and image data associated with document items which have been processed in accordance with the transport application program. If applicable, the memory <b>46</b> may also store encoder status, endorsement status, or bank stamp status.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a typical check <b>60</b> which can be processed by the check processing system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated. The check <b>60</b> is made of sheet material and includes a payer field <b>62</b>, a date field <b>64</b>, a check number field <b>66</b> located in the upper-right corner of the check, and a payee field <b>68</b>. The check <b>60</b> also includes a courtesy amount field <b>70</b>, a legal amount field <b>72</b>, a paying bank name field <b>74</b>, a memo field <b>76</b>, and a payer signature field <b>78</b>. Each field of the check <b>60</b> contains pre-printed information therein, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The particular check <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a torn portion <b>63</b>. Since the check <b>60</b> is a torn document item, it needs to be placed into acarrier envelope for special handling as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The check <b>60</b> also has a MICR codeline which comprises a routing/transit number <b>80</b>, an account number <b>84</b>, and a check number <b>88</b>. The routing/transit number <b>80</b> is located between a first transit Q symbol <b>81</b> and a second transit Q symbol <b>82</b>. The account number <b>84</b> is located between the second transit Q symbol <b>82</b> and an account Q symbol <b>85</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The check number <b>88</b> is located between the account Q symbol and an amount Q symbol (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The encoder <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) encodes amount Q symbols on the check <b>60</b> during processing the check. Other arrangements of routing/transit numbers, account numbers, check numbers, and Q symbols are possible. Format of Q symbols <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>85</b> are conventional and well known in the financial industry.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a particular type of document item in the form of a carrier envelope <b>50</b> is illustrated. The carrier envelope <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a pre-encoded type of carrier envelope as will be explained later. The carrier envelope <b>50</b> comprises a piece of opaque paper <b>51</b> with a clear plastic cover <b>90</b> on the front that forms a pocket to hold a foreign, damaged or other item which requires special handling. There is room at the bottom of the carrier envelope <b>50</b> to allow encoding thereof. As an example, the torn check <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> would need to be placed into the pocket of a carrier envelope such as the carrier envelope <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As another example, a badly curled check (not shown) would need to be placed into the pocket of a carrier envelope such as the carrier envelope <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, opaque paper <b>51</b> extends between its upper edge <b>52</b> and its lower edge <b>53</b>, and between its left edge <b>54</b> (as viewed looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and its right edge <b>55</b>. Clear plastic cover <b>90</b> extends between its top edge <b>91</b> and its bottom edge <b>92</b>, and extends between its left edge <b>93</b> and its right edge <b>94</b>. Left edge <b>93</b> of cover <b>90</b> overlies left edge <b>54</b> of paper <b>51</b>, and right edge <b>94</b> of cover <b>90</b> overlies right edge <b>55</b> of paper <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A patch of adhesive <b>99</b> in a generally U-shape is disposed between paper <b>51</b> and cover <b>90</b> in the vicinity of bottom edge <b>92</b> and left and right edges <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> of cover <b>90</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to bond paper <b>51</b> and cover <b>90</b> together to form a pocket between paper and cover. The pocket extends between left pocket side <b>95</b> and right pocket side <b>96</b>, and extends between pocket bottom <b>97</b> and pocket opening located at top edge <b>91</b> of cover <b>90</b>. Text <b>56</b> which is descriptive of carrier envelope <b>50</b> is pre-printed on paper <b>51</b> and is visible through clear cover <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A MICR codeline <b>57</b> located between pair of transit Q symbols <b>59</b> is pre-encoded on bottom portion <b>58</b> of paper <b>51</b>. A carrier envelope with a pre-encoded MICR codeline, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is known as a pre-encoded type of carrier envelope. A carrier envelope with no pre-encoded MICR codeline (not shown) is known as a non-encoded type of carrier envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Rectangle <b>32</b> shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an imaginary first predefined area which front OCR reader <b>23</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) attempts to read MICR codeline data from carrier envelope <b>50</b> during processing of carrier envelope through check processing system <b>10</b> as will be described in detail later. First predefined area <b>32</b> is also where MICR codeline reader <b>20</b> attempts to read MICR codeline data from carrier envelope <b>50</b>. First predefined area <b>32</b> corresponds to the area in which front OCR reader <b>23</b><i>a </i>would scan for presence of a MICR codeline of a typical check such as check <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Accordingly, first predefined area <b>32</b> corresponds to an area of a typical check item where its MICR codeline would normally be found.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Rectangle <b>34</b> shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an imaginary second predefined area which is located above first predefined area <b>32</b>. Second predefined area <b>34</b> is an area which OCR reader <b>23</b><i>a </i>attempts to read MICR codeline data from a check item contained in the pocket of the carrier envelope <b>50</b>. MICR codeline data from an image of a check item in the carrier envelope <b>50</b> would normally show through clear cover <b>90</b> at a location within second predefined area <b>32</b> of the item image.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Size of second predefined area <b>34</b> is larger than size of first predefined area <b>32</b>. The relatively larger size of second predefined area <b>34</b> is needed to accommodate a check item which may be in different positions when the check item is inside carrier envelope <b>50</b>. As an example, the check item may be positioned in the pocket of carrier envelope <b>50</b> such that left edge of check item may be all the way to the left next to left pocket side <b>95</b>, or such that right edge of check item may be all the way to the right next to right pocket side <b>96</b>. In either case, MICR codeline data of the check item in the carrier envelope <b>50</b> will show through the relatively larger window formed by second predefined area <b>34</b>. Size of second predefined area <b>34</b> may vary by particular type of carrier envelope and particular size of carrier envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Front OCR reader <b>23</b><i>a </i>may scan second predefined area <b>34</b> in a number of different ways. One example way is to scan a fixed zone based upon type of the particular carrier envelope. Another example way is to iteratively attempt to read OCR starting above the first predefined area <b>32</b> by moving over a predetermined distance using predetermined step intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a captured image of the pre-encoded type of carrier envelope of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> which contains the torn check of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is illustrated. The pre-encoded carrier envelope in the image is designated with reference numeral &#x201c;<b>50</b><i>a</i>&#x201d;, and is referred to herein as &#x201c;carrier <b>50</b><i>a</i>&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, flowchart <b>100</b> depicts a method of operation of the image-based check processing system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It is conceivable that any combination of the steps shown in flowchart <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After an image of a document item which has been identified as a potentially double-fed item is received (step <b>102</b>), an attempt is made by front OCR reader <b>23</b><i>a </i>to read a MICR codeline from first defined area <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) of the item image (step <b>104</b>). A determination is then made (step <b>106</b>) as to whether the attempted read of a MICR codeline from first predefined area <b>32</b> indicates that the item image is that of a pre-encoded carrier envelope. If the determination in step <b>106</b> is affirmative (i.e., the MICR codeline read from first predefined area <b>32</b> indicates that the item image is that of a pre-encoded carrier envelope), then the process proceeds to step <b>116</b>. In step <b>116</b>, a conclusion is made that the potentially double-fed item is not a double-fed item. The item is then continued to be processed as a single-fed item (step <b>118</b>). The process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">However, if the determination made back in step <b>106</b> is negative (i.e., the MICR codeline read from first predefined area <b>32</b> indicates that the item image is not that of a pre-encoded carrier envelope), then the process proceeds to step <b>108</b>. In step <b>108</b>, a determination is made as to whether a blank codeline has been read from first predefined area <b>32</b> of the item image. A &#x201c;blank&#x201d; codeline may comprise a line which is entirely blank, or a line of only a limited number of reject characters. As examples, a &#x201c;blank&#x201d; line may have no numbers, have no symbols, or have a number of rejects from document noise.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If the determination in step <b>108</b> is negative (i.e., a blank MICR codeline has not been read from first predefined area <b>32</b>), then the process proceeds to step <b>130</b> in which a human operator is alerted of a potential double feed condition. As an example, the operator may be alerted by way of a pop-up message appearing on a display in transport operator interface <b>43</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As shown in step <b>132</b>, the physical document item corresponding to the item image may be transported to a reject pocket of the pocket device <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).

As an example, a determination may be made as to whether length of the item image is within a predetermined tolerance of a predetermined length dimension. If the determination in step <b>110</b> is negative (i.e., the dimension of the item image is not within a predetermined tolerance of a predetermined dimension), then the process proceeds to step <b>130</b> in which a human operator is alerted of a potential double feed condition.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After a determination is made as to number of rejects contained in the MICR codeline read from second predefined area <b>34</b> of the item image (step <b>152</b>), a determination is made as to whether number of rejects exceeds a predetermined number of rejects (step <b>154</b>). If the determination in step <b>154</b> is affirmative (i.e., number of rejects is greater than the predetermined number of rejects), then a conclusion is made that the MICR codeline is not valid (step <b>170</b>). However, if the determination in step <b>154</b> is negative (i.e., number of rejects is not greater than a predetermined number of rejects), then the process proceeds to step <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">After a determination is made as to number of valid E13B/CMC7 characters contained in the MICR codeline read from second predefined area <b>34</b> of the item image (step <b>156</b>), a determination is made as to whether number of valid E13B/CMC7 characters is less than a predetermined number of E13B/CMC7 characters (step <b>158</b>).

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be apparent that the above description describes a combination of a number of factors in determining whether a document item being processed along the document track <b>14</b> is a double feed. One factor is whether MICR codeline information is readable from first predefined area <b>32</b> of the item image. Another factor is whether valid MICR codeline information is readable from second predefined area <b>34</b> of the item image. Still another factor is the number of different ways of determining if a valid MICR codeline has been read from second predefined area <b>34</b> of the item image.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should further be apparent that example method described hereinabove provides an improved double feed detecting feature. This feature may be implemented by a double feed detecting algorithm which is expressed in a computer program containing executable instructions which, when executed, carry out steps of the algorithm to provide the feature. By providing an improved double feed detecting feature, involvement of human-operator time to reprocess a missed document item is reduced. This results in cost savings during operation of the image-based check processing system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should also be apparent that example method described hereinabove is performed by a computer having a memory executing one or more programs of instructions which are tangibly embodied in a program storage medium readable by the computer. A single computer associated with image-based check processing system <b>10</b> may perform example method described hereinabove. However, it is conceivable that more than one computer associated with the image-based check processing system <b>10</b> perform example method described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although the above description describes double feed detection being performed in real time, it is conceivable that double feed detection be performed in batch. As an example in the case of batch processing, controlling software for software OCR would process the image of a document item and mark suspect double feed items. It is conceivable that the controlling software for OCR performs operations to make the decision to either accept or reject the document item and direct the document item to the appropriate pocket in the pocket device <b>30</b>. A human operator would then verify item images and also possibly verify physical document items to ensure that there are no extra document items in pockets of the pocket device <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, although the above description describes double feed detection being performed in an image capture transport of a check processing system during a first pass of check processing as described hereinabove, it is conceivable that double feed detection may be performed in an encoding and sorting transport of the check processing system during a second pass of check processing.</p>
