<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">According to one embodiment, a position demodulator includes a demodulator, a phase corrector, and a position demodulating module. The demodulator demodulates a first demodulated signal and a second demodulated signal having a phase difference of 90 degrees from the first demodulated signal as a result of discrete Fourier transform operation on a read signal of a null servo pattern recorded in a servo area of a medium read out by a head. The phase corrector carries out correction to tilt respective vectors of the first demodulated signal and the second demodulated signal represented on a phase plane by a predetermined angle. The position demodulating module demodulates a positional signal for determining the position of the core of the head based on the first demodulated signal and the second demodulated signal corrected by the phase corrector.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-114160, filed May 20, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An embodiment described herein relates generally to a position demodulator and a position demodulation method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hard disk drive devices write data or the like to a recording medium using an actuator arm with a head provided to the tip of the actuator arm. The recording medium has data areas to store user data and servo areas to store data used for positioning control of the head.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such a hard disk drive device, when the head passes over a servo area, the position of the head is determined based on a signal read out from the servo area. The arm adjusts the head position based on the position determined. Thus, the head can be controlled to be located at a desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are several types of patterns recorded in the servo areas including, for example, null servo patterns, area servo patterns, and phase servo patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, a null servo pattern is provided with two blocks of different magnetization patterns. By a positional information signal read out from the two blocks, the position of the head can be determined. Because the null servo pattern only needs two blocks, less servo areas are required, and therefore, data areas are easily secured. There has been disclosed conventional technology related to such the null servo pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such the hard disk drive device, upon determining the position of the head based on positional information read out from a pattern in the servo area, it is difficult to accurately determine the position of the head using only the conventional technology. This is because it is difficult to associate a read signal with the position of the head with a smooth correspondence relation due to specifications, operational circumstances, and the like of the hard disk drive device. This applies not only to demodulation of a position using a null servo pattern, but also to demodulation using other servo patterns. Therefore, in the hard disk drive device, the read signal needs to be corrected to accurately determine the position of the head.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In general, according to one embodiment, a position demodulator comprises a demodulator, a phase corrector, and a position demodulating module. The demodulator is configured to demodulate a first demodulated signal and a second demodulated signal having a phase difference of 90 degrees from the first demodulated signal as a result of discrete Fourier transform operation on a read signal of a null servo pattern recorded in a servo area of a medium read out by a head. The phase corrector is configured to carry out correction to tilt respective vectors of the first demodulated signal and the second demodulated signal represented on a phase plane by a predetermined angle. The position demodulating module is configured to demodulate a positional signal for determining the position of the core of the head based on the first demodulated signal and the second demodulated signal corrected by the phase corrector.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A disk storage device <b>100</b> that employs a position demodulator according to an embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram of an electrical hardware configuration of the disk storage device <b>100</b> of the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a magnetic disk <b>111</b> is a disk-shaped recording medium, and is rotated by a spindle motor <b>112</b> about the rotation axis at a predetermined rotational speed. The spindle motor <b>112</b> is rotated by a motor driver <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A magnetic head <b>122</b> writes data to and reads data from the magnetic disk <b>111</b> by a recording head and a reproducing head provided therewith, respectively. The magnetic head <b>122</b> is located at the tip of an actuator arm <b>115</b>, and is moved in the radial direction of the magnetic disk <b>111</b> by a voice coil motor (VCM) <b>116</b> driven by the motor driver <b>121</b>. When the rotation of the magnetic disk <b>111</b> is stopped and the like, the magnetic head <b>122</b> is retracted on a ramp <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A head amplifier <b>124</b> amplifies a signal read out by the magnetic head <b>122</b> from the magnetic disk <b>111</b>, and outputs the signal to feed it to a read-write channel (RDC) <b>125</b>. The head amplifier <b>124</b> further amplifies a signal supplied from the RDC <b>125</b> for writing data to the magnetic disk <b>111</b>, and feeds the amplified signal to the magnetic head <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The RDC <b>125</b> carries out code modulation on data supplied from a hard disk controller (HDC) <b>131</b>, which will be described later, to be written to the magnetic disk <b>111</b>, and feeds it to the head amplifier <b>124</b>. The RDC <b>125</b> further carries out code demodulation on a signal read out from the magnetic disk <b>111</b> and fed from the head amplifier <b>124</b>, and outputs it to the HDC <b>131</b> as digital data.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A CPU <b>126</b> is connected with a static random access memory (SRAM) <b>127</b> that is a working memory, a flash read only memory (ROM) <b>128</b> that is a non-volatile memory, and a buffer RAM <b>129</b> for temporary storage. The CPU <b>126</b> controls the overall operation of the disk storage device <b>100</b> in accordance with firmware stored in advance in the flash ROM <b>128</b> and the magnetic disk <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The HDC <b>131</b> controls data exchange with a host computer (host) <b>40</b> via an I/F bus, controls the buffer RAM <b>129</b>, corrects errors in recorded data, and the like. The buffer RAM <b>129</b> is used as a cache for the data sent and received with the host computer <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The detail of the magnetic disk <b>111</b> will be explained. The magnetic disk <b>111</b> has a data area where user data is recorded and a servo area where servo information and the like is recorded. In the servo area, servo patterns extending in circular arcs in a radial direction from the rotation center are recorded. The servo pattern is the data used for positioning the magnetic head <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The magnetic disk <b>111</b> is a recording medium comprising a substrate made of metal or glass in a disk shape and a magnetic film formed thereon. To record data onto the magnetic disk <b>111</b>, a magnetic field is applied from the magnetic head <b>122</b> to a recording area where data is recorded on the magnetic disk <b>111</b> to make a magnetized state of magnetic materials on the surface thereof changed, thereby recording the data. To read out and reproduce data from the magnetic disk <b>111</b>, the magnetic head <b>122</b> is moved to a recorded area of intended reproduction on the magnetic disk <b>111</b> and the magnetized state of magnetic materials of the magnetic disk <b>111</b> is read out to reproduce the data. The recording method of the magnetic disk <b>111</b> may be either of perpendicular magnetic recording method or horizontal magnetic recording method.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment, as a method for determining the position of the magnetic head <b>122</b>, null demodulation, i.e., demodulation with a null servo pattern, is used. A servo pattern in the servo area is configured to have a preamble section, a servo mark (SM) section, a Gray code section, and a burst section. The preamble section corresponds to a leading portion of a servo pattern, and in the embodiment, it is defined as an area of 4T cycles. The burst section is an area for detecting an offset position of the magnetic head <b>122</b> from the center of a track in each track. When null demodulation is used, the burst section has two blocks (hereinafter, referred to as a null pattern). In the embodiment, the burst section is defined as an area of 8T cycles. When the cycle of the preamble section is defined as 4T and that of the burst section is defined as 8T, the frequency is doubled. Therefore, when null demodulation is used as in the disk storage device <b>100</b> of the embodiment, correction based on a difference in frequency between an initial phase of the preamble section and a null pattern in the burst section is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The burst section of the magnetic disk <b>111</b> will be described specifically. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of a pattern in a burst section of the magnetic disk <b>111</b> in the case of null demodulation. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a null pattern in two phases is formed in the burst section. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the null pattern is arranged with north poles and south poles alternately. Accordingly, accessing a null pattern by a read core of the magnetic head <b>122</b> allows reading out a signal the waveform of which changes in cycles formed by those north poles and south poles.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiment, as a null pattern of two phases, a burst A for a positional information signal PosA and a burst B for a positional information signal PosB that is shifted in phase by 90 degrees from the positional information signal PosA are recorded. More specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the interval of tracks for the burst A and the burst B is shifted by half a track. Because of this, the amplitude of waveforms is configured to be different between a signal readout from the burst A by the magnetic head <b>122</b> and a signal read out from the burst B. Therefore, in the disk storage device <b>100</b> of the embodiment, from the difference in amplitude of waveforms for signals of the burst A and the burst B, an offset position (hereinafter, also referred to as position) of the read core of the magnetic head <b>122</b> can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the disk storage device <b>100</b> of the embodiment, correction is carried out on demodulated signals obtained from discrete Fourier transform (DFT) operation on a positional information signal PosA and a positional information signal PosB recorded in a burst section, and from the demodulated signals after the correction, a positional signal (a signal that can determine an offset position) of the magnetic head <b>122</b> from the track center of a track number detected is demodulated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A configuration to demodulate position will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of a configuration to demodulate a position in the RDC <b>125</b> and the HDC <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The RDC <b>125</b> comprises a null demodulator <b>331</b>. The null demodulator <b>331</b> carries out a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) operation on positional information signals PosA and PosB that are signals of a null servo pattern recorded in the servo area of the magnetic disk <b>111</b> read out by the magnetic head <b>122</b>. The null demodulator <b>331</b> then demodulates, as a result of the DFT operation, a demodulated signal A (a first demodulated signal) and a demodulated signal B (a second demodulated signal). The demodulated signal A and the demodulated signal B have a phase difference of 90 degrees from each other. The demodulated signal A and the demodulated signal B obtained by demodulation are represented as respective vectors, each containing a sine component and a cosine component.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In conventional magnetic disk devices, a phase angle &#x3b8; can be obtained from a direction of a vector represented on a phase plane by using a sine component of the demodulated signal A as an X-coordinate and a sine component of the demodulated signal B as a Y-coordinate. An offset position of the magnetic head <b>122</b> is determined based on the phase angle &#x3b8;. The sine component of the demodulated signal A and the sine component of the demodulated signal B used for determining the offset position will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a vector represented in a phase space after assigning a sine component of the demodulated signal A on an X-coordinate and a sine component of the demodulated signal B on a Y-coordinate. In the phase space illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, plotting a sine component of the demodulated signal A and a sine component of the demodulated signal B sampled at a predetermined timing in the phase space provides a terminal <b>402</b> of a vector <b>401</b>. The extracting timing of samples is conceivable, for example, to be carried out at eight samples per 2&#x3c0; for six cycles (12&#x3c0;).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The vector <b>401</b> rotates in a counter-clockwise direction on a circle indicated by a broken line along with changes made when the magnetic head <b>122</b> is moved in the radial direction at a constant speed. The circumference of a circle <b>403</b> that the terminal <b>402</b> of the vector <b>401</b> draws holds samples of sine components of the demodulated signal A and sine components of the demodulated signal B obtained by the move of the magnetic head <b>122</b> in the radial direction. Thus, plotting the results of samples held in a phase space provides a position Lissajous figure, i.e., a Lissajous figure by head position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A position Lissajous figure is drawn as a circle illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> when the demodulated signals A and B are sinusoidal waveforms. However, when a position Lissajous figure is drawn using actually obtained the demodulated signals A and B, there are various distortions caused. For example, saturation at a peak causes distortion resulting not in a sinusoidal waveform, and thus the position Lissajous figure may not be formed in a circle as indicated in broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and may result in a deformed rectangular shape with rounded corners. Therefore, in the disk storage device <b>100</b> of the embodiment, it is determined that various types of corrections are carried out such that the demodulated signals A and B draw an appropriate position Lissajous figure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the embodiment, the concepts of various types of corrections carried out in the HDC <b>131</b> will be described with reference to position Lissajous figures. The position Lissajous figures in the followings are exemplified for the purpose of simple explanation, and thus it is not necessary to actually generate a position Lissajous figure upon carrying out the corrections of the demodulated signals A and B in the disk storage device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The HDC <b>131</b> comprises an initial-phase correcting module <b>311</b>, an azimuth correcting module <b>312</b>, a velocity correcting module <b>313</b>, and a head position demodulator <b>314</b>. When the magnetic head <b>122</b> passes over a servo area, the HDC <b>131</b> in the foregoing configuration demodulates a positional signal of the magnetic head <b>122</b> after the various types of corrections are carried out on the demodulated signals received from the RDC <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The initial-phase correcting module <b>311</b> carries out correction to tilt respective vectors of the demodulated signals A and B obtained by DFT operation represented on a phase plane by a predetermined angle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the concept of correction of the initial-phase correcting module <b>311</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when sampled on a phase plane using sine components and cosine components of the demodulated signal A, a Lissajous figure as illustrated in a chart <b>501</b> is obtained. When sampled on a phase plane using sine components and cosine components of the demodulated signal B, a Lissajous figure as illustrated in a chart <b>502</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Meanwhile, in conventional technologies, a phase angle &#x3b8; is obtained only using sine components of the demodulated signal A and sine components of the demodulated signal B as described above. However, as illustrated in the chart <b>501</b> and the chart <b>502</b>, the Lissajous figures are shaped like an ellipse and a major axis <b>503</b> of an elliptical shape in the chart <b>501</b> and a major axis <b>504</b> of an elliptical shape in the chart <b>502</b> are inclined by an angle &#x3b8;<sub>init </sub>with respect to Y-axes. Due to the angle &#x3b8;<sub>init</sub>, there is a possibility of not accurately determining the position of the magnetic head <b>122</b>. Therefore, the initial-phase correcting module <b>311</b> of the embodiment corrects the tilts before calculating a phase angle &#x3b8;.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The initial-phase correcting module <b>311</b> of the embodiment carries out correction by multiplying a rotation matrix that gives a rotation of a predetermined angle &#x3b8;<sub>init </sub>by respective vectors of the demodulated signal A and the demodulated signal B represented on a phase plane. A chart <b>505</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the demodulated signal A after the correction to rotate over the predetermined angle &#x3b8;<sub>init </sub>is carried out by the initial-phase correcting module <b>311</b>. A chart <b>506</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the demodulated signal B after the correction to rotate over the predetermined angle &#x3b8;<sub>init </sub>is carried out by the initial-phase correcting module <b>311</b>. The predetermined angle &#x3b8;<sub>init </sub>is defined as a predetermined angle to correct the tilts between the respective Lissajous figures of the demodulated signal A and the demodulated signal B and the Y-coordinate axes. Because the predetermined angle &#x3b8;<sub>init </sub>is different depending on disk storage devices and is determined by actual measurement, the explanation of a specific value is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the disk storage device <b>100</b> of the embodiment, as illustrated in a chart <b>507</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the sine components of the demodulated signal A after the correction are assigned on an X-coordinate, and the sine components of the demodulated signal B after the correction are assigned on the Y-coordinate. On the phase plane thus formed, a phase angle &#x3b8; that is after the correction is carried out by the initial-phase correcting module <b>311</b> can be obtained from the direction of a vector.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, in the embodiment, the correction to rotate by a predetermined angle &#x3b8;<sub>init </sub>is carried out on the demodulated signals A and B. Thus, demodulating a positional signal representing an offset position of the magnetic head <b>122</b> using the demodulated signals A and B after the correction is carried out allows improving the determining accuracy of positions.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It has been described that a position Lissajous figure may not form a circle under certain conditions and may be deformed to a rectangular shape with rounded corners. This deformation is caused by a ratio of a width of the read core of the magnetic head <b>122</b> to a track pitch of a servo track writer (STW). In the embodiment, Sd is defined as Sd=(width of read core)/(track pitch of STW). Position Lissajous figures based on difference in Sd will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates examples of position Lissajous figures based on difference in Sd. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref> illustrates a position Lissajous figure when Sd is 0.14. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref> illustrates a position Lissajous figure when Sd is 0.18. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(C)</figref> illustrates a position Lissajous figure when Sd is 0.22. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(A) to 6(C)</figref>, the larger the Sd is, the closer to a circle the position Lissajous figure becomes. In other words, the wider the width of the read core of the magnetic head <b>122</b> is or the narrower the track pitch of an STW is, the closer to a circle the position Lissajous figure becomes. However, as the track pitch of the STW becomes narrower, it is necessary to further improve the determining accuracy of the position of the magnetic head <b>122</b>. Therefore, the track pitch and the like of the STW are determined based on a balance between the determining accuracy of the position of the magnetic head <b>122</b> and the performance of the STW.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the embodiment, the magnetic disk <b>111</b> is divided into three zones of inner, center, and outer zones at predetermined intervals in the radial direction (in-out direction) from the rotation center. The magnetic disk <b>111</b> may be divided at any intervals according to the mode of implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The azimuth correcting module <b>312</b> then carries out correction to tilt respective vectors of the demodulated signals A and B represented on a phase plane by a different angle for respective zones from which positional information signals PosA and PosB that are origins of the demodulated signals A and B are read out, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the concept of correction of the azimuth correcting module <b>312</b>. In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, position Lissajous figures are of rectangular shapes with rounded corners. Although the position Lissajous figures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are of rectangular shapes and are different in shape from the position Lissajous figure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, this is for the simplicity of the description. In the embodiment, the azimuth correcting module <b>312</b> corrects the demodulated signals A and B after being corrected by the initial-phase correcting module <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, position Lissajous figures before the correction by the azimuth correcting module <b>312</b> are an inner position Lissajous <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 911</figref>, a center position Lissajous <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 912</figref>, and an outer position Lissajous <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 913</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the tilt of position Lissajous figure in a rectangular shape is different for each zone. For the inner zone, a position Lissajous figure is tilted at an angle &#x3b8;<sub>in </sub>from a Y-axis as indicated by an axis <b>901</b>, and for the outer zone, it is tilted at an angle &#x3b8;<sub>out </sub>from a Y-axis in an opposite direction to that of the inner zone as indicated by an axis <b>903</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Therefore, the azimuth correcting module <b>312</b> multiplies the demodulated signals A and B for the inner zone by a rotation matrix that gives a rotation of only the angle &#x3b8;<sub>in </sub>in a direction indicated by an arrow <b>902</b>. Meanwhile, the azimuth correcting module <b>312</b> multiplies the demodulated signals A and B for the outer zone by a rotation matrix that gives a rotation of only the angle &#x3b8;<sub>out </sub>in a direction indicated by an arrow <b>904</b>. Accordingly, the tilt of position Lissajous figure in a rectangular shape different for each zone is corrected. With this, the accuracy in determining the position of the magnetic head <b>122</b> can be improved. The angle &#x3b8;<sub>in </sub>and the angle &#x3b8;<sub>out </sub>are different depending on disk storage devices and are determined by actual measurement, and thus the explanation of specific values is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After the correction by the azimuth correcting module <b>312</b> is carried out, the velocity correcting module <b>313</b> then carries out correction on the corrected demodulated signals A and B.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A description will be give of changes in position Lissajous figures while the actuator arm <b>115</b> is in a seek operation. For the simplicity of the description, an example in which a position Lissajous figure forms a circle when a seek operation using the actuator arm <b>115</b> is not performed is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the disk storage device <b>100</b> of the embodiment, if a seek operation is performed using the actuator arm <b>115</b>, a position Lissajous figure forms an ellipse in response to a moving velocity of the actuator arm <b>115</b>. The shape of the ellipse changes by whether forward seek is carried out or backward seek is carried out. When a position Lissajous figure becomes elliptic, a phase angle &#x3b8; is not changed linearly, whereby the determining accuracy of positions is lowered. Therefore, the velocity correcting module <b>313</b> of the disk storage device <b>100</b> of the embodiment carries out correction to make a position Lissajous figure in an elliptic shape form a circle.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the concept of correction of the velocity correcting module <b>313</b>. A chart <b>1001</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a position Lissajous figure resulted in an elliptic shape by forward seek, and a chart <b>1002</b> illustrates a position Lissajous figure resulted in an elliptic shape by backward seek. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it is assumed that, in the case of forward seek, the position Lissajous figure is in an elliptic shape with its minor axis in a 45 degree direction, and in the case of backward seek, the position Lissajous figure is in an elliptic shape with its minor axis in a &#x2212;45 degree direction. Accordingly, in forward seek, the velocity correcting module <b>313</b> of the embodiment multiplies vectors of the demodulated signals A and B represented on a phase plane by a rotation matrix that gives rotation by 45 degrees, then multiplies the vectors by an augmented matrix that increases one-and-a-half times in an X-axis direction, and finally multiplies the vectors by a rotation matrix that gives rotation by &#x2212;45 degrees. Consequently, correction to extend in a minor axis direction is made on the position Lissajous figure of an elliptic shape, and thus the position Lissajous figure is corrected into a circle shape as illustrated in a chart <b>1003</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Meanwhile, in backward seek, carrying out a process of similar intent can also correct the position Lissajous figure into a circle shape.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The correction by the velocity correcting module <b>313</b> allows improving linearity in determining the position of the read core even when the actuator arm <b>115</b> has a moving velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The head position demodulator <b>314</b> comprises a linearity correcting module <b>321</b>, and based on the demodulated signals A and B after being corrected by the various correction methods, demodulates a positional signal of the read core of the magnetic head <b>122</b>. The head position demodulator <b>314</b> of the embodiment receives the demodulated signals A and B after being corrected, and outputs a phase angle &#x3b8; indicative of a direction of a vector formed by the demodulated signals A and B on a phase plane as a positional signal of the magnetic head <b>122</b>. This allows the position of the magnetic head <b>122</b> to be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the head position demodulator <b>314</b> carries out demodulation of position, the linearity correcting module <b>321</b> carries out correction to improve linearity of changes in position (phase angle &#x3b8;) determined as the read core based on the changes in the demodulated signals A and B. More specifically, when a position Lissajous figure is a circle, because the linearity of position (phase angle &#x3b8;) determined as the read core is high, whereby the accuracy of the position of the read core determined as a head becomes high. However, the linearity of position (phase angle &#x3b8;) determined as the read core is lowered as the position Lissajous figure becomes closer to a rectangular shape, whereby the determining accuracy of the position of the read core of the head becomes lower. Therefore, in the embodiment, correction to improve the linearity is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In conventional technologies, if a position Lissajous figure is a circle, the position (phase angle &#x3b8;) of the read core of the magnetic head <b>122</b> is calculated using a function of arctan(x). The variable x is defined as x=|demodulated signal B component|/|demodulated signal A component|when |demodulated signal B component|&#x2266;|demodulated signal A component|, and as x=|demodulated signal A component|/|demodulated signal B component|when |demodulated signal B component|&#x3e;|demodulated signal A component|. The demodulated signal A component is defined as a sine component of the demodulated signal A, and the demodulated signal B component is defined as a sine component of the demodulated signal B. However, when a position Lissajous figure is not a circle, but a rectangle, the detecting accuracy of positions becomes low if calculated by arctan(x).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Accordingly, the head position demodulator <b>314</b> of the embodiment demodulates a phase angle &#x3b8; representing the read core, i.e., the position of the read core, based on a value calculated using the following quadratic polynomial (1):

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, as the value of coefficient Gm is increased from the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of &#x2212;0.35, the curves have more concave curvatures compared with that of when arctan(x) is used, and thus it can be confirmed that the degree of linearity correction becomes large. Consequently, in the head position demodulator <b>314</b> of the embodiment, the value calculated using the expression (1) is defined as the phase angle &#x3b8; allows improving linearity in determining position compared with that of when arctan(x) is used. The coefficient G<sub>m </sub>is determined based on a shape of position Lissajous figure, more specifically, a width of the read core of the magnetic head <b>122</b> and a track pitch of an STW.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an example of position Lissajous figure represented as a subject of linearity correction.

The situation of using the above quadratic polynomial on the position Lissajous <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 1201</figref> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Upon using the quadratic polynomial (1), the demodulated signal A component and the demodulated signal B component need to be in absolute values. Furthermore, although the quadratic polynomial (1) is useful when used while x is between 0 and 1, it is not considered for when a vector representing the demodulated signals A and B on a phase plane varies between 0 and 2&#x3c0;. Therefore, in the embodiment, it is necessary to extend the quadratic polynomial (1) so that an appropriate value can be obtained depending on a situation.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the head position demodulator <b>314</b> of the embodiment, by differentiating a position calculating method in response to the domain determined, the quadratic polynomial is extended.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The linearity upon determining position using the calculating methods will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a chart illustrating linearity of when the above position calculating methods are applied to the situation represented by the position Lissajous figure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a line <b>1601</b> represents the linearity of when a coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of &#x2212;0.35, i.e., arctan(x), is applied, and a line <b>1602</b> represents the linearity of when a coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of 0.5 is applied. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, with the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of 0.5, compared with that of the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of &#x2212;0.35, values close to 1 are kept in the range of 0 to 2&#x3c0;. Accordingly, with the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of 0.5, compared with the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of &#x2212;0.35, higher linearity is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Specifically, in the position Lissajous figure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, because a straight line is drawn in a range <b>1202</b>, the sensitivity of position demodulation is low, and because an arc is drawn in a range <b>1203</b>, the sensitivity of position demodulation is high. Furthermore, the range <b>1202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> corresponds to a range <b>1301</b> on the phase plane illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and the range <b>1203</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> corresponds to a range <b>1302</b> on the phase plane illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Therefore, on the chart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>is &#x2212;0.35, the range <b>1202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> corresponds to a range <b>1603</b>, and the range <b>1203</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> corresponds to a range <b>1604</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, at places of low demodulation sensitivity such as the range <b>1202</b> of the position Lissajous figure, the linearity is low with the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of &#x2212;0.35, but with the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of 0.5, high linearity can be ensured. Moreover, even at places of high demodulation sensitivity such as the range <b>1203</b> of the position Lissajous figure, compared with that of the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of &#x2212;0.35, the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of 0.5 allows higher linearity to be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Consequently, in the situation represented by the position Lissajous figure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, that the head position demodulator <b>314</b> uses the position calculating methods indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> substituted with the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of 0.5 to demodulate the positional signal of the read core of the magnetic head <b>122</b> can determine the position with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The head position demodulator <b>314</b> of the embodiment outputs, as a positional signal of the read core of the magnetic head <b>122</b>, a phase angle &#x3b8; calculated using the quadratic polynomial with the variable x that indicates the ratio between the absolute value of the demodulated signal A component and the absolute value of the demodulated signal B component after being corrected by the above correction methods and the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>that is defined to perform correction to improve linearity. Specifically, using the position calculating method indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and using the coefficient G<sub>m </sub>appropriate for Sd allow improving the determining accuracy of positions. The coefficient G<sub>m </sub>differs depending on the above conditions and is a value determined by actual measurement, and thus an explanation about a specific value is omitted.</p>

The ordinate axis represents linearity and the abscissa axis represents coefficient G<sub>m</sub>. The smallest value out of the degrees of variation in linearity illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is defined as an optimal value. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the use of a coefficient G<sub>m </sub>that renders the least degree of variation (0.4 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) obtains the positions of the read core with high accuracy.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the use of a coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of 0.2 that renders the least degree of variation allows obtaining the positions of the read core with high accuracy.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the use of a coefficient G<sub>m </sub>of &#x2212;0.05 that renders the least degree of variation allows obtaining the positions of the read core with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 to 16</figref>, it can be perceived that the degree of variation in linearity becomes smaller as a position Lissajous figure becomes closer to a circle from a rectangle, and thus the accuracy of read core position is improved. However, it can be seen that, even when a position Lissajous figure is close to a rectangle, the linearity correction of the embodiment can make the degree of variation in linearity relatively small. Therefore, the accuracy of positions and specifications of an STW only need to be considered to determine the track pitch of the STW.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The correction to improve linearity illustrated in the linearity correcting module <b>321</b> is not restricted to when null demodulation is used, but is also applicable to other demodulation methods. For example, it can be applied to a disk storage device that determines the position of the head using area demodulation.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the embodiment, the fact that the head position demodulator <b>314</b> uses the quadratic polynomial (2) to determine the position of the magnetic head <b>122</b> can improve the accuracy of determining position.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">First, the read core of the magnetic head <b>122</b> reads out positional information signals PosA and PosB from a null servo pattern (S<b>2001</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The null demodulator <b>331</b> then carries out DFT (discrete Fourier transform) operation on the positional information signals PosA and PosB to demodulate demodulated signals A and B (S<b>2002</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thereafter, the initial-phase correcting module <b>311</b> carries out correction to tilt respective vectors of the demodulated signals A and B represented on a phase plane by a predetermined angle (S<b>2003</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The azimuth correcting module <b>312</b> then carries out correction to tilt respective vectors of the demodulated signals A and B represented on a phase plane by an angle different for each zone that contains the positional information signals PosA and PosB that are origins of the demodulated signals A and B, respectively (S<b>2004</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The velocity correcting module <b>313</b> then carries out correction to make a position Lissajous figure in an elliptic shape represented by the demodulated signals A and B form a circle (S<b>2005</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The head position demodulator <b>314</b> then demodulate a positional signal while improving the linearity of phase angle of the read core that is determined based on the demodulated signals A and B using the linearity correcting module <b>321</b> (S<b>2006</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">By the process as described above, in the disk storage device <b>100</b> of the embodiment, the positional signal is demodulated after the various corrections are carried out in the HDC <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the embodiment, while the corrections are carried out in the order of the initial phase correction, the azimuth correction, the velocity correction, and the linearity correction, the order of corrections is not restricted and may be carried out in no particular order. Furthermore, it is not necessary to carry out all of the initial phase correction, the azimuth correction, the velocity correction, and the linearity correction, and as long as one or more of the corrections are carried out, the determining accuracy of offset position of the magnetic head <b>122</b> can be improved. Moreover, the correction may be combined with other corrections.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">According to the embodiment, the disk storage device <b>100</b> corrects the demodulated signals A and B using at least one of the above correction methods. This improves accuracy in the positioning of the magnetic head <b>122</b>.</p>
