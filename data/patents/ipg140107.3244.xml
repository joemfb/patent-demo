<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a rear radiation type solid-state imaging device, a method of manufacturing the solid-state imaging device, and an electronic apparatus using the solid-state imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the related art, a CCD type solid-state imaging device and a CMOS type solid-state imaging device have been proposed as solid-state imaging devices that are used in digital cameras or video cameras. In such solid-state imaging devices, a light receiving section is formed in each of a plurality of pixels formed in a two-dimensional matrix and a signal charge is generated in the light receiving section in accordance with the amount of light received. Further, the signal charge generated in the light receiving section is transferred and amplified, thereby acquiring an image signal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Common solid-state imaging devices of the related art are surface type solid-state imaging devices that are equipped with a substrate with electrodes or wires on the surface and radiate light from above. For example, in surface type and CMOS type solid-state imaging devices, photodiodes (PD) of the light receiving sections of the pixels are formed inside the silicon substrate and a plurality of wire layers are formed on the silicon substrate through an interlayer insulating film. Further, a color filter and an on-chip lens are disposed above the wire layers. In the surface type solid-state imaging device, light travels into the photodiodes of the light receiving section through the color filter and the wire layers from the on-chip lens.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, there is a problem in that as the solid-state imaging device is miniaturized, the pitches of the wires decrease while the wire layers become multi-layered, such that the distances between the light receiving sections on the on-chip lens and the silicon substrate increase. With the multi-layering of the wire layers, a portion of incident light traveling at an angle is blocked by the wire layers and does not easily reach the light receiving sections on the silicon substrate, such that a phenomenon, such as shading, occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, a rear radiation type solid-state imaging device that radiates light from a side opposite to the side where the wire layers are formed on the substrate has been proposed (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 6-283702). In the rear radiation type solid-state imaging device, since a wire layer or a circuit device is not disposed at the side from which light is radiated, it is possible to achieve an effective aperture ratio of 1000 of a light receiving section formed on a substrate whereby incident light travels into the light receiving section without reflecting from a wire layer. Therefore, there are great expectations of considerably improving sensitivity and eliminating shading in the rear radiation type solid-state imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the rear radiation type solid-state imaging device, it may be preferable to improve the maximum cumulative dosage (Quantity of saturated charges; Qs) of photoelectric-converted charge in the photodiode or widen the area of the photodiode in the depth direction of the substrate, in order to improve the dynamic range, which is the basic performance. However, when the photodiode is expanded close to the light receiving surface, the distance from the output terminal increases, such that it is difficult to completely transfer the charges accumulated in the photodiode, which causes a residual image. As an improvement plan, a solid-state imaging device equipped with a vertical transistor having a reading electrode (trench type electrode) corresponding to a photodiode has been proposed (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-281499 and PCT Japanese Translation Patent Publication No. 2007-531254).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional configuration of a solid-state imaging device equipped with a vertical transistor of the related art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, two layers of photodiodes PD<b>1</b> and PD<b>2</b> are formed in the depth direction of a substrate <b>101</b>. Vertical gate electrodes <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> are formed deep in contact with the photodiodes PD<b>1</b> and PD<b>2</b>, respectively. The vertical gate electrodes <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> are formed by embedding an electrode material in trench portions formed in desired depths in the substrate <b>101</b> through a gate insulating film <b>102</b>. Floating diffusion portions FD<b>1</b> and FD<b>2</b> are formed at the areas adjacent to the vertical gate electrodes <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the solid-state imaging device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, signal charges accumulated in the photodiodes PD<b>1</b> and PD<b>2</b> are transferred to the floating diffusion portions FD<b>1</b> and FD<b>2</b>, respectively, by applying a desired voltage to the vertical gate electrodes <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>. In this configuration, it is possible to implement a configuration that can transfer signal charges accumulated in the photodiodes PD<b>1</b> and PD<b>2</b> formed in different depths by changing the depths of the trench portions formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. However, the configuration that changes the depths of the trench portions in the same substrate is difficult implement by a one-time lithography process and etching process, such that it is necessary to repeat the process of forming the vertical gate electrodes <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> several times. Therefore, considering non-uniformity of the depths of the trench portions or non-uniformity of the process, such as non-uniformity in diffusion of ion injection when forming the photodiodes, it is not practical to design a pixel that can transfer a photoelectric-converted signal charge.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It may be considered to remove the process non-uniformity by applying a vertical transistor composed of vertical gate electrodes formed through a substrate (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-258316).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional configuration of a solid-state imaging device <b>105</b> including a vertical gate electrode formed through a substrate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a solid-state imaging device <b>105</b> includes a vertical gate electrode <b>108</b> that is vertically formed through the horizontal surface of a substrate <b>106</b>. The vertical gate electrode <b>108</b> is formed by forming a through-hole through the substrate <b>106</b> and embedding an electrode material through a gate insulating film <b>107</b>. In the solid-state imaging device <b>105</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a signal charge of a photodiode PD formed deep in the depth direction of the substrate <b>106</b> can be read out with a floating diffusion portion FD formed opposite to a light receiving side of the substrate <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, when the vertical gate electrode <b>108</b> is formed through the substrate <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the deep portion of the substrate <b>106</b> is damaged by backflow of an etchant when forming the through-hole from the surface side to the rear surface side of the substrate <b>106</b>. Accordingly, there is a problem on the rear surface side of the substrate <b>106</b> in that a carrier is generated at the corners (surrounded by dotted lines &#x2018;a&#x2019;) continuing from the inner circumferential surface of the end of the through-hole to the rear surface side of the substrate, and a noise is generated by the mixing of the carrier with a carrier (signal) created by photoelectric conversion, such that so-called white points increase.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is desirable to provide a solid-state imaging device with the generation of white points reduced due to the reduction of process non-uniformity. Further, it is desirable to provide an electric device using the solid-state imaging device. A solid-state imaging device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes a substrate, a through-hole formed through the substrate, a vertical gate electrode formed in the through-hole, and a charge fixing film.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A photoelectric conversion unit generating signal charges in accordance with the amount of received light is formed in the substrate. The through-hole is formed from a front surface side through a rear surface side of the substrate. The vertical gate electrode causes a reading-out portion to read out the signal charges generated by the photoelectric conversion unit and is formed through a gate insulating film in the through-hole. The charge fixing film is implemented by a film that is formed to cover a portion of the inner circumferential surface of the through-hole at the rear surface side of the substrate while covering the rear surface side of the substrate and has negative fixed charges.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the solid-state imaging device according to the embodiment of the disclosure, it is possible to cause a charge reading-out portion formed at the surface side to read out the signal charges accumulated at a deep position, at the center portion of the photoelectric conversion unit formed in the depth direction of the substrate, by forming a vertical gate electrode in the through-hole. Further, the rear surface side of the substrate and a portion of the inner circumferential surface of the through-hole are coated with the charge fixing film that is implemented by a film having negative fixed charges. Therefore, it is possible to restrain dark current from being generated at the rear surface side of the substrate while absorbing carriers due to a defect of the substrate which is generated at a deep position of the through-hole with the charge fixing film.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A method of manufacturing a solid-state imaging device according to another embodiment of the disclosure first forms a hole at a desired depth across the rear surface side from the surface of a substrate. Next, a vertical gate electrode that causes a reading-out portion formed at the surface side of the substrate to read out the signal charges accumulated in the photoelectric conversion unit by embedding an electrode material into the hole through a gate insulating film is formed. Next, a wire layer where a plurality of layers of wires is stacked is formed on the surface of the substrate through an interlayer insulating film. Next, the substrate is turned over after bonding a support substrate onto the wire layer. Next, the gate insulating film formed in the through-hole at a predetermined depth is removed while forming the through-hole by reducing the thickness of the substrate until the hole passes through the rear surface side of the substrate. Next, a charge fixing film having negative fixed charges covering the entire rear surface of the substrate is formed while filling the through-hole with the gate insulating film removed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the method of manufacturing a solid-state imaging device according to the embodiment of the disclosure, the bottom of a hole formed at the substrate passes the rear surface side of the substrate and becomes a through-hole by reducing the size of the substrate. Further, the gate insulating film formed in the through-hole is removed at a predetermined depth and the charge fixing film having negative fixed charges is embedded in the removed portion. Therefore, since the inner circumferential surface of the through-hole at the rear surface side of the substrate is coated with the charge fixing film, abnormal carriers due to a defect of the substrate which is generated at the bottom of the hole when forming the hole are absorbed into the charge fixing film and white points can be prevented from being generated. Further, the charge fixing film is formed throughout the rear surface of the substrate. Therefore, dark current that is generated at the interface of the substrate is restrained.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An electronic apparatus according to still another embodiment of the present disclosure includes an optical lens, a solid-state imaging device into which light condensed in the optical lens travels, and a signal processing circuit that processes an output signal that is output from the solid-state imaging device. Further, the solid-state imaging device includes a substrate, a through-hole formed through the substrate, a vertical gate electrode formed in the through-hole, and a charge fixing film. A photoelectric conversion unit generating signal charges in accordance with the amount of received light is formed in the substrate. The through-hole is formed through the rear surface side from the surface of the substrate. The vertical gate electrode causes a reading-out portion to read out the signal charges generated by the photoelectric conversion unit and is formed through a gate insulating film in the through-hole. The charge fixing film is implemented by a film that is formed to cover a portion of the inner circumferential surface of the through-hole at the rear surface side of the substrate while coating the rear surface side of the substrate and has negative fixed charges.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, non-uniformity in processes is reduced and white points are prevented from being generated, in a rear side radiation type solid-state imaging device that increases the quantity of saturated charges. Further, an electronic apparatus that improves image quality is achieved by using the solid-state imaging device.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">1-2. Configuration of Main Part</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional configuration view of the main part of the solid-state imaging device according to the embodiment. The solid-state imaging device <b>1</b> according to the embodiment includes a plurality of photoelectric conversion units, a substrate <b>12</b> where pixel transistors including a vertical transistor Tra and a surface type transistor Trb are formed, a wire layer <b>25</b>, and a support substrate <b>30</b>. Further, a charge fixing layer <b>17</b>, a light shield film <b>18</b>, a planarizing film <b>19</b>, a color filter layer <b>20</b>, and an on-chip lens <b>21</b> are provided on the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The substrate <b>12</b> is implemented by a semiconductor substrate made of a first conduction type silicon (n-type in the embodiment) and a second conduction type well area <b>13</b> (p-type in the embodiment) is formed in a predetermined area of the substrate <b>12</b>. A plurality of pixels that is each composed of a photoelectric conversion unit implemented by a photodiode PD and a plurality of pixel transistors are formed in a 2-dimensional matrix in the well area <b>13</b> of the substrate <b>12</b>. In the embodiment, the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b> is a light receiving surface and the surface side of the substrate <b>12</b> is a circuit forming surface where a reading-out circuit is formed. That is, in the embodiment, light travels inside through the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The photodiode PD of the photoelectric conversion unit is composed of p-type semiconductor areas <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> that restrain dark current generated at the surface side and the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b> and an n-type semiconductor area <b>14</b> that is a charge accumulation area formed between the p-type semiconductor areas <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>. The p-type semiconductor areas <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> that restrain dark current are formed with higher density than the concentration of an impurity of the well area <b>13</b>. In the embodiment, the main photodiode PD is formed by pn-bonding implemented on the bonding surface of the p-type semiconductor areas <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> and the n-type semiconductor area <b>14</b> that defines the charge accumulation area.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A signal charge according to the amount of light traveling into the substrate <b>12</b> is generated and accumulated in the n-type semiconductor area <b>14</b> that is the charge accumulation area, in the photodiode PD. Further, electrons that cause the dark current generated on the interface of the substrate <b>12</b> are absorbed into holes, which are a plurality of carriers of the p-type semiconductor areas <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, thereby restraining the dark current.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, the photodiode PD is surrounded by a pixel separation area that is defined by the high-density p-type semiconductor area <b>35</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the signal charges, which are generated from the photodiode PD and accumulated, from moving to another pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The pixel transistor of a unit pixel is implemented by an n-channel MOS transistor and composed of three transistors, a transfer transistor, a reset transistor, and an amplification transistor, or four transistors, including a selection transistor. The transfer transistor is implemented by a vertical transistor Tra while the other transistors are implemented by surface type transistors Trb. One vertical transistor Tra for the transfer transistor, and one surface type transistor Trb of any one for the reset transistor, the amplification transistor, or the selection transistor are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The vertical transistor Tra is composed of a vertical gate electrode <b>28</b> disposed adjacent to the photodiode PD and a floating diffusion area FD that is a charge reading-out portion, formed on the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b> which is adjacent to the vertical gate electrode <b>28</b>. The vertical gate electrode <b>28</b> is composed of an embedded portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>formed in a through-hole <b>31</b> formed through the substrate <b>12</b> and an extending portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>that extends to the surface side of the substrate. The embedded portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>is longitudinally formed with respect to the horizontal surface of the substrate <b>12</b>, by embedding an electrode material in the through-hole <b>31</b> through a gate insulating film <b>24</b>. Further, the extending portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>is formed through the gate insulating film <b>24</b> on the surface of the substrate <b>12</b>, connected to the embedded portion <b>28</b><i>a</i>. Further, the vertical gate electrode <b>28</b> is formed, with the embedded portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>in contact with the n-type semiconductor area <b>14</b> that is a charge accumulation area. The through-hole <b>31</b> is open vertically through the horizontal surface of the substrate <b>12</b> and the inner circumferential surface of the through-hole <b>31</b> at the end portion of the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b> is covered with a charge fixing film <b>17</b>, which is described below. The floating diffusion area FD is formed at the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b> and defined by an n-type semiconductor area having higher density than the n-type semiconductor area <b>14</b> of the charge accumulation area.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, a channel-formed layer <b>22</b> is formed along the vertical gate electrode <b>28</b> from the photodiode PD to the floating diffusion area FD of the substrate <b>12</b>, in the vertical transistor Tra. The channel-formed layer <b>22</b> is formed in the n-type semiconductor area having higher density than the n-type semiconductor area <b>14</b> of the charge accumulation area. Further, a p-type semiconductor area <b>23</b> is formed in the area between the vertical gate electrode <b>28</b> and the channel-formed layer <b>22</b>. The p-type semiconductor area <b>23</b> has a function of removing the dark current generated from the interface of the through-hole <b>31</b> or the electrons that cause white points by re-bonding the electrons to the holes that are a plurality of carriers of the p-type semiconductor area.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A channel is formed on the channel-formed layer <b>22</b> by applying a desired voltage to the vertical gate electrode <b>28</b>, in the vertical transistor Tra. Accordingly, the signal charges accumulated in the n-type semiconductor area <b>14</b> that is the charge accumulation area are effectively transferred to the floating diffusion area FD through the channel formed along the vertical gate electrode <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The surface type transistor Trb is composed of source/drain areas <b>29</b> and a surface type gate electrode <b>32</b> formed between the source/drain areas <b>29</b>. The source/drain areas <b>29</b> are implemented by n-type semiconductor areas having higher density than, for example, the n-type semiconductor area <b>14</b> that is a charge accumulation area, formed at the surface side of the substrate <b>12</b>. The source/drain areas <b>29</b> of the surface type transistor Trb for the reset transistor, the amplification transistor, or the selection transistor are implemented mutually with the desired source/drain areas of another surface type transistor. The signal charge read out from the floating diffusion area FD by the vertical transistor Tra is output to a signal wire formed on the sire layer <b>25</b>, as a pixel signal, through the surface type transistor Trb.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Insulating materials, such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a high-dielectric film (High-k film), or a film having negative fixed charges, may be used as the material of the gate insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As the high-dielectric film, hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), tantalum oxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), praseodymium oxide (PrOx), titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), hafnia silicate (HfSiO), yttrium oxide (Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogenized hafnium aluminate (HfAlON) or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As the film having negative fixing charges, for example, a hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>) film, an aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) film, a zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) film, a tantalum oxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) film, or a titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) film may be used. As method of forming the film, for example, chemical vapor deposition, spattering, and atomic layer vapor deposition may be used. When the atomic layer vapor deposition is used, it is very suitable for simultaneously forming a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film having about a 1 nm thickness that reduces the interface state while forming the film. Further, as a material other than the materials described above, lanthanum oxide (La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), praseodymium oxide (Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>), neodymium oxide (Nd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), promethium oxide (Pm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) or the like may be used. Further, as the materials, samarium oxide (Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), europium oxide (Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), gadolinium oxide (Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), terbium oxide (Tb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), dysprosium oxide (Dy<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), or the like may be used. Further, as the material, holmium oxide (Ho<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), thulium oxide (Tm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), ytterbium oxide (Yb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), lutetium oxide (Lu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), yttrium oxide (Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), or the like may be used. Further, the film having negative fixed charges may be a hafnium nitride film, an aluminum nitride film, a hafnium oxynitride film, or an aluminum oxynitride film.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, silicon (Si) or nitrogen (N) may be added to the films within a range that does not deteriorate insulation, as the film having negative fixed charges. The concentration is appropriately determined within a range that does not deteriorate insulation of the film. It is possible to increase thermal resistance of the film or the performance of ion injection prevention in a process by adding silicon (Si) or nitrogen (N) as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Transfer efficiency is deteriorated when a high-dielectric film or a film having negative fixed charges is used as the gate insulating film <b>24</b>, and there is an advantage in that the process can be shortened as compared with when a silicon-based insulating material is used. In the embodiment, an example of using a silicon oxide film as the gate insulating film <b>24</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A conductive material, such as polysilicon, phosphorous doped amorphous silicon (PDAS), or metal may be used as the material of the vertical gate electrode <b>28</b> and the surface type gate electrode <b>32</b>, and may be selected, according to the material of the gate insulating material. For example, when a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, or a film having negative fixed charges is used, polysilicon, PDAS or the like is used, when a High-K film is used, polysilicon, PDAS, metal or the like is used. Further, whether to use polysilicon or PDAS depends on the manufacturing process. Further, polysilicon or PDAS may be used for the High-K film, but high performance may not be achieved for a work function.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The wire layer <b>25</b> is formed at the surface side opposite to the light incidence side of the substrate <b>12</b> and composed of a plurality of wires <b>1</b>M to <b>3</b>M stacked in a plurality of layers (three layers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) through the interlayer insulating film <b>26</b>. The desired wires or the wires <b>1</b>M to <b>3</b>M and the pixel transistor implemented by the vertical transistor Tra or the surface type transistor Trb are connected by a contact portion <b>27</b>. Accordingly, the pixel transistors of the pixels are driven from the wire layer <b>25</b>. As the material of the wires <b>1</b>M to <b>3</b>M of the wire layer <b>25</b>, a metal material, such as aluminum (Al) or copper (Cu) may be used. Further, as the material of the contact portion <b>27</b>, a metal material, such as tungsten or copper, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The support substrate <b>30</b> is implemented, for example, by a silicon substrate, and bonded on the wire layer <b>25</b>. The support substrate <b>30</b> is bonded on the wire layer in the manufacturing process and provided to improve the strength of the substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The charge fixing film <b>17</b> is made of a material having negative fixed charges and formed throughout the rear surface that is the light incidence side of the substrate <b>12</b>. Further, the charge fixing film <b>17</b> is embedded at a predetermined depth in the through-hole <b>31</b> to coat the inner circumferential surface of the end of the through-hole <b>31</b> at the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b> while being formed at the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b>. Since the charge fixing film <b>17</b> is made of a material having negative fixed charges, the hole accumulation state is strengthened at the corner of the substrate <b>12</b>, including the inner circumferential surface of the end of the through-hole <b>31</b> and the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b>. Therefore, dark current that is generated at the interface of the substrate is restrained and dark current that is abnormally generated by a defect generated at the inner circumferential surface of the end of the through-hole <b>31</b> or at the corner of the substrate <b>12</b> is restrained.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The charge fixing film <b>17</b> may be made of the same material as the film having negative fixed charges that can be used for the gate insulating film <b>24</b>. The charge fixing film <b>17</b> is a film provided to prevent dark current that is generated at the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b> and at the inner circumferential surface of the end of the through-hole <b>31</b> at the rear surface side of the substrate <b>12</b> and is preferably made of a material that can achieve a strong pinning effect.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It is preferable that the embedded depth in the through-hole <b>31</b> of the charge fixing film <b>17</b>, that is, the depth from the rear surface of the substrate <b>12</b> of the charge fixing film <b>17</b> formed in the through-hole <b>31</b> is determined in order not to cross the channel formed adjacent to the n-type semiconductor area <b>14</b> of the charge accumulation area. When charges are transferred by applying a desired voltage to the vertical gate electrode <b>28</b>, a hole is excited in the area adjacent to the charge fixing film <b>17</b>, such that an n-type channel is not easily formed on the channel-formed layer <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Therefore, the formed area in the through-hole <b>31</b> of the charge fixing film <b>17</b> is determined such that a channel that is necessary for transferring charges is formed in the depth direction of the substrate <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The color filter layer <b>20</b> is formed on the planarizing film <b>19</b>, corresponding to each of the pixels. The color filter layer <b>20</b> selectively transmits light, such as green, red, blue, cyan, yellow, black, or white light, for the pixels.

Therefore, it is possible to avoid the contact between the embedded portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>and the substrate <b>12</b> by removing the end of the embedded portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>simultaneously with removing the gate insulating film <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As described above, this can be applied to the embodiment even if the bottom of the embedded portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>is recessed or protruding, with respect to the rear surface of the substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The charge fixing film <b>17</b> is formed in one layer, but it may be formed by stacking a plurality of kinds of films having negative fixed charges.
