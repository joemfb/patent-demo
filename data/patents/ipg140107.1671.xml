<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/556,527, filed Nov. 7, 2011. All of the subject matter disclosed by U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/556,527 is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the sport of archery it is well known to provide a so-called nock at the rear end of the arrow, which, in essence is a slot, or other means, to engage the bowstring of a bow during the draw. It is also well known that in order to perform a good aim and subsequent shot of the arrow the nock should be placed on the bow string at a point close to the center of the bowstring and that said point should also be aligned horizontally with a point at which the arrow is supported at the center of the bow. In order to attain such alignment, it is known to provide a so-called center nock attached to the center of the bowstring, which may engage the rear end of the arrow, while it is being driven by the bowstring toward the target.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current nocks in the marketplace may include flat, half-moon or slotted nocks that are not versatile, in that, they may need to be placed in a specific orientation, namely, in a specific orientation with respect to an arrow's vanes or fletching. As an example, aligning the arrow according to the vanes in a wrong position may not allow the nock to effectively engage the bowstring. That is, for example, a groove in the nock may not lie along the bowstring properly. Also, flat nocks (e.g., those without noticeable grooves and/or slots) may allow the user to engage the arrow with the bowstring in any desired alignment; however, they do not properly align the vanes in an effective position each time the arrow is drawn. Thus, a nock that can provide effective alignment of the arrow on the bowstring, while providing versatility of the flat nock may be desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is provided an archery-based system wherein a nock can comprise more than one position for engaging the bowstring. Such a nock may take advantage of a flat nock's versatility, for example, and/or effective alignment provided by a notched nock. Such a nock may be oriented in alignment with any suitable arrangement of the arrow's fletching, for example, and may provide a way to center the arrow in contact with the bowstring.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one implementation of an arrow nock device, the nock device can comprise a top portion that comprises a top surface. Further, the top portion can comprise at least a first string guide impression and a second string guide impression. In this implementation, respective string guide impressions can be symmetrically disposed on the top surface, with respect to each other. Additionally, the first string guide impression may be disposed at a first location on the top surface, and the second string guide impression can be disposed at a second location on the top surface. The first and second locations maybe disposed at opposite ends of a bisecting line or the top surface. The first string guide impression can also be configured to receive a first part of a bowstring, and the second string guide impression can be configured to receive a second part of the bowstring.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a component diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example implementation <b>100</b> of a nock. In this implementation <b>100</b>, the nock <b>10</b> comprises a slotted portion <b>12</b> and a shaft engagement portion <b>14</b>. As one example, a bowstring of a bow (e.g., long bow, compound bow, recurve bow, crossbow, etc.) may engage the slotted portion <b>12</b> of the nock <b>10</b>, where the bowstring may suitably fit into the opening of the slotted portion <b>12</b>. Further, in this example, the shaft engagement portion <b>14</b> may be configured to suitably fit into an end (e.g., a rear, or opposite end from the point of the arrow) of an arrow shaft (not shown). Typically, the shaft engagement portion <b>14</b> can be held in place in the end of the arrow shaft by a pressure fit, such that the shaft end is configured to snugly fit the shaft engagement portion <b>14</b>. Further, in one implementation, the shaft engagement portion <b>14</b> may fitted in the end of the arrow shaft and held in place by an application of glue.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this implementation <b>100</b>, the slotted portion <b>12</b> of the nock <b>10</b> may merely allow for two orientations of the arrow against the bowstring. That is, for example, in a first orientation (e.g., top of arrow up) the fletching vanes of the arrow may be aligned in a first position, and in a second orientation (e.g., top of arrow down) the fletching vanes of the arrow may be aligned in a second position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As an illustrative example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are component diagrams illustrating a rear perspective view of example implementations <b>400</b>, <b>450</b> of a portion of an arrow. In the example implementation <b>400</b>, an arrow shaft <b>40</b> comprises an alignment groove/slot <b>44</b> (e.g., comprised on the nock), which is oriented in an up position. In this position, the fletching vanes <b>42</b> attached to the arrow shaft <b>40</b> can be aligned in the first position, for example, where vane <b>42</b><i>b </i>protrudes to the right at approximately ninety degrees from the orientation of the groove <b>44</b>, and vanes <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>c </i>protrude to the left at approximately thirty degrees and one-hundred and fifty degrees, respectively, from the orientation of the groove <b>44</b> (e.g., respective vanes aligned approximately one-hundred and twenty degrees apart).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the example implementation <b>450</b>, the arrow shaft <b>40</b> may be rotated one-hundred and eighty degree (e.g., flipped over), where the alignment groove <b>44</b> is oriented in a down position. In this implementation <b>450</b>, the respective alignment of the vanes <b>42</b> has changed to a second position, placing them in an opposite position relative to the up orientation of the example implementation <b>400</b>. In this way, for example, the dual orientation of the slotted nock may accommodate both right-handed and left-handed vertical bow shooters. The slotted nock can accommodate merely one appropriate position on a crossbow barrel, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, where, in the example implementation <b>480</b>, the vane <b>42</b><i>b </i>may be disposed in a barrel slot of the crossbow (e.g., proper operational position). In this example implementation <b>480</b>, placing either vane <b>42</b><i>a </i>or <b>42</b><i>b </i>in the downward position (e.g., in the barrel slot) may not allow for proper alignment of the groove <b>44</b> with a crossbow bowstring. The slotted nock is merely limited to these two orientations, for example, where merely one orientation (e.g., <b>400</b>) may be used in a crossbow.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a component diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example implementation <b>200</b> of a nock. The example implementation <b>200</b> comprises a half-moon style nock <b>20</b>. The nock <b>20</b> comprises a grooved portion <b>22</b> and a shaft engagement portion <b>24</b>. As one example, a bowstring of a bow may engage the grooved portion <b>22</b> of the nock <b>20</b>, where the groove of the grooved portion <b>22</b> can accommodate a bowstring, for example, and align the bowstring at the center of the groove. Further, in this example, the shaft engagement portion <b>24</b> may be configured to suitably fit into an end of an arrow shaft (not shown). The shaft engagement portion <b>24</b> may be pressure fit into the end of the arrow shaft, such that the shaft end is configured to snugly fit the shaft engagement portion <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Like the slotted nock <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the half-moon nock <b>20</b> may merely allow for two orientations of the arrow against the bowstring. That is, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, a groove <b>44</b> at the back end of the arrow shaft <b>40</b> (e.g., comprising a half-moon nock) may merely allow the arrow to orient in an up position, as in the example implementation <b>400</b>, or a down position, as in example implementation <b>450</b>. Much like the slotted nock <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for example, the half-moon nock allows the arrow fletching vanes to be oriented to accommodate both a right-handed and a left-handed handed bow shooter, and/or accommodate an appropriate position on a crossbow barrel, but does not allow for alternate orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a component diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example implementation <b>300</b> of a nock. In the example implementation <b>300</b>, a flat nock <b>30</b> does not comprise an obvious slot or groove, but merely comprises a flat portion <b>32</b> and a shaft engagement portion <b>34</b>. In this implementation, for example, a user may engage the bowstring to the flat portion <b>32</b> of the flat nock <b>30</b> at any suitable location on the flat portion <b>32</b>. Further, in this example, the shaft engagement portion <b>34</b> may be configured to suitably fit into an end of an arrow shaft (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As one example, unlike the slotted nock <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and/or the half-moon nock <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a flat nock <b>30</b> may allow various orientations of the arrow against the bowstring, merely dependent upon how the user decides to align the nock <b>30</b> on the bowstring. However, the configuration of the flat portion <b>32</b> of the flat nock <b>10</b> may not provide for a way of appropriately centering the bowstring on the flat portion <b>32</b>, as is found with the slotted nock <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the half-moon nock <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. That is, for example, while the orientation of the flat nock <b>30</b> is not limited by a slot or groove, thereby allowing various alignments of the arrow's fletching vanes, the center alignment of the bowstring on the nock cannot be assured.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref> illustrate one of more example implementations of an alternate nock device <b>50</b>.

In this implementation, the third location and the second location can be disposed at opposite ends of a second bisecting line <b>70</b><i>b </i>of the top surface <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one implementation, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6C</figref>, and <b>6</b>D, a fifth string guide impression <b>60</b><i>e </i>can be configured to receive the first part of the bowstring, and a sixth string guide impression <b>60</b><i>f </i>can be configured to receive the second part of the bowstring.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another implementation, a seventh <b>60</b><i>g </i>and eighth <b>60</b><i>h </i>string guide impression can receive the first and second part of the bowstring, respectively, where the seventh <b>60</b><i>g </i>and eighth <b>60</b><i>h </i>string guide impressions are disposed at a seventh and eighth location, respectively, on the top surface <b>64</b>, at opposite ends of a fourth bisecting line <b>70</b><i>d</i>. It will be understood that the systems, described herein, are not limited to the example implementations described above. It is anticipated that those skilled in the art may devise alternate arrangements for the string guide impressions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, while implementations of up to four pairs of string guide impressions have been described above, utilizing symmetrical spacings of approximately one-hundred and eighty degrees, ninety degrees, sixty degrees, and forty-five degrees apart, other orientations are anticipated to be within the scope of the described systems. As one example, the top portion <b>52</b> may comprise five or more pairs of string guide impressions arranged in an orientation to accommodate a particular arrangement of fletching vanes and/or shooting arrangements (e.g., left-handed, right handed, crossbow, longbow, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one implementation, the string guide impressions may be arranged in accordance with an arrangement of the fletching vanes of the arrow, for example, configured to accommodate the number and arrangement of vanes on the arrow (e.g., two, three, four, or more). That is, for example, when the nock device is attached to the arrow, a center line of a string guide impression <b>60</b> may be offset from a center line (measured along the length of the arrow) of one or the fletching vanes <b>42</b>. As an illustrative example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates an example implementation of an arrangement of a portion of an arrow. In this implementation, an alignment of the fletching vane <b>42</b><i>c </i>can be offset from the center line <b>72</b> of the string guide impression <b>60</b><i>a </i>(e.g., by thirty degrees). Further, in this implementation, the alignment of the fletching vane <b>42</b><i>b </i>may be offset (e.g., by ninety degrees) from the center line <b>72</b> of the string guide impression <b>60</b><i>a </i>(e.g., and by thirty degrees from the center line or string guide impression <b>60</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As another illustrative example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, when using an arrow comprises merely three fletching vanes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>, <b>42</b><i>c</i>, the nock device implemented can comprise three pairs of symmetrically aligned string guide impressions <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<b>60</b><i>f </i>(e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>). In this example implementation, an arrangement of the impressions <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<b>60</b><i>f </i>can be configured to mitigate interference of the fletching vanes <b>42</b><i>a</i>-<b>42</b><i>c </i>with the structure of the bow, and/or accommodate the barrel of a crossbow. In order to mitigate interference of the vanes with the bow structure and/or accommodate a crossbow, the impressions <b>60</b> may be aligned when the nock device is inserted into the arrow shaft in an orientation (e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>) that allows the vane(s) to pass over the riser (e.g., for a bow), and/or to be inserted into a barrel (e.g., for a crossbow), appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the example implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the center line <b>72</b> of the string guide impression <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>may comprise a centrally bisecting line on the top surface <b>64</b> of the top portion <b>52</b> of the nock device. Further, as one example, a user of the nock device may aligned the bowstring (e.g., of a bow and/or crossbow) along the center line <b>72</b> of the string guide impression <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b</i>. In this example, a vertical bow, bowstring aligned in such a manner (e.g., for a left-handed archer) may allow the fletching vanes <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>c </i>to appropriately clear a vertical riser of the bow when the bowstring is released (e.g., thereby shooting the arrow). Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, a crossbow, bowstring aligned along the center line <b>72</b> in such a manner may allow the fletching vane <b>42</b><i>b </i>to be appropriately engaged (e.g., inserted down into) a barrel slot of the barrel of the crossbow; thereby allowing the arrow to be appropriately shot from the crossbow.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As another example, an arrow comprising three vanes (e.g., <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>, <b>42</b><i>c</i>), disposed one-hundred and twenty degrees apart from each other around the arrow shaft, may allow for three nocking positions (e.g., comprising six string guide impressions) on a bowstring of a bow and/or on the crossbow barrel. Further, for example, an arrow comprising two vanes, disposed one-hundred and eighty degrees apart, may utilize a nock device comprising four string guide impressions (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) at ninety degree (e.g., allowing for two nocking positions, one for a bow the other for a crossbow). Additionally, as an example, an arrow comprising four vanes may utilize a nock device comprising eight string guide impressions (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>), disposed at forty-five degrees apart (e.g., allowing for four nocking positions, two for a bow, two for a crossbow); and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref>, in one implementation, as illustrated in the example embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B</figref>, <b>5</b>C, <b>8</b>B and <b>8</b>C, the nock device <b>50</b> can comprise a stem portion <b>54</b>, which may comprise one or more outward protrusions <b>56</b> and/or a chamfered base <b>58</b>. As an example, the stem portion <b>54</b> may be configured to be inserted into a rear opening of an arrow shaft. Further, for example, the chamfered base <b>58</b> of the stem portion <b>54</b> may be configured to facilitate insertion into the rear opening of an arrow shaft, where the rounded edges can mitigate snagging of the stem portion <b>54</b> on an edge of the rear opening of an arrow shaft. Additionally, as an example the outward protrusions <b>56</b> may facilitate securing the nock device <b>50</b> within the shaft of the arrow. That is, for example, the outward protrusions <b>56</b> can increase the diameter of the nock device <b>50</b> with respect to the diameter of the shaft, which may help form a pressure friction fit within the shaft of the arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one implementation, in a center portion of the nock device top portion <b>52</b>, an attachment slot <b>62</b> may be disposed, where the attachment slot <b>62</b> can extend through at least a portion of the top portion <b>52</b>. In one implementation, the attachment slot <b>62</b> may be formed into a triangular shape. In other implementations, the attachment slot <b>62</b> may be formed to any appropriate shape for aligning an attachment, such as a square and/or other polygon.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a component diagram illustrating an example implementation of the nock device. In one implementation, the nock device <b>50</b> can comprise a nock guide <b>90</b>. The nock guide <b>90</b> may be configured to be selectively removable from the nock device <b>50</b>, such as from the attachment slot <b>62</b>. The nock guide <b>90</b> may be further configured to facilitate appropriate alignment of the nock device <b>50</b>, for example, when assembled to an arrow. In one implementation, the nock guide <b>90</b> can comprise a male portion <b>92</b> that is configured to selectively mate with the attachment slot <b>62</b>. As one example, a shape of the male portion <b>92</b> may comprise a complimentary shape of an attachment slot <b>62</b> to which it is intended to be mated (e.g., both the male portion and slot are triangular, or square, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one implementation, the nock guide <b>90</b> can be attached to the nock device <b>50</b>, and the bowstring of the bow (e.g., longbow, crossbow, etc.) may be inserted into a nock guide slot <b>94</b> of the nock guide <b>90</b>. As one example, an arrow shaft may be attached to the stem portion <b>54</b> of the nock device <b>50</b> while the user aligns the fletching vanes in accordance with the desired use (e.g., right-handed, left-handed, longbow, crossbow, etc.) In this way, for example, the arrow, the nock guide <b>90</b>, and nock device <b>50</b> can be in appropriate alignment with the fletching vanes of the arrow, such as for use with crossbows in aligning the vanes within the slotted portion of the barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As an illustrative example, in an operation of a bow, the bowstring is cocked and the arrow, with the nock against the bowstring, is drawn back with the bowstring. In accordance with one implementation of the nock device <b>50</b> comprising the three pairs of string guide impressions, the arrow can be aligned any one of three arrangements in accordance with the vanes of the arrow, the handedness of the shooter, and/or the arrangement of the bow riser/handle. As another example, in operation of a crossbow, the bowstring is cocked into a ready-to-shoot position by the user. Subsequently, the arrow can be loaded on the barrel, with at least one of the vanes inserted into a slotted portion of the barrel, with the nock device <b>50</b> pressed against the bowstring. In this example, the arrow may be aligned in any one of three positions, in accordance with the vanes of the arrow and the slotted portion of the barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Now with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>, and continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref>, in one aspect, when a traditional nock, such as a half-moon nock, is misaligned with the bowstring <b>1002</b>, for example, such that a centerline of the groove portion <b>22</b> of the nock is not aligned with (e.g., parallel to) the bowstring <b>1002</b>, the arrow <b>40</b> may not shoot from the bow (e.g., crossbow) in a desired manner. That is, for example, a user of a bow (e.g., crossbow, vertical bow) may occasionally misalign a traditional nock with the bowstring <b>1002</b>. A misalignment of this type can result in undesirable flight characteristics for the arrow <b>40</b> when the bowstring <b>1002</b> is released, for example, causing the arrow <b>40</b> to miss an intended target.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As one example, the groove portion <b>22</b> of a half-moon nock (e.g., and other traditional nocks) is configured to align parallel to, and engage with, the bowstring <b>1002</b>. Due to this alignment, as described above, merely one configuration of the fletching vanes <b>42</b> of an arrow <b>40</b> may be utilized. For example, when a crossbow is used, a first fletching vane <b>42</b><i>b </i>is disposed in the barrel slot <b>1006</b> of the barrel <b>1004</b> of the crossbow, such that the groove portion <b>22</b> of the nock is appropriately aligned with the bowstring <b>1002</b>. Further, two second vanes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>c </i>are disposed above (e.g., and not in contact with) the barrel <b>1004</b>. In this way, for example, when the bowstring is released from a shooting position (e.g., the crossbow is shot), the arrow may travel properly down the barrel, and may further travel a desired flight path (e.g., to the intended target).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">However, an arrow <b>40</b> shot with a misaligned nock may rise up <b>1104</b> from the barrel <b>1004</b>, and/or rotate <b>1102</b> out of the barrel slot <b>1006</b> of a crossbow, causing an inaccurate shot. As one example, rotating a groove portion <b>22</b> of a half-moon nock out of alignment with the bowstring <b>1002</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-C</figref>, can cause the arrow to rise <b>1104</b> and rotate <b>1102</b> out of the barrel slot <b>1006</b> when shot from the crossbow. In this example, raising <b>1104</b> and rotating <b>1102</b> the arrow <b>40</b> out of the barrel slot <b>1006</b> may cause the arrow <b>40</b> to miss the intended target, due to undesired alignment of the arrow's fletchings <b>42</b> during a flight path of the shot.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one implementation, the user of the crossbow may misalign the groove portion <b>22</b> of the traditional nock with the bowstring <b>1002</b>, for example, by inadvertently placing the incorrect fletching vane <b>42</b><i>c </i>in the barrel slot <b>1006</b>. In this implementation, for example, when the bowstring <b>1002</b> is released (e.g., shot) the shape of the groove portion <b>22</b> of the half-moon nock may cause the arrow <b>40</b> to rotate <b>1102</b> (e.g., counter-clockwise in this example) as the groove portion <b>22</b> is forced to align with the bowstring <b>1002</b> during the shot (e.g., due to a great force applied by the bowstring to nock during a shot). Further, in this example, the rotation <b>1102</b> of the arrow <b>40</b> can force the fletching vane <b>42</b><i>c </i>against a wall of the barrel slot <b>1006</b>, thereby pushing the arrow <b>40</b> up <b>1104</b> and out of the barrel slot <b>1006</b> during the shot. Additionally, the rotation <b>1102</b> can force the fletching vane <b>42</b><i>a </i>against the barrel <b>1004</b>, further providing for the arrow <b>40</b> to rise <b>1104</b> out of the barrel slot <b>1006</b> (e.g., due to the configuration of the vanes <b>42</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one implementation of this aspect, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-B</figref> and <b>13</b>A-B, when an arrow <b>40</b> comprising the alternate nock design <b>50</b> is misaligned on the bowstring <b>1002</b>, the design of the alternate nock <b>50</b> can cause the arrow <b>40</b> to rotate into appropriate alignment upon release of the bowstring <b>1002</b>. That is, for example, instead of causing the arrow to rise and rotate out of the barrel slot <b>1006</b> of a crossbow, the bowstring <b>1002</b> engaging with the alternate nock <b>50</b> can cause the arrow <b>40</b> to rotate <b>1102</b> into appropriate alignment (e.g., in the barrel slot <b>1006</b>) prior to release from the bow, and not deviate from a desired path (e.g., rise up), thereby providing a more accurate shot.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this implementation, the disposition of the string guide impressions <b>60</b> on the top surface <b>64</b> of the top portion <b>52</b> of the nock <b>50</b> may provide for multiple alignment positions for the arrow <b>40</b>, with respect to the fletching vanes <b>40</b> and the bow. That is, for example, when using a crossbow, a first fletching vane <b>42</b><i>b </i>may be disposed in the barrel slot <b>1006</b>, where respective second fletching vanes <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>, are disposed above, and not in contact with, the barrel. In this example, the first string impression <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the second string impression <b>60</b><i>b </i>may be engaged with the bowstring <b>1002</b> in a desired alignment (e.g., parallel). Further, if the arrow <b>40</b> is rotated such that the fletching vane <b>42</b><i>a </i>is disposed in the barrel slot <b>1006</b>, string guide impression <b>60</b><i>e </i>and <b>60</b><i>f </i>may provide an appropriate alignment with the bowstring <b>1002</b>. Additionally, if the arrow <b>40</b> is again rotated such that the fletching vane <b>42</b><i>c </i>is disposed in the barrel slot <b>1006</b>, string guide impression <b>60</b><i>c </i>and <b>60</b><i>d </i>may provide an appropriate alignment with the bowstring <b>1002</b>. That is, for example, regardless of which fletching vane <b>60</b> is disposed in the barrel slot <b>1006</b>, an appropriate alignment of the bowstring <b>1002</b> to a string guide impression may be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one implementation, in this aspect, use of the nock device <b>50</b> (e.g., described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>) may mitigate undesired flight path characteristics for an arrow <b>40</b> that is misaligned with respect to the bowstring <b>1002</b>. As one example, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the nock device <b>50</b> may not be fully engaged with the bowstring, such that the bowstring <b>1002</b> is not in full contact with the respective string guide impressions (e.g., the nock is, at least, partially offset from the bowstring). In this example, the string guide impressions may not be aligned properly with the bowstring <b>1002</b> (e.g., the bowstring may not be aligned with the first bisecting line). In this implementation, for example, when the bowstring <b>1002</b> is released (e.g., the arrow is shot) the nock device <b>50</b> may cause the arrow <b>40</b> to rotate <b>1102</b> into proper alignment, prior to release from the bow, upon the bowstring <b>1002</b> engaging the nock device <b>50</b> (e.g., as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As one example, the string guide impressions <b>60</b> may comprise a concave impression with gradually sloping sides (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B</figref>, <b>5</b>C, <b>7</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>8</b>C, and <b>9</b>). In this implementation, for example, the concavity design of the impression <b>60</b> may allow the bowstring to slide down a gradually sloping side to the base of the impression <b>60</b>, upon release of the bowstring <b>1002</b>, when the bowstring <b>1002</b> is not appropriately aligned with the bisecting line <b>70</b> of the impression <b>60</b> (e.g., with the base of the impression <b>60</b>). In this way, for example, an arrow <b>40</b> engaged with the alternate nock device <b>50</b> may rotate <b>1102</b> into proper alignment with the bowstring <b>1002</b>, as the bowstring <b>1002</b> slides into the base of the impression <b>60</b> (e.g., the nock <b>50</b> slides up the bowstring <b>1002</b>), upon release of the bowstring <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A method may be devised wherein an alternate nock device may be used, for example, to nock an arrow for subsequent shooting (e.g., from a bow and/or crossbow). Typical nocks merely provide for a single alignment of a bowstring, for example, where the arrow may be oriented in an up or down position, according a nock's groove (e.g., bowstring receiver). Some flat nocks may allow for multiple alignments of the bowstring against the nock, but they may not provide for a centering (e.g., comprising a central bisection) of the bowstring on the flat portion of the nock. Using an alternate nock design (e.g., <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref>), the user may be able to align the arrow on the bowstring in multiple alignments, and/or may be able to appropriately center the bowstring on the back (e.g., top surface) of the nock.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method <b>1000</b> for using a nock device. The exemplary method <b>1400</b> begins at <b>1402</b>. At <b>1404</b> a process of aligning the nock device on/in a shaft of an arrow begins. That is, for example, when a nock is engaged with the shaft of the arrow, it is typically aligned in accordance with fletchings attached to the shaft. At <b>1406</b>, a nock guide can be engaged with the nock device. As described above, the nock device may comprise an attachment slot on its top (e.g., back) surface of its top portion. In one implementation, the attachment slot can protrude, at least partially, into top portion of the nock device, for example, into which a user may selectively engage a male portion of the nock guide.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At <b>1408</b>, the nock guide can be aligned in a desired alignment with the arrow's fletching vanes. As one example, the nock guide can be used to guide engagement of the nock device with the arrow shaft to a desired orientation, for example, with respect to one or more arrow fletching vanes disposed on said arrow shaft. As described above, the nock guide may comprise a groove, for example, that may engage a bowstring. In this example, the groove of the nock guide (e.g., <b>94</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) may be appropriately aligned with the bowstring, and the fletchings may be appropriately aligned (e.g., appropriate for a bow or crossbow) for shooting. In one embodiment, when aligned to the desired orientation, the nock device may be fully engaged (e.g., friction/pressure fit, and/or glued) in the desired orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At <b>1410</b>, the nock guide may be disengaged from the nock device. For example, the male portion of the nock guide may be pulled from the attachment slot on top of the top surface of the nock device. At <b>1412</b>, a first portion of the bowstring can be engaged with a first string guide impression on the nock device; and a second portion of the bowstring can be engaged with a second string guide impression on the nock device, at <b>1414</b>. In one implementation, a bowstring guide on the nock device may comprise a pair of impressions (e.g., the first and second), respectively disposed at opposite ends of a generally, centrally bisecting line across the top surface of the nock device. In this implementation, the user may engage (e.g., nock) the arrow to the bowstring by engaging the bowstring with both of the impressions in the pair, at two different locations (e.g., either end of the bisecting line). In this way, for example, the bowstring can be centrally aligned on the top surface of the nock, and, therefore, centrally aligned on the back of the arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one implementation, the nock device may comprise a third and a fourth string guide impression (e.g., a pair of impressions) that are respectively located at opposite ends of a second generally, centrally bisecting line of the top surface. In one implementation, the nock device may comprise a fifth and a sixth string guide impression that are respectively located at opposite ends of a third generally, centrally bisecting line of the top surface. In one implementation, the respective bisecting lines (e.g., and therefore the respective impressions) can be oriented on the top surface in a generally symmetrical layout, for example, such that an intersection of any two lines comprises a similar angle (e.g., ninety degrees, sixty degrees, forty-five degrees, thirty-six degrees, and/or thirty degrees), such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref>. In this way, for example, the user may engage (e.g., nock) the arrow to the bowstring using any one of the string guide impression pairs, based on the user's desired orientation of the arrow's fletchings.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At <b>1416</b> of the exemplary method <b>1400</b>, the bowstring, engaged with the nock device, may be released from a shooting position. As one example, a bowstring of a bow (e.g., recurve, long, compound, etc.) may be released from a shooting position (e.g., where the bow is cocked, drawn, etc.) by the user when the user uncocks (e.g., straightens) their fingers wrapped around the bowstring, or may be released when the user opens or releases a bowstring release device engaged with the bowstring. As another example, a bowstring of a crossbow may be released when the user activate (e.g., pulls, releases, etc.) a trigger mechanism engaged with the bowstring. Typically, when the bowstring is released, the engagement of the nock to the bowstring causes the arrow to be shot from the bow (e.g., bow, crossbow).</p>
