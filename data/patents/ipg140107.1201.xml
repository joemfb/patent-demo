<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0115700, filed on Nov. 27, 2009 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present general inventive concept relate to a printing medium feeding cassette in which the size of a printing medium to be loaded therein can be conveniently adjusted by a user, and an image forming apparatus including the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An image forming apparatus which forms an image on a printing medium is typically classified into an inkjet type, a thermal transfer type, or an electro-photographic type.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The image forming apparatus is provided with an image forming unit to form an image on a printing medium, and a printing medium feeding cassette to feed the printing medium to the image forming unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The printing medium feeding cassette includes a size adjusting unit to adjust a length or width thereof to be suitable for a size of the printing medium loaded therein, to thereby align the printing medium in place.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The size adjusting unit includes a plurality of coupling recesses which is formed in a main body of the printing medium feeding cassette to correspond to a plurality of printing medium sizes, and a stopper which is provided in a movable casing which slides with respect to the cassette main body and is coupled with any one of the plurality of coupling recesses. As the stopper is coupled with any one of the plurality of coupling recesses, the size of the printing medium feeding cassette can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in order for a user to adjust the size of the printing medium feeding cassette by using the size adjusting unit, the user must first separate the stopper from the coupling recess and then make the movable casing slide with respect to the cassette main body, which is inconvenient to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, in order to separate the stopper from the coupling recess, the user should pull or push a lever connected with the stopper, which also causes inconvenience to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, it is difficult for the user to manipulate the size adjusting unit with one hand.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Exemplary embodiments of the present general concept may provide a printing medium feeding cassette in which the size thereof can be conveniently adjusted by a user, and an image forming apparatus including the same.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Exemplary embodiments of the present general inventive concept may also provide a printing medium feeding cassette in which the size thereof can be conveniently adjusted by a single pushing or pulling action applied in a direction corresponding to a desired size.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional features and/or utilities of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the general inventive concept</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The foregoing and/or other aspects and utilities may be achieved by providing a printing medium feeding cassette usable with an image forming apparatus, the printing medium feeding cassette including a first casing which comprises a guide member which extends along a sliding direction, and a plurality of coupling parts arranged in a central area of the guide member to be spaced from each other along the sliding direction, a second casing to form a printing medium containing space in cooperation with the first casing configured to slide along the guide member, a stopper to reciprocate in a direction transverse to the sliding direction between a coupling position in which the stopper is coupled with any one of the plurality of coupling parts and a releasing position in which the stopper is released from the coupling part, and a releasing member which is coupled with the second casing to move in the sliding direction in connection with the second casing and is moved by an external force applied thereto in the sliding direction to allow the stopper to move to the releasing position from the coupling position.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The releasing position may include a first releasing position and a second releasing position each corresponding to a first side and a second side of the guide member which are spaced from the central area of the guide member in the transverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The releasing member may include a manipulation part to which the external force is applied; and a stopper guide part which is provided to the manipulation part to guide the stopper from the coupling position to the releasing position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The stopper guide part may include a guide groove which crosses the sliding direction at an acute angle.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The manipulation part may include a base plate; a flange part which extends from the base plate towards the second casing; and a bent part which is bent from the flange part in the transverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second casing may include a bent part inserting hole through which the bent part is inserted; a sliding groove in which the flange part moves in the sliding direction; and a stopper inserting hole in which the stopper is accommodated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The stopper inserting hole may include an elongated hole formed along the transverse direction to regulate a movement of the stopper.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The manipulation part may move relative to the second casing in the sliding direction, with respect to the stopper inserting hole.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second casing may further include a plurality of elastic member holders spaced apart from the stopper inserting hole in the transverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The releasing member may further include a plurality of elastic member supports spaced apart from opposite sides of each elastic member holder along the sliding direction.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The printing medium feeding cassette may further include a plurality of elastic members arranged between each elastic member holder and the plurality of elastic member supports to elastically bias the manipulation part so that the stopper is located in the coupling position.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The manipulation part may receive therein the guide member and may be coupled with the second casing to move in the sliding direction.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cassette may further include an elastic member to elastically bias the manipulation part so that the stopper is located in the coupling position.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A distance between the manipulation part and the guide member may gradually increase toward the releasing position from the coupling position.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The manipulation part may include approximately an &#x2018;M&#x2019; shaped section.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The guide member may include a curved shape which is convex at the central area.</p>

The exemplary embodiments are described below in order to explain the present general inventive concept by referring to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an image forming apparatus <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment includes an apparatus main body <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), a printing medium feeding cassette <b>100</b> which can be detachably coupled with the apparatus main body <b>2</b>, an image forming unit <b>200</b> which forms an image on a printing medium supplied from the printing medium feeding cassette <b>100</b>, a network connection unit <b>300</b> which receives printing data corresponding to an image which is to be formed on the printing medium, a scanning unit <b>400</b> which scans an image in an original document, a manipulation panel <b>500</b> which receives a scanning command, a printing command and a controlling command, and a controller <b>600</b> which controls the image forming unit <b>200</b>, the scanning unit <b>400</b>, and the manipulation panel <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this respect, the network connection unit <b>300</b>, the scanning unit <b>400</b>, and the manipulation panel <b>500</b> may be selectively provided to the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>, and thus, one or more of them may be omitted for convenience of design.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In exemplary embodiments, the network connection unit <b>300</b> may include a network interface card, and the scanning unit <b>400</b> may include an image sensor (not illustrated) such as a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) or a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The manipulation panel <b>500</b> may include an input key (not illustrated) to input the scanning command, the printing command, or the controlling command, and a display panel (not illustrated) to display the command input through the input key and an operational state corresponding to the input command.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The image forming unit <b>200</b> may employ at least one of an inkjet type, which ejects ink droplets through nozzles to form an image, an electro-photographic type, which forms an image through the processes of charging, exposure, development, transfer, fixing and cleaning, and a thermal transfer type, which forms an image by using a thermal printing head.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an exemplary embodiment, in a case of the inkjet type, the image forming unit <b>200</b> includes an ink chamber in which ink is stored, a heater which is disposed inside of the ink chamber to heat the ink, and a nozzle plate which is provided with a plurality of nozzles to eject the ink heated by the heater. However, the present general inventive concept is not limited thereto. That is, in alternative exemplary embodiments, the heater may be replaced with a piezoelectric element.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 6</figref>, the printing medium feeding cassette <b>100</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment includes a first casing <b>110</b>, a second casing <b>120</b> which is configured to slide in a sliding direction A, a stopper <b>130</b> which is selectively coupled with part of the first casing <b>110</b> to regulate a movement of the second casing <b>120</b> along the sliding direction A, and a releasing member <b>140</b> which can release the stopper <b>130</b> from the first casing <b>110</b> according to an external force applied along the sliding direction A.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The first casing <b>110</b> and the second casing <b>120</b> cooperates with each other to form a printing medium containing space S (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in which a printing medium (not illustrated) can be contained.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4B</figref> illustrates an assembly of a first casing <b>110</b> with a second casing <b>120</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The first casing <b>110</b> includes a base support <b>111</b> which supports the printing medium; and a first guide member <b>115</b> which extends from the base support <b>111</b> in the sliding direction A.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When the first and second casings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are combined with each other (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4D</figref>), the base support <b>111</b> of the first casing <b>110</b> is disposed above a base support <b>126</b> of the second casing <b>120</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the first casing <b>110</b> having a relatively small width is received inside of the second casing <b>120</b> having a relatively large width so that the second casing <b>120</b> can slide with respect to the first casing <b>110</b>. In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the second casing <b>120</b> may have a smaller width than the first casing <b>110</b>, so that the second casing <b>120</b> can be received inside of the first casing <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The first guide member <b>115</b> may be recessed in a direction downward from the base support <b>111</b> and may extend in the sliding direction A. In exemplary embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a bottom surface <b>115</b><i>a </i>of the first guide member <b>115</b> may include a concave shape. As the first casing <b>110</b> is combined with the second casing <b>120</b>, the first guide member <b>115</b> of the first casing <b>110</b> is disposed below a second guide member <b>127</b> of the second casing <b>120</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In exemplary embodiments, the first casing <b>110</b> may further include a plurality of coupling parts <b>116</b> formed in the first guide member <b>115</b> along a lengthwise direction of the first guide member <b>115</b>, that is, along the sliding direction A.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the plurality of coupling parts <b>116</b> may be provided along a central area along a widthwise direction of the first guide member <b>115</b> and may be spaced apart from each other. More specifically, in a case that the stopper <b>130</b> is located in the central area of the first guide member <b>115</b>, the stopper <b>130</b> can be contacted and coupled with any one of the plurality of coupling parts <b>116</b>. In the case that the stopper <b>130</b> is shifted from the central area to any one side of the first guide member <b>115</b>, the stopper <b>130</b> loses contact with the coupling part <b>116</b> and would thereby be released from the coupling part <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The plurality of coupling parts <b>116</b> may be provided as grooves or protrusions. However, the present general inventive concept is not limited thereto. That is, in exemplary embodiments, the coupling parts may be provided in various shapes which correspond to a shape of the stopper <b>130</b> to allow the stopper <b>130</b> to be coupled to the coupling parts <b>116</b> of the first guide member <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The plurality of coupling parts <b>116</b> may include a first coupling part <b>116</b><i>a</i>, a second coupling part <b>116</b><i>b</i>, and a third coupling part <b>116</b><i>c</i>, when viewed from the side of the first casing <b>110</b>. In this respect, a number of the coupling parts <b>116</b> may be varied depending on a size of printing mediums to be loaded within the printing medium containing space S. That is, the number of coupling parts <b>116</b> disposed on the first guide member <b>115</b> may increase as a size of the printing medium to be contained within the printing medium containing space S increases.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In exemplary embodiments, the first casing <b>110</b> may further include a plurality of sliding grooves <b>112</b> which may be formed in the base support <b>111</b> adjacent to opposite sides of the first guide member <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">When the first and second casings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are combined with each other, the plurality of sliding grooves <b>112</b> corresponds to and communicates with sliding grooves <b>124</b> of the second casing <b>120</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Thus, the releasing member <b>140</b> may reciprocate in the sliding direction A along the sliding grooves <b>112</b> and <b>124</b> of the first and second casings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In exemplary embodiments, the second casing <b>120</b> includes the base support <b>126</b> which supports a printing medium; the sliding grooves <b>124</b> which guides a sliding movement of the releasing member <b>140</b> along the sliding direction A; and a bent part inserting hole <b>123</b> which are formed in the base support <b>126</b> of the second guide member <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In exemplary embodiments, flange parts <b>144</b> of the releasing member <b>140</b>, which will be described later, may be inserted into the sliding grooves <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The sliding grooves <b>124</b> may be disposed adjacent to opposite sides of the second guide member <b>127</b> along the sliding direction A. That is, the second guide member <b>127</b> may be disposed between the sliding grooves <b>124</b>, and may face the first guide member <b>115</b> of the first casing <b>110</b> when the first and second casings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are combined with each other. That is, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>10</b>, a bottom surface <b>127</b><i>a </i>of the second guide member <b>127</b> may face a top surface <b>115</b><i>b </i>of the first guide member <b>115</b> when the first and second guide casings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are combined.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The second guide member <b>127</b> includes a stopper inserting hole <b>125</b> through which the stopper <b>130</b> may be inserted. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the stopper inserting hole <b>125</b> may be provided as an elongated hole (i.e., a slot) which is formed in a direction transverse to the sliding direction A. In exemplary embodiments, the stopper inserting hole <b>125</b> may contact the stopper <b>130</b> to apply a force to the stopper <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The stopper <b>130</b> may reciprocate between a coupling position C (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) in which the stopper <b>130</b> may be contacted and coupled with any one of the coupling parts <b>116</b> arranged in a central area of the first guide member <b>115</b> and releasing positions D and E (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) in which the stopper <b>130</b> is shifted from the central area of the first guide member <b>115</b> in a transverse direction B and is released from the coupling parts <b>116</b>. The stopper <b>130</b> can be accommodated in the stopper inserting hole <b>125</b> of the second guide member <b>127</b> of the second casing <b>120</b>, and thus, the stopper <b>130</b> may be regulated to move in the transverse direction B. That is, in exemplary embodiments, the stopper <b>130</b> may move due to a force applied from the stopper inserting hole <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The releasing positions D and E refer to positions where the stopper <b>130</b> moves to the opposite sides of the first guide member <b>115</b> from the central area thereof in the transverse direction B. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the stopper <b>130</b> includes a stopper main body <b>133</b>, and a protrusion <b>131</b> which is inserted into a stopper guide part <b>143</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In exemplary embodiments, sides and corners of a bottom of the stopper main body <b>133</b> may be rounded to slide easily with respect to an upper surface of the first guide member <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a modified stopper <b>130</b><i>a</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the modified stopper <b>130</b><i>a </i>includes a modified protrusion <b>131</b><i>a</i>. The modified protrusion <b>131</b><i>a </i>includes a suspension part <b>131</b><i>b </i>and a round part <b>131</b><i>c</i>. A modified stopper guide part <b>143</b><i>a </i>includes a deviation prevention part <b>143</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the suspension part <b>131</b><i>b</i>. That is, the suspension part <b>131</b><i>b </i>can be suspended on the deviation prevention part <b>143</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the stopper <b>130</b><i>a </i>may be prevented from being deviated in a direction away from the manipulation part <b>141</b> (i.e., downwards). With this configuration, the stopper <b>130</b><i>a </i>can be stably supported by the manipulation part <b>141</b>, while moving along the stopper guide part <b>143</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In exemplary embodiments, when the protrusion <b>131</b><i>a </i>is inserted into the stopper guide part <b>143</b><i>a</i>, the protrusion <b>131</b><i>a </i>may smoothly pass through the deviation prevention part <b>143</b><i>b </i>by means of the round part <b>131</b><i>c</i>. To this end, the stopper <b>130</b><i>a </i>and the manipulation part <b>141</b> may be made of plastic having flexibility. However, the present general inventive concept is not limited thereto. That is, in exemplary embodiments, the stopper <b>130</b><i>a </i>and the manipulation part <b>141</b> may be formed of various materials, including metals, which are coated with materials, such as silicone or Teflon&#x2122;, to reduce a friction between the stopper <b>130</b><i>a </i>and the manipulation part <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the releasing member <b>140</b> includes the manipulation part <b>141</b> which is exposed outside of the printing medium feeding cassette <b>100</b> and receives an external force applied in the sliding direction A, and the stopper guide part <b>143</b> which guides the stopper <b>130</b> between the coupling position C and the releasing positions D and E. In exemplary embodiments, an upper surface of the manipulation part <b>141</b> may be planar with the base support <b>111</b> of the first casing <b>110</b> and/or the base support <b>126</b> of the second casing <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In exemplary embodiments, the releasing member <b>140</b> may be integrally formed from a single piece of material. That is, in exemplary embodiments, the manipulation part <b>141</b> may be integrally formed with the elastic member supports <b>142</b>, the flange part <b>144</b>, and the bent part <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In exemplary embodiments, when an external force is applied to the manipulation part <b>141</b> in the sliding direction A, the releasing member <b>140</b> may move in the sliding direction A together with the second casing <b>120</b>. More specifically, since an elastic member holder <b>121</b> which can be attached to a rear surface of the second casing <b>120</b> is connected with the releasing member <b>140</b> through elastic members <b>150</b>, to be described later, the releasing member <b>140</b> may move in the sliding direction A together with the second casing <b>120</b>, when an external force exceeding an elastic force of the elastic members <b>150</b> is applied to the manipulation part <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In exemplary embodiments, a bent part <b>146</b> of the releasing member <b>140</b> may be coupled with an edge of a bent part inserting hole <b>123</b> of the second casing <b>120</b>, so that the releasing member <b>140</b> and the second casing <b>120</b> may move in connection with each other.</p>

When a force is applied to the manipulation part <b>140</b> along the A direction toward the first casing <b>110</b>, the stopper inserting hole <b>125</b> of the second casing <b>120</b> may move with the manipulation part <b>140</b> when the force is greater than a second force exerted by the elastic members <b>150</b>. The movement of the second casing <b>120</b>, in turn, forces the stopper inserting hole <b>125</b> to cause the stopper <b>130</b> to move along a second B direction, which traverses the A direction. In exemplary embodiments, the B direction forms an acute angle with respect with the A direction, such that the stopper <b>130</b> may move along the B direction, when a force is applied to the stopper <b>130</b> along the A direction.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the stopper <b>130</b>&#x2033; has moved such that a distance D<b>1</b> between the reference line R<b>1</b> and a center of the stopper <b>130</b> has changed to a distance D<b>2</b>, which is less than the distance D<b>1</b>. As a result, the first length L<b>1</b> has changed to a distance L<b>2</b>, such that the first casing <b>110</b> and the second casing <b>120</b> may accommodate a second size of printing medium which is smaller than the first size of printing medium. The stopper inserting hole <b>125</b> may force the stopper <b>130</b> away from a central portion of the first casing <b>110</b>, such that the stopper <b>130</b> is released from the coupling part <b>116</b><i>c </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, when the stopper <b>130</b> corresponds to another coupling part, such as <b>116</b><i>b </i>or <b>116</b><i>a</i>, the second force exerted by the elastic members <b>150</b> moves the manipulation part <b>140</b> such that the stopper <b>130</b> returns to the central portion of the first casing <b>110</b>, to thereby be coupled to the coupling part <b>116</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The manipulation part <b>141</b> may receive an external force to pull the second casing <b>120</b> in a first direction A<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) in which the second casing <b>120</b> moves away from the first casing <b>110</b>. Further, the manipulation part <b>141</b> may receive an external force to push the second casing <b>120</b> in a second direction A<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) in which the second casing <b>120</b> moves toward to the first casing <b>110</b>. The pulling force and the pushing force may be manually applied by a user. However, the present general inventive concept is not limited thereto. That is, in exemplary embodiments, the pulling force and the pushing force may be applied by an electric motor, a pneumatic device, a hydraulic device or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 10</figref>, the manipulation part <b>141</b> includes an external force acting surface <b>141</b><i>a </i>to which when an external force is applied, flange parts <b>144</b> which are bent from opposite sides of the external force acting surface <b>141</b><i>a </i>moves towards the second casing <b>120</b> and bent parts <b>146</b> which are bent from the flange parts <b>144</b> move in a transverse direction B of direction A.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In exemplary embodiments, the flange parts <b>144</b> of the manipulation part <b>141</b> may be inserted into the sliding grooves <b>112</b> and <b>124</b> of the first and second casings <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>; and the bent parts <b>146</b> of the manipulation part <b>141</b> may be accommodated in the bent part inserting holes <b>123</b> of the second casing <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In exemplary embodiments, the stopper guide part <b>143</b> may be formed on an inner surface of the manipulation part <b>141</b>, which faces the second guide member <b>127</b> of the second casing <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The stopper guide part <b>143</b> may include a guide groove which may be formed on the inner surface of the manipulation part <b>141</b> in a direction which crosses the sliding direction A at an acute angle. In this respect, as the angle between a lengthwise direction of the guide groove <b>143</b> and the sliding direction A is close to 90&#xb0;, the manipulation part <b>141</b> may move a short distance in the sliding direction A to move the stopper <b>130</b> from the coupling position to the releasing positions. Contrarily, as the angle between the direction of the guide groove <b>143</b> and the sliding direction A is close to 0&#xb0;, the manipulation part <b>141</b> should move a relatively long distance in the sliding direction A to move the stopper <b>130</b> from the coupling position to the releasing positions. The angle between the direction of the guide groove <b>143</b> and the sliding direction A may be appropriately adjusted in consideration of a movement range of the releasing member <b>140</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the above exemplary embodiment, the stopper guide part <b>143</b> can be formed in a shape corresponding to the guide groove <b>143</b> by way of example, but the stopper guide part <b>143</b> may be formed in a shape of a protrusion having a same profile as that of the guide groove <b>143</b>. In this case, the stopper <b>130</b> may be configured to move along the protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The printing medium feeding cassette <b>100</b> may further include the elastic members <b>150</b> which elastically bias the releasing member <b>140</b> so that the stopper <b>130</b> can be located in a coupling position.

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the releasing member <b>140</b> further includes a plurality of elastic member supports <b>142</b> which is respectively protruded from the flange parts <b>144</b>.

Further, the elastic member supports <b>142</b> are arranged adjacent to the opposite sides of the first guide member <b>115</b>. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the number of the elastic member supports <b>142</b> may be, for example, four to correspond to the four flange parts <b>144</b>. However, the present general inventive concept is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, each elastic member <b>150</b> may be connected with the elastic member holder <b>121</b> at one end part <b>150</b><i>a </i>thereof (i.e., a first end), and may be connected with the elastic member support <b>142</b> at the other end part <b>150</b><i>b </i>thereof (i.e., a second end).</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In an exemplary embodiment, it is assumed that the printing medium feeding cassette <b>100</b> can load therein at least three different sizes of printing mediums, for example, a letter size (216&#xd7;279 cm), an A4 size (210&#xd7;297 cm), and a legal document size (216&#xd7;356 cm). In this respect, it is assumed that the first coupling part <b>116</b><i>a</i>, the second coupling part <b>116</b><i>b</i>, and the third coupling part <b>116</b><i>c </i>correspond to the letter size, the A4 size and the legal document size, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the manipulation part <b>141</b> and the first guide member <b>115</b> may be configured so that a distance H between the manipulation part <b>141</b> and the first guide member <b>115</b> is gradually increased from the coupling position C toward the first and second releasing positions E and D. Accordingly, as the stopper <b>130</b> moves from the coupling position C to the releasing position D or E, the stopper <b>130</b> becomes gradually spaced apart from the first guide member <b>115</b> to thereby be released from the coupling part <b>116</b> provided in the first guide member <b>115</b>.</p>
