<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Hybrid location determination for wireless communication device. Various services that may be used by a wireless communication device within a particular location may be referred to as location based services (LBS). As such, means by which the location of a wireless communication device that may use such available services, within such a locale, is made by using more than one type of location determination approach. For example, a wireless communication device includes communication capability (e.g., RX and TX) in accordance with a first communication protocol (e.g., Bluetooth) and also includes a communication capability (e.g., RX only) in accordance with a second communication protocol (e.g., WiFi/WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)). The RX capability is operative to assist in location determination for the wireless communication device based on knowledge of at least one wireless communication device that communicates with the wireless communication device.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">The invention relates generally to wireless communication devices; and, more particularly, it relates to determining location of such wireless communication devices for use, at least in part, to determining which location based services (LBSs) are available for use by such wireless communication devices.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">Communication systems are known to support wireless and wire lined communications between wireless and/or wire lined communication devices. Such communication systems range from national and/or international cellular telephone systems to the Internet to point-to-point in-home wireless networks. Each type of communication system is constructed, and hence operates, in accordance with one or more communication standards. For instance, wireless communication systems may operate in accordance with one or more standards including, but not limited to, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, advanced mobile phone services (AMPS), digital AMPS, global system for mobile communications (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), local multi-point distribution systems (LMDS), multi-channel-multi-point distribution systems (MMDS), radio frequency identification (RFID), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and/or variations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">Depending on the type of wireless communication system, a wireless communication device, such as a cellular telephone, two-way radio, personal digital assistant (PDA), personal computer (PC), laptop computer, home entertainment equipment, RFID reader, RFID tag, etc., communicates directly or indirectly with other wireless communication devices. For direct communications (also known as point-to-point communications), the participating wireless communication devices tune their receivers and transmitters to the same channel or channels (e.g., one of the plurality of radio frequency (RF) carriers of the wireless communication system or a particular RF frequency for some systems) and communicate over that channel(s). For indirect wireless communications, each wireless communication device communicates directly with an associated base station (e.g., for cellular services) and/or an associated access point (e.g., for an in-home or in-building wireless network) via an assigned channel. To complete a communication connection between the wireless communication devices, the associated base stations and/or associated access points communicate with each other directly, via a system controller, via the public switch telephone network, via the Internet, and/or via some other wide area network.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">For each wireless communication device to participate in wireless communications, it includes a built-in radio transceiver (i.e., receiver and transmitter) or is coupled to an associated radio transceiver (e.g., a station for in-home and/or in-building wireless communication networks, RF modem, etc.). As is known, the receiver is coupled to an antenna and includes a low noise amplifier, one or more intermediate frequency stages, a filtering stage, and a data recovery stage. The low noise amplifier receives inbound RF signals via the antenna and amplifies then. The one or more intermediate frequency stages mix the amplified RF signals with one or more local oscillations to convert the amplified RF signal into baseband signals or intermediate frequency (IF) signals. The filtering stage filters the baseband signals or the IF signals to attenuate unwanted out of band signals to produce filtered signals. The data recovery stage recovers raw data from the filtered signals in accordance with the particular wireless communication standard.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">As is also known, the transmitter includes a data modulation stage, one or more intermediate frequency stages, and a power amplifier. The data modulation stage converts raw data into baseband signals in accordance with a particular wireless communication standard. The one or more intermediate frequency stages mix the baseband signals with one or more local oscillations to produce RF signals. The power amplifier amplifies the RF signals prior to transmission via an antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">While transmitters generally include a data modulation stage, one or more IF stages, and a power amplifier, the particular implementation of these elements is dependent upon the data modulation scheme of the standard being supported by the transceiver. For example, if the baseband modulation scheme is Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK), the data modulation stage functions to convert digital words into quadrature modulation symbols, which have a constant amplitude and varying phases. The IF stage includes a phase locked loop (PLL) that generates an oscillation at a desired RF frequency, which is modulated based on the varying phases produced by the data modulation stage. The phase modulated RF signal is then amplified by the power amplifier in accordance with a transmit power level setting to produce a phase modulated RF signal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">As another example, if the data modulation scheme is 8-PSK (phase shift keying), the data modulation stage functions to convert digital words into symbols having varying amplitudes and varying phases. The IF stage includes a phase locked loop (PLL) that generates an oscillation at a desired RF frequency, which is modulated based on the varying phases produced by the data modulation stage. The phase modulated RF signal is then amplified by the power amplifier in accordance with the varying amplitudes to produce a phase and amplitude modulated RF signal.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">As yet another example, if the data modulation scheme is x-QAM (16, 64, 128, 256 quadrature amplitude modulation), the data modulation stage functions to convert digital words into Cartesian coordinate symbols (e.g., having an in-phase signal component and a quadrature signal component). The IF stage includes mixers that mix the in-phase signal component with an in-phase local oscillation and mix the quadrature signal component with a quadrature local oscillation to produce two mixed signals. The mixed signals are summed together and filtered to produce an RF signal that is subsequently amplified by a power amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">As the desire for wireless communication devices to support multiple standards continues, recent trends include the desire to integrate more functions on to a single chip. However, such desires have gone unrealized when it comes to implementing baseband and RF on the same chip for multiple wireless communication standards. In addition, many components and/or modules within the components employed within such communication devices and wireless communication devices include many off-chip elements.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">Location based services (LBSs) continue to grow in availability. Such LBSs may be viewed as those particular communication services provided within a particular location. Determining the location of such a communication device is employed in accordance with the process of determining which services are then available to that communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">The use of LBSs continues to become ever-increasing in view of the integration of multiple wireless technologies onto various wireless communication devices (e.g., mobile platforms, portable wireless communication devices, etc.). As such, an improved means for performing location determination (using hybrid location techniques) is presented herein. Such a hybrid approach is inherently improved when compared to relying on a single technology, such as global positioning system (GPS) alone to determine the location of such a wireless communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">This determined location information is used to offer location based services (LBS). One example of such a hybrid technique as described herein is based on knowledge of proximate wireless local area network (WLAN/WiFi) (or alternatively referred to only as WLAN) access point (AP) as determined based on an associated IEEE 802.11 MAC address provided to a WiFi-enabled wireless communication device (e.g., smartphone) for use in determining the location of such a wireless communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">The market penetration of Bluetooth into various wireless communication devices (e.g., mobile phone devices) is extremely high versus the penetration of WiFi, which is still a fairly nascent market for a variety of reasons (e.g., there are limited use cases involving the use of WiFi in mobile devices to justify the significant additional die area and power consumption penalties associated with adding full WiFi capabilities to the mobile device).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">Therefore, for the large market of Bluetooth-enabled devices that do not have embedded WiFi capability, only a reduced functionality/minimum subset of WLAN/WiFi functionality is implemented or embedded in a Bluetooth capable communication device in order to obtain the required MAC addresses from a WLAN AP (e.g., an IEEE 802.11 2.4 GHz WiFi Access Point, or one operating in accordance with a different version of the IEEE 802.11 standards and using a different frequency).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">Generally speaking, no WLAN/WiFi transmitter capability is required at all within the communication device, and of all the modulation types and rates supported by the evolving IEEE 802.11 standard, the only WLAN/WiFi receiver capability receive implemented is for the Barker-spread 1 Mbps rate, differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK) modulation that is required to obtain the information relevant to location (i.e. media access control (MAC) address and/or signal strength indication (RSSI) associated with communications from such a WLAN AP).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">Only a very slight modification (which translates into only a very modest increase in die area) of an existing Bluetooth radio receiver's design is made to also support processing of WLAN/WiFi beacons from a WLAN AP and from which the relevant location-related information can be extracted.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating an embodiment of a wireless communication system <b>100</b>. The wireless communication system <b>100</b> includes a plurality of base stations and/or access points <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>, a plurality of wireless communication devices <b>118</b>-<b>132</b> and a network hardware component <b>134</b>. Note that the network hardware <b>134</b>, which may be a router, switch, bridge, modem, system controller, etc., provides a wide area network connection <b>142</b> for the communication system <b>100</b>. Further note that the wireless communication devices <b>118</b>-<b>132</b> may be laptop host computers <b>118</b> and <b>126</b>, personal digital assistant hosts <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>, personal computer hosts <b>124</b> and <b>132</b> and/or cellular telephone hosts <b>122</b> and <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">Wireless communication devices <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, and <b>124</b> are located within an independent basic service set (IBSS) area and communicate directly (i.e., point to point). In this configuration, these devices <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, and <b>124</b> may only communicate with each other. To communicate with other wireless communication devices within the system <b>100</b> or to communicate outside of the system <b>100</b>, the devices <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, and/or <b>124</b> need to affiliate with one of the base stations or access points <b>112</b> or <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">The base stations or access points <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> are located within basic service set (BSS) areas <b>111</b> and <b>113</b>, respectively, and are operably coupled to the network hardware <b>134</b> via local area network connections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>. Such a connection provides the base station or access point <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> with connectivity to other devices within the system <b>100</b> and provides connectivity to other networks via the WAN connection <b>142</b>. To communicate with the wireless communication devices within its BSS <b>111</b> or <b>113</b>, each of the base stations or access points <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> has an associated antenna or antenna array. For instance, base station or access point <b>112</b> wirelessly communicates with wireless communication devices <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> while base station or access point <b>116</b> wirelessly communicates with wireless communication devices <b>126</b>-<b>132</b>. Typically, the wireless communication devices register with a particular base station or access point <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> to receive services from the communication system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">Typically, base stations are used for cellular telephone systems (e.g., advanced mobile phone services (AMPS), digital AMPS, global system for mobile communications (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), local multi-point distribution systems (LMDS), multi-channel-multi-point distribution systems (MMDS), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA and/or variations thereof) and like-type systems, while access points are used for in-home or in-building wireless networks (e.g., IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, ZigBee, any other type of radio frequency based network protocol and/or variations thereof). Regardless of the particular type of communication system, each wireless communication device includes a built-in radio and/or is coupled to a radio.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating an embodiment <b>100</b> of a wireless communication device that includes the host device <b>118</b>-<b>132</b> and an associated radio <b>260</b>. For cellular telephone hosts, the radio <b>260</b> is a built-in component. For personal digital assistants hosts, laptop hosts, and/or personal computer hosts, the radio <b>260</b> may be built-in or an externally coupled component.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">As illustrated, the host device <b>118</b>-<b>132</b> includes a processing module <b>250</b>, memory <b>252</b>, a radio interface <b>254</b>, an input interface <b>258</b>, and an output interface <b>256</b>. The processing module <b>250</b> and memory <b>252</b> execute the corresponding instructions that are typically done by the host device. For example, for a cellular telephone host device, the processing module <b>250</b> performs the corresponding communication functions in accordance with a particular cellular telephone standard.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The radio interface <b>254</b> allows data to be received from and sent to the radio <b>260</b>. For data received from the radio <b>260</b> (e.g., inbound data), the radio interface <b>254</b> provides the data to the processing module <b>250</b> for further processing and/or routing to the output interface <b>256</b>. The output interface <b>256</b> provides connectivity to an output display device such as a display, monitor, speakers, etc., such that the received data may be displayed. The radio interface <b>254</b> also provides data from the processing module <b>250</b> to the radio <b>260</b>. The processing module <b>250</b> may receive the outbound data from an input device such as a keyboard, keypad, microphone, etc., via the input interface <b>258</b> or generate the data itself. For data received via the input interface <b>258</b>, the processing module <b>250</b> may perform a corresponding host function on the data and/or route it to the radio <b>260</b> via the radio interface <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">Radio <b>260</b> includes a host interface <b>262</b>, digital receiver processing module <b>264</b>, an analog-to-digital converter <b>266</b>, a high pass and low pass filter module <b>268</b>, an IF mixing down conversion stage <b>270</b>, a receiver filter <b>271</b>, a low noise amplifier <b>272</b>, a transmitter/receiver switch <b>273</b>, a local oscillation module <b>274</b>, memory <b>275</b>, a digital transmitter processing module <b>276</b>, a digital-to-analog converter <b>278</b>, a filtering/gain module <b>280</b>, an IF mixing up conversion stage <b>282</b>, a power amplifier <b>284</b>, a transmitter filter module <b>285</b>, a channel bandwidth adjust module <b>287</b>, and an antenna <b>286</b>. The antenna <b>286</b> may be a single antenna that is shared by the transmit and receive paths as regulated by the Tx/Rx switch <b>273</b>, or may include separate antennas for the transmit path and receive path. The antenna implementation will depend on the particular standard to which the wireless communication device is compliant.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">The digital receiver processing module <b>264</b> and the digital transmitter processing module <b>276</b>, in combination with operational instructions stored in memory <b>275</b>, execute digital receiver functions and digital transmitter functions, respectively. The digital receiver functions include, but are not limited to, digital intermediate frequency to baseband conversion, demodulation, constellation demapping, decoding, and/or descrambling. The digital transmitter functions include, but are not limited to, scrambling, encoding, constellation mapping, modulation, and/or digital baseband to IF conversion. The digital receiver and transmitter processing modules <b>264</b> and <b>276</b> may be implemented using a shared processing device, individual processing devices, or a plurality of processing devices. Such a processing device may be a microprocessor, micro-controller, digital signal processor, microcomputer, central processing unit, field programmable gate array, programmable logic device, state machine, logic circuitry, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or any device that manipulates signals (analog and/or digital) based on operational instructions. The memory <b>275</b> may be a single memory device or a plurality of memory devices. Such a memory device may be a read-only memory, random access memory, volatile memory, non-volatile memory, static memory, dynamic memory, flash memory, and/or any device that stores digital information. Note that when the processing module <b>264</b> and/or <b>276</b> implements one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry, the memory storing the corresponding operational instructions is embedded with the circuitry comprising the state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">In operation, the radio <b>260</b> receives outbound data <b>294</b> from the host device via the host interface <b>262</b>. The host interface <b>262</b> routes the outbound data <b>294</b> to the digital transmitter processing module <b>276</b>, which processes the outbound data <b>294</b> in accordance with a particular wireless communication standard (e.g., IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, ZigBee, WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), any other type of radio frequency based network protocol and/or variations thereof etc.) to produce outbound baseband signals <b>296</b>. The outbound baseband signals <b>296</b> will be digital base-band signals (e.g., have a zero IF) or digital low IF signals, where the low IF typically will be in the frequency range of one hundred kHz (kilo-Hertz) to a few MHz (Mega-Hertz).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">The digital-to-analog converter <b>278</b> converts the outbound baseband signals <b>296</b> from the digital domain to the analog domain. The filtering/gain module <b>280</b> filters and/or adjusts the gain of the analog signals prior to providing it to the IF mixing stage <b>282</b>. The IF mixing stage <b>282</b> converts the analog baseband or low IF signals into RF signals based on a transmitter local oscillation <b>283</b> provided by local oscillation module <b>274</b>. The power amplifier <b>284</b> amplifies the RF signals to produce outbound RF signals <b>298</b>, which are filtered by the transmitter filter module <b>285</b>. The antenna <b>286</b> transmits the outbound RF signals <b>298</b> to a targeted device such as a base station, an access point and/or another wireless communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">The radio <b>260</b> also receives inbound RF signals <b>288</b> via the antenna <b>286</b>, which were transmitted by a base station, an access point, or another wireless communication device. The antenna <b>286</b> provides the inbound RF signals <b>288</b> to the receiver filter module <b>271</b> via the Tx/Rx switch <b>273</b>, where the Rx filter <b>271</b> bandpass filters the inbound RF signals <b>288</b>. The Rx filter <b>271</b> provides the filtered RF signals to low noise amplifier <b>272</b>, which amplifies the signals <b>288</b> to produce an amplified inbound RF signals. The low noise amplifier <b>272</b> provides the amplified inbound RF signals to the IF mixing module <b>270</b>, which directly converts the amplified inbound RF signals into an inbound low IF signals or baseband signals based on a receiver local oscillation <b>281</b> provided by local oscillation module <b>274</b>. The down conversion module <b>270</b> provides the inbound low IF signals or baseband signals to the filtering/gain module <b>268</b>. The high pass and low pass filter module <b>268</b> filters, based on settings provided by the channel bandwidth adjust module <b>287</b>, the inbound low IF signals or the inbound baseband signals to produce filtered inbound signals.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">The analog-to-digital converter <b>266</b> converts the filtered inbound signals from the analog domain to the digital domain to produce inbound baseband signals <b>290</b>, where the inbound baseband signals <b>290</b> will be digital base-band signals or digital low IF signals, where the low IF typically will be in the frequency range of one hundred kHz to a few MHz. The digital receiver processing module <b>264</b>, based on settings provided by the channel bandwidth adjust module <b>287</b>, decodes, descrambles, demaps, and/or demodulates the inbound baseband signals <b>290</b> to recapture inbound data <b>292</b> in accordance with the particular wireless communication standard being implemented by radio <b>260</b>. The host interface <b>262</b> provides the recaptured inbound data <b>292</b> to the host device <b>118</b>-<b>132</b> via the radio interface <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the wireless communication device of the embodiment <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be implemented using one or more integrated circuits. For example, the host device may be implemented on one integrated circuit, the digital receiver processing module <b>264</b>, the digital transmitter processing module <b>276</b> and memory <b>275</b> may be implemented on a second integrated circuit, and the remaining components of the radio <b>260</b>, less the antenna <b>286</b>, may be implemented on a third integrated circuit. As an alternate example, the radio <b>260</b> may be implemented on a single integrated circuit. As yet another example, the processing module <b>250</b> of the host device and the digital receiver and transmitter processing modules <b>264</b> and <b>276</b> may be a common processing device implemented on a single integrated circuit. Further, the memory <b>252</b> and memory <b>275</b> may be implemented on a single integrated circuit and/or on the same integrated circuit as the common processing modules of processing module <b>250</b> and the digital receiver and transmitter processing module <b>264</b> and <b>276</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">Any of the various embodiments of communication device that may be implemented within various communication systems can incorporate functionality to perform communication via more than one standard, protocol, or other predetermined means of communication. For example, a single communication device, designed in accordance with certain aspects of the invention, can include functionality to perform communication in accordance with a first protocol, a second protocol, and/or a third protocol, and so on. These various protocols may be WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) protocol, a protocol that complies with a wireless local area network (WLAN/WiFi) (e.g., one of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer) 802.11 protocols such as 802.11a, 802.11b, and/or 802.11g), a Bluetooth protocol, or any other predetermined means by which wireless communication may be effectuated.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating an alternative embodiment <b>300</b> of a wireless communication device <b>310</b>. The wireless communication device <b>310</b> includes a wireless local area network (WLAN/WiFi) receiver (RX) circuitry <b>320</b>. In some embodiments, the wireless communication device <b>310</b> includes a location determination circuitry <b>330</b> (which may include a memory module <b>330</b><i>a </i>that is operative to store one or more maps, database components, etc.), a Bluetooth (BT) transceiver circuitry <b>340</b>, and up to an n-th location based service (LBS) communication circuitries <b>350</b> (i.e., one or both of RX circuitry and/or transmitter (TX) circuitry). Each of these radio circuitries is coupled to a baseband circuitry that is operative to perform various digital signal processing functions as well.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">One or more of the components within the wireless communication device <b>310</b> may be implemented within a single integrated circuit <b>310</b><i>a</i>, or they may alternatively be implemented in two or more integrated circuits, and/or one or more printed circuit boards. The wireless communication device <b>310</b> is operative to communicate with a WLAN access point (AP) <b>370</b><i>a</i>. Depending on which components are particularly implemented within the wireless communication device <b>310</b> (i.e., by including a location determination circuitry <b>330</b>), the wireless communication device <b>310</b> may also be operative to communicate with a location service communication device <b>370</b><i>b </i>(e.g., a global positioning system (GPS) satellite type location based servicing communication device). Also, in embodiments where the wireless communication device <b>310</b> includes a BT transceiver <b>340</b>, the wireless communication device <b>310</b> may also be operative to communicate with another BT communication device <b>370</b><i>c</i>. Clearly, in embodiments where the wireless communication device <b>310</b> includes an n-th LBS communication circuitry <b>350</b>, the wireless communication device <b>310</b> may also be operative to communicate with an n-th communication device <b>370</b><i>n </i>(e.g., that operates in accordance with an n-th communication protocol).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">The WLAN RX circuitry <b>320</b> is a reduced or minimum functionality receiver circuitry that need not include any transmitter (TX) capability at all. This reduced/minimum functionality RX is operative to perform WLAN beacon processing, as shown in a block <b>320</b><i>a</i>. This minimal amount of processing of only a portion of the communications provided from the WLAN AP <b>370</b><i>a </i>includes extracting the media access control (MAC) address and/or the received signal strength indication (RSSI) measures associated with such communications.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">In many or most situations, the location of an AP is known. Such information is communicated with and may be extracted from the MAC address associated with a communication from such an AP. In terms of determining location of the wireless communication device <b>310</b>, the determined location of the WLAN AP <b>370</b><i>a </i>may be used to make an estimate of the location of the wireless communication device <b>310</b>. For example, if the wireless communication device <b>310</b> is operative to communicate with the WLAN AP <b>370</b><i>a</i>, then it is certainly located within a sufficient proximity of the WLAN AP <b>370</b><i>a </i>(whose location is known). As such, a preliminary estimate of the location of the wireless communication device <b>310</b> may be made.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">Once the location of the WLAN AP <b>370</b><i>a </i>or the wireless communication device <b>310</b> is known, then that known location may be used to determine the various communication services that may be available in that locale for use by the wireless communication device <b>310</b>. The wireless communication device <b>310</b> may then use one or more of such LBSs.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating an alternative embodiment <b>400</b> of a wireless communication device <b>410</b>. This embodiment <b>400</b> has some similarities to the previous embodiment <b>300</b>. For example, wireless communication device <b>410</b> may be implemented using a single integrated circuit <b>410</b><i>a</i>, one or more integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, etc. Also, depending on which components are particularly implemented within the wireless communication device <b>410</b> (i.e., by including a location determination circuitry <b>430</b>), the wireless communication device <b>410</b> may also be operative to communicate with a location service communication device <b>470</b><i>b </i>(e.g., a GPS satellite type location based servicing communication device). In embodiments where the wireless communication device <b>410</b> includes an n-th LBS communication circuitry <b>450</b>, the wireless communication device <b>410</b> may also be operative to communicate with an n-th communication device <b>470</b><i>n </i>(e.g., that operates in accordance with an n-th communication protocol). Each of these radio circuitries is coupled to a baseband circuitry that is operative to perform various digital signal processing functions as well.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">However, at least one difference being that the wireless communication device <b>410</b> is that a BT transceiver circuitry <b>440</b> includes a BT TX circuitry <b>440</b><i>a </i>and a BT RX circuitry <b>440</b><i>b </i>(that is modified with respect to a conventional or typical BT RX circuitry to allow processing of beacons provided by WLAN AP <b>470</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">There is significant re-use or sharing of processing resources, circuitry, etc. within the BT RX circuitry <b>440</b><i>b </i>to perform also the processing of beacons provided by the WLAN AP <b>470</b><i>a </i>to process only a portion of the communications provided from the WLAN AP <b>470</b><i>a </i>includes extracting the MAC address and/or the RSSI measures associated with such communications. In other words, there is very little modification of the BT RX circuitry <b>440</b><i>b </i>to enable the ability to perform processing of communications provided from the WLAN AP <b>470</b><i>a</i>. For example, the one or more antennae of the wireless communication device <b>410</b>, the low noise amplifier (LNA) stages and automatic gain control (AGC) stages, one or more mixers, etc. of the BT RX circuitry <b>440</b><i>b </i>are employed commonly for processing both BT communications as well as for WLAN communications. Even the filter structure within the BT RX circuitry <b>440</b><i>b </i>is same for both BT communications as well as for WLAN communications (with only difference being the values of the coefficients used for each). One additional functional block or circuitry employed to process the beacons provided in accordance with WLAN communications is a SYNC functional block or circuitry, which operates to remove Barker spreading and to identify the strongest signal path, based on which frame timing is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">Generally speaking, by using knowledge of a proximate WLAN AP (e.g., as determined by the IEEE 802.11 MAC address associated therewith), then determination of which LBSs that may be available within the locale of the WLAN AP or the wireless communication device (whose location may be estimated by its proximity to the known location of a WLAN AP with which the wireless communication device may communicate [i.e., receive beacons from]). RSSI information may also e measured, for applications where this additional piece of information is useful (e.g., in accordance with triangulation using communications received from two or more WLAN APs.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">In accordance with performing hybrid position determination, an A-GPS may achieve a faster time to fix first (TTFF) on a Bluetooth and GPC (BT+GPC) processing core combination.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">Referring to the memory <b>330</b><i>a </i>or <b>430</b><i>a </i>of the previous embodiments, a wireless communication device (or user operating such wireless communication device) may download (e.g., via a wireless network connection, a cable connection, BT connection, or other communication connection) a WLAN AP database for a particular geographic region in which the wireless communication device or user is located (e.g., resides, in which the user is traveling, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">Alternatively, if the size of a much larger database (e.g., nationwide database) is not too large, the wireless communication device could be pre-loaded with such a larger database (e.g., of a portion or all of a nation, of a portion of a continent [such as Western Europe], etc.). In order to improve TTFF, the device would then be able to map the AP's MAC address to its corresponding GPS co-ordinates of the AP (e.g., as confirmed with respect to the database). This would operate to give the co-located GPS operative device a good head-start towards initial acquisition in terms of location determination thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">In accordance with performing location determination for a communication device that is only BT capable when no collocated GPS is available, those LBSs that are nearby may also be identified. For example, this mode of operation gives the device some initial clue about its location/whereabouts (e.g., consider Apple's iPod Touch). Therein, the iPhone and iTouch use software from Skyhook Wireless for this purpose. As mentioned above, RSSI information may be used to further refine the accuracy of the wireless communication device's location estimate (e.g., with respect to triangulation).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">WLAN APs, operating in accordance with IEEE 802.11, typically operate at a particular frequency (e.g., 2.4 GHz for IEEE 802.11b, 5 GHz for IEEE 802.11a, etc.) and transmit beacons at the 1 Mbps rate, using DBPSK modulation with direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) spreading at approximately 1 beacon every 100 ms. The MAC address can be obtained from the MAC header as well as the service set identifier (SSID) information, which is embedded in the frame body field of the IEEE 802.11 management frame, if SSID is useful. In general, all demodulated WLAN bits from the beacon could simply be dumped to memory, in order for Firmware to post-process this information in order to obtain the MAC address and other relevant information. RSSI may also be measured on the beacons frames; for array antenna based platforms, the measurement accuracy would be improved even in disperse channels. In accordance with certain WLAN/WiFi service providers, some of them maintain databases of WiFi APs along with their location coordinates, that will be associated with the MAC addresses extracted from communications from such WLAN APs.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">As referred to above, only a reduced or minimum amount of IEEE 802.11 receiver functionality is employed or needed to accommodate the processing of beacons provided from such a WLAN AP.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">With respect to the radio circuitry within such a wireless communication device, the radio receiver path need only be modified in a very minor way to accommodate the 20 MHz wide WLAN signal bandwidth, which is currently narrower to remove ambient country identifier (ACI) and blockers for Bluetooth. The first AADF stages of the radio receiver path have wider than 20 MHz bandwidths and the DS oversampling is high enough to obtain adequate dynamic range.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">With respect to the baseband processing circuitry within such a wireless communication device, the automatic gain control (AGC) circuitry, the IEEE 802.11 frame detection, 11 MHz (single-sided bandwidth) channel select filtering, initial time and frequency correction, followed by channel estimation and demodulation of bits is the normal sequence of flow for some IEEE 802.11b receivers.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">To simplify the baseband processing, there is no need to include any RAKE matched filtering. From the output of the Barker Matched Filter (BMF) based SYNC block, the strongest path may simply be chosen (i.e., instead of doing any combining processing therein). For more disperse channels, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) penalty will increase by taking this short-cut, but in typical cases there may be a minor loss of performance (e.g., 2 to 3 dB in some embodiments). This minor performance loss may be compensated by the fact that in order to minimize the hidden-node problem, AP's (usually connected to wall-power outlets providing 120 V AC at approximately 60 Hz) transmit at higher (and at fixed) transmit levels, than wireless stations (STAs).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">Thus, a simplified baseband hardware module or circuitry of such a wireless communication device may simply comprise of a BMF (simple, 22-tap FIR filter running at 22 MHz). Also, the SYNC block simply picks the strongest path component. Early-late time tracking is performed on samples out of the BMF. Bluetooth's Early-Late hardware can be reused for time tracking purposes. Basically, the BMF gives synchronization to within 1 chip and then time tracking is done to reduce the synchronization error further. Carrier frequency offset (CFO), due to differences in the transmitter and receiver local oscillators (Los), results in a constant phase error at the output of the demodulator and can also be removed by reusing BT circuitry. Also, the start of frame delimiter (SFD) is also used from the frame sync.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">A BT demodulator may be modified (with only a slight modification required) to perform DBPSK demodulation of the beacons provided by a WLAN AP. The IEEE 802.11 receive digital processing is based on operation of I/Q samples at 22 Ms/s, so a sample rate conversion to 22 Ms/s would need to be performed. The rate adapter hardware in the current BT design is able to provide this.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0073">Also, the very same configurable channel select filter as used in current BT design may be employed for processing the beacons provided by the WLAN AP. However it is noted that this will need to be clocked at a higher frequency to accommodate the 20 MHz signal.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">As can be seen, the vast majority of components within the BT receiver may be also used to perform the processing of received beacons from the WLAN AP. The BT receiver architecture lends itself well to a significant level of sharing for use in BT communications. For example, sharing for the processing of both BT and WLAN communications may be made with respect to the one or more antennae, LNA stages and the AGC logic, mixer(s), etc. and even filter structures can remain the same (with the only changes being to the filter coefficient values), in order to support either the narrow band Bluetooth signals or wide band WLAN signals. The main digital block needed is the SYNC block to remove the Barker spreading and identify the strongest signal path, based on which frame timing is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">Also, it is noted that there may be only a need to store demodulated bits from the beacons themselves (e.g., and no need to store any other bits/communications from a WLAN AP or STA transmissions). Therefore, hardware-assist may also be provided to ascertain that the frame is in fact a beacon, before dumping such bits to memory. IEEE 802.11 frames consist of a MAC header, followed by a variable length frame body and then a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC). Beacons can be identified by the all 1s destination MAC address, which is used for broadcast. If the MAC address indicates a beacon, then the remainder of the frame should continue being demodulated. Alternatively, if the MAC address does not indicate a beacon, then the remainder of the frame could be dumped/discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">The hardware-assist is employed to extract the frame duration information from the MAC header, in order to know how long to continue the demodulation processing. However, the CRC checking (FCS) can be performed in firmware, if desired in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">Moreover, there is no need to support carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol, since such wireless communication device operates as a passive, listen-only sniffer that does not ever transmit.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating an embodiment <b>500</b> of regions in which various location based services (LBSs) are provided with respect to locations of access points (APs), respectively. When a wireless communication device is operative to communicate with (at least receive beacons from) an AP, then an estimate of the location of the wireless communication device may be made based on its proximity to the AP. With such knowledge of a location of a wireless communication device or an AP with which the wireless communication device communicates, the location based services (LBSs) provided within the vicinity or near the location of the wireless communication device or the AP.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">For example, each of the wireless communication devices <b>510</b>, <b>510</b><i>a</i>, and <b>510</b><i>b </i>are located within proximity to be able to communicate with (at least receive beacons from) each of the AP <b>520</b> and the AP <b>520</b><i>a</i>. As such, the determined locations of the APs <b>520</b> and <b>520</b><i>a </i>(e.g., based on the MAC addresses of the beacons provided there from), LBSs provided within such vicinities may be presented for availability and use by the wireless communication devices <b>510</b>, <b>510</b><i>a</i>, and <b>510</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram illustrating an embodiment <b>600</b> of triangulation as may be performed within a wireless communication device based on communications received from three or more APs <b>620</b>, <b>620</b><i>a</i>, <b>620</b><i>b </i>and the associated received signal strength indication (RSSI) measures associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">Information associated with communications provided from three or more APs <b>620</b>, <b>620</b><i>a</i>, <b>620</b><i>b </i>(or even more APs not specifically shown in the diagram) may be employed to determine the location of a wireless communication device receiving such communications. Based on the attenuation of signals as they propagate from a first wireless communication device to a second wireless communication device, the RSSI measures associated with such signals may be used to determine how far away a particular WLAN AP is. For example, when the original signal strength is known (e.g., when transmitted from the AP), and then when the received signal strength is determined (e.g., RSSI measure when received at the wireless communication device), then the difference in power or energy (e.g., based on the attenuation during propagation) of those two signals may be correlated to the distance between the wireless communication device and the AP.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">When RSSI measures associated with communications from three or more APs are employed, then triangulation of the two or more signals may be made to estimate more precisely the location of the wireless communication device. For examples, based on the intersections of the vectors associated with the communications from three or more communication devices, a triangulated intersection may be estimated thereby estimating the location of the communication device <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram illustrating an embodiment <b>700</b> of connectivity between a wireless communication device and various other communication devices via a network segment and/or other communication paths.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">A wireless communication device <b>710</b> may be located within a region or vicinity serviced by an AP <b>720</b><i>b</i>. Via the AP <b>720</b><i>b </i>or via another communication link (e.g., network segment <b>799</b>, which may be a satellite/global positioning system (GPS) communication link, an Internet wide area network (WAN), WLAN, and/or cable system), the wireless communication device <b>710</b> may also communicate with other APs <b>720</b> and <b>720</b><i>b</i>, and the wireless communication device <b>710</b> may also access a remote database (D) <b>730</b>), which may include a local map <b>730</b><i>a </i>or a wide-area map <b>730</b><i>b </i>(e.g., such as a nationwide map) corresponding to particular locations of APs. For example, when the wireless communication device receives a communication from the AP <b>720</b><i>b </i>(e.g., a beacon and then extracts the MAC address there from), the wireless communication device <b>710</b> may then access the DB <b>730</b> to retrieve the location associated with the AP <b>720</b><i>b </i>(e.g., by comparing the extracted MAC address to one of the maps within the DB <b>730</b>). Alternatively, the wireless communication device <b>710</b> may retrieve and download such lists of AP locations from the DB <b>730</b> before extracting a MAC address from a communication received from the AP <b>720</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">The firmware of such a wireless communication device may be implemented to schedule when to look for such WLAN AP/IEEE 802.11 beacons. The format of a management frame (of which, the beacon is one type) is illustrated below). Approximately 1 beacon is transmitted per 100 ms (typical), but the beacon can be delayed by a few milli-seconds if the AP is completing a transaction with another wireless communication device/wireless station (STA). To perform effective receipt and processing of beacons provided by a WLAN AP, there is only a need to receive 1 beacon (i.e., the very first one), so there is not necessarily any benefit to recording the embedded timestamp information and beacon interval info to help with BT coexistence (e.g., to narrow the search window for future beacon transmissions from the same WLAN AP).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram illustrating an embodiment <b>800</b> of format of a management frame. For LBS service identification, the only information needed from the beacon frame is the WLAN AP's MAC address. This MAC address is the &#x2018;fingerprint&#x2019; of the AP and is all that is really needed for LBS database (at least those based on or with respect to the location of the WLAN AP), i.e. the database associates the GPS coordinates of the AP with its MAC address.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">Moreover, RSSI information may also be useful, for example, if there are multiple APs being used for triangulation, etc. such as depicted herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">After the hardware has indicated that it has detected a beacon, and the hardware then dumps all the bits (e.g., as few as approximately 400 bits or as long as approximately 2000 bits) to memory, the firmware can take over and do the CRC check and then extract the MAC address information there from. It is noted tote that the beacon frame body length is variable because as the IEEE 802.11 specification has evolved to higher rates and a richer feature set, more information elements have been added to the frame body, for the newer STAs to exploit the added capabilities.</p>

For example, if a user has just powered up a wireless communication device (e.g., a phone), and the user wants to quickly to find out which APs are present in the vicinity, the wireless communication device could send probe requests on the WLAN center frequencies and receive probe responses from the nearby APs (the probe response format is almost identical to that of a beacon).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0106">With this variation of a wireless communication device in providing probe requests (i.e., having TX capability), however, it is noted that such a wireless communication device is no longer a passive, IEEE 802.11 sniffer type of device (i.e., that includes no TX capability). In such an embodiment, there may be a need to implement a CSMA/CA protocol (i.e., to decode the NAVs to figure out when a probe request may be transmitted).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0107">Also, there may be some WiFi Alliance certification issues encountered if a subset of the IEEE 802.11 specification is implemented and communication are attempted in accordance with standard WLAN APs.

In contrast, the co-located GPS may synchronize faster than the WiFi-based coarse positioning. Practically speaking, in some applications, it may not be worth the cost to add active scanning and 1 Mbps WiFi transmit capability within such a wireless communication device (e.g., the protocol capability as well as TX path modifications to allow the transmitting of probe requests).</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0124">In some embodiments, the baseband processing circuitry <b>1331</b> is operative to process the uni-directional communications comporting with the second communication protocol thereby calculating a received signal strength indication (RSSI) measure associated therewith. The estimate of the location of the wireless communication device <b>1310</b> and/or the estimate of the location of the at least one additional transmitting wireless communication device is derived from both the MAC address and the RSSI measure (i.e., not the MAC address alone, but using both the MAC address and the RSSI measure [which may be employed in accordance with ranging operations]).</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0127">When implemented within a particular embodiment, the location determination circuitry <b>1330</b> is operative to compare the MAC address to a number of MAC addresses (e.g., such as retrieved from a remote database, stored within the memory <b>1330</b><i>a</i>, from a combination thereof, etc.). Based upon a favorable comparison of the MAC address with one of the MAC addresses (e.g., matching up with one another), the location determination circuitry <b>1330</b> is operative to estimate a location of the wireless communication device <b>1310</b> and/or a location of the communication device <b>1370</b><i>b</i>. An estimate of the location of the communication device <b>1370</b><i>b </i>(that is firstly calculated) may be employed to make an estimate of the location of the wireless communication device <b>1310</b>.</p>
