<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/376,919, filed Mar. 15, 2006 and entitled &#x201c;System and Method for Providing Network Security to Mobile Devices,&#x201d; which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/750,326, filed Dec. 13, 2005 and entitled &#x201c;Personal Security Appliance,&#x201d; which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to network security, and more particularly provides a system and method for providing network security to mobile devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The internet is an interconnection of millions of individual computer networks owned by governments, universities, nonprofit groups, companies and individuals. While the internet is a great source of valuable information and entertainment, the internet has also become a major source of system damaging and system fatal application code, such as &#x201c;viruses,&#x201d; &#x201c;spyware,&#x201d; &#x201c;adware,&#x201d; &#x201c;worms,&#x201d; &#x201c;Trojan horses,&#x201d; and other malicious code.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To protect users, programmers design computer and computer-network security systems for blocking malicious code from attacking both individual and network computers. On the most part, network security systems have been relatively successful. A computer that connects to the internet from within an enterprise's network typically has two lines of defense. The first line of defense includes a network security system, which may be part of the network gateway, that includes firewalls, anti-virus, anti-spyware and content filtering. The second line of defense includes individual security software on individual machines, which is not typically as secure as the network security system and is thus more vulnerable to attacks. In combination, the first and second lines of defense together provide pretty good security protection. However, when a device connects to the internet without the intervening network security system, the device loses its first line of defense. Thus, mobile devices (e.g., laptops, desktops, PDAs such as RIM's Blackberry, cell phones, any wireless device that connects to the internet, etc.) when traveling outside the enterprise network are more vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example network system <b>100</b> of the prior art. Network system <b>100</b> includes a desktop <b>105</b> and a mobile device <b>110</b>, each coupled to an enterprise's intranet <b>115</b>. The intranet <b>115</b> is coupled via a network security system <b>120</b> (which may be a part of the enterprise's gateway) to the untrusted internet <b>130</b>. Accordingly, the desktop <b>105</b> and mobile device <b>110</b> access the internet <b>130</b> via the network security system <b>120</b>. A security administrator <b>125</b> typically manages the network security system <b>120</b> to assure that it includes the most current security protection and thus that the desktop <b>105</b> and mobile device <b>110</b> are protected from malicious code. Demarcation <b>135</b> divides the trusted enterprise <b>140</b> and the untrusted public internet <b>130</b>. Because the desktop <b>105</b> and the mobile device <b>110</b> are connected to the internet <b>130</b> via the network security system <b>120</b>, both have two lines of defense (namely, the network security system <b>120</b> and the security software resident on the device itself) against malicious code from the internet <b>130</b>. Of course, although trusted, the intranet <b>115</b> can also be a source of malicious code.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example network system <b>200</b> of the prior art, when the mobile device <b>110</b> has traveled outside the trusted enterprise <b>140</b> and reconnected to the untrusted internet <b>130</b>. This could occur perhaps when the user takes mobile device <b>110</b> on travel and connects to the internet <b>130</b> at a cybercafe, at a hotel, or via any untrusted wired or wireless connection. Accordingly, as shown, the mobile device <b>110</b> is no longer protected by the first line of defense (by the network security system <b>120</b>) and thus has increased its risk of receiving malicious code. Further, by physically bringing the mobile device <b>110</b> back into the trusted enterprise <b>140</b> and reconnecting from within, the mobile device <b>110</b> risks transferring any malicious code received to the intranet <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As the number of mobile devices and the number of attacks grow, mobile security is becoming increasingly important. The problem was emphasized in the recent Info-Security Conference in New York on Dec. 7-8, 2005. However, no complete solutions were presented.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is a need for personal security appliances capable of providing levels of network security as provided by enterprise network security systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

The third mobile device <b>310</b> may be in use by an employee of the trusted enterprise <b>340</b> who is currently on travel. A security administrator <b>325</b> manages the mobile security system <b>345</b><i>a</i>, the mobile security system <b>345</b><i>b</i>, and the network security system <b>320</b> to assure that they include the most current security protection. One skilled in the art will recognize that the same security administrator need not manage the various devices. Further, the security administrator could be the user and need not be within the trusted enterprise <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Demarcation <b>335</b> divides the trusted enterprise <b>340</b> and the untrusted publicly accessible internet <b>330</b>. Each of mobile device <b>310</b><i>a</i>, <b>310</b><i>b </i>and <b>310</b><i>c </i>may be referred to generically as mobile device <b>310</b>, although they need not be identical. Each mobile security system <b>345</b><i>a </i>and <b>345</b><i>b </i>may be referred to generically as mobile security system <b>345</b>, although they need not be identical.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown, although the mobile device <b>310</b><i>c </i>has traveled outside the trusted enterprise <b>340</b>, the mobile device <b>310</b><i>c </i>connects to the untrusted internet <b>330</b> via the mobile security system <b>345</b><i>b </i>and thus retains two lines of defense (namely, the mobile security system <b>345</b><i>b </i>and the security software resident on the device itself). In this embodiment, the mobile security system <b>345</b> effectively acts as a mobile internet gateway on behalf of the mobile device <b>310</b><i>c</i>. In an embodiment, the mobile security system <b>345</b> may be a device dedicated to network security. In an embodiment, each mobile security system <b>345</b> may support multiple mobile devices <b>310</b>, and possibly only registered mobile devices <b>310</b>, e.g., those belonging to enterprise <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each mobile security system <b>345</b> (e.g., <b>345</b><i>a</i>, <b>345</b><i>b</i>) may be a miniature server, based on commercial hardware (with Intel's Xscale as the core), Linux OS and network services, and open-source firewall, IDS/IPS and antivirus protection. The mobile security system <b>345</b> may be based on a hardened embedded Linux 2.6.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, because the security administrator <b>325</b> is capable of remotely communicating with the mobile security system <b>345</b><i>b</i>, IT can monitor and/or update the security policies/data/engines implemented on the mobile security system <b>345</b><i>b</i>. The security administrator <b>325</b> can centrally manage all enterprise devices, remotely or directly. Further, the security administrator <b>325</b> and mobile security systems <b>345</b> can interact to automatically translate enterprise security policies into mobile security policies and configure mobile security systems <b>345</b> accordingly. Because the mobile security system <b>345</b> may be generated from the relevant security policies of the enterprise <b>340</b>, the mobile device <b>310</b><i>c </i>currently traveling may have the same level of protection as the devices <b>305</b>/<b>310</b> within the trusted enterprise <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The mobile security system <b>345</b> may be designed as an add-on to existing software security or to replace all security hardware and software on a traveling mobile device. These security applications will preferably operate on different OSI layers to provide maximum security and malicious code detection, as shown in the example system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Operating on the lower OSI layers and doing TCP/IP packets analysis only (by screening firewall or router packets) would miss virus and/or worm behavior. Also, many modern viruses use mobile code implemented on a &#x201c;higher&#x201d; level than the 7<sup>th </sup>OSI layer (Application&#x2014;HTTP, FTP, etc.) and therefore cannot be interpreted at the packet layer nor at the application layer. For example, applying antivirus analysis only at the session or transport layer on a malicious Java Script (that is included in an HTML page), trying to match the signature with packets and without understanding the content type (Java Script), will not detect the malicious nature of the Java Script. To offer greater protection, the mobile security system <b>345</b> may act as corporate class security appliance and engage different security applications based on the content type and the appropriate OSI layers, (or even a &#x201c;higher&#x201d; level if content is encapsulated in the application layer). The mobile security system <b>345</b> may be configured to perform content analysis at different OSI layers, e.g., from the packet level to the application level. It will be appreciated that performing deep inspection at the application level is critical to detect malicious content behavior and improve detection of viruses, worms, spyware, Trojan horses, etc. The following software packages may be implemented on the mobile security system <b>345</b>:

<p id="p-0035" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram illustrating details of an example computer system <b>400</b>, of which each desktop <b>305</b>, mobile device <b>310</b>, network security system <b>320</b>, mobile security system <b>345</b>, and security administrator <b>325</b> may be an instance. Computer system <b>400</b> includes a processor <b>405</b>, such as an Intel Pentium&#xae; microprocessor or a Motorola Power PC&#xae; microprocessor, coupled to a communications channel <b>410</b>. The computer system <b>400</b> further includes an input device <b>415</b> such as a keyboard or mouse, an output device <b>420</b> such as a cathode ray tube display, a communications device <b>425</b>, a data storage device <b>430</b> such as a magnetic disk, and memory <b>435</b> such as Random-Access Memory (RAM), each coupled to the communications channel <b>410</b>. The communications interface <b>425</b> may be coupled directly or via a mobile security system <b>345</b> to a network such as the internet. One skilled in the art will recognize that, although the data storage device <b>430</b> and memory <b>435</b> are illustrated as different units, the data storage device <b>430</b> and memory <b>435</b> can be parts of the same unit, distributed units, virtual memory, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">The data storage device <b>430</b> and/or memory <b>435</b> may store an operating system <b>440</b> such as the Microsoft Windows XP, the IBM OS/2 operating system, the MAC OS, UNIX OS, LINUX OS and/or other programs <b>445</b>. It will be appreciated that a preferred embodiment may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned. An embodiment may be written using JAVA, C, and/or C++ language, or other programming languages, possibly using object oriented programming methodology.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">One skilled in the art will recognize that the computer system <b>400</b> may also include additional information, such as network connections, additional memory, additional processors, LANs, input/output lines for transferring information across a hardware channel, the internet or an intranet, etc. One skilled in the art will also recognize that the programs and data may be received by and stored in the system in alternative ways. For example, a computer-readable storage medium (CRSM) reader <b>450</b> such as a magnetic disk drive, hard disk drive, magneto-optical reader, CPU, etc. may be coupled to the communications bus <b>410</b> for reading a computer-readable storage medium (CRSM) <b>455</b> such as a magnetic disk, a hard disk, a magneto-optical disk, RAM, etc. Accordingly, the computer system <b>400</b> may receive programs and/or data via the CRSM reader <b>450</b>. Further, it will be appreciated that the term &#x201c;memory&#x201d; herein is intended to cover all data storage media whether permanent or temporary.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram illustrating details of the mobile security system <b>345</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Mobile security system <b>345</b> includes adapters/ports/drivers <b>505</b>, memory <b>510</b>, a processor <b>515</b>, a preboot flash/ROM memory module <b>520</b> storing a secure version of the mobile security system's operating system and other applications, network connection module <b>525</b>, security engines <b>530</b>, security policies <b>535</b>, security data <b>540</b>, remote management module <b>550</b>, distribution module <b>555</b>, and backup module <b>560</b>. Although these modules are illustrated as within the mobile security system <b>345</b>, one skilled in the art will recognize that many of them could be located elsewhere, e.g., on the security administrator <b>325</b> or on third-party systems in communication with the mobile security system <b>345</b>. The mobile security system <b>345</b> may be in a pocket-size, handheld-size or key-chain size housing, or possibly smaller. Further, the mobile security system <b>345</b> may be incorporated within the mobile device <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">The adapters/ports/drivers <b>505</b> include connection mechanisms (including software, e.g., drivers) for USB, Ethernet, WiFi, WiMAX, GSM, CDMA, BlueTooth, PCMCIA and/or other connection data ports on the mobile security system <b>345</b>. In one embodiment, the adapters/ports/drivers <b>505</b> may be capable of connection to multiple devices <b>310</b> to provide network security to the multiple devices <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045">Memory <b>510</b> and processor <b>515</b> execute the operating system and applications on the mobile security system <b>345</b>. In this example, the preboot flash <b>520</b> stores the operating system and applications. At boot time, the operating system and applications are loaded from the preboot flash <b>520</b> into memory <b>510</b> for execution. Since the operating system and applications are stored in the preboot flash <b>520</b>, which cannot be accessed during runtime by the user, the operating system and applications in the preboot flash <b>520</b> are not corruptible. Should the copy of the operating system and applications in memory <b>510</b> be corrupted, e.g., by malicious code, the operating system and applications may be reloaded into the memory <b>510</b> from the preboot flash <b>520</b>, e.g., upon restart. Although described as stored within the preboot flash <b>520</b>, the OS and applications can be securely stored within other read-only memory devices, such as ROM, PROM, EEPROM, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, memory (including memory <b>510</b> and preboot flash <b>520</b>) on the mobile security system <b>345</b> may be divided into the following zones: read only memory <b>570</b>; random access memory <b>575</b> for storing a copy of the OS, kernel and security applications; runtime environment <b>580</b>; and database <b>585</b> for storing application data, log files, etc. Upon each &#x201c;hard&#x201d; restart, the boot loader (resident in read only memory <b>570</b>) of the mobile security system <b>345</b> copies the kernel and security applications (a fresh unchanged copy) from read only memory <b>570</b> to random access memory <b>575</b>. This causes a clean version of the OS and applications to be loaded into random access memory <b>575</b> each time. That way, if a special attack on mobile security system <b>345</b> is developed, the attack will be unable to infect the system, since the OS and applications are precluded from accessing read only memory <b>570</b> during runtime. Further, any attack that does reach memory <b>510</b> will be able to run only once and will disappear upon a hard restart. A triggering mechanism may be available to restart the mobile security system <b>345</b> automatically upon infection detection.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">The network connection module <b>525</b> enables network connection, e.g., to the internet <b>330</b> or the intranet <b>315</b> via network communication hardware/software including WiFi, WiMAX, CDMA, GSM, GPRS, Ethernet, modem, etc. For example, if the mobile device <b>310</b> wishes to connect to the internet <b>330</b> via a WiFi connection, the adapters/ports/drivers <b>505</b> may be connected to the PCI port, USB port or PCMCIA port of the mobile device <b>310</b>, and the network connection module <b>525</b> of the mobile security system <b>345</b> may include a WiFi network interface card for connecting to wireless access points. Using the network connection module <b>425</b>, the mobile security system <b>345</b> may communicate with the network as a secure gateway for the mobile device <b>310</b>. Other connection architectures are described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">The security engines <b>530</b> execute security programs based on the security policies <b>535</b> and on security data <b>540</b>, both of which may be developed by IT managers. Security engines <b>530</b> may include firewalls, VPN, IPS/IDS, anti-virus, anti-spyware, malicious content filtering, multilayered security monitors, Java and bytecode monitors, etc. Each security engine <b>530</b> may have dedicated security policies <b>535</b> and security data <b>540</b> to indicate which procedures, content, URLs, system calls, etc. the engines <b>530</b> may or may not allow. The security engines <b>530</b>, security policies <b>535</b> and security data <b>540</b> may be the same as, a subset of, and/or developed from the engines, policies and data on the network security system <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">To provide a higher security level provided by antivirus and antispyware software, the security engines <b>530</b> on each mobile security system <b>345</b> may implement content analysis and risk assessment algorithms. Operating for example at OSI Layer 7 and above (mobile code encapsulated within Layer 7), these algorithms may be executed by dedicated High Risk Content Filtering (HRCF) that can be controlled by a rules engine and rule updates. The HRCF will be based on a powerful detection library that can perform deep content analysis to verify real content types. This is because many attacks are hidden within wrong mime types and/or may use sophisticated tricks to present a text file type to a dangerous active script or ActiveX content type. The HRCF may integrate with a URL categorization security engine <b>530</b> for automatic rule adjustment based on the URL category. In one embodiment, when the risk level increases (using the described mechanism) the mobile security system <b>345</b> may automatically adjust and increase filtering to remove more active content from the traffic. For example, if greater risk is determined, every piece of mobile code, e.g., Java script, VB script, etc. may be stripped out.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050">Three aspects for integration with corporate policy server legacy systems include rules, LDAP and active directory, and logging and reporting as discussed below. In one embodiment, a policy import agent running on the security administrator <b>325</b> will access the rule base of Checkpoint Firewall-1 and Cisco PIX Firewalls and import them into a local copy. A rule analysis module will process the important rules and will offer out-of-the-box rules and policies for mobile security systems <b>345</b>. This proposed policy will offer all mobile security systems <b>345</b> a best fit of rules that conform the firewall policy of the enterprise <b>340</b>. The agent will run periodically to reflect any changes and generate updates for mobile security system <b>345</b> policies <b>535</b>. The LDAP and Active Directory may be integrated with the directory service to maintain mobile security system <b>345</b> security policies <b>535</b> that respond to the enterprise's directory definitions. For example, a corporate policy for LDAP user Group &#x201c;G&#x201d; may automatically propagate to all mobile security systems <b>345</b> in &#x201c;G&#x201d; group. Mobile security system <b>345</b> local logs and audit trails may be sent in accordance to a logging and reporting policy to a central log stored at the security administrator <b>325</b>. Using a web interface, IT may be able to generate reports and audit views related to all mobile device <b>310</b> users, their internet experiences, and attempts to bring infected devices back to the enterprise <b>340</b>. IT will be able to forward events and log records into legacy management systems via SYSLOG and SNMP Traps.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">The security engines <b>530</b> may perform weighted risk analysis. For example, the security engine <b>530</b> may analyze HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IM, P2P, etc. including any traffic arriving from the internet <b>330</b>. The security engine <b>530</b> may assign a weight and rank for every object based on its type, complexity, richness in abilities, source of the object, etc. The security engine <b>530</b> may assign weight based on the source using a list of known dangerous or known safe sources. The security engine <b>530</b> may assign weight to objects based on the category of the source, e.g., a gambling source, an adult content source, a news source, a reputable company source, a banking source, etc. The security engine <b>530</b> may calculate the weight, and based on the result determine whether to allow or disallow access to the content, the script to run, the system modification to occur, etc. The security engine <b>530</b> may &#x201c;learn&#x201d; user content (by analyzing for a predetermined period of time the general content that the user accesses) and accordingly may create personal content profiles. The personal content profile may be used to calibrate the weight assigned to content during runtime analysis to improve accuracy and tailor weighted risk analysis for specific user characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">In some embodiments, the security engines <b>530</b>, security policies <b>535</b> and security data <b>540</b> may enable bypassing the mobile security system <b>345</b>. The security policy <b>535</b>, set by the security administrator <b>325</b>, may include a special attribute to force network connection through the mobile security system <b>325</b> when outside the trusted enterprise <b>340</b>. Thus, if this attribute is set &#x201c;on,&#x201d; when a mobile device <b>310</b> attempts to connect to the internet <b>330</b> without the mobile security system <b>345</b> and not from within the trusted enterprise <b>340</b>, all data transfer connections including LAN connection, USB-net, modem, Bluetooth, WiFi, etc. may be closed. The mobile device <b>310</b> may be totally isolated and unable to connect to any network, including the internet <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">In one embodiment, to enable this, when first connecting the mobile security system <b>345</b> to the mobile device <b>310</b> using for example the USB cable (for both power and USB connection creation), the USB plug &#x26; play device driver will be sent into the mobile device <b>310</b>. The installed driver may be &#x201c;Linux.inf&#x201d; which allows a USB-net connection for the mobile security system <b>345</b>. This connection allows the mobile security system <b>345</b> to access the internet <b>330</b> via the USB port and using the mobile device <b>310</b> network connection plus additional code (&#x201c;the connection client&#x201d;). In a Windows example, the connection client may be installed at the NDIS level of the mobile device <b>310</b> above all the network interface cards of every network connection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The implementation will be as an NDIS Intermediate (IM) Driver or NDIS-Hooking Filter Driver. Both implementations may be at the kernel level, so that an end user cannot stop or remove it. When starting the mobile device <b>310</b>, the connection client may attempt to connect to the security administrator <b>325</b> or the network security system <b>320</b> locally within the trusted enterprise <b>340</b>. If the node is not found (finding via VPN is considered as not found in local LAN), the connection client will assume it is working from outside the trusted enterprise <b>340</b> and expects to find the mobile security system <b>345</b> connected, e.g., via USB-net or other connection mechanism. If the mobile security system <b>345</b> is not found, the connection client may avoid any communication to any network connection. By a policy definition, this behavior can be modified to allow communication to the enterprise <b>340</b> via VPN installed in the mobile device <b>310</b>. Similarly, in case of a mobile device system <b>345</b> failure, all traffic may be disabled, except for the VPN connection into the enterprise <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">It will be appreciated that NDIS is one possible implementation of intercepting traffic at the kernel level. For example, in another embodiment, the system may hook Winsock or apply other ways that may be in future Windows versions.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">In an embodiment where the mobile security system <b>345</b> supports multiple mobile devices <b>310</b>, the security engines <b>530</b>, security policies <b>535</b> and security data <b>540</b> may be different for each mobile device <b>310</b> (e.g., based on for example user preferences or IT decision). Alternatively, it can apply the same engines <b>530</b>, policies <b>535</b> and data <b>540</b> for all connected devices <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">The remote management module <b>550</b> enables communication with security administrator <b>325</b> (and/or other security administrators), and enables local updating of security engines <b>530</b>, security policies <b>535</b>, security data <b>540</b> including signatures and other applications. In one embodiment, modification to the security policies <b>535</b> and data <b>540</b> can be done by the security administrator <b>325</b> only. The remote management module <b>550</b> of the mobile security system <b>345</b> may receive updates from an update authorities device (UAD), e.g., on the security administrator <b>325</b> via a secured connection. A UAD may operate on an update server at a customer IT center located on the internet <b>330</b> to forward updates to mobile security systems <b>345</b> that possibly do not belong to an enterprise <b>540</b> in charge of managing updates. A UAD may operate on a mobile security system <b>345</b>. Security engine <b>530</b> updates may modify the antivirus engine DLL, etc. OS and security application updates may be implemented only from within the enterprise <b>540</b> while connecting to the security administrator <b>325</b> and via an encrypted and authenticated connection.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">The security administrator <b>325</b> can modify URL black and white lists for remote support to traveling users. In case of false positives, the security administrator <b>325</b> may allow access to certain URLs, by bypassing the proactive heuristics security but still monitoring by firewall, antivirus, IPS/IDS, etc. Additional remote device-management features may enable the security administrator <b>325</b> to perform remote diagnostics, access local logs, change configuration parameters, etc. on the mobile security system <b>345</b>. The security administrator <b>325</b> may delegate tasks to a helpdesk for support.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">The remote management module <b>550</b> may communicate with a wizard (e.g., wizard <b>745</b>), which may be on the security administrator <b>325</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, or on another system. Details of the wizard <b>745</b> and details of the communication schemes between the remote management module <b>550</b> and the wizard <b>745</b> are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">The distribution module <b>555</b> enables distribution of updates, e.g., security policy <b>535</b> updates including rule updates, security data <b>540</b> updates including signature updates, security engine <b>530</b> updates, application/OS updates, etc. by the mobile security system <b>345</b> to N other mobile security systems <b>345</b>. A routing table identifying the N other mobile security systems <b>345</b> to whom to forward the updates may be provided to the distribution module <b>555</b> to enable system <b>345</b> to system <b>345</b> communication. Updates may be implemented according to policies set by the security administrator <b>325</b>. When forwarding updates, the distribution module <b>555</b> acts as a UAD.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060">Each mobile security system <b>345</b> may obtain its routing table with security information updates, periodically, at predetermined times, upon login, etc. The routing tables may be maintained on a server, e.g., the security administrator <b>325</b> or another mobile security system <b>345</b>. In one embodiment, the mobile security systems <b>345</b> may contact the server to retrieve the routing tables. Alternatively, the server may push the routing tables to the mobile security systems <b>345</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0061">The distribution module <b>555</b> may enable rapid updates as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Currently, all commercial antivirus products available do not update devices faster than viruses spread. To assure that a new virus attack does not spread faster than for example signature updates, each mobile security system <b>345</b> may be an active UAD. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each mobile security system <b>345</b> is responsible for forwarding the signature updates to four other devices <b>345</b>. As one skilled in the art will recognize, all devices <b>345</b> need to forward to the same number of other devices <b>345</b>. Multiple devices <b>345</b> may be responsible for forwarding to the same device <b>345</b>. When necessary, offline devices <b>345</b> being activated may poll the server, e.g., the security administrator <b>325</b>, for routing table updates. Many other updating techniques are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0062">The backup module <b>560</b> may constantly backup image and changes of the boot sector and system files of the mobile device <b>310</b> into the flash memory <b>520</b> or into another persistent memory device. That way, in case of major failure, including a loss of the system or boot sector of the mobile device <b>310</b>, the mobile security system <b>345</b> may be identified as a CD-ROM during reboot and may launch the backup module (or separate program) to restore the boot sector and system files on the mobile device <b>310</b>, thereby recovering the mobile device <b>310</b> without the need for IT support. In an embodiment where the network security system <b>345</b> supports multiple mobile devices <b>310</b>, the backup module <b>560</b> may contain separate boot sector and system files for each of the mobile devices <b>310</b>, if different.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram illustrating details of a smart policy updating system <b>700</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System <b>700</b> includes the security administrator <b>325</b> coupled to the network security system <b>320</b> and to the mobile security system <b>345</b>. The network security system <b>320</b> includes security engines <b>705</b>, including an antivirus engine <b>715</b>, an IPS/IDS engine <b>720</b>, a firewall engine <b>725</b>, and other security engines. The network security system <b>320</b> also includes security policies and data <b>710</b>, including antivirus policies and data <b>730</b>, IPS/IDS policies and data <b>735</b>, firewall policies and data <b>740</b>, and other policies and data. Similarly, the mobile security system <b>345</b> includes an antivirus engine <b>755</b>, an IPS/IDS engine <b>760</b>, a firewall engine <b>765</b>, and other engines. The mobile security system <b>345</b> also includes security policies and data <b>535</b>/<b>540</b>, including antivirus security policies and data <b>770</b>, IPS/IDS security policies and data <b>775</b>, firewall security policies and data <b>780</b>, and other security policies and data.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0064">The security administrator <b>325</b> includes a wizard <b>745</b> for enabling substantially automatic initial and possibly dynamic setup of the security engines <b>530</b>, security policies <b>535</b> and security data <b>540</b> on the mobile security system <b>345</b>. In one embodiment, the wizard <b>745</b> may automatically load all security engines <b>705</b> and policies and data <b>710</b> of the network security system <b>320</b> as the security engines <b>530</b> and policies and data <b>535</b>/<b>540</b> on the mobile security system <b>345</b>. In another embodiment, the wizard <b>745</b> may include all security engines <b>705</b> and policies and data <b>710</b> except those known to be irrelevant, e.g., those related to billing software used by accounting, those relating to web software running only on the web servers, etc. In another embodiment, the engines <b>530</b> would need to be loaded by an IT manager, and would not be loaded automatically by the wizard <b>745</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">In one embodiment, the wizard <b>745</b> may determine whether the mobile security system <b>345</b> requires a particular security engine <b>530</b>, e.g., an antivirus engine <b>755</b>, IPS/IDS engine <b>760</b>, firewall engine <b>765</b>, etc. If so determined, then the wizard <b>745</b> would load the engine <b>530</b> onto the mobile security system <b>345</b>. The wizard <b>745</b> would then determine which policies and data sets, e.g., some for antivirus engine <b>755</b>, some for the IPS/IDS engine <b>760</b>, some for the firewall engine <b>765</b>, etc. are important to the mobile security system <b>345</b>. The wizard <b>745</b> will then determine which of the antivirus policies and data <b>730</b> on the network security system <b>320</b> are relevant to the antivirus policies and data <b>770</b> on the mobile security system <b>345</b>, which of the IPS/IDS policies and data <b>735</b> on the network security system <b>320</b> are relevant to the IPS/IDS policies and data <b>775</b> on the mobile security system <b>345</b>, which of the firewall policies and data <b>740</b> on the network security system <b>320</b> are relevant to the firewall policies and data <b>780</b> on the mobile security system <b>345</b>, and which of the other policies and data on the network security system <b>320</b> are relevant to the policies and data on the mobile security system <b>345</b>. As stated above, the wizard <b>745</b> may determine that all security engines <b>705</b> or just a subset are needed on the mobile security system <b>345</b>. The wizard <b>745</b> may determine that all policies and data <b>710</b> for a given engine type or just a subset should be forwarded. The wizard <b>745</b> may determine which relevant policies and data <b>710</b> should be forwarded to the mobile security system <b>345</b> based on rules developed by an IT manager, based on item-by-item selection during the setup procedure, etc. Alternative to the wizard <b>745</b>, an IT manager can setup the engines <b>530</b> and policies and data <b>535</b>/<b>540</b> on the mobile security system <b>345</b> without the wizard <b>745</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">The security administrator <b>325</b> may also include an update authorities device <b>750</b>. The update authorities device <b>750</b> may obtain security system updates (e.g., signature updates) and may send the updates to the network security system <b>320</b> and to the mobile security system <b>345</b>. One skilled in the art will recognize that the updates to the network security system <b>320</b> and the updates to the mobile security system <b>345</b> need not be the same. Further, the update authorities device <b>750</b> may obtain the updates from security managers, security engine developers, antivirus specialists, etc. The update authorities device <b>750</b> may forward the updates to all network security systems <b>320</b> and all mobile security systems <b>345</b>, or may forward routing tables to all mobile security systems <b>345</b> and the updates only to an initial set of mobile security systems <b>345</b>. The initial set of mobile security systems <b>345</b> may forward the updates to the mobile security systems <b>345</b> identified in the routing tables in a P2P manner, similar to the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As stated above, each mobile security system <b>345</b> operating to forward updates is itself acting as an update authorities device <b>750</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067">Other applications may be included on the mobile security system <b>345</b>. For example, add-on applications for recurring revenue from existing customers may include general email, anti-spam, direct and secured email delivery, information vaults, safe skype and other instant messaging services, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">Email Security and Anti-spam&#x2014;implementation of mail relay on mobile security systems <b>345</b> (including the web security engine above) and a local spam quarantine (based on SendMail or similar process) may implement a complete mail security suite (SMTP and POP3) including anti-spam with real time indexing (via online web spam quarries). Users may have access to the quarantine to review spam messages, release messages, modify and custom spam rules, etc., via a web interface.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">Direct and Secured Email Delivery based on mail relay will allow the mobile security system <b>345</b> to send user email directly from one mobile security system <b>345</b> to another mobile security system <b>345</b> without using in route mail servers. This allows corporate users to send emails that need not travel in the internet, thus leaving trace and duplicates on different unknown mail servers in route. This combined with the ability to use a secured pipe between two mobile security systems is valuable to corporations. Without such methodology, people could trace emails exchange without accessing to the enterprise's mail server, by tracking down copies in intermediate mail servers that were used to deliver the messages.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">Information Vault&#x2014;Application to encrypt and store end user information on the mobile security system <b>345</b> may be available only to authorized users via a web interface and a web server implemented on every mobile security system <b>345</b> (e.g., BOA, Apache, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0071">Safe Skype and Other IM&#x2014;implementing an instant messaging client on the mobile security system <b>345</b> can guarantee that the instant messaging system or P2P application has no access to data on the mobile device <b>310</b>. Adding a chipset of AC/97 to provide a sound interface on the mobile security system <b>325</b> could allow users to talk and receive calls directly from/to the mobile security system <b>325</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0072">Although not shown, a small battery may be included with the mobile security system <b>345</b>. This battery may be charged by the USB connection during runtime or using the power adapter at any time. The battery may guarantee proper shutdown, e.g., when user disconnects the USB cable from the mobile security system <b>345</b>. It will be signaled by the system which will launch applications and system shutdown. This will ensure a proper state of the file system and flashing open files buffers.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0073">A multi-layered defense and detection abilities is required. This may be done by a special code that is constantly monitoring the scanning result by different systems (antivirus, IDS/IPS, firewall, antispyware, URL category, etc.) and at different levels to build a puzzle and identify an attack even if it's not recognized by each of the individual subsystems. By doing this, the mobile security system <b>345</b> will maintain and in some cases even improve the security level provided within the enterprise <b>540</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074">One available benefit of the mobile security system <b>345</b> is its ability to enforce the policy of the enterprise <b>540</b> on the end user while they are traveling or working from home. Since the mobile security system <b>345</b> uses similar security engines and policy as when connected from within the enterprise <b>540</b> and since the end user cannot access the internet <b>330</b> without it (except via VPN connection into the enterprise <b>546</b>), IT may be capable of enforcing its security policy beyond the boundaries of the enterprise <b>540</b>. The OS may be under the entire supervision of IT, while the mobile security system <b>3450</b>S acts as an end user OS under his control. This resolves the problems of who controls what and how security and productivity face minimal compromise.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075">A standalone version of the mobile security system <b>345</b> may offer the same functionality, and may provide a local management interface via web browser. Attractive to home users and small offices that lack an IT department, the mobile security system <b>345</b> enables the end user to launch a browser, connect to the mobile security system <b>345</b>, set the different policies (update policy, security rules, etc.) including modifying the white and black URL lists, etc. There is also an opportunity to provide end users with a service of remote management of the mobile security systems <b>345</b> by subscription.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</figref>, <b>10</b>B and <b>10</b>C illustrate three example architectures of connecting a mobile security system <b>345</b> to a mobile device <b>310</b>, in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.
