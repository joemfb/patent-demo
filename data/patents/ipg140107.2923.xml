<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to binding proteins and compositions thereof, for example antibodies and antigen binding portions specific to lipid metabolites such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>), and methods of making, characterizing, and using them in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bioactive lipids such as prostaglandin (PG), thromboxane (TX), leukotriene (LT), and sphingosine-1-phosphate play a critical physiological role in the etiology of various disorders. (Wymann, M P and Schneiter R, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 9(2):162-76 (2008)). During inflammation, cellular phospholipases, especially phospholipases A2 and C, are activated and degrade cell membrane phospholipids to arachidonic acid (AA). AA is metabolized by two major routes, the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipooxygenase (LO) pathways. The COX pathway produces prostaglandins (PGD<sub>2</sub>, PGE<sub>2</sub>, PGF<sub>2&#x3b1;</sub>, prostacyclin or PGI<sub>2</sub>, and thromboxane A2 or TXA<sub>2</sub>). The LO pathway has two branches; the 5-LO pathway produces leukotrienes (e.g., LTA4, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and LTF4) and the 15-LO pathway produces lipoxins (e.g., LXA4, LXB4). Prostanoids such as prostaglandin (PG), thromboxane (TX) and leukotriene (LT) have various physiological activities for maintaining local homeostasis in the body (The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Gilman, et al., eds., 7th Ed., p. 660, Macmillan Publishing Co., New York (1985)). The products of COX, PG G2/PG H2, are converted to specific PGs by the actions of tissue specific isomerases to yield PGI<sub>2</sub>, TXA<sub>2</sub>, PGD<sub>2</sub>, PGE<sub>2</sub>, and PGF<sub>2&#x3b1;</sub>. The biological functions of PGs are mediated by tissue-specific cell surface rhodopsin-like seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The precise physiological/pathological role of each PG is determined by the cellular context, receptor expression profile, ligand affinity, and differential coupling to signal transduction pathways (Haluska et al., Annu. Rev. Pharm. Tox. 10:213 (1989); Prostanoids and their Receptors. In Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, p. 643, Pergamon Press, Oxford (1990)). PGs play a wide variety of physiological roles in the regulation of modulation of vasomotricity, the sleep/wake cycle, intestinal secretion, lipolysis, glomerular filtration, mast cell degranulation, neurotransmission, platelet aggregation, leuteolysis, myometrial contraction and labor, inflammation and arthritis, patent ductus arteriosus, cell growth and differentiation, and immune responses generally. Patho-physiologically, PGs have been implicated in a variety of diseases including pain and inflammation, cancer, neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) is a member of the prostanoid family. PGE<sub>2 </sub>participates widely in the contraction and relaxation of the gastrointestinal tract, secretion of gastric acid, relaxation of smooth muscle, and release of neurotransmitters. Four subtype receptors for PGE<sub>2 </sub>have been identified, including EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (Negishi, M. et al., J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signalling, 12:379-391 (1995)), each of which is involved in a different signal transduction pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">PGE<sub>2 </sub>is the main product of the COX pathway of AA metabolism. It is the major PG synthesized in the joints and plays an important role in inflammation and the pathogenesis of arthritis. Five PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthases have been identified. (Smith W L, Am. J. Physiol. 263(2 Pt 2):F181-91 (1992)). Of these five, membrane PGE synthase (mPGES)-1 appears to be the key PGE<sub>2 </sub>convertase enzyme responsible for PGE<sub>2 </sub>production. MPGES-1 displays the highest catalytic activity relative to other PGE synthases and functions in conjunction with COX-1 and/or COX-2, to convert PGH<sub>2 </sub>to PGE<sub>2</sub>. Studies using mPGES-1 KO mice (Kamei, D., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 279(32):33684-95 (2004); Trebino, C. E., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100(15):9044-9 (2003), specific PGE<sub>2 </sub>receptor isoform KO mice (McCoy, J. M., et al. J. Clin. Invest., 110(5):651-8 (2002); Majima, M., et al. Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 24(10):524-9 (2003); and Amano, H., et al., J. Exp. Med., 197(2):221-32 (2003); and anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>specific antibodies (Portanova, J. P., et al., J. Exp. Med., 184(3):883-91 (1996); Zhang, Y., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 283(3):1069-75 (1997) suggest that PGE<sub>2 </sub>plays a major role in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pain and inflammation and cancer development. In the absence of mPGES-1, levels of COX-1, COX-2, and other PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthases remain relatively unaltered. The mPGES-1 KO mice are viable, fertile, and develop normally compared to wild type mice. However, they display a drastic reduction in both basal levels of PGE<sub>2 </sub>production as well as in PGE<sub>2 </sub>production from macrophages following challenge with various inflammatory stimuli. In addition, production of TXA2 is increased. The mPGES-1 KO mice show reduced incidence and severity of arthritis development and show resistance to pain and inflammation in various models. Several laboratories have independently generated various EP receptor isoform KO mice. These mice are viable, fertile and develop normally. Studies using specific EP isoform KO mice demonstrate that the various functions of PGE<sub>2 </sub>are mediated via specific EP isoforms. For example, the lack of EP4 isoform clearly affects the severity of arthritis development in mice, whereas the lack of EP3 influences tumor development and progression by modulating VEGF production by stromal cells and angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Defects in the biosynthesis and metabolism of prostaglandins are now believed to play an important part in the etiology of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. For example, the synovial tissues from patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis produce larger amounts of PGE<sub>2 </sub>and prostaglandin F2&#x3b1;, (PGF<sub>2&#x3b1;</sub>) compared to the synovial tissues from unaffected subjects (Blotman, F., et al., Rev. Rhum. Mal. Osteoartic, 46(4):243-7 (1979)). Similarly, an increased synthesis of PGE<sub>2 </sub>and PGF<sub>2&#x3b1;</sub> occurs in patients exhibiting systemic and gastrointestinal symptoms secondary to food intolerance. Thus, migraine headaches secondary to the ingestion of certain foods could be the result of an increased synthesis of 2-series prostaglandins. Multiple sclerosis is also associated with an imbalance in the normal levels of the prostaglandins, PGE<sub>1 </sub>and PGE<sub>2</sub>. Many aspects of reproduction, for example, fertility, pregnancy and labor, may be regulated by prostaglandins. Prostaglandins also play a major role in reproductive physiology. Excessive prostaglandin synthesis causes dysmenorrhea and parturition, which may be induced by administering prostaglandins intravenously or by insertion of a prostaglandin pessary. (Wang L. et al., Occup. Environ. Med. 61(12):1021-1026 (2004)). Excessive synthesis of PGE<sub>2 </sub>also plays a major role in disorders of reproduction, such as infertility, repeated miscarriage, preeclampsia, and eclampsia. A need therefore exists for antibodies specific to PGE<sub>2 </sub>that block or modulate its biological functions, which may be used to prevent and treat the diseases associated with excess production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>as well as diagnostic purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The generation of a highly specific, high affinity (K<sub>D </sub>is about 300 pM) anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>mAb, 2B5, has been reported. (Mnich S J, et al. J. Immunol. 155(9):4437-44 (1995)). The efficacy of 2B5 relative to indomethacin, a COX-1,2 inhibitor, was determined in animal models of pain and inflammation in mice and adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. (Portanova J P et al., J. Exp. Med. 184(3):883-91 (1996)). These studies clearly showed that 2B5 was as effective as indomethacin in reducing pain and inflammation as well as the severity of arthritis, suggesting that PGE<sub>2 </sub>is a key participant in the COX-1,2 pathway of AA metabolism in these animal models.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Inhibition of pan-PG production by COX-inhibitors has been a well-established therapeutic strategy for decades. Two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, are known, each of which are encoded by a distinct gene. The two isoforms carry out essentially the same catalytic reaction and have similar tertiary structures (Garavito R M, et al., Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 32:183-206 (2003)). COX-1 is constitutively expressed in nearly all tissues and is believed to be largely responsible for the normal &#x201c;house keeping&#x201d; functions, such as gastric cytoprotection and homeostasis. COX-2, by contrast, is constitutively expressed in particular tissues, and is highly inducible at sites of inflammation and cancer. Thus, COX-2-mediated PG production is thought to play an important role at the site of inflammation and cancer. The traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g., aspirin, indomethacin, ibuprofen) inhibit both COX isoforms. These compounds are the most widely used drugs for pain, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), and cardiovascular diseases and now are under consideration for the prevention of colon cancer and AD. The main liabilities of traditional NSAIDs are gastric and renal adverse events, in high-risk populations, which are believed to be due to inhibition of COX-1. Therefore, the second generation of NSAIDs, the COX-2 selective inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib, Celebrex&#x2122;; rofecoxib, Vioxx&#x2122;; valdecoxib, Bextra&#x2122;), are believed to have a better therapeutic profile. This assumption has resulted in their widespread use for pain, RA, and OA. Since the approval of the first COX-2 inhibitor in 1999 the combined sales of COX-2 inhibitors in 2004 was approximately US $ 5 billion. However, recently some COX-2 selective inhibitors were taken off the market, and are under FDA review, due to cardiovascular side-effects in high risk patients for certain COX-2 inhibitors. The liabilities associated with COX inhibitors probably arose due to their ability to inhibit all PGs, and in particular due to their ability to differentially interfere with PGI<sub>2 </sub>and TXA<sub>2 </sub>production, both of which play an important role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis (Martinez-Gonz&#xe1;lez J. et al., Curr. Pharm. Des. 13(22):2215-2227 (2007)). The inhibition of COX may make more AA available to the LO pathways, thus increasing the production of leukotrienes and lipoxins, which may contribute to COX inhibition-associated adverse effects. Recent studies using COX-1 and/or COX-2 knockout mice and COX-1 and COX-2 specific inhibitors also suggest that assumptions concerning the physiological roles of the two COX-isoforms may not be correct. (Loftin, C. D., et al. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 68-69:177-85 (2002)). These studies suggest that both COX-1 and COX-2 play an important role in supplying PGs to maintain tissue homeostasis and both isoforms may contribute to disease development, such as pain, inflammation and cancer. Therefore, blocking detrimental PGE<sub>2 </sub>downstream of COX-1 and COX-2 pathway with a specific antibody appears to be an attractive approach for the treatment of certain human diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another example of an important bioactive prostaglandin is PGD<sub>2</sub>. PGD<sub>2 </sub>is the major cyclooxygenase product of arachidonic acid produced from mast cells on immunological challenge (Lewis, et al., J. Immunol. 129:1627-1631 (1982)). Activated mast cells, a major source of PGD<sub>2</sub>, are one of the key players in driving the allergic response in conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic dermatitis and other diseases (Brightling, et al., Clin. Exp. Allergy 33:550-556 (2003)). Recent studies have shown that PGD<sub>2 </sub>exerts its effects through two different G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the D-prostanoid receptor (DP) and the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T helper type-2 cells (CRTH2), expressed in various human tissues. The PGD<sub>2</sub>/CRTH2 system mediates the chemotaxis of eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 cells, which are involved in the induction of allergic inflammation (Ulven T et al., Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 6(13):1427-1444 (2006)). Many of the actions of PGD<sub>2 </sub>are mediated through its action on the D-type prostaglandin (&#x201c;DP&#x201d;) receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed on epithelium and smooth muscle. In asthma, the respiratory epithelium has long been recognized as a key source of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that drive the progression of the disease (Holgate, et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 162:113-117 (2000)). In an experimental murine model of asthma, the DP receptor is dramatically up-regulated on airway epithelium on antigen challenge (Matsuoka, et al., Science 287:2013-2017 (2000)). The DP receptor is involved in human allergic rhinitis, a frequent allergic disease that is characterized by the symptoms of sneezing, itching, rhinorea and nasal congestion. DP antagonists have been shown to be effective at alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in multiple species, and more specifically have been shown to inhibit the antigen-induced nasal congestion, the most manifest symptom of allergic rhinitis (Jones, et al., Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 167:A218 (2003); Arimura, et al., S-5751. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 298(2):411-9 (2001)). DP antagonists are also effective in experimental models of allergic conjunctivitis and allergic dermatitis (Arimura et al., S-5751. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 298(2):411-9 (2001); Torisu, et al., Bioorg. &#x26; Med. Chem. 12:5361-5378 (2004)). A need therefore also exists for antibodies specific to PGD<sub>2 </sub>and blocking or modulating its biological functions therefore may be used to prevent and treat the diseases associated with excess production of PGD<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is another example of a bioactive lipid that induces many cellular effects, including those that result in platelet aggregation, cell proliferation, cell morphology, tumor cell invasion, endothelial cell chemotaxis, and endothelial cell in vitro angiogenesis. S1P receptors are therefore good targets for therapeutic applications such as wound healing and tumor growth inhibition. S1P signals cells in part via a set of G protein-coupled receptors named S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 (formerly called EDG-1, EDG-5, EDG-3, EDG-6, and EDG-8, respectively). These receptors share 50-55% amino acid and cluster identity with three other receptors (LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 (formerly EDG-2, EDG-4 and EDG-7)) for the structurally-related lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). (Ishii, I. et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 58(5):895-902 (2000)). A conformational shift is induced in the G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) when the ligand binds to that receptor, causing GDP to be replaced by GTP on the &#x3b1;-subunit of the associated G-proteins and subsequent release of the G-proteins into the cytoplasm. The &#x3b1;-subunit then dissociates from the &#x3b2;&#x3b3;-subunit, and each subunit can then associate with effector proteins, which activate second messengers leading to a cellular response. Eventually the GTP on the G-proteins is hydrolyzed to GDP, and the subunits of the G-proteins re-associate with each other and then with the receptor. Amplification plays a major role in the general GPCR pathway. The binding of one ligand to one receptor leads to the activation of many G-proteins, each capable of associating with many effector proteins, leading to an amplified cellular response. S1P receptors make good drug targets, because individual receptors are both tissue- and response-specific. Tissue specificity of the S1P receptors is important, because development of an agonist or antagonist selective for one receptor localizes the cellular response to tissues containing that receptor, limiting unwanted side effects. Response specificity of the S1P receptors is also important because it allows for development of agonists or antagonists that initiate or suppress certain cellular responses without affecting other responses. For example, the response specificity of the S1P receptors could allow for an S1P mimetic that initiates platelet aggregation without affecting cell morphology.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">S1P is formed as a metabolite of sphingosine in its reaction with sphingosine kinase, and is abundantly stored in platelet aggregates where high levels of sphingosine kinase exist and sphingosine lyase is absent. S1P is released during platelet aggregation, accumulates in serum and is also found in malignant ascites. S1P biodegradation most likely proceeds via hydrolysis by ectophosphohydrolases, specifically the sphingosine 1-phosphate phosphohydrolases. A need therefore exists for antibodies specific to S1P for modulating its biological functions either by blocking its interaction with receptors or stabilizing S1P and enhancing its biological effects, for use in preventing or treating autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cancers.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This invention pertains to Prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) binding proteins, particularly anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, that bind PGE<sub>2</sub>. Various aspects of the invention relate to antibodies and antibody fragments, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, as well as nucleic acids, recombinant expression vectors and host cells for making such antibodies and fragments. Methods of using the antibodies of the invention to detect PGE<sub>2</sub>, to inhibit one or more PGE<sub>2 </sub>activities, either in vitro or in vivo; and to regulate gene expression are also encompassed by the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. The meaning and scope of the terms should be clear, however, in the event of any latent ambiguity, definitions provided herein take precedent over any dictionary or extrinsic definition. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. In this application, the use of &#x201c;or&#x201d; means &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term &#x201c;including&#x201d;, as well as other forms, such as &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and &#x201c;included&#x201d;, is not limiting. Also, terms such as &#x201c;element&#x201d; or &#x201c;component&#x201d; encompass both elements and components comprising one unit and elements and components that comprise more than one subunit unless specifically stated otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Generally, nomenclatures used in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, immunology, microbiology, genetics and protein and nucleic acid chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. The methods and techniques of the present invention are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification unless otherwise indicated. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The nomenclatures used in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">That the present invention may be more readily understood, select terms are defined below.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; as used herein, refers to any polymeric chain of amino acids. The terms &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably with the term polypeptide and also refer to a polymeric chain of amino acids. The term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; encompasses native or artificial proteins, protein fragments and polypeptide analogs of a protein sequence. A polypeptide may be monomeric or polymeric.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The term &#x201c;isolated protein&#x201d; or &#x201c;isolated polypeptide&#x201d; is a protein or polypeptide that by virtue of its origin or source of derivation is not associated with naturally associated components that accompany it in its native state; is substantially free of other proteins from the same species; is expressed by a cell from a different species; or does not occur in nature. Thus, a polypeptide that is chemically synthesized or synthesized in a cellular system different from the cell from which it naturally originates will be &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; from its naturally associated components. A protein may also be rendered substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, using protein purification techniques well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The term &#x201c;recovering&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the process of rendering a chemical species such as a polypeptide substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, e.g., using protein purification techniques well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The terms &#x201c;Prostaglandin E2&#x201d; (abbreviated herein as PGE<sub>2</sub>), as used herein, refers to the prostaglandin having the following structure or a variant thereof that retains some or all PGE<sub>2 </sub>activities:</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="24.72mm" wi="54.10mm" file="US08624002-20140107-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">&#x201c;Biological activity&#x201d; as used herein, refers to inherent biological properties of the cytokine. Biological properties of PGE<sub>2 </sub>include but are not limited to binding to a PGE<sub>2 </sub>receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The terms &#x201c;specific binding&#x201d; or &#x201c;specifically binding&#x201d;, as used herein, in reference to the interaction of an antibody, a protein, or a peptide with a second chemical species, mean that the interaction is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (e.g., an antigenic determinant or epitope) on the chemical species; for example, an antibody recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure rather than to proteins generally. If an antibody is specific for epitope &#x201c;A&#x201d;, the presence of a molecule containing epitope A (or free, unlabeled A), in a reaction containing labeled &#x201c;A&#x201d; and the antibody, will reduce the amount of labeled A bound to the antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, broadly refers to any immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule comprised of four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains, or any functional fragment, mutant, variant, or derivation thereof, which retains the essential epitope binding features of an Ig molecule. Such mutant, variant, or derivative antibody formats are known in the art. Nonlimiting embodiments of which are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In a full-length antibody, each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG 1, IgG2, IgG 3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The term &#x201c;antigen-binding portion&#x201d; or &#x201c;antigen binding fragment&#x201d; of an antibody (or simply &#x201c;antibody portion&#x201d;), as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., PGE<sub>2</sub>). The antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Such antibody embodiments may also have bispecific, dual specific, or multispecific formats, specifically binding to two or more different antigens. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term &#x201c;antigen-binding portion&#x201d; of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) <i>Nature </i>341:544-546, Winter et al., PCT publication WO 90/05144 A1), which comprises a single variable domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) <i>Science </i>242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term &#x201c;antigen-binding portion&#x201d; of an antibody. Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:6444-6448; Poljak, R. J., et al. (1994) <i>Structure </i>2:1121-1123). Such antibody binding portions are known in the art (Kontermann and Dubel eds., <i>Antibody Engineering </i>(2001) Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 790 (ISBN 3-540-41354-5).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The term &#x201c;antibody construct&#x201d; as used herein refers to a polypeptide comprising one or more antigen binding portions of the invention linked to a linker polypeptide or an immunoglobulin constant domain. Linker polypeptides comprise two or more amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds and are used to link one or more antigen binding portions. Such linker polypeptides are well known in the art (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:6444-6448; Poljak, R. J., et al. (1994) <i>Structure </i>2:1121-1123). An immunoglobulin constant domain refers to a heavy or light chain constant domain. Human IgG heavy chain and light chain constant domain amino acid sequences are known in the art and are represented in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Still further, an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof may be part of a larger immunoadhesion molecule, formed by covalent or noncovalent association of the antibody or antibody portion with one or more other proteins or peptides. Examples of such immunoadhesion molecules include use of the streptavidin core region to make a tetrameric scFv molecule (Kipriyanov, S. M., et al. (1995) <i>Human Antibodies and Hybridomas </i>6:93-101) and use of a cysteine residue, a marker peptide and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag to make bivalent and biotinylated scFv molecules (Kipriyanov, S. M., et al. (1994) <i>Mol. Immunol. </i>31:1047-1058). Antibody portions, such as Fab and F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments, can be prepared from whole antibodies using conventional techniques, such as papain or pepsin digestion, respectively, of whole antibodies. Moreover, antibodies, antibody portions and immunoadhesion molecules can be obtained using standard recombinant DNA techniques, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">An &#x201c;isolated antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds PGE<sub>2 </sub>is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than PGE<sub>2</sub>). An isolated antibody that specifically binds PGE<sub>2 </sub>may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as Prostaglandin E1 (PGE<sub>1</sub>) molecules. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The term &#x201c;recombinant human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell (described further in Section II C, below), antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library (Hoogenboom H. R., (1997) <i>TIB Tech. </i>15:62-70; Azzazy H., and Highsmith W. E., (2002) <i>Clin. Biochem. </i>35:425-445; Gavilondo J. V., and Larrick J. W. (2002) <i>BioTechniques </i>29:128-145; Hoogenboom H., and Chames P. (2000) <i>Immunology Today </i>21:371-378), antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see e.g., Taylor, L. D., et al. (1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295; Kellermann S-A., and Green L. L. (2002) <i>Current Opinion in Biotechnology </i>13:593-597; Little M. et al. (2000) <i>Immunology Today </i>21:364-370) or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo. One embodiment provides fully human antibodies capable of binding PGE<sub>2 </sub>which can be generated using techniques well known in the art, such as, but not limited to, using human Ig phage libraries such as those disclosed in Jermutus et al., PCT publication No. WO 2005/007699 A2.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The term &#x201c;chimeric antibody&#x201d; refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and/or light chain variable region sequences from one species and constant region sequences from another species, such as antibodies having murine heavy and light chain variable regions linked to human constant regions.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The term &#x201c;CDR-grafted antibody&#x201d; refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and/or light chain variable region sequences from one species but in which the sequences of one or more of the CDR regions of VH and/or VL are replaced with CDR sequences of another species, such as antibodies having murine heavy and light chain variable regions in which one or more of the murine CDRs (e.g., CDR3) has been replaced with human CDR sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from a non-human species (e.g., a mouse) but in which at least a portion of the VH and/or VL sequence has been altered to be more &#x201c;human-like&#x201d;, i.e., more similar to human germline variable sequences. One type of humanized antibody is a CDR-grafted antibody, in which human CDR sequences are introduced into non-human VH and VL sequences to replace the corresponding nonhuman CDR sequences. In one embodiment, humanized anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies and antigen binding portions are provided. Such antibodies were generated by obtaining murine anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>monoclonal antibodies using traditional hybridoma technology followed by humanization using in vitro genetic engineering, such as those disclosed in Kasaian et al PCT publication No. WO 2005/123126 A2.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The terms &#x201c;Kabat numbering&#x201d;, &#x201c;Kabat definitions&#x201d; and &#x201c;Kabat labeling&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. These terms, which are recognized in the art, refer to a system of numbering amino acid residues which are more variable (i.e., hypervariable) than other amino acid residues in the heavy and light chain variable regions of an antibody, or an antigen binding portion thereof (Kabat et al. (1971) <i>Ann. NY Acad, Sci. </i>190:382-391 and, Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition</i>, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242). For the heavy chain variable region, the hypervariable region ranges from amino acid positions 31 to 35 for CDR1, amino acid positions 50 to 65 for CDR2, and amino acid positions 95 to 102 for CDR3. For the light chain variable region, the hypervariable region ranges from amino acid positions 24 to 34 for CDR1, amino acid positions 50 to 56 for CDR2, and amino acid positions 89 to 97 for CDR3.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;acceptor&#x201d; and &#x201c;acceptor antibody&#x201d; refer to the antibody or nucleic acid sequence providing or encoding at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or 100% of the amino acid sequences of one or more of the framework regions. In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;acceptor&#x201d; refers to the antibody amino acid or nucleic acid sequence providing or encoding the constant region(s). In yet another embodiment, the term &#x201c;acceptor&#x201d; refers to the antibody amino acid or nucleic acid sequence providing or encoding one or more of the framework regions and the constant region(s). In a specific embodiment, the term &#x201c;acceptor&#x201d; refers to a human antibody amino acid or nucleic acid sequence that provides or encodes at least 80%, preferably, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98%, or 100% of the amino acid sequences of one or more of the framework regions. In accordance with this embodiment, an acceptor may contain at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, or at least 10 amino acid residues that does (do) not occur at one or more specific positions of a human antibody. An acceptor framework region and/or acceptor constant region(s) may be, e.g., derived or obtained from a germline antibody gene, a mature antibody gene, a functional antibody (e.g., antibodies well-known in the art, antibodies in development, or antibodies commercially available).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As used herein, the term &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; refers to the complementarity determining region within antibody variable sequences. There are three CDRs in each of the variable regions of the heavy chain and the light chain, which are designated CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, for each of the variable regions. The term &#x201c;CDR set&#x201d; as used herein refers to a group of three CDRs that occur in a single variable region capable of binding the antigen. The exact boundaries of these CDRs have been defined differently according to different systems. The system described by Kabat (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987) and (1991)) not only provides an unambiguous residue numbering system applicable to any variable region of an antibody, but also provides precise residue boundaries defining the three CDRs. These CDRs may be referred to as Kabat CDRs. Chothia and coworkers (Chothia &#x26;Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987) and Chothia et al., Nature 342:877-883 (1989)) found that certain sub-portions within Kabat CDRs adopt nearly identical peptide backbone conformations, despite having great diversity at the level of amino acid sequence. These sub-portions were designated as L1, L2 and L3 or H1, H2 and H3 where the &#x201c;L&#x201d; and the &#x201c;H&#x201d; designates the light chain and the heavy chains regions, respectively. These regions may be referred to as Chothia CDRs, which have boundaries that overlap with Kabat CDRs. Other boundaries defining CDRs overlapping with the Kabat CDRs have been described by Padlan (FASEB J. 9:133-139 (1995)) and MacCallum (J Mol Biol 262(5):732-45 (1996)). Still other CDR boundary definitions may not strictly follow one of the above systems, but will nonetheless overlap with the Kabat CDRs, although they may be shortened or lengthened in light of prediction or experimental findings that particular residues or groups of residues or even entire CDRs do not significantly impact antigen binding. The methods used herein may utilize CDRs defined according to any of these systems, although preferred embodiments use Kabat or Chothia defined CDRs.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As used herein, the term &#x201c;canonical&#x201d; residue refers to a residue in a CDR or framework that defines a particular canonical CDR structure as defined by Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-907 (1987); Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 227:799 (1992). According to Chothia et al., critical portions of the CDRs of many antibodies have nearly identical peptide backbone confirmations despite great diversity at the level of amino acid sequence. Each canonical structure specifies primarily a set of peptide backbone torsion angles for a contiguous segment of amino acid residues forming a loop.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;donor&#x201d; and &#x201c;donor antibody&#x201d; refer to an antibody providing one or more CDRs. In a preferred embodiment, the donor antibody is an antibody from a species different from the antibody from which the framework regions are obtained or derived. In the context of a humanized antibody, the term &#x201c;donor antibody&#x201d; refers to a non-human antibody providing one or more CDRs.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As used herein, the term &#x201c;framework&#x201d; or &#x201c;framework sequence&#x201d; refers to the remaining sequences of a variable region minus the CDRs. Because the exact definition of a CDR sequence can be determined by different systems, the meaning of a framework sequence is subject to correspondingly different interpretations. The six CDRs (CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 of light chain and CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3 of heavy chain) also divide the framework regions on the light chain and the heavy chain into four sub-regions (FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4) on each chain, in which CDR1 is positioned between FR1 and FR2, CDR2 between FR2 and FR3, and CDR3 between FR3 and FR4. Without specifying the particular sub-regions as FR1, FR2, FR3 or FR4, a framework region, as referred by others, represents the combined FRs within the variable region of a single, naturally occurring immunoglobulin chain. As used herein, a FR represents one of the four sub-regions, and FRs represent two or more of the four sub-regions constituting a framework region. See Tables 5 and 6 for exemplary FR sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As used herein, the term &#x201c;germline antibody gene&#x201d; or &#x201c;germline antibody gene fragment&#x201d; refers to an immunoglobulin sequence encoded by non-lymphoid cells that have not undergone the maturation process that leads to genetic rearrangement and mutation for expression of a particular immunoglobulin. (See, e.g., Shapiro et al., Crit. Rev. Immunol. 22(3): 183-200 (2002); Marchalonis et al., Adv Exp Med. Biol. 484:13-30 (2001)). One of the advantages provided by various embodiments of the present invention stems from the recognition that germline antibody genes are more likely than mature antibody genes to conserve essential amino acid sequence structures characteristic of individuals in the species, hence less likely to be recognized as from a foreign source when used therapeutically in that species.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As used herein, the term &#x201c;key&#x201d; residues refer to certain residues within the variable region that have more impact on the binding specificity and/or affinity of an antibody, in particular a humanized antibody. A key residue includes, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: a residue that is adjacent to a CDR, a potential glycosylation site (can be either N- or O-glycosylation site), a rare residue, a residue capable of interacting with an antigen, a residue capable of interacting with a CDR, a canonical residue, a contact residue between heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region, a residue within the Vernier zone, and a residue in the region that overlaps between the Chothia definition of a variable heavy chain CDR1 and the Kabat definition of the first heavy chain framework.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As used herein, the term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; is an antibody or a variant, derivative, analog or fragment thereof which immunospecifically binds to an antigen of interest and which comprises a framework (FR) region having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human antibody and a complementary determining region (CDR) having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human antibody. As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; in the context of a CDR refers to a CDR having an amino acid sequence at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of a non-human antibody CDR. A humanized antibody comprises substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains (e.g., Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2, FabC, Fv) in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin (i.e., donor antibody) and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. Preferably, a humanized antibody also comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody contains both the light chain as well as at least the variable domain of a heavy chain. The antibody also may include the CH1, hinge, CH2, CH3, and CH4 regions of the heavy chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized light chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized heavy chain. In specific embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized variable domain of a light chain and/or humanized heavy chain.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE, and any isotype, including without limitation IgG 1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype, and particular constant domains may be selected to optimize desired effector functions using techniques well-known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The framework and CDR regions of a humanized antibody need not correspond precisely to the parental sequences, e.g., the donor antibody CDR or the consensus framework may be mutagenized by substitution, insertion and/or deletion of at least one amino acid residue so that the CDR or framework residue at that site does not correspond to either the donor antibody or the consensus framework. In a preferred embodiment, such mutations, however, will not be extensive. Usually, at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental FR and CDR sequences. As used herein, the term &#x201c;consensus framework&#x201d; refers to the framework region in the consensus immunoglobulin sequence. As used herein, the term &#x201c;consensus immunoglobulin sequence&#x201d; refers to the sequence formed from the most frequently occurring amino acids (or nucleotides) in a family of related immunoglobulin sequences (See, e.g., Winnaker, From Genes to Clones (Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany 1987). In a family of immunoglobulins, each position in the consensus sequence is occupied by the amino acid occurring most frequently at that position in the family. If two amino acids occur equally frequently, either can be included in the consensus sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As used herein, &#x201c;Vernier&#x201d; zone refers to a subset of framework residues that may adjust CDR structure and fine-tune the fit to antigen as described by Foote and Winter (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224:487-499). Vernier zone residues form a layer underlying the CDRs and may impact on the structure of CDRs and the affinity of the antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The term &#x201c;multivalent binding protein&#x201d; is used in this specification to denote a binding protein comprising two or more antigen binding sites. The multivalent binding protein is preferably engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites, and is generally not a naturally occurring antibody. The term &#x201c;multispecific binding protein&#x201d; refers to a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins as used herein, are binding proteins that comprise two or more antigen binding sites and are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins. Such DVD binding proteins may be monospecific, i.e., capable of binding one antigen or multispecific, i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens. DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to a DVD-Ig&#x2122;. Each half of a DVD-Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, and a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As used herein, the term &#x201c;neutralizing&#x201d; refers to neutralization of biological activity of a cytokine or a lipid metabolite when a binding protein specifically binds the cytokine or a lipid metabolite. Preferably a neutralizing binding protein is a neutralizing antibody whose binding to PGE<sub>2 </sub>results in inhibition of a biological activity of PGE<sub>2</sub>. Preferably the neutralizing binding protein binds PGE<sub>2 </sub>and reduces a biological activity of PGE<sub>2 </sub>by at least about 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 85% or more. Inhibition of a biological activity of PGE<sub>2 </sub>by a neutralizing binding protein can be assessed by measuring one or more indicators of PGE<sub>2 </sub>biological activity well known in the art. For example inhibition of PGE<sub>2 </sub>induced calcium influx by EP4 assay using HEK293 cells over-expressing EP4 receptor (see Example 1.1.C 1).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The term &#x201c;activity&#x201d; includes activities such as the binding specificity/affinity of an antibody for an antigen, for example, an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody that binds to an PGE<sub>2 </sub>antigen and/or the neutralizing potency of an antibody, for example, an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody whose binding to PGE<sub>2 </sub>inhibits the biological activity of PGE<sub>2</sub>, e.g., for example inhibition of PGE<sub>2 </sub>induced calcium influx by EP4 assay using HEK293 cells over-expressing EP4 receptor (see Example 1.1.C 1).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; includes any polypeptide determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. In certain embodiments, epitope determinants include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl, or sulfonyl, and, in certain embodiments, may have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody. In certain embodiments, an antibody specifically binds an antigen when it preferentially recognizes its target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The term &#x201c;surface plasmon resonance&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example, using the BIAcore system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.).

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The term &#x201c;labeled binding protein&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a protein with a label incorporated that provides for the identification of the binding protein. Preferably, the label is a detectable marker, e.g., incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or colorimetric methods). Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>90</sup>Y, <sup>99</sup>Tc, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>177</sup>Lu, <sup>166</sup>Ho, or <sup>153</sup>Sm); fluorescent labels (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors); enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase); chemiluminescent markers; biotinyl groups; predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags); and magnetic agents, such as gadolinium chelates.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The term &#x201c;antibody conjugate&#x201d; refers to a binding protein, such as an antibody, chemically linked to a second chemical moiety, such as a therapeutic or cytotoxic agent.

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The terms &#x201c;crystal&#x201d;, and &#x201c;crystallized&#x201d; as used herein, refer to an antibody, or antigen binding portion thereof, that exists in the form of a crystal. Crystals are one form of the solid state of matter, which is distinct from other forms such as the amorphous solid state or the liquid crystalline state. Crystals are composed of regular, repeating, three-dimensional arrays of atoms, ions, molecules (e.g., proteins such as antibodies), or molecular assemblies (e.g., antigen/antibody complexes). These three-dimensional arrays are arranged according to specific mathematical relationships. The fundamental unit, or building block, that is repeated in a crystal is called the asymmetric unit. Repetition of the asymmetric unit in an arrangement that conforms to a given, well-defined crystallographic symmetry provides the &#x201c;unit cell&#x201d; of the crystal. Repetition of the unit cell by regular translations in all three dimensions provides the crystal. See Giege, R. and Ducruix, A. Barrett, Crystallization of Nucleic Acids and Proteins, a Practical Approach, 2nd ed., pp. 20 1-16, Oxford University Press, New York, N.Y., (1999).</p>

The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA but preferably is double-stranded DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The term &#x201c;isolated polynucleotide&#x201d; as used herein shall mean a polynucleotide (e.g., of genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin, or some combination thereof) that, by virtue of its origin, the &#x201c;isolated polynucleotide&#x201d; is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide with which the &#x201c;isolated polynucleotide&#x201d; is found in nature; is operably linked to a polynucleotide that it is not linked to in nature, or does not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The term &#x201c;vector&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a &#x201c;plasmid&#x201d;, which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as &#x201c;recombinant expression vectors&#x201d; (or simply, &#x201c;expression vectors&#x201d;). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, &#x201c;plasmid&#x201d; and &#x201c;vector&#x201d; may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The term &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; refers to a juxtaposition wherein the components described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A control sequence &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences. &#x201c;Operably linked&#x201d; sequences include both expression control sequences that are contiguous with the gene of interest and expression control sequences that act in trans or at a distance to control the gene of interest. The term &#x201c;expression control sequence&#x201d; as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences that are necessary to effect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which they are ligated. Expression control sequences include appropriate transcription initiation, termination, promoter and enhancer sequences; efficient RNA processing signals such as splicing and polyadenylation signals; sequences that stabilize cytoplasmic mRNA; sequences that enhance translation efficiency (i.e., Kozak consensus sequence); sequences that enhance protein stability; and when desired, sequences that enhance protein secretion. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host organism; in prokaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal binding site, and transcription termination sequence; in eukaryotes, generally, such control sequences include promoters and transcription termination sequence. The term &#x201c;control sequences&#x201d; is intended to include components whose presence is essential for expression and processing, and can also include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences. Protein constructs of the present invention may be expressed, and purified using expression vectors and host cells known in the art, including expression cassettes, vectors, recombinant host cells, and methods for the recombinant expression and proteolytic processing of recombinant polyproteins and pre-proteins from a single open reading frame (e.g., WO 2007/014162).</p>

Transformation may rely on any known method for the insertion of foreign nucleic acid sequences into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. The method is selected based on the host cell being transformed and may include, but is not limited to, viral infection, electroporation, lipofection, and particle bombardment. Such &#x201c;transformed&#x201d; cells include stably transformed cells in which the inserted DNA is capable of replication either as an autonomously replicating plasmid or as part of the host chromosome. They also include cells that transiently express the inserted DNA or RNA for limited periods of time.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The term &#x201c;recombinant host cell&#x201d; (or simply &#x201c;host cell&#x201d;), as used herein, is intended to refer to a cell into which exogenous DNA has been introduced.

Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term &#x201c;host cell&#x201d; as used herein. Preferably host cells include prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, insect cells, or cells selected from any of the Kingdoms of life. Preferred eukaryotic cells include protist, fungal, plant and animal cells.

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">1. Anti-Prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>Monoclonal Antibodies Using Hybridoma Technology</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, phage, and yeast display technologies, or a combination thereof. Monoclonal antibodies can be produced, for example, using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981). The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. In one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention wherein, preferably, the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of the invention (See Example 1.2). Briefly, mice can be immunized with a carrier protein conjugated PGE<sub>2 </sub>known as hapten-carrier protein conjugates. Here, the hapten is PGE<sub>2 </sub>and carrier protein can be any of bovine thyroglobulins, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin etc. In a preferred embodiment, the PGE<sub>2</sub>-thyroglobulin conjugate is administered with an adjuvant to stimulate the immune response. Such adjuvants include complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant, RIBI (muramyl dipeptides) or ISCOM (immunostimulating complexes). Such adjuvants may protect the polypeptide from rapid dispersal by sequestering it in a local deposit, or they may contain substances that stimulate the host to secrete factors that are chemotactic for macrophages and other components of the immune system. Preferably, if a polypeptide is being administered, the immunization schedule will involve two or more administrations of the polypeptide, spread out over several weeks.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">After immunization of an animal with a PGE<sub>2</sub>-thyroglobulin conjugate, antibodies and/or antibody-producing cells may be obtained from the animal. An anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody-containing serum is obtained from the animal by bleeding or sacrificing the animal. The serum may be used as it is obtained from the animal, an immunoglobulin fraction may be obtained from the serum, or the anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies may be purified from the serum. Serum or immunoglobulins obtained in this manner are polyclonal, thus having a heterogeneous array of properties.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen PGE<sub>2 </sub>are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well-known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding PGE<sub>2</sub>. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies, can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In another embodiment, antibody-producing immortalized hybridomas may be prepared from the immunized animal. After immunization, the animal is sacrificed and the splenic B cells are fused to immortalized myeloma cells as is well known in the art. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, supra. In a preferred embodiment, the myeloma cells do not secrete immunoglobulin polypeptides (a non-secretory cell line). After fusion and antibiotic selection, the hybridomas are screened using PGE<sub>2</sub>, or a portion thereof, or a cell expressing PGE<sub>2</sub>. In a preferred embodiment, the initial screening is performed using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) or a radioimmunoassay (RIA), preferably an ELISA. An example of ELISA screening is provided in WO 00/37504.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody-producing hybridomas are selected, cloned and further screened for desirable characteristics, including robust hybridoma growth, high antibody production and desirable antibody characteristics, as discussed further below. Hybridomas may be cultured and expanded in vivo in syngeneic animals, in animals that lack an immune system, e.g., nude mice, or in cell culture in vitro. Methods of selecting, cloning and expanding hybridomas are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In a preferred embodiment, the hybridomas are mouse hybridomas, as described above. In another preferred embodiment, the hybridomas are produced in a non-human, non-mouse species such as rats, sheep, pigs, goats, cattle or horses. In another embodiment, the hybridomas are human hybridomas, in which a human non-secretory myeloma is fused with a human cell expressing an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody.</p>

For example, Fab and F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments).

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In another aspect of the invention, recombinant antibodies are generated from single, isolated lymphocytes using a procedure referred to in the art as the selected lymphocyte antibody method (SLAM), as described in U.S. Pat.

In this method, single cells secreting antibodies of interest, e.g. lymphocytes derived from any one of the immunized animals described in Section 1, are screened using an antigen-specific hemolytic plaque assay, wherein the antigen PGE<sub>2</sub>, a subunit of PGE<sub>2</sub>, or a fragment thereof, is coupled to sheep red blood cells using a linker, such as biotin, and used to identify single cells that secrete antibodies with specificity for PGE<sub>2</sub>. Following identification of antibody-secreting cells of interest, heavy- and light-chain variable region cDNAs are rescued from the cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR and these variable regions can then be expressed, in the context of appropriate immunoglobulin constant regions (e.g., human constant regions), in mammalian host cells, such as COS, HEK293, or CHO cells. The host cells transfected with the amplified immunoglobulin sequences, derived from in vivo selected lymphocytes, can then undergo further analysis and selection in vitro, for example by panning the transfected cells to isolate cells expressing antibodies to PGE<sub>2</sub>. The amplified immunoglobulin sequences further can be manipulated in vitro, such as by in vitro affinity maturation methods such as those described in PCT Publication WO 97/29131 and PCT Publication WO 00/56772.</p>

<p id="h-0015" num="0000">B. Production Of Recombinant Prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>Antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Antibodies of the present invention may be produced by any of a number of techniques known in the art. For example, expression from host cells, wherein expression vector(s) encoding the heavy and light chains are transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various forms of the term &#x201c;transfection&#x201d; are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques commonly used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, e.g., electroporation, calcium-phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection and the like. Although it is possible to express the antibodies of the invention in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells, expression of antibodies in eukaryotic cells is preferable, and most preferable in mammalian host cells, because such eukaryotic cells (and in particular mammalian cells) are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Preferred mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant antibodies of the invention include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr-CHO cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin, (1980) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>77:4216-4220, used with a DHFR selectable marker, e.g. as described in R. J. Kaufman and P. A. Sharp (1982) <i>Mol. Biol. </i>159:601-621), NS0 myeloma cells, COS cells and SP2 cells. When recombinant expression vectors encoding antibody genes are introduced into mammalian host cells, the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or, more preferably, secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown. Antibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein purification methods.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Host cells can also be used to produce functional antibody fragments, such as Fab fragments or scFv molecules. It will be understood that variations on the above procedure are within the scope of the present invention. For example, it may be desirable to transfect a host cell with DNA encoding functional fragments of either the light chain and/or the heavy chain of an antibody of this invention. Recombinant DNA technology may also be used to remove some, or all, of the DNA encoding either or both of the light and heavy chains that is not necessary for binding to the antigens of interest. The molecules expressed from such truncated DNA molecules are also encompassed by the antibodies of the invention. In addition, bifunctional antibodies may be produced in which one heavy and one light chain are an antibody of the invention and the other heavy and light chain are specific for an antigen other than the antigens of interest by crosslinking an antibody of the invention to a second antibody by standard chemical crosslinking methods.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In a preferred system for recombinant expression of an antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, of the invention, a recombinant expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the antibody light chain is introduced into dhfr-CHO cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector, the antibody heavy and light chain genes are each operatively linked to CMV enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory elements to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector, transfect the host cells, select for transformants, culture the host cells and recover the antibody from the culture medium. Still further the invention provides a method of synthesizing a recombinant antibody of the invention by culturing a host cell of the invention in a suitable culture medium until a recombinant antibody of the invention is synthesized. The method can further comprise isolating the recombinant antibody from the culture medium.</p>

In a specific embodiment the chimeric antibody of the invention comprises a heavy chain variable region (V<sub>H</sub>) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, and 80 and light chain variable region (VL) SEQ ID 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, and 81.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Anti-Prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>Humanized Antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules derived from a non-human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Known human Ig sequences are disclosed, e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Dept. Health (1983). Such imported sequences can be used to reduce immunogenicity or reduce, enhance or modify binding, affinity, on-rate, off-rate, avidity, specificity, half-life, or any other suitable characteristic, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Framework residues in the human framework regions may be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988)). Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available that illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art, such as, but not limited to, those described in Jones et al., Nature 321:522 (1986); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534 (1988)), Sims et al., J.

<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Preferably, anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies of the present invention exhibit a high capacity to reduce or to neutralize PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity, e.g., as assessed by any one of several in vitro and in vivo assays known in the art (e.g., see Example 1.1.C). For example, these antibodies neutralize PGE<sub>2</sub>-induced calcium influx in EP4 assay with IC<sub>50 </sub>values in the range of at least about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M, about 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M, about 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>M, about 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M, about 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M, about 10<sup>&#x2212;11 </sup>M or about 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>M.</p>

<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The monoclonal antibodies of the invention block PGE<sub>2 </sub>binding to at least one of EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 receptors. Both FACS-based receptor binding assay and <sup>3</sup>H-labeled PGE<sub>2 </sub>binding assay on cell surface demonstrate that both murine version and humanized version anti-PGE2, are able to effectively block PGE<sub>2 </sub>binding to its receptors. The crystal structure of PGE<sub>2 </sub>complexed with the Fab portion of humanized anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody Hu2B5.7 is envisioned by the invention</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In certain embodiments, the antibody comprises a heavy chain constant region, such as an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD constant region. Preferably, the heavy chain constant region is an IgG1 heavy chain constant region or an IgG4 heavy chain constant region. Furthermore, the antibody can comprise a light chain constant region, either a kappa light chain constant region or a lambda light chain constant region. Preferably, the antibody comprises a kappa light chain constant region. Alternatively, the antibody portion can be, for example, a Fab fragment or a single chain Fv fragment.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Replacements of amino acid residues in the Fc portion to alter antibody effector function are known in the art (Winter, et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,260; 5,624,821). The Fc portion of an antibody mediates several important effector functions, e.g., cytokine induction, ADCC, phagocytosis, complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and half-life/clearance rate of antibody and antigen-antibody complexes. In some cases these effector functions are desirable for therapeutic antibody but in other cases might be unnecessary or even deleterious, depending on the therapeutic objectives. Certain human IgG isotypes, particularly IgG1 and IgG3, mediate ADCC and CDC via binding to Fc&#x3b3;Rs and complement C1q, respectively. Neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) are the critical components determining the circulating half-life of antibodies. In still another embodiment at least one amino acid residue is replaced in the constant region of the antibody, for example, the Fc region of the antibody, such that effector functions of the antibody are altered. In another embodiment, the activity of the Fc fragment can be greatly enhanced by sialylation of the N-linked glycan of the Fc portion (e.g., with 2,6-linkage to the penultimate galactose on the complex, biantennary glycan found at Asn 297 in immunoglobulin G (IgG)) (Anthony, R M (2008) Science 320:373-376).</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">One embodiment provides a labeled binding protein wherein an antibody or antibody portion of the invention is derivatized or linked to another functional molecule (e.g., another peptide or protein). For example, a labeled binding protein of the invention can be derived by functionally linking an antibody or antibody portion of the invention (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another antibody (e.g., a bispecific antibody or a diabody), a detectable agent, a cytotoxic agent, a pharmaceutical agent, and/or a protein or peptide that can mediate association of the antibody or antibody portion with another molecule (e.g., such as a streptavidin core region or a polyhistidine tag).</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Useful detectable agents with which an antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be derivatized include fluorescent compounds. Exemplary fluorescent detectable agents include fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, 5-dimethylamine-1-napthalenesulfonyl chloride, phycoerythrin and the like. An antibody may also be derivatized with detectable enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase and the like. When an antibody is derivatized with a detectable enzyme, it is detected by adding additional reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a detectable reaction product. For example, when the detectable agent horseradish peroxidase is present, the addition of hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine leads to a colored reaction product, which is detectable. An antibody may also be derivatized with biotin, and detected through indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin binding.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Another embodiment of the invention provides a crystallized binding protein. Preferably the invention relates to crystals of whole anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies and fragments thereof as disclosed herein, and formulations and compositions comprising such crystals. In one embodiment the crystallized binding protein has a greater half-life in vivo than the soluble counterpart of the binding protein. In another embodiment the binding protein retains biological activity after crystallization.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Crystallized binding protein of the invention may be produced according methods known in the art and as disclosed in WO 02072636.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Another embodiment of the invention provides a glycosylated binding protein wherein the antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof comprises one or more carbohydrate residues. Nascent in vivo protein production may undergo further processing, known as post-translational modification. In particular, sugar (glycosyl) residues may be added enzymatically, a process known as glycosylation. The resulting proteins bearing covalently linked oligosaccharide side chains are known as glycosylated proteins or glycoproteins. Antibodies are glycoproteins with one or more carbohydrate residues in the Fc domain, as well as the variable domain. Carbohydrate residues in the Fc domain have important effect on the effector function of the Fc domain, with minimal effect on antigen binding or half-life of the antibody (R. Jefferis, <i>Biotechnol. Prog. </i>21 (2005), pp. 11-16). In contrast, glycosylation of the variable domain may have an effect on the antigen binding activity of the antibody. Glycosylation in the variable domain may have a negative effect on antibody binding affinity, likely due to steric hindrance (Co, M. S., et al., Mol. Immunol. (1993) 30:1361-1367), or result in increased affinity for the antigen (Wallick, S. C., et al., Exp. Med. (1988) 168:1099-1109; Wright, A., et al., EMBO J. (1991) 10:2717 2723).</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">One aspect of the present invention is directed to generating glycosylation site mutants in which the O- or N-linked glycosylation site of the binding protein has been mutated. One skilled in the art can generate such mutants using standard well-known technologies. Glycosylation site mutants that retain the biological activity, but have increased or decreased binding activity, are other objects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In still another embodiment, the glycosylation of the antibody or antigen-binding portion of the invention is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such a glycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in PCT Publication WO2003016466A2, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Additionally or alternatively, a modified antibody of the invention can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNAc structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. See, for example, Shields, R. L. et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740; Umana et al. (1999) Nat. Biotech. 17:176-1, as well as, European Patent No: EP 1,176,195; PCT Publications WO 03/035835; WO 99/54342 80.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Protein glycosylation depends on the amino acid sequence of the protein of interest, as well as the host cell in which the protein is expressed. Different organisms may produce different glycosylation enzymes (e.g., glycosyltransferases and glycosidases), and have different substrates (nucleotide sugars) available. Due to such factors, protein glycosylation pattern, and composition of glycosyl residues, may differ depending on the host system in which the particular protein is expressed. Glycosyl residues useful in the invention may include, but are not limited to, glucose, galactose, mannose, fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. Preferably the glycosylated binding protein comprises glycosyl residues such that the glycosylation pattern is human.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">It is known to those skilled in the art that differing protein glycosylation may result in differing protein characteristics. For instance, the efficacy of a therapeutic protein produced in a microorganism host, such as yeast, and glycosylated utilizing the yeast endogenous pathway may be reduced compared to that of the same protein expressed in a mammalian cell, such as a CHO cell line. Such glycoproteins may also be immunogenic in humans and show reduced half-life in vivo after administration. Specific receptors in humans and other animals may recognize specific glycosyl residues and promote the rapid clearance of the protein from the bloodstream. Other adverse effects may include changes in protein folding, solubility, susceptibility to proteases, trafficking, transport, compartmentalization, secretion, recognition by other proteins or factors, antigenicity, or allergenicity. Accordingly, a practitioner may prefer a therapeutic protein with a specific composition and pattern of glycosylation, for example, glycosylation composition and pattern identical, or at least similar, to that produced in human cells or in the species-specific cells of the intended subject animal.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Expressing glycosylated proteins different from that of a host cell may be achieved by genetically modifying the host cell to express heterologous glycosylation enzymes. Using techniques known in the art a practitioner may generate antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof exhibiting human protein glycosylation. For example, yeast strains have been genetically modified to express non-naturally occurring glycosylation enzymes such that glycosylated proteins (i.e., glycoproteins) produced in these yeast strains exhibit protein glycosylation identical to that of animal cells, especially human cells (U.S. patent applications 20040018590 and 20020137134 and PCT publication WO2005100584 A2).</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In addition to the binding proteins, the present invention is also directed to an anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibody specific for such binding proteins of the invention. An anti-Id antibody is an antibody that recognizes unique determinants generally associated with the antigen-binding region of another antibody. The anti-Id can be prepared by immunizing an animal with the binding protein or a CDR containing region thereof. The immunized animal will recognize, and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing antibody and produce an anti-Id antibody. The anti-Id antibody may also be used as an &#x201c;immunogen&#x201d; to induce an immune response in yet another animal, producing a so-called anti-anti-Id antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Further, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that a protein of interest may be expressed using a library of host cells genetically engineered to express various glycosylation enzymes, such that member host cells of the library produce the protein of interest with variant glycosylation patterns. A practitioner may then select and isolate the protein of interest with particular novel glycosylation patterns. Preferably, the protein having a particularly selected novel glycosylation pattern exhibits improved or altered biological properties.</p>

<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Given their ability to bind to PGE<sub>2</sub>, the anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies, or portions thereof, of the invention can be used to detect PGE<sub>2 </sub>(e.g., in a biological sample, such as serum or plasma), using a conventional immunoassay, such as an enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), an radioimmunoassay (RIA) or tissue immunohistochemistry. The invention provides a method for detecting PGE<sub>2 </sub>in a biological sample comprising contacting a biological sample with an antibody, or antibody portion, of the invention and detecting either the antibody (or antibody portion) bound to PGE<sub>2 </sub>or unbound antibody (or antibody portion), to thereby detect PGE<sub>2 </sub>in the biological sample. The antibody is directly or indirectly labeled with a detectable substance to facilitate detection of the bound or unbound antibody. Suitable detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, &#x3b2;-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; and examples of suitable radioactive material include <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>90</sup>Y, <sup>99</sup>Tc, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>177 </sup>Lu, <sup>166</sup>Ho, or <sup>153</sup>Sm.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Alternative to labeling the antibody, PGE<sub>2 </sub>can be assayed in biological fluids by a competition immunoassay utilizing PGE<sub>2 </sub>standards labeled with a detectable substance and an unlabeled anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody. In this assay, the biological sample, the labeled PGE<sub>2 </sub>standards and the anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody are combined and the amount of labeled PGE<sub>2 </sub>standard bound to the unlabeled antibody is determined. The amount of PGE<sub>2 </sub>in the biological sample is inversely proportional to the amount of labeled PGE<sub>2 </sub>standard bound to the anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody. Similarly, PGE<sub>2 </sub>can also be assayed in biological fluids by a competition immunoassay utilizing PGE<sub>2 </sub>standards labeled with a detectable substance and an unlabeled anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The antibodies and antibody portions of the invention preferably are capable of neutralizing PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, such antibodies and antibody portions of the invention can be used to inhibit PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity, e.g., in a cell culture containing PGE<sub>2</sub>, in human subjects or in other mammalian subjects having PGE<sub>2 </sub>with which an antibody of the invention cross-reacts. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for inhibiting PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity comprising contacting PGE<sub>2 </sub>with an antibody or antibody portion of the invention such that PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity is inhibited. For example, in a cell culture containing, or suspected of containing PGE<sub>2</sub>, an antibody or antibody portion of the invention can be added to the culture medium to inhibit PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity in the culture.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for reducing PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity in a subject, advantageously from a subject suffering from a disease or disorder in which PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity is detrimental. The invention provides methods for reducing PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity in a subject suffering from such a disease or disorder, which method comprises administering to the subject an antibody or antibody portion of the invention such that PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity in the subject is reduced. Preferably, the subject is a human subject. Alternatively, the subject can be a mammal expressing PGE<sub>2 </sub>to which an antibody of the invention is capable of binding. Still further the subject can be a mammal into which PGE<sub>2 </sub>has been introduced (e.g. by administration of PGE<sub>2 </sub>or by expression of a PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthetase transgene). An antibody of the invention can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non-human mammal expressing PGE<sub>2 </sub>with which the antibody is capable of binding for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter, such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention (e.g., testing of dosages and time courses of administration).</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">As used herein, the term &#x201c;a disorder in which PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity is detrimental&#x201d; is intended to include diseases and other disorders in which the presence of PGE<sub>2 </sub>in a subject suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder. Accordingly, a disorder in which PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity is detrimental is a disorder in which reduction of PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and/or progression of the disorder. Such disorders may be evidenced, for example, by an increase in the concentration of PGE<sub>2 </sub>in a biological fluid of a subject suffering from the disorder (e.g., an increase in the concentration of PGE<sub>2 </sub>in serum, plasma, synovial fluid, etc. of the subject), which can be detected, for example, using an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody as described above. Non-limiting examples of disorders that can be treated with the antibodies of the invention include those disorders discussed in the section below pertaining to pharmaceutical compositions of the antibodies of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">PGE<sub>2 </sub>has been implicated as having a pivotal role in causing pathological responses associated with rheumatoid arthritis. However other mediators of differential immunological pathways are also involved in arthritis, and blocking these mediators, in addition to PGE<sub>2</sub>, may offer additional therapeutic benefit. Thus, binding proteins of the invention may be incorporated into DVD-Ig&#x2122; proteins where in the DVD-Ig&#x2122; is capable of binding target pairs including, but not limited to, PGE<sub>2 </sub>and a pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;). Blocking both PGE<sub>2 </sub>and TNF-&#x3b1; may have beneficial effects that combining DMARD effect of TNF-&#x3b1; and pain relief from blocking PGE<sub>2</sub>.

<p id="p-0209" num="0208">PGE<sub>2 </sub>has been implicated as having a pivotal role in causing pathological responses associated with rheumatoid arthritis or cancer. However other mediators of differential immunological pathways are also involved in arthritis or cancer, and blocking these mediators, in addition to PGE<sub>2</sub>, may offer additional therapeutic benefit. A list of the drugs that currently are used for the treatment of various human diseases and disorders is available on the internet. This list is updated frequently to reflect state-of-art for the treatment of various human diseases. Anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>can be combined with any of the therapies in that list for a particular disease conditions. A few examples are provided below. Anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>can be combined with one or more agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Examples of these agents include but are not limited to the agents listed below, for example, drugs that decrease pain and inflammation while decreasing the growth of abnormal synovial tissue (the tissue that lines the inside of the joint). These drugs include methotrexate and low doses of corticosteroids (such as prednisone or cortisone). In some people, these drugs also decrease joint destruction. Other medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include: anti-malarial medications (such as hydroxychloroquine), gold, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin and minocycline. In addition, more than one drug may be prescribed. Newer biologic agents that block the effects of specific inflammatory factors (cytokines) are now available. Infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab block the cytokine TNF&#x3b1;, abatacept blocks T cell costimulation, rituximab depletes B cells, anakinra blocks the cytokine interleukin-1, and other new biologic agents target IL-6, IL-6R, IL-17, IL-18, IL-23, B7.1/B7.2. Anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>can combine with one or more agents for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. Examples of these agents include but are not limited to corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs and most recently anti-TNF&#x3b1; agents. Anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>can be combined with one or more agents for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Examples of these agents include but are not limited to Avonex&#x2122;, Azasan&#x2122;, Azathioprine, Betaseron&#x2122;, Bubbli-Pred&#x2122;, Copaxone&#x2122;, Cotolone, Glatiramer, Imuran&#x2122;, Interferon Beta-1a, Interferon Beta-1b Solution, Key-Pred, Key-Pred SP, Mitoxantrone, Natalizumab, Novantrone&#x2122;, Orapred&#x2122;, Orapred ODT&#x2122;, Pediapred&#x2122;, Pred-Ject-50, Predacort 50, Predalone 50, Predate-50, Prednisolone, Prelone&#x2122;, Rebif&#x2122;, and Tysabri&#x2122;. Anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>can be combined with one or more agents or treatment procedures for the treatment of pain. Anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>can be combined with one or more agents or treatment procedures for the treatment of Crohn's disease. Anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>can combine with one or more agents or treatment procedures for the treatment of various human cancers and malignancies.</p>

As used herein, &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include one or more of water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may further comprise minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives or buffers, which enhance the shelf life or effectiveness of the antibody or antibody portion.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer one or more antibodies of the invention or the combination of one or more antibodies of the invention and a prophylactic agent or therapeutic agent useful for preventing, managing, treating, or ameliorating a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or antibody fragment, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432 (1987)), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of administering a prophylactic or therapeutic agent of the invention include, but are not limited to, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and subcutaneous), epidural administration, intratumoral administration, and mucosal administration (e.g., intranasal and oral routes). In addition, pulmonary administration can be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985,320; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92/19244; WO 97/32572; WO 97/44013; WO 98/31346; and WO 99/66903. In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention, combination therapy, or a composition of the invention is administered using Alkermes AIR&#xae; pulmonary drug delivery technology (Alkermes, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.). In a specific embodiment, prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are administered intramuscularly, intravenously, intratumorally, orally, intranasally, pulmonary, or subcutaneously. The prophylactic or therapeutic agents may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment. This may be achieved by, for example, local infusion, by injection, or by means of an implant, such an implant being of a porous or non-porous material, including membranes and matrices, such as sialastic membranes, polymers, fibrous matrices (e.g., Tissuel&#xae;), or collagen matrices. In one embodiment, an effective amount of one or more antibodies of the invention is administered locally to the affected area to a subject to prevent, treat, manage, and/or ameliorate a disorder or a symptom thereof. In another embodiment, an effective amount of one or more antibodies of the invention is administered locally to the affected area in combination with an effective amount of one or more therapies (e.g., one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents) other than an antibody of the invention of a subject to prevent, treat, manage, and/or ameliorate a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In another embodiment, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent of the invention can be delivered in a controlled release or sustained release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used to achieve controlled or sustained release (see Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:20; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507; Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled or sustained release of the therapies of the invention (see e.g., Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61; see also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg. 7 1:105); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,679,377; 5,916,597; 5,912,015; 5,989,463; 5,128,326; PCT Publication No. WO 99/15154; and PCT Publication No. WO 99/20253. Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not limited to, poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and polyorthoesters. In a preferred embodiment, the polymer used in a sustained release formulation is inert, free of leachable impurities, stable on storage, sterile, and biodegradable. In yet another embodiment, a controlled or sustained release system can be placed in proximity of the prophylactic or therapeutic target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)).</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990, Science 249:1527-1533). Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more therapeutic agents of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In a specific embodiment, where the composition of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a prophylactic or therapeutic agent, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded prophylactic or therapeutic agent, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see, e.g., Joliot et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864-1868). Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include, but are not limited to, parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral, intranasal (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (e.g., topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. In a specific embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, oral, intranasal, or topical administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">If the compositions of the invention are to be administered topically, the compositions can be formulated in the form of an ointment, cream, transdermal patch, lotion, gel, shampoo, spray, aerosol, solution, emulsion, or other form known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 19th ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa. (1995). For non-sprayable topical dosage forms, viscous to semi-solid or solid forms comprising a carrier or one or more excipients compatible with topical application and having a dynamic viscosity preferably greater than water are typically employed. Suitable formulations include, without limitation, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, salves, and the like, which are, if desired, sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents (e.g., preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, buffers, or salts) for influencing various properties, such as, for example, osmotic pressure. Other suitable topical dosage forms include sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the active ingredient, preferably in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier, is packaged in a mixture with a pressurized volatile (e.g., a gaseous propellant, such as freon) or in a squeeze bottle. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms if desired. Examples of such additional ingredients are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">If the method of the invention comprises intranasal administration of a composition, the composition can be formulated in an aerosol form, spray, mist or in the form of drops. In particular, prophylactic or therapeutic agents for use according to the present invention can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant (e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas). In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges (composed of, e.g., gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">If the method of the invention comprises oral administration, compositions can be formulated in the form of tablets, capsules, cachets, gelcaps, solutions, suspensions, and the like. Tablets or capsules can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well-known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, but not limited to, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives, or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavoring, coloring, and sweetening agents as appropriate. Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated for slow release, controlled release, or sustained release of a prophylactic or therapeutic agent(s).</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The method of the invention may comprise pulmonary administration, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, of a composition formulated with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985,320; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92/19244; WO 97/32572; WO 97/44013; WO 98/31346; and WO 99/66903. In a specific embodiment, an antibody of the invention, combination therapy, and/or composition of the invention is administered using Alkermes AIR&#xae; pulmonary drug delivery technology (Alkermes, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.).</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The method of the invention may comprise administration of a composition formulated for parenteral administration by injection (e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion). Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form (e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers) with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water) before use.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The methods of the invention may additionally comprise administration of compositions formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (e.g., subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compositions may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (e.g., as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives (e.g., as a sparingly soluble salt).</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The methods of the invention encompass administration of compositions formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Generally, the ingredients of compositions are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the mode of administration is infusion, composition can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the mode of administration is by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">In particular, the invention also provides that one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents, or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of the agent. In one embodiment, one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents, or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted (e.g., with water or saline) to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably, one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg, more preferably at least 10 mg, at least 15 mg, at least 25 mg, at least 35 mg, at least 45 mg, at least 50 mg, at least 75 mg, or at least 100 mg. The lyophilized prophylactic or therapeutic agents or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention should be stored at between 2&#xb0; C. and 8&#xb0; C. in its original container and the prophylactic or therapeutic agents, or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention should be administered within 1 week, preferably within 5 days, within 72 hours, within 48 hours, within 24 hours, within 12 hours, within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment, one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the agent. Preferably, the liquid form of the administered composition is supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 0.25 mg/ml, more preferably at least 0.5 mg/ml, at least 1 mg/ml, at least 2.5 mg/ml, at least 5 mg/ml, at least 8 mg/ml, at least 10 mg/ml, at least 15 mg/kg, at least 25 mg/ml, at least 50 mg/ml, at least 75 mg/ml or at least 100 mg/ml. The liquid form should be stored at between 2&#xb0; C. and 8&#xb0; C. in its original container.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">The antibodies and antibody-portions of the invention can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral administration. Preferably, the antibody or antibody-portions will be prepared as an injectable solution containing 0.1-250 mg/ml antibody. The injectable solution can be composed of either a liquid or lyophilized dosage form in a flint or amber vial, ampule or pre-filled syringe. The buffer can be L-histidine (1-50 mM), optimally 5-10 mM, at pH 5.0 to 7.0 (optimally pH 6.0). Other suitable buffers include but are not limited to, sodium succinate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate. Sodium chloride can be used to modify the toxicity of the solution at a concentration of 0-300 mM (optimally 150 mM for a liquid dosage form). Cryoprotectants can be included for a lyophilized dosage form, principally 0-10% sucrose (optimally 0.5-1.0%). Other suitable cryoprotectants include trehalose and lactose. Bulking agents can be included for a lyophilized dosage form, principally 1-10% mannitol (optimally 2-4%). Stabilizers can be used in both liquid and lyophilized dosage forms, principally 1-50 mM L-Methionine (optimally 5-10 mM). Other suitable bulking agents include glycine, arginine, can be included as 0-0.05% polysorbate-80 (optimally 0.005-0.01%). Additional surfactants include but are not limited to polysorbate 20 and BRIJ surfactants. The pharmaceutical composition comprising the antibodies and antibody-portions of the invention prepared as an injectable solution for parenteral administration, can further comprise an agent useful as an adjuvant, such as those used to increase the absorption, or dispersion of a therapeutic protein (e.g., antibody). A particularly useful adjuvant is hyaluronidase, such as Hylenex&#xae; (recombinant human hyaluronidase). Addition of hyaluronidase in the injectable solution improves human bioavailability following parenteral administration, particularly subcutaneous administration. It also allows for greater injection site volumes (i.e., greater than 1 ml) with less pain and discomfort, and minimum incidence of injection site reactions (see WO2004078140 and US2006104968).</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The compositions of this invention may be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, liquid, semi-solid and solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, liposomes and suppositories. The preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typical preferred compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions, such as compositions similar to those used for passive immunization of humans with other antibodies. The preferred mode of administration is parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular). In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is administered by intravenous infusion or injection. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (i.e., antibody or antibody portion) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile, lyophilized powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and spray-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The antibodies and antibody-portions of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art, although for many therapeutic applications, the preferred route/mode of administration is subcutaneous injection, intravenous injection or infusion. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. In certain embodiments, the active compound may be prepared with a carrier that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g. <i>Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems</i>, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">In certain embodiments, an antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. The compound (and other ingredients, if desired) may also be enclosed in a hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. To administer a compound of the invention by other than parenteral administration, it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its inactivation.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. In certain embodiments, an antibody or antibody portion of the invention is coformulated with and/or coadministered with one or more additional therapeutic agents that are useful for treating disorders in which PGE<sub>2 </sub>activity is detrimental. For example, an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be coformulated and/or coadministered with one or more additional antibodies that bind other targets (e.g., antibodies that bind other cytokines or that bind cell surface molecules). Furthermore, one or more antibodies of the invention may be used in combination with two or more of the foregoing therapeutic agents. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered therapeutic agents, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">In certain embodiments, an antibody to PGE<sub>2 </sub>or fragment thereof is linked to a half-life extending vehicle known in the art.

<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may include a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; or a &#x201c;prophylactically effective amount&#x201d; of an antibody or antibody portion of the invention. A &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of the antibody or antibody portion may be determined by a person skilled in the art and may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the antibody or antibody portion to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody, or antibody portion, are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A &#x201c;prophylactically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of an antibody or antibody portion of the invention is 0.1-20 mg/kg, more preferably 1-10 mg/kg. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition.</p>

<heading id="h-0055" level="1">Generation and Characterization of Recombinant Anti Prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>Antibodies According to Solved Protein Sequence by a Combination of Edman Sequencing, Mass Spectrum Analysis and BLAST</heading>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">The protein sequence of hybridoma-derived mouse antibodies specific for PGE<sub>2 </sub>was generated by analyzing amino acid sequences using a combination of Edman degradation, mass spectrum analysis and BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, NCBI, NIH, Bethesda, Md.) as described previously (Pham, V. et al. Analyt. Biochem. 352:77-86 (2006)). 0.45 mg of anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody was reduced with 100 mM DTT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) to light chain and heavy chain. The light chains and heavy chains of the anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies were separated by reverse phase HPLC on Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, Md.) with a Vydac C-18 reverse phase column (H-P Separations Group, Hesperia, Calif.). The molecular weights of the light and heavy chains were measured on the Applied Biosystems API QSTAR Pulsar i mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) and Agilent Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent, Palo Alto, Calif.). N terminal sequencing of the light chains was performed in solution on PE Applied Biosystems 494/785A/140C/610A Protein-Peptide Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). 45 uL of light chain of the anti-PGE2 2B5 antibody was loaded on the center of the filter and 42 cycles were performed. The N-terminal of heavy chain of the anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody was blocked with pyroglutamic acid and it could not be sequenced directly by Edman degradation. Prior to N-terminal Edman sequencing the heavy chain, the heavy chain N terminal was de-blocked using pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). 80 &#x3bc;g of anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody was reduced with 50 mM DTT at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. 0.42 &#x3bc;l of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 7.5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) was added to the reduced sample to a final EDTA concentration of 1 mM. 50 &#x3bc;l reconstituted recombinant <i>pyrococcus furiosus </i>pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) was added to the sample. After incubating the sample solution at 40&#xb0; C. for 15 hours, the temperature was increased to 60&#xb0; C. for an additional two hours. An additional 10 &#x3bc;l of the reconstituted <i>pyrococcus furiosus </i>pyroglutamate aminopeptidase was added and the sample was incubated at 60&#xb0; C. for an additional hour. 4 &#x3bc;l of the sample was used for LC/MS analysis at 15 hour, 17 hour, and 18 hour time points to monitor the extent of the de-blocking process. When the de-blocking reaction was complete, the solution was concentrated by speed-vacuum (Eppendorf, Westbury, N.Y.) to about 100 &#x3bc;l. The de-blocked heavy chain was separated from light chain by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) for Edman Sequencing (Niall, H D, Methods Enzymol. 27:942-1010 (1973)).</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">To obtain the internal peptide sequence of an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody, the antibody was digested with multiple proteases with or without alkylation treatment. The sample was first reduced with DTT. The reduced sample was either digested directly with a protease or alkylated with iodoacetamide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) before digestion. Proteases used in this study include trypsin, glu-C, asp-N and chymotrypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). Fractions of protease digested peptides were separated by HPLC and each fraction was collected in a separate eppendorf tube for either MS or Edman sequencing. For LC/MS/MS analysis, MALDI-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), nano-LC/ESI-MS/MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) with either LCQ-deca, API QStar Pulsar (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) and Agilent Q-TOF (Agilent, Palo Alto, Calif.) were used. HPLC conditions were mobile Phase A=0.1% Formic acid; mobile Phase B=80% ACN/20% 0.1% Formic acid. A 1-3 hour gradient (5-50% B) was applied. For Edman sequencing, the fractions containing peptides resulting from protease digestion were transferred to PVDF membrane by a ProSorb cartridge (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). Each fraction was diluted to 100 &#x3bc;l of 0.1% TFA solution (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). After wetting the PVDF membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) in the reservoir with 10 &#x3bc;l methanol (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), the sample was added to the reservoir. The sample was removed from the reservoir and the PVDF membrane was air dried. The PVDF membrane was punched out, 5 &#x3bc;l of 10% diluted Biobrene solution (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) was added and the membrane dried completely. After washing the PVDF membrane with 15 &#x3bc;l 0.1% TFA for 15 seconds, the surface was wiped with filter paper. 4 &#x3bc;l of methanol was added to the PVDF membrane and allowed to dry thoroughly. The dried PVDF membrane was used for Edman Sequencing.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Germline sequences of the VH and VL of an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody were determined by alignment of the solved variable regions of heavy chain and light chain according to the above methods with the VH and VL database of mouse germline sequences (Ig-BLAST, NCBI, NIH, Bethesda, Md.). For the regions unsolved by MS and Edman sequencing, the closest germline sequence was assigned. The possible hot spot mutations were identified manually to match the experimental molecular weight of the heavy chain and light chain of an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody determined by MS respectively. The protein sequence of an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody was solved using the above method.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Several versions of the recombinant anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies (2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 and 2B5-9.0) were constructed based on this solved protein sequence, each having different residues in a few unsolved positions (Table 5). The testing of these recombinant antibodies is described in Example 4. Although the amino acid sequence of antibody CDRs are critical for binding specificity, potency and affinity of the antibody, substitutions, alterations, deletions or additions of a few residues in the frameworks and even CDRs may still largely maintain the binding specificity, potency, and affinity of an antibody. A version of an antibody with at least one or a few such substitution(s), alterations, deletions or additions is still within the scope of the invention. An alignment of VH and VL regions of anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies (2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 and 2B5-9.0) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0280" num="0279">DNA encoding the heavy chain variable regions of mouse anti-PGE2 antibodies 2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 or 2B5-9.0 was fused to a cDNA fragment encoding either a human IgG1 constant region, a mouse IgG1 constant, or a mouse IgG2a constant region by homologous recombination in bacteria. (Zhang, Y et al. Nature Biotechnol. 18(12):1314-7 (2000)). DNA encoding the light chain variable regions of 2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 or 2B5-9.0 was fused to a human kappa constant region or mouse kappa constant region. Id. Full-length antibodies were transiently expressed in 293 cells by co-transfection of heavy and light chain cDNAs ligated into the pTT3 expression plasmids. (Durocher, Y et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 30(2):E9 (2002)). Cell supernatants containing recombinant chimeric antibody were purified by Protein A Sepharose chromatography and bound antibody was eluted by addition of acid buffer. Antibodies were neutralized and dialyzed into PBS. (Making and Using Antibodies: A Practical Handbook. Edited by Gary C. Howard and Matthew R. Kaser. Published by CRC (2006)).</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">The purified chimeric anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>monoclonal antibodies 2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 and 2B5-9.0 were then tested for their ability to bind to PGE<sub>2 </sub>in an ELISA assay as described in Example 1.1.A (Table 6) and for their selectivity in a competition ELISA as described in Example 1.1.B (Table 6). All three recombinant anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>monoclonal antibodies 2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 and 2B5-9.0 potently bound to PGE<sub>2 </sub>with a similar specificity for PGE<sub>2</sub>. 2B5-8.0 demonstrated the highest binding ability to PGE<sub>2 </sub>and was selected for further characterization in an EP4 bioassay to characterize its ability to neutralize PGE<sub>2 </sub>bioactivity and in a <sup>3</sup>H-PGE<sub>2 </sub>competition ELISA to characterize its prostaglandin selectivity using a full panel of prostaglandins. 2B5-8.0 potently inhibited PGE<sub>2 </sub>induced calcium influx in the EP4 bioassay as described in Examples 1.1.

<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Humanization was based on amino acid sequence homology, CDR cluster analysis, frequency of use among expressed human antibodies, and available information on the crystal structures of human antibodies. Taking into account possible effects on antibody binding, VH-VL pairing, and other factors, murine residues were mutated to human residues where murine and human framework residues were different, with a few exceptions. Additional humanization strategies were designed based on an analysis of human germline antibody sequences, or a subgroup thereof, that possessed a high degree of homology, i.e., sequence similarity, to the actual amino acid sequence of the murine antibody variable regions.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Homology modeling was used to identify residues unique to the murine antibody sequences that are predicted to be critical to the structure of the antibody CDRs. A reference protein sharing sequence similarity to the target protein of interest and for which three dimensional coordinates are known was used to obtain initial coordinates and guidance for their further refinement. The primary sequences of the reference and target proteins are aligned such that coordinates of identical portions of the two proteins are aligned. Coordinates for mismatched portions of the two proteins, e.g., from residue mutations, insertions, or deletions, are constructed from generic structural templates and energy refined to insure consistency with the already aligned model coordinates. This computational protein structure may be further refined or employed directly in modeling studies.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">The murine variable heavy and variable light chain gene sequence of 2B5-8.0 was separately aligned against 44 human immunoglobulin germline variable heavy chain or 46 germline variable light chain sequences (derived from NCBI Ig BlAST website at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/retrieveig.html.) using Vector NTI software. A combination of BLAST searching and visual inspection was used to identify suitable reference structures. Sequence identity of 25% between the reference and target amino acid sequences is considered the minimum necessary to attempt a homology modeling exercise. Sequence alignments were constructed manually and model coordinates were generated with the program Jackal (Petrey, D., et al. Proteins 53 (Suppl. 6):430-435 (2003)). For 2B5-8.0 humanization, based on a homology search against human V and J segment sequences, the VH segment VH1-18 and the J segment JH4 were selected to provide the frameworks for the humanized heavy chain variable region for 2B5-8.0. For the 2B5-8.0 light chain variable region, the VL segment 01 and the J segment JK4 were used (see Tables 7 and 8). The identity of the framework amino acids between 2B5-8.0 VH and the acceptor human VH1-18 and JH4 segments was 80.2%, while the identity between 2B5-8.0 VL and the acceptor human 01 and JK4 segments was 90.3%. Although a specific pair of preferred human framework acceptors VH/JH and VL/JK was selected as acceptors for humanization of 2B5-8.0, it is known in the art that other human framework acceptors with sequence identity of minimum 25% to mouse framework can also be used for humanization of 2B5-8.0 and are therefor within the scope of this invention.</p>

<p id="p-0288" num="0287">The primary sequences of the murine and human framework regions of the selected antibodies share significant identity. Residue positions that differed were candidates for inclusion of the murine residue in the humanized sequence in order to retain the observed binding potency of the murine antibody. Such framework region amino acid substitutions (human residues that are back mutated to mouse residues) at a key residue are called framework back mutations, wherein the key residue is selected from the group consisting of a residue adjacent to a CDR; a glycosylation site residue; a rare residue; a residue capable of interacting with PGE2; a residue capable of interacting with a CDR; a canonical residue; a contact residue between heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region; a residue within a Vernier zone; and a residue in a region that overlaps between a Chothia-defined variable heavy chain CDR1 and a Kabat-defined first heavy chain framework. In an embodiment, the human acceptor framework comprises at least one Framework Region amino acid substitution, wherein the amino acid sequence of the framework is at least 65% identical to the sequence of the human acceptor framework and comprises at least 70 amino acid residues identical to the human acceptor framework. For humanization of 2B5-8.0, the framework region amino acid substitution at a key residue is selected from the group consisting of M (human) to I (mouse) at position 48, V (human) to A (mouse) at position 68, M (human) to L (mouse) at position 70, and T (human) to V (mouse) at position 72 in the heavy chain variable region; and I (human) to V (mouse) at position 2 and V (human) to L (mouse) at position 3 in the light chain variable region.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">The likelihood that a given framework residue would impact the binding properties of the antibody depends on its proximity to the CDR residues. Therefore, using the model structures, the residues that differ between the murine and human sequences were ranked according to their distance from any atom in the CDRs that likely contact PGE<sub>2</sub>. Those residues that fell within 4.5 &#x212b; of any CDR atom were identified as most important and were deemed candidates for retention of the murine residue in the humanized antibody (i.e., frame work back mutation).</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">For humanization of the 2B5-8.0 antibody variable regions, the general approach provided in the present invention was as follows. First, a molecular model of the 2B5-8.0 antibody variable regions was constructed with the aid of the computer programs ABMOD and ENCAD (Levitt, M., J. Mol. Biol. 168: 595-620 (1983)). Next, based on a homology search against human V and J segment sequences, the VH segment VH1-18 (The Immunoglobulin Facts Book. 2001, authored by Marie-Paule Lefranc and Gerald Lefranc, published by Academic Press) and the J segment JH4 (Id.) were selected to provide the frameworks for the humanized heavy chain variable region for 2B5-8.0. For the 2B5-8.0 light chain variable region, the VL segment 01 (Id.) and the J segment JK4 (Id.) were used. The identity of the framework amino acids between 2B5-8.0 VH and the acceptor human VH1-18 and JH4 segments was 80.2%, while the identity between 2B5-8.0 VL and the acceptor human 01 and JK4 segments was 90.3%. The computer model did not identify any significant contact residues with the CDRs that need to be back mutated. No further replacements were done.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Nine different versions of humanized 2B5-8.0, named as HU2B5.1, HU2B5.2, HU2B5.3, HU2B5.4, HU2B5.5, HU2B5.6, HU2B5.7, HU2B5.8 and HU2B5.9, were designed. The nine antibodies were different in the framework back mutations at positions 48, 68, 70, and 72 in the heavy chain variable region and positions 2 and 3 in the light chain variable region as described above.</p>

<heading id="h-0064" level="1">Example 4.2.2</heading>
<heading id="h-0065" level="1">Construction of Humanized Antibodies</heading>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">The in silico designed humanized antibodies described in Example 4.2.1 were constructed de novo using oligonucleotides. For each variable region cDNA, 6 oligonucleotides of 60-80 nucleotides each were designed to overlap each other by 20 nucleotides at the 5&#x2032; and/or 3&#x2032; end of each oligonucleotide. In an annealing reaction, all 6 oligos were combined, boiled, and annealed in the presence of dNTPs. DNA polymerase I, Large (Klenow) fragment (New England Biolabs #M0210, Beverley, Mass.) was added to fill-in the approximately 40 bp gaps between the overlapping oligonucleotides. PCR was then performed to amplify the entire variable region gene using two outermost primers containing overhanging sequences complementary to the multiple cloning site in a modified pTT3 vectors. The PCR products derived from each cDNA assembly were separated on an agarose gel and the band corresponding to the predicted variable region cDNA size was excised and purified. The variable heavy region was inserted in-frame into a cDNA fragment encoding a wild-type human IgG1 constant region, or a human IgG1 constant region containing 2 hinge-region amino acid mutations by homologous recombination in bacteria. (Zhang, Y et al. Nature Biotechnol. 18(12):1314-7 (2000)). The mutations were a leucine to alanine change at position 234 (EU numbering) and a leucine to alanine change at position 235 (Lund et al. J. Immunol., 147:2657 (1991)). The variable light chain region was inserted in-frame into a human kappa constant region by homologous recombination. Bacterial colonies were isolated, plasmid DNA extracted, and cDNA inserts were sequenced in their entirety. pTT3 vectors containing correct humanized heavy and light chains corresponding to each antibody were co-transfected into HEK293 cells to transiently produce full-length humanized anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies. Cell supernatants containing recombinant chimeric antibody were purified by Protein A Sepharose chromatography and bound antibody was eluted by the addition of 0.1N acetic acid/0.15M NaCl (pH3.0). Antibodies were neutralized and dialyzed in PBS.</p>
<heading id="h-0066" level="1">Example 4.2.3</heading>
<heading id="h-0067" level="1">Alternative Construction of Humanized Anti-PGE2 Antibodies</heading>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">This example describes the humanization of an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody. Humanization of the murine monoclonal antibody 2B5-8.0 was carried out essentially according to the procedure of Queen, C., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 10029-10033 (1989). First, human V segments with high homology to the 2B5-8.0 VH or VL amino acid sequences were identified. Next, the complementarity-determining region (CDR) sequences together with framework amino acids important for maintaining the structures of the CDRs were grafted into the selected human framework sequences. In addition, human framework amino acids that were found to be rare in the corresponding V region subgroup were substituted with consensus amino acids to reduce potential immunogenicity.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">For humanization of the 2B5-8.0 variable regions, the general approach provided in the present invention was followed. First, a molecular model of the 2B5-8.0 variable regions was constructed with the aid of the computer programs ABMOD and ENCAD (Levitt, M., J. Mol. Biol. 168: 595-620 (1983)). Next, based on a homology search against human V and J segment sequences, the VH segment MUC 1-1&#x2032;CL (Griffiths, A. D., et al., EMBO J. 12: 725-734 (1993)) and the J segment JH4 (Ravetch, J. V., et al., Cell 27: 583-591 (1981)) were selected to provide the frameworks for the Hu2B5-8.0 heavy chain variable region. For the Hu2B5-8.0 light chain variable region, the VL segment TR1.37&#x2032;CL (Portolano, S., et al., J. Immunol. 151: 2839-2851 (1993)) and the J segment JK2 (Hieter, P. A., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257: 1516-1522 (1982)) were used. The identity of the framework amino acids between 2B5-8.0 VH and the acceptor human MUC1-1&#x2032;CL and JH4 segments was 76%, while the identity between 2B5-8.0 VL and the acceptor human TR1.37&#x2032;CL and JK2 segments was 84%.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">At framework positions in which the computer model suggested significant contact with the CDRs, the amino acids from the mouse V regions were substituted for the original human framework amino acids. For humanization of 2B5-8.0, the framework region amino acid substitution at a key residue is selected from the group consisting of M (human) to I (mouse) at position 48, R (human) to K (mouse) at position 67, V (human) to A (mouse) at position 68, I (human) to L (mouse) at position 70 and R (human) to V (mouse) at position 72 in the heavy chain variable region; and D (human) to V (mouse) at position 75 in the light chain variable region. In addition, a few amino acids have been changed to the consensus amino acids in the same human variable domain subgroups to eliminate potential immunogenicity, which includes A to T substitution at position 76 in the heavy chain variable region, and E to D substitution at position 1 and L to I substitution at position 2 in the light chain variable region.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">The protein sequences of the CDR grafted variable domains (VH and VL of Hu2B5.P1) and the variable domains which incorporated all the back mutations and consensus substitutions (VH and VL of Hu2B5.P2) based on this humanization analysis are provided below. It is understood in general that any humanized version with one or a few such back mutations and consensus substitutions fall within the scope of this invention. Antibody E comprised VH Hu2B5.P2 and VL Hu2B5.P2; Antibody F comprised VH Hu2B5.P2 and VL Hu2B5.P1; Antibody G comprised VH Hu2B5.P1 and VL Hu2B5.P2; and Antibody I comprised VH Hu2B5.P1 and VL Hu2B5.P1.</p>

<p id="p-0305" num="0304">Competitive inhibition of PGE<sub>2 </sub>binding to PGE<sub>2 </sub>receptors, for example EP4, by an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody can be determined by a cell-based or membrane based receptor binding assay using <sup>3</sup>H-PGE<sub>2 </sub>as described in Example 1.1.D and a cell based FACS assay as described in Example 1.E.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">For a therapeutic mAb with serum half-life between 10 and 20 days in man, the serum concentration is normally between 5-15 &#x3bc;g/ml, with a weekly or bi-weekly IV or SC 3 mpk or less dosing regiment. Based on this calculation, hu2B5.1-Hu2B5.9 are likely to completely (100%) block PGE<sub>2 </sub>binding to EP4 in vivo as a therapeutic mAb, at a serum concentration of 100 nM (or 15 ug/ml), under a conventional dosing regimen of a monoclonal antibody.</p>

<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Criteria tested ranged from general drug-like property parameters such as, parameters indicating intrinsic stability (differential scanning calorimetry or DSC), and general physical and chemical stability (e.g., purity including fragmentation and aggregation monitoring by SEC).</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Analytical methods used for biophysico-chemical characterization:</p>
<heading id="h-0074" level="1">Example 4.2.5.1</heading>
<heading id="h-0075" level="1">Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)</heading>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">Size exclusion chromatography was used to separate proteins based on size. Proteins are carried in an aqueous mobile phase and through a porous stationary phase resin packed in a column. The retention time in the column is a function of the hydrodynamic size of the protein and the size of the pores in the packed resin bed. Smaller molecules can penetrate into smaller pores in the resin and are retained longer than larger molecules. Upon elution from the column the proteins are detected by UV absorbance. The SEC method used a TSK gel guard (TOSOH Biosciences, Montgomeryville, Pa., cat. no. 08543) and a TSK gel G3000SWxL (TOSOH Biosciences, Montgomeryville, Pa., cat. no. 08541). The mobile phase was 100 mM Na2HPO4, 200 mM Na2SO4, pH 7.0. The flow rate was 0.3 mL/minute. Injection volume was 20 &#x3bc;L of 1 mg/mL sample. The column temperature was room temperature. The autosampler temperature was 2-8&#xb0; C. The total run time was 50 minutes. The detection was based on UV absorbance at 214 nm wavelength, with band width set at 8 nm, using reference wavelength at 360 nm with band width 100 nm.</p>
<heading id="h-0076" level="1">Example 4.2.5.1</heading>
<heading id="h-0077" level="1">Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)</heading>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">The thermal stability of the anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibodies was assessed using a DSC instrument. The DSC instrument used was an automated VP-DSC equipment with Capillary Cell (Microcal, GE Healthcare Ltd./Microcal, Buckinghamshire, UK). Unfolding of molecules was studied applying a 1&#xb0; C./minute scan rate over a 25&#xb0; C.-95&#xb0; C. temperature range for samples at 1 mg/mL. Additional measurement parameters applied were a fitting period of 16 seconds, a pre-scan wait time of 10 minutes, and measurements were performed in none-feedback mode. Per individual measurement, 420 &#x3bc;L of sample/blank were filled into the DSC measurement sample holder, with a plate fill scheme as provided below. The thermograms obtained were fitted to a non two state model to obtain the midpoint temperatures and enthalpies of the different transitions.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">An additional requirement for successful biologics development candidate is that the protein remains its native state and conformation. A protein in aqueous solution is in equilibrium between the native (folded) conformation and its denatured (unfolded) conformation. The stability of the native state is based on the magnitude of the Gibbs free energy (DG) of the system and the thermodynamic relationship between enthalpy (DH) and entropy (DS) changes. A positive DG indicates the native state is more stable than the denatured state&#x2014;the more positive the DG, the greater the stability. For a protein to unfold, stabilizing forces need to be broken. Conformational entropy overcomes stabilizing forces allowing the protein to unfold at temperatures where entropy becomes dominant. DSC measures DH of protein unfolding due to heat denaturation. As a general rule it can be stated that the higher the transition midpoint (the Tm), the more stable the protein at lower temperatures. During the same experiment DSC also measures the change in heat capacity (DCp) for protein denaturation. Heat capacity changes associated with protein unfolding are primarily due to changes in hydration of side chains that were buries in the native state, but become solvent exposed in the denatured state. DSC has been shown to be a valuable predictor of liquid formulation stability for proteins and other biological macromolecules (Remmele, R. L. Jr., Gombotz, W. R., BioPharm 13, 36-46, 2000, and; Remmele, R. L. Jr., Nightlinger, N. Srinivasen, S., Gombotz, W. R., Pharm. Res. 15, 200-208, 1998).</p>

<p id="p-0318" num="0317">Capillary zone electrophoresis is a capillary electrophoresis method in which the capillary is filled with buffer and the separation mechanism is based on differences in electrophoretic mobility of the analyte through the buffer. The electrophoretic mobility of a molecule is related to the charge-to-size ratio. A Beckman-Coulter ProteomeLab PA 800 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.) was used for the CZE analysis. A neutral capillary (eCAP neutral, 56 cm total length, 50 &#x3bc;m I. D. Beckman-Coulter, P/N 477441, Fullerton, Calif.) was used. The method used a 30.2 cm capillary with a detection window 20.2 cm from the sample introduction inlet. The running buffer was 100 mM EACA (6-Aminocaproic acid, Sigma A7824-100 G, St. Louis, Mo.) with 0.1% MC (from 1% Methylcellulose solution, Convergent Bioscience, cat# 101876, Toronto, ON, Canada), pH 5.5.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">The results showed that Hu2B5.1, Hu2B5.3, Hu2B5.5, Hu2B5.7, Hu2B5.9 migrated more basic (e.g., they had a shorter migration time) than Hu2B5.2, Hu2B5.4, Hu2B5.6, Hu2B5.8. This may be due to the fact that Hu2B5.1, Hu2B5.3, Hu2B5.5, Hu2B5.7, Hu2B5.9 all have R at heavy chain #84 amino acid, while the other four samples have S at the same position. All nine samples showed a main peak and minor acidic and basic species, but there was not much difference among the distribution of the different species.</p>

<p id="p-0321" num="0320">To prepare Hu2B5.7 Fab fragment, Hu2B5.7 IgG in 0.15 M PBS buffer is first concentrated to 2 mg/ml using an Ultrafree-15 Biomax 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) centrifugal filter device (Millipore). A papain gel slurry (Pierce) is pre-washed and charged in 2-3&#xd7; with Buffer A (20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM cysteine) at a 1:1 volume ratio. The concentrated antibody is then mixed with 50% papain gel slurry and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 24 hours with vigorous shaking. The antibody/slurry mixture is centrifuged (Beckman 6KR) and the supernatant is loaded onto a PBS pre-equilibrated Superdex 75. A major peak is eluted and protein is pooled. A 25 mL Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia) is prepared by washing with 100 mL of PBS. The pooled antibody fragments are applied to the affinity column (2 mL/min flow rate). Fractions containing Hu2B5.7 Fab fragments (monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm) are collected in the flow-thru. Fractions containing a Hu2B5.7 Fab fragment concentration greater than 0.3 mg/mL (determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm) are pooled and frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. Sample purity is assessed with SDS-PAGE.</p>

The data are processed with the HKL2000 suite of programs (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). After determining the crystal orientation, the data are integrated with DENZO and scaled and merged with SCALEPACK, and placed on an absolute scale and reduced to structure factor amplitudes with TRUNCATE (French and Wilson, 1978). Five percent of the unique reflections are assigned, in a random fashion, to the &#x201c;free&#x201d; set, for calculation of the free R-factor (Rfree) (Br&#xfc;nger, 1992); the remaining 95% of the reflections constitute the &#x201c;working&#x201d; set, for calculation of the R-factor (R).</p>

<p id="p-0327" num="0326">The refinement of the PGE2/Hu2B5.7 Fab complex crystal structure begins with the molecular replacement solution coordinates, described above, in an appropriate space group. Refinement begins using rigid-body refinement by the program REFMAC available in the CCP4 suite of programs (Murshudov et al., 1997, Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). De novo PGE2 electron density is observed. Manual building of six PGE2 monomers is guided by the public PGE2 NMR structure 1IJZ (Moy et al., 2001) using the molecular graphics program O (Jones et al., 1991) and examination of 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron-density maps. The refinement program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) is used for iterative rounds of restrained refinement resulting in the following statistics: R of 25.8% (Rfree 30.5%).</p>

<heading id="h-0115" level="1">In Vivo Efficacy of Mouse and Humanized Anti-PGE2 Antibodies in a Carrageenan-Induced Footpad Edema Model</heading>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">Carrageenan-Induced Footpad Edema is an acute rodent model of innate immune function. The in vivo efficacy of mouse anti-PGE2 antibody 2B5-8.0 is assessed in a carragenan-induced paw edema model. The induction of paw inflammation with carrageenan is performed similarly as previously described (Joseph P. Portanova, et al. J. Exp. Med. 184: 883-891 (1996)). Intradermal (ID) injection of an inflammatory agent causes a rapid influx of neutrophils and fluid edema which peaks at approximately 4 hours, followed by an influx of macrophages and monocytes which peaks at approximately 48 hours. C57.BL/6 mice (8-10-week-old, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me.) were injected ID in the rear footpad with 30 &#x3bc;L of either PBS (left) or &#x3bb;-carrageenen (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) in PBS (right) at a concentration of 5.0 mg/mL (150 &#x3bc;g/mouse). Rear footpad thickness was measured by Dyer spring caliper model #310-119 at baseline (time=0), and 4 hours post carrageenan challenge. Significant difference for paw thickness was determined by comparing mean paw swelling for each treatment group to vehicle in a Student's two-tailed t-test. Mice were given a dose titration of an anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody (2B5-8.0) intraperitonially (IP) 18 hours prior to carrageenan challenge, or Indomethacin, PO 2 hours prior to challenge. The endpoint measured was the difference in paw swelling (edema) between right and left paws 4 hours after treatment. The anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody inhibited paw edema dose-dependently, and provided a maximal 40-50% inhibition of paw swelling at 10 mg/kg, comparable to the maximal inhibition achieved by indomethacin (Table 20).</p>

<heading id="h-0117" level="1">In Vivo Efficacy of Mouse and Humanized Anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>Antibodies in a Carrageenan-Induced Hyperalgesia Model</heading>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">The in vivo efficacy of mouse anti-PGE2 antibody 2B5-8.0 and humanized anti-PGE2 antibody Hu2B5.7 is assessed by determining carragenan-induced hyperalgesia. The induction of paw inflammation with carrageenan is performed as previously described (Joseph P. Portanova, et al. J. Exp. Med. 184: 883-891 (1996)). Hyperalgesia is induced by the injection of 0.1 ml of a 0.1% carrageenan solution in sterile saline (FMC Corp., Rockland, Me.) into the hind footpad of a 200-g male Sprague Dawley rat (Charles River Laboratories, Portage, Me.). A hyperalgesic response to thermal stimulation is determined in the same animals by the method of Hargreaves et al. Pain. 32:77-88 (1988)). Hind paws are exposed to radiant heat emitted from a high intensity projection bulb at selected times after injection. The amount of time in which each hind paw remains in contact with the heat source is measured to the nearest 0.1 s. The hyperalgesic response is expressed as the difference in the latency withdrawal period between carrageenan- and saline-injected paws of each animal. In certain experiments, rats are administered indomethacin by oral gavage in 0.5% Methocel/0.025% Tween 80 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) 1 hour before carrageenan administration. Other rats are injected intraperitoneally with mouse anti-PGE2 mAb, 2B5-8.0, or humanized anti-PGE2 antibody, Hu2B5.7, or isotype-matched antibody 18 hours before carrageenan injection.</p>

<heading id="h-0119" level="1">In Vivo Efficacy of Mouse Anti-PGE<sub>2 </sub>Antibodies in Collagen-Induced Arthritis</heading>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">Type II bovine collagen (lyophilized) was obtained from the University of Utah (Salt Lake City, Utah). Male DBA/J mice (8-10-week-old, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me.) were immunized intradermally at the base of the tail with 100 &#x3bc;L of emulsion containing 100 &#x3bc;g of type II bovine collagen dissolved in 0.1 N of acetic acid and 100 &#x3bc;g of heat-inactivated <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>H37Ra (Complete Freund's Adjuvant, Difco, Laurence, Kans.). Twenty-one days after immunization with collagen, mice were boosted IP with 1 mg of Zymosan A (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). Following the boost, mice were monitored daily for arthritis. Each paw was scored by the following criteria: 0=normal; 1=swelling in one site, foot, or ankle; 2=swelling in foot and ankle; and 3=ankylosis. Scores were summed for each animal, and total average of all animals in each group was expressed as MAS. In addition to clinical scores, mice were also evaluated for paw-edema using Dyer spring calipers model #310-119. Mice were enrolled for the study between days 24 and 28 at the first clinical signs of disease. At the termination of the experiment, six paws from each group were harvested and stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin for micro CT and histology.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">Micro-computed tomography was performed on a Scanco &#x3bc;CT-40 unit (Scanco Medical AG) at 60 kVp at 160 &#x3bc;A. The hind paws (stored in 70% ethanol) were secured in imaging tubes and the tarsal bone volume was measured for a 1.8-mm section of the mouse ankle from the base of the tibia to the tarsal/metatarsal joint at a resolution of 18 &#x3bc;m. The raw micro-computed tomography image was then analyzed using the Scanco AG &#x3bc;CT Evaluation program.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">For histopathology analysis, formalin-fixed paws were sectioned and stained with Gills 3 hematoxylin (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, Mich.) and eosin with phloxine (Newcomer Supply, Middleton, Mich.). Severity of disease was evaluated histologically using the following criteria: 0=normal; 1=minimal change; 2=mild change; 3=moderate change; and 4=severe change. Scores were summed for each animal, and the total was expressed as an average of all animals in each group.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">The therapeutic effects of anti-PGE2 alone was evaluated in mouse (male DBA/1J) collagen-induced arthritis, a standard preclinical model for human rheumatoid arthritis. Drug treatment was initiated after the mice developed signs of arthritic disease after immunization with bovine type II collagen. Mice were scored visually for clinical signs of arthritis and the results were recorded as the mean arthritic score (MAS). Paw swelling and MAS monitored over time, were also represented as area under the curve (AUC) (Table 21). After disease onset, treatment with anti-PGE2 mAb 2B5 reduced the AUC for MAS by 22%.</p>

<p id="p-0357" num="0356">The in vivo efficacy of mouse anti-PGE2 antibody 2B5-8.0 is assessed in an adjuvant-induced arthritis model. Arthritis is induced in male Lewis rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, Ind.) by footpad injection of <i>Mycobacterium butyricum </i>in mineral oil (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) as described previously. Dexamethasone and indomethacin (Sigma Chemical Co.) are suspended in Methocel/Tween and administered twice daily by gavage at dosages of 0.1 and 2 mg/kg, respectively. 2B5-8.0 and isotype control are administered daily at a dose of 10 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection. Treatments are initiated on day 15 post adjuvant injection and continued until final assessment of paw volume of uninjected contralateral paws on day 21. Mice are carefully examined twice weekly for the visual appearance of arthritis in peripheral joints, and scores for disease activity are determined.</p>
