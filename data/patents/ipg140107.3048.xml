<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0042581, filed on May 6, 2010, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to an electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell, a method of manufacturing the same, and a dye sensitized solar cell including the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Solar cells, such as silicon-based solar cells and dye sensitized solar cells, are eco-friendly energy sources.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the costs for manufacturing silicon-based solar cells are expensive, it is difficult to commercialize silicon-based solar cells and/or improve their efficiency. On the other hand, the costs for manufacturing dye sensitized solar cells are far less expensive than those of the conventional silicon-based solar cells so that dye sensitized solar cells may replace silicon-based solar cells. Dye sensitized solar cells are photoelectriochemical solar cells including dye molecules that absorb visible light to generate electron-hole pairs and transition metal oxide that transfers the generated electrons as main components.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A dye sensitized solar cell includes a counter electrode including a catalyst and an electrolyte having redox pairs. The counter electrode consecutively supplies electrons to cells by reducing ions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The catalyst may be platinum (Pt), carbon (C), or a conductive polymer, and among these elements, platinum has the highest efficiency. However, since platinum is also very expensive, research is being conducted into reducing the amount of platinum in order to reduce the manufacturing costs and also prevent the decrease in efficiency caused by the reduction of the amount of platinum.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One or more embodiments of the present invention are directed toward an electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell having excellent photoelectric conversion efficiency, a method of manufacturing the electrode, and a dye sensitized solar cell including the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, an electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell includes platinum (Pt) having a specific surface area in a range of about 20 to about 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g (or of 20 to 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g). In addition, the electrode has a surface roughness (RMS) in a range of about 10 to about 30 nm (or of 10 to 30 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the grain size of platinum is in a range of about 1 to about 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the electrode further includes metal oxide particles. In one embodiment, the metal oxide includes titania, silica, and/or indium tin oxide. In one embodiment, the amount of the metal oxide particles is in a range of about 100 to about 500 parts (or of 100 to 500 parts) by weight based on 100 parts by weight of platinum.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, a method of manufacturing an electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell includes: preparing an electrode composition by mixing a platinum salt, a low-volatile solvent, and a binder; and printing the electrode composition on a substrate and heat-treating the electrode composition.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the binder includes ethyl cellulose and/or polyethylene glycol.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the binder is in the electrode composition at an amount between about 800 and about 1,500 parts (or between 800 and 1,500 parts) by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the platinum salt.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the electrode composition further includes a material for forming a micelle with the platinum salt. In one embodiment, the material for forming the micelle with the platinum salt is a polyethylene oxide (PEO1)-polypropylene oxide (PPO) block copolymer and/or a polyethylene oxide (PEO1)-polypropylene oxide (PPO)-polyethylene oxide (PEO2) block copolymer. In one embodiment, the material for forming the micelle with the platinum salt is in the electrode composition at an amount between about 250 and about 1,000 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the platinum salt.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the electrode composition further includes metal oxide particles. In one embodiment, the metal oxide comprises titania, silica, and/or indium tin oxide.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. In this regard, the present embodiments may have different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the descriptions set forth herein. Accordingly, the embodiments are merely described below, by referring to the figures, to explain aspects of the present description.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell according to an embodiment of the present invention includes platinum (Pt) having a specific surface area in a range of about 20 to about 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g and an electrode having a surface roughness (RMS) in a range of about 10 to about 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the RMS of the electrode is in the range of about 15 to about 25 nm, and the specific surface area of platinum is in the range of about 30 to about 45 m<sup>2</sup>/g.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell may further include metal oxide particles. The metal oxide particles may scatter light so as to improve photoavailability of the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The metal oxide may include titania, silica, and/or indium tin oxide, and the amount of the metal oxide particles may be in the range of about 100 to about 500 parts by weight, for example, about 250 to about 400 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of platinum.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, if the amount of the metal oxide particles is within the range described above, the specific surface area of the platinum electrode increases and photoavailability improves.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An average diameter of platinum particles may be in the range of about 1 to about 20 nm, for example, about 5 to about 15 nm, and an average diameter of the metal oxide particles may be in the range of about 20 to about 100 nm, for example, about 30 to about 70 nm. In one embodiment, if the average diameters of platinum particles and the metal oxide particles are within the ranges described above, photoavailability of the electrode and platinum catalyst characteristics for reducing an electrolyte improves.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hereinafter, a method of manufacturing the electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell will be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">First, an electrode composition is prepared by mixing a platinum salt, a low-volatile solvent, and a binder.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The platinum salt may be chloroplatinic acid (H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>), platinum(II) acetylacetonate, or any mixture thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The low-volatile solvent may be &#x3b1;-terpineol, butyl carbitol acetate (BCA), or any mixture thereof, and the amount of the low-volatile solvent may be in the range of about 5,000 parts to about 12,000 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the platinum salt. When the amount of the low-volatile solvent is within the range described above, components of the electrode composition are uniformly mixed and dispersed in the electrode composition and the electrode composition has a viscosity suitable for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The binder may be ethyl cellulose, glycol polyethylene, or the like. The binder may be EC100 purchased from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The amount of the binder may be in the range of about 800 to about 1,500 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the platinum salt. When the amount of the binder is within this range, the electrode may have a strong binding ability to a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The electrode composition may further include a material that forms a micelle with the platinum salt.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A surfactant having a hydrophilic group and a hydrophobic group that are separated from each other may be used as the material that forms a micelle with the platinum salt. By adding the surfactant, the grain size of platinum may be controlled in a platinum-containing electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">By forming the micelle with platinum, the grain size of platinum may be controlled. The micelle formed as described above is removed during a subsequent heat-treatment, so that a platinum electrode having controlled surface roughness and specific surface area may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The grain size of platinum in the platinum electrode may be in the range of about 1 to about 30 nm, for example, about 10 to about 25 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The term &#x201c;grain size&#x201d; used herein refers to a diameter of a grain formed of a single particle or an average diameter of a grain formed of a plurality of particles.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The material that forms a micelle with the platinum salt may be a polyethylene oxide (PEO1)-polypropylene oxide (PPO) block copolymer or a polyethylene oxide (PEO1)-polypropylene oxide (PPO)-polyethylene oxide (PEO2) block copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The PEO1-PPO-PEO2 block copolymer may be commercially available from BASF Corp. (Pluronic P123).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The amount of the PPO repeating unit contained in the block copolymer may be in the range of about 1 to about 3 moles based on 1 mole of the PEO1 repeating unit, and the amount of the PEO2 repeating unit may be in the range of about 0.1 to about 1 mole based on 1 mole of the PEO1 repeating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The amount of the material that forms the micelle with the platinum salt may be in the range of about 250 to about 1,000 parts by weight, for example, about 400 to about 800 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the platinum salt.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The electrode composition may further include metal oxide particles.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The metal oxide may include titania, silica, and/or indium tin oxide, and the amount of the metal oxide particles may be in the range of about 100 to about 500 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of platinum salt.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Then, the electrode composition is printed on a substrate and heat-treated.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The heat-treatment may be performed at a temperature in a range of about 400 to about 500&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the temperature for the heat-treatment is within the range described above, catalyst characteristics of the electrode may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the above process, an electrode including platinum having a surface roughness (RMS) in the range of about 10 to about 30 nm, a specific surface area of platinum in the range of about 20 to about 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and a grain size of platinum in the range of about 10 to about 30 nm may be prepared. The electrode according to the current embodiment is not surface-treated using UV/ozone, while a comparable platinum electrode is surface-treated using UV/ozone. Here, the electrode according to the current embodiment has excellent transmittance without a surface treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The electrode composition is a composition for screen printing suitable for a large electrode. An electrode prepared using the electrode composition is used as a counter electrode of a dye sensitized solar cell.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The surface roughness of the electrode including platinum is measured by measuring arithmetical average roughness (Ra) using an atomic force microscope (AFM).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The grain size of platinum contained in the electrode is measured using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) analyzer.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a dye sensitized solar cell according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the dye sensitized solar cell according to the current embodiment includes a first substrate <b>10</b> on which a first electrode <b>11</b>, a photoelectrode <b>13</b>, and a dye <b>15</b> are formed; a second substrate <b>20</b> on which a second electrode <b>21</b> is formed; and an electrolyte <b>30</b> disposed between the first electrode <b>11</b> and the second electrode <b>21</b>, wherein the first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>20</b> face each other.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The first substrate <b>10</b> which supports the first electrode <b>11</b> is transparent and thus external light can incident onto and pass through the first substrate <b>10</b>. The first substrate <b>10</b> may be formed of glass or plastic. Non-limiting examples of the plastic include polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polycarbonate (PC), polypropylene (PP), polyimide (PI), and triacetyl cellulose (TAC).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first electrode <b>11</b> formed on the first substrate <b>10</b> may be formed of at least one transparent material selected from the group consisting of indium tin oxides, indium oxides, tin oxides, zinc oxides, sulfur oxides, fluorine oxides, mixtures thereof, ZnO&#x2014;Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and ZnO&#x2014;Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The first electrode <b>11</b> may have a single or multi-layered structure including the transparent material.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The photoelectrode <b>13</b> is formed on the first electrode <b>11</b>. The photoelectrode <b>13</b> includes the titanium dioxide particles <b>131</b>. An appropriate average pore size may improve necking characteristics of the titanium dioxide particles <b>131</b> since the electrolyte <b>30</b> is easily transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The thickness of the photoelectrode <b>13</b> may be in the range of about 10 to about 3000 nm, for example, about 10 to about 1000 nm. However, the thickness of the photoelectrode <b>13</b> is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The dye <b>15</b>, which absorbs external light and generates excited electrons, is adsorbed into the surface of the photoelectrode <b>13</b>.</p>

In this regard, the transparent electrode <b>21</b><i>a </i>may have a single or multi-layered structure including the transparent material.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The catalyst electrode <b>21</b><i>b </i>activates a redox couple, and a platinum electrode according to the current embodiment is used as the catalyst electrode <b>21</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The first substrate <b>10</b> is assembled to the second substrate <b>20</b> using an adhesive agent <b>41</b>.

The electrolyte <b>30</b> is uniformly dispersed in the photoelectrode <b>13</b>. The electrolyte <b>30</b> transfers electrons from the second electrode <b>21</b> to the dye <b>15</b> through oxidation and reduction. The hole <b>25</b><i>a </i>penetrating the second substrate <b>20</b> and the second electrode <b>21</b> is sealed using an adhesive agent <b>42</b> and a cover glass <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A suitable porous membrane may further be formed between (or on) the upper surface of the first electrode <b>11</b> and the lower surface of the photoelectrode <b>13</b>. In this regard, the photoelectrode <b>13</b> functions as a light scattering electrode and adsorbs a large amount of the dye <b>15</b> so that the efficiency of the dye sensitized solar cell increases.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The porous membrane is formed of particles of a metal oxide such as a titanium oxide, a zinc oxide, a tin oxide, a strontium oxide, an indium oxide, an iridium oxide, a lanthan oxide, a vanadium oxide, a molybdenum oxide, a tungsten oxide, a niobium oxide, a magnesium oxide, an aluminum oxide, a yttrium oxide, a scandium oxide, a samarium oxide, a gallium oxide, a strontium titanium oxide, or the like.
