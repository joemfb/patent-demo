<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods, cleavers, and packagings for cleaving an optical fiber using an abrasive medium are disclosed. In one embodiment, the bladeless cleaver includes a body having a flexible tongue configured to receive an optical fiber. The flexible tongue is further configured to provide an arcuate surface to bend a portion of the optical fiber. The bladeless cleaver in this embodiment also includes a cleaver structure attached to the body that comprises an abrasive medium carrier configured to support an abrasive medium. The abrasive medium carrier is configured to be actuated to place the abrasive medium in contact with the portion of the optical fiber to create a flaw in the portion of the optical fiber.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/697,604, filed on Feb. 1, 2010, entitled &#x201c;METHODS, CLEAVERS, AND PACKAGINGS FOR CLEAVING AN OPTICAL FIBER USING AN ABRASIVE MEDIUM,&#x201d; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/710,746, filed on even date herewith, entitled &#x201c;BLADELESS CLEAVERS HAVING AN ARCUATE EXTERIOR SURFACE AND RELATED METHODS FOR CLEAVING AN OPTICAL FIBER USING AN ABRASIVE MEDIUM,&#x201d; both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The technology of the disclosure relates to cleaving optical fibers to provide an end face on the optical fibers for fiber optic termination preparations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Technical Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Optical fibers can be used to transmit or process light in a variety of applications. Benefits of optical fiber include extremely wide bandwidth and low noise operation. Because of the advantages, optical fiber is increasingly being used for a variety of applications, including but not limited to broadband voice, video, and data transmission. Fiber optic networks employing optical fiber are being developed and used to deliver voice, video, and data transmissions to subscribers over both private and public networks. These fiber optic networks often include separated connection points linking optical fibers to provide &#x201c;live fiber&#x201d; from one connection point to another connection point. In this regard, fiber optic equipment is located in data distribution centers or central offices to support interconnections.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Optical communication networks involve termination preparations to establish connections between disparate optical fibers. For example, optical fibers can be spliced together to establish an optical connection. Optical fibers can also be connectorized with fiber optic connectors that can be plugged together to establish an optical connection. In either case, it may be necessary for a technician to establish the optical connection in the field. The technician cleaves the optical fiber to prepare an end face on the optical fiber. The technician may employ a cleaver that includes a blade to score, scribe, or otherwise induce a flaw in the glass of the optical fiber. Inducing a flaw in the glass of an optical fiber precedes breaking the glass at the flaw to produce an end face. The blade may either by pressed into the glass or swiped across the glass to induce the flaw. The end face can then either be spliced to another optical fiber or connectorized with a fiber optic connector to establish an optical connection.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional cleaver blades are expensive. Conventional cleaver blades may employ an expensive hardened material(s), including diamond, sapphire, ruby, ceramics, steel, and carbide, as examples. Further, the conventional cleaver blade needs to include an extremely sharp edge to minimize the size of the flaw induced in the glass to reduce risk of damaging the core of the optical fiber to provide efficient light transfer. Providing a sharp edge on the conventional cleaver blade adds cost. Inducing a large flaw in the glass may create a poor end face. Maintenance must be provided to keep the conventional cleaver blade sharp.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments disclosed in the detailed description include methods, cleavers, and packagings for cleaving an optical fiber using an abrasive medium. The abrasive medium may be placed into contact with a portion of an optical fiber to induce a flaw in the portion of the optical fiber. The optical fiber is broken about the induced flaw to create an end face for fiber optic termination preparations. Cleaving the optical fiber prepares an end face on the optical fiber to prepare fiber optic terminations, including in the field. In this manner, the cost of the cleaver may be reduced by employing the abrasive medium. The abrasive medium may be sufficiently inexpensive to be disposable as opposed to maintaining a conventional cleaver blade. The abrasive medium may also be disposed on a flexible carrier that allows the abrasive medium to be employed in flexible manners and cleaver form factors and/or packagings.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this regard, in one embodiment, an alternative bladeless cleaver for cleaving an optical fiber is disclosed. The bladeless cleaver in this embodiment includes a body having a flexible tongue configured to receive an optical fiber. The flexible tongue is further configured to provide an arcuate surface to bend a portion of the optical fiber. The bladeless cleaver in this embodiment also includes a cleaver structure attached to the body that comprises an abrasive medium carrier configured to support an abrasive medium. The abrasive medium carrier is configured to be actuated to place the abrasive medium in contact with the portion of the optical fiber to create a flaw in the portion of the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a method described herein, the bladeless cleaver of this embodiment may be used to cleave an optical fiber without employing a conventional blade. The method for cleaving an optical fiber without employing a conventional blade includes providing an optical fiber on a flexible tongue extending from a body of the bladeless cleaver. The method also includes bending the flexible tongue to bend a portion of the optical fiber and apply a tension to the portion of the optical fiber. A flaw is then created in the portion of the optical fiber by actuating an abrasive medium carrier attached to the body to place an abrasive medium disposed in the abrasive medium carrier in contact with the portion of the optical fiber to create the flaw in the portion of the optical fiber. After the flaw is created, the optical fiber is broken at the flaw to create a cleaved end face on the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional features and advantages will be set forth in the detailed description which follows, and in part will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from that description or recognized by practicing the embodiments as described herein, including the detailed description that follows, the claims, as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description present embodiments, and are intended to provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the disclosure.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments are shown. Indeed, the concepts may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limiting herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Whenever possible, like reference numbers will be used to refer to like components or parts.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Embodiments disclosed in the detailed description include methods, cleavers, and packagings for cleaving an optical fiber using an abrasive medium. The abrasive medium may be placed into contact with a portion of an optical fiber to induce a flaw in the portion of the optical fiber. The optical fiber is broken about the induced flaw to create an end face for fiber optic termination preparations. Cleaving the optical fiber prepares an end face on the optical fiber to prepare fiber optic terminations, including in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An abrasive medium for cleaving an optical fiber is more economical than a conventional cleaver blade. An abrasive medium for cleaving an optical fiber may cost on the order of cents, whereas conventional cleaver blades can cost tens of dollars up to a hundred dollars as an example. By employing a less expensive abrasive medium, costs associated with maintaining a sharp edge on a conventional cleaver blade to avoid inducing a large flaw in an optical fiber are avoided. Consequently, with the cleavers and methods disclosed, it is financially feasible to dispose and replace a used abrasive medium in the cleaver with a new abrasive medium after a few uses. For example, the abrasive medium may be disposed and replaced after ten (10) to twenty (20) cleaves. Use of an abrasive medium to cleave an optical fiber may also allow smaller form factors of optical fiber cleavers over use of conventional cleaver blades. The abrasive medium may be disposed on a rigid or flexible member. If the abrasive medium is disposed on a flexible member, the abrasive medium may be easily disposed and replaceable in a variety of cleaver form factors, thus making these form factors feasible for use by technicians to cleave optical fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exemplary method for cleaving an optical fiber by creating or inducing a flaw in a portion of the optical fiber using an abrasive medium. As illustrated therein, an optical fiber <b>10</b> is provided. The optical fiber <b>10</b> can be any type of optical fiber, including but not limited to a single-mode optical fiber and a multi-mode optical fiber. The optical fiber <b>10</b> may be of any size diameter D<sub>1</sub>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The optical fiber <b>10</b> may include a core <b>12</b> surrounded by cladding <b>14</b> to provide total internal reflection (TIR) of light <b>16</b> propagated down the core <b>12</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The cladding <b>14</b> may be provided as glass or other material, including but not limited to a polymer cladding such as a plastic clad silica as an example. An outer coating (not shown) may be disposed around the cladding <b>14</b>. The optical fiber <b>10</b> may be provided as part of a single fiber or multi-fiber fiber optic cable.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When splicing or connectorizing the optical fiber <b>10</b>, it is necessary to provide an end face <b>18</b> on the optical fiber <b>10</b>, as schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The end face <b>18</b> is aligned with an end face of another optical fiber to transfer the light <b>16</b> from the optical fiber <b>10</b> to the spliced or connected optical fiber. When splicing or connectorizing an optical fiber, it is important to provide an end face <b>18</b> that has a relatively smooth and mirror-like surface to achieve an efficient light transfer. It is also important to avoid damaging the core <b>12</b> and/or the cladding <b>14</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b>. In this regard, the optical fiber <b>10</b> is cleaved to prepare the end face <b>18</b>. The end face <b>18</b> is prepared by introducing a flaw into a portion of the optical fiber <b>10</b>. The end face <b>18</b> is formed when the optical fiber <b>10</b> is broken about the induced flaw.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this regard, instead of employing a conventional blade to cleave the optical fiber, an abrasive medium <b>20</b> is employed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The abrasive medium <b>20</b> is an abrasive material. The abrasive medium <b>20</b> is disposed on a carrier <b>22</b> in this embodiment. The carrier <b>22</b> is controlled to bring the abrasive medium <b>20</b> in contact with a portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to induce a flaw <b>26</b> in the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b>. The flaw <b>26</b> cracks the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b>. The end face <b>18</b> is created in the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> by breaking the optical fiber <b>10</b> at the flaw <b>26</b>. In this manner, the abrasive medium <b>20</b> cleaves the optical fiber <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The abrasive medium <b>20</b> is not a conventional blade in this embodiment. A conventional blade is typically a hardened material that has a sharp edge. The abrasive medium <b>20</b> does not have a sharp edge. A conventional blade has a smooth surface, wherein the abrasive medium <b>20</b> does not have a smooth surface. Simply stated, the abrasive medium <b>20</b> does not include a sharp blade that can easily be placed into precise contact with an optical fiber like the conventional blade. Thus, the cleaving of the optical fiber <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> using the abrasive medium <b>20</b> is a bladeless form and method of cleaving the optical fiber <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The carrier <b>22</b> may be controlled by human hand or a cleaving device, examples of which will be described below in this disclosure, to place the abrasive medium <b>20</b> in contact with the optical fiber <b>10</b> to induce the flaw <b>26</b> in the optical fiber <b>10</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the optical fiber <b>10</b> is held in place while the carrier <b>22</b> is moved in a direction D<sub>2 </sub>towards the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> to bring the abrasive medium <b>20</b> in contact with the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b>. The carrier <b>22</b> may be controlled in a swiping motion for example. Alternatively, the carrier <b>22</b> could be held in place and the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> moved to be brought into contact with the abrasive medium <b>20</b>. In either case, relative movement is created between the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> and the abrasive medium <b>20</b> to create the flaw <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Any coating (not shown) disposed on the outside of the optical fiber <b>10</b> is removed prior to placing the abrasive medium <b>20</b> in contact with the optical fiber <b>10</b> so that the abrasive medium <b>20</b> directly contacts glass of the optical fiber <b>10</b>. In this regard, any coating disposed around the core <b>12</b> and/or the cladding <b>14</b> may be removed prior to placing the abrasive medium <b>20</b> in contact with the optical fiber <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The abrasive medium <b>20</b> may be material provided in grit form on the carrier <b>22</b>. The abrasive medium <b>20</b> may be provided by any type of material or combination or compound of elements or materials. Non-limiting examples of the abrasive medium <b>20</b> include, but are not limited to diamond, silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, cerium oxide, and ferrous oxide. The size of the abrasive medium <b>20</b> may be any suitable size. As an example only, the size of the abrasive medium <b>20</b> may be between five (5) and twenty (20) micrometers (&#x3bc;m) as a non-limiting example. For example, the abrasive medium <b>20</b> may be fifteen (15) &#x3bc;m diamond, or eight (8) &#x3bc;m carbide, as non-limiting examples.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The carrier <b>22</b> may be any material that is configured to support the abrasive medium <b>20</b> disposed or deposited thereon. For example, the carrier <b>22</b> may be a film, such as a polishing film. The abrasive medium <b>20</b> is disposed on a surface of the carrier <b>22</b>. The abrasive medium <b>20</b> may be disposed or deposited on the entire surface area of the carrier <b>22</b> or only a portion of the surface area of the carrier <b>22</b>. For example, the abrasive medium <b>20</b> may be disposed on an edge of the carrier <b>22</b>. Other non-limiting examples of carriers, include, but are not limited to a wire, a string, a block, and a body. The carrier <b>22</b> may be of any size and made from any type of material desired, including but not limited to a polymer, plastic, and metal, as non-limiting examples. The quality and nature of the abrasive medium <b>20</b> and the carrier <b>22</b> determine the life or number of uses to cleave the optical fiber <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The carrier <b>22</b> may be rigid or flexible. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the carrier <b>22</b> is flexible. Providing a flexible carrier <b>22</b> allows a precise portion of the abrasive medium <b>20</b> disposed or deposited thereon to be placed into contact with the optical fiber <b>10</b> to induce the flaw <b>26</b> in the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in this embodiment. Providing a flexible carrier <b>22</b> may also allow the deploying of the abrasive medium <b>20</b> in cleavers and other packagings that may not be possible or convenient if a conventional blade cleaver were employed. Examples of such cleavers and packagings are discussed in more detail below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The optical fiber <b>10</b> may be placed under stress prior to placing the abrasive medium <b>20</b> in contact with the optical fiber <b>10</b> to cleave the same. Placing the optical fiber <b>10</b> under stress prevents the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> from moving when contacted by the abrasive medium <b>20</b>. Placing the optical fiber <b>10</b> under stress prior to inducing the flaw <b>26</b> in the optical fiber <b>10</b> with the abrasive medium <b>20</b> also propagates the induced flaw <b>26</b> to cleave the optical fiber <b>10</b>. Examples of placing the optical fiber <b>10</b> under stress includes but is not limited to placing a tension on the optical fiber <b>10</b>, rotating or twisting the optical fiber <b>10</b>, or bending the optical fiber <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, the optical fiber <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is placed under tension prior to the abrasive medium <b>20</b> being placed into contact with the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, portions <b>28</b>A, <b>28</b>B of the optical fiber <b>10</b> disposed on each side of the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> where the flaw <b>26</b> is desired to be induced are clamped by clamps <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B. The clamps <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B with the portions <b>28</b>A, <b>28</b>B of the optical fiber <b>10</b> secured therein may be pulled away from each other in directions D<sub>3 </sub>and D<sub>4 </sub>to place the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> under tension. Thus, once the flaw <b>26</b> is introduced by the abrasive medium <b>20</b> in the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b>, the tension will cause the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> to break about the flaw <b>26</b> to create the end face <b>18</b>. If the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> is not placed under a stress when the flaw <b>26</b> is introduced by the abrasive medium <b>20</b>, a stress could be subsequently placed on the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> to create the break about the flaw <b>26</b> to create the end face <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It may also be desirable to bend the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> in addition to placing the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> under a tension or other stress prior to inducing the flaw <b>26</b> with the abrasive medium <b>20</b>. Placing a bend in the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> assists in propagating the flaw <b>26</b> into a break in the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> to create the end face <b>18</b>. Placing a bend in the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> creates tension on the outside surface of a bent portion of the optical fiber <b>10</b>, which assists in propagating the flaw <b>26</b> into a break in the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">After the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> is broken at the flaw <b>26</b>, the end face <b>18</b> is created, as illustrated by example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The end face <b>18</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is disposed in the portion <b>24</b> of the optical fiber <b>10</b> in a cross-sectional plane P<sub>1 </sub>orthogonal or substantially orthogonal to a longitudinal axis A<sub>1 </sub>of the optical fiber <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A fiber stripper <b>60</b> is optionally attached to the body <b>42</b> in this embodiment to strip coating from the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> disposed about the guide surface <b>44</b> of the body <b>42</b>. The fiber stripper <b>60</b> is used to strip coating from the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> prior to the cleaver structure <b>50</b> placing the abrasive medium <b>54</b> in contact with the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b>. When the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> is initially disposed about the guide surface <b>44</b> of the body <b>42</b>, the fiber stripper <b>60</b> is disposed at a first end <b>62</b> of the guide surface <b>44</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> may then be disposed around the entire guide surface <b>44</b> until the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> reaches a second end <b>64</b> of the guide surface <b>44</b>, as also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Thereafter, the fiber stripper <b>60</b> may be aligned and secured to the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> to prepare the same for stripping. In other words, the optical fiber <b>48</b> is inserted onto fiber stripper <b>60</b> so that an end of the optical fiber <b>48</b> extends a suitable distance therein, such as to second end <b>64</b> when the fiber stripper <b>60</b> is disposed on the first end <b>62</b> of the guide surface <b>44</b>. Thereafter, the fiber stripper <b>60</b> can then be translated when secured to the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> circumferentially around the guide surface <b>44</b>, noted as C<sub>1 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, until the fiber striper <b>60</b> is disposed at the second end <b>64</b> of the guide surface <b>44</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As the fiber stripper <b>60</b> is translated, any coating disposed on the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> is removed by fiber stripper <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the translation of the fiber stripper <b>60</b> circumferentially about the guide surface <b>44</b> to strip the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b>. In this embodiment, a guide or track <b>66</b> is disposed in the body <b>42</b> of the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> adjacent the guide surface <b>44</b>. The track <b>66</b> is disposed around the radius R<sub>1 </sub>of the guide surface <b>44</b> in this embodiment. The track <b>66</b> retains the fiber stripper <b>60</b> and allows the fiber stripper <b>60</b> to be secured to the body <b>42</b> as the fiber stripper <b>60</b> is translated circumferentially about the guide surface <b>44</b>. This is further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrating a left side view of the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b>. As illustrated therein, the fiber stripper <b>60</b> is engaged to the track <b>66</b> in the body <b>42</b> at the first end <b>62</b> of the guide surface <b>44</b>. The fiber stripper <b>60</b> contains a protrusion <b>68</b> that acts as a rail configured to engage with the track <b>66</b>, but other suitable guide structures are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The fiber stripper <b>60</b> in this embodiment also contains a clamp <b>70</b> to secure the fiber stripper <b>60</b> to the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> prior to stripping in this embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this embodiment, the clamp <b>70</b> is disposed in the fiber stripper <b>60</b>, but such is not required. The clamp <b>70</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is open to receive the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b>. When the clamp <b>70</b> is open, the clamp <b>70</b> disposed in the fiber stripper <b>60</b> contains an opening <b>72</b> configured to receive the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> when disposed therein. The portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> is inserted through the opening <b>72</b> when disposing the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> around the guide surface <b>44</b> of the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> (see also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). To secure the fiber stripper <b>60</b> to the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b>, the clamp <b>70</b> is closed onto the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> when the fiber stripper <b>60</b> is disposed at the first end <b>62</b> of the guide surface <b>44</b>, as illustrated in the left side and top views of the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, respectively. When the clamp <b>70</b> is closed, the size of the opening <b>72</b> is reduced from when the clamp <b>70</b> is opened, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to secure the fiber stripper <b>60</b> to the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b>. The opening <b>72</b> when the clamp <b>70</b> is closed is designed to be sized such that any coating on the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> is removed when the fiber stripper <b>60</b> is translated circumferentially about the guide surface <b>44</b> to the second end <b>64</b> without damaging the glass of the optical fiber <b>48</b>, as illustrated in the top view of the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The clamp <b>70</b> may also place a stress on the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> prior to cleaving.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As discussed above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> includes the cleaver structure <b>50</b> attached to the body <b>42</b> to support the carrier <b>56</b> having the abrasive medium <b>54</b> disposed thereon. The cleaver structure <b>50</b> controls placing the abrasive medium <b>54</b> in contact with the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> to induce a flaw therein, as described below. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the body <b>42</b> contains openings <b>74</b> that are configured to support attachment of the cleaver structure <b>50</b> to the body <b>42</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, two shafts <b>76</b>, one hidden by the carrier <b>56</b> and one unobstructed, are disposed in the cleaver structure <b>50</b> to space apart the cleaver structure <b>50</b> from the body <b>42</b> when the cleaver structure <b>50</b> is attached to the body <b>42</b>. The shafts <b>76</b> are disposed through the openings <b>74</b> in the body <b>42</b>. Springs (not shown) are disposed inside the shafts <b>76</b>, wherein the springs bottom out in blind holes <b>78</b> disposed on the opposite side of the body <b>42</b> from the openings <b>74</b>. In this manner, the cleaver structure <b>50</b> is spring-actuated with the body <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The cleaver structure <b>50</b> can be actuated to be moved in a direction D<sub>5 </sub>towards the body <b>42</b> and guide surface <b>44</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>, by exerting a force on the cleaver structure <b>50</b> towards the body <b>42</b>. The springs inside the shafts <b>76</b> are compressed as a result, and the cleaver structure <b>50</b> is moved against the body <b>42</b>, as illustrated in the top view of the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. When the force exerted on the cleaver structure <b>50</b> is released, the springs in the shafts <b>76</b> release their stored energy and the cleaver structure <b>50</b> is returned to its position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Because the carrier <b>56</b> having the abrasive medium <b>54</b> disposed thereon is disposed in the abrasive medium structure <b>52</b> disposed in the cleaver structure <b>50</b>, when the cleaver structure <b>50</b> is moved towards the body <b>42</b>, the cleaver structure <b>50</b> places the abrasive medium <b>54</b> into contact with the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> to induce a flaw in the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b>. Due to the stress induced into the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> by the clamp <b>70</b> of the fiber stripper <b>60</b> as previously discussed and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> is cleaved due to the bend disposed in the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> and/or the stress due to the clamping of the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> by the clamp <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">To support the abrasive medium <b>54</b> in the cleaver structure <b>50</b>, the abrasive medium structure <b>52</b> is disposed in the cleaver structure <b>50</b> in this embodiment. The abrasive medium structure <b>52</b> supports the carrier <b>56</b> containing the abrasive medium <b>54</b>. Providing an abrasive medium structure <b>52</b> allows the abrasive medium <b>54</b> to be disposed within the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> as opposed to having to be provided and handled separately by a technician from a cleaver. Thus, the alignment and contact of the abrasive medium <b>54</b> with the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> is controlled by the cleaver structure <b>50</b> for quality and repeatability in cleaving.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this embodiment, as illustrated in the top views of the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, the abrasive medium structure <b>52</b> is provided in the form of an abrasive medium compartment <b>80</b>. The abrasive medium compartment <b>80</b> is an opening <b>81</b> in this embodiment that is configured to allow the carrier <b>56</b> containing the abrasive medium <b>54</b> to be disposed therein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> illustrated the carrier <b>56</b> inserted into the abrasive medium compartment <b>80</b> from a side view. The opening <b>81</b> does not extend all the way through the cleaver structure <b>50</b>. Alternatively, the opening <b>81</b> could extend all the way through the cleaver structure <b>50</b>. In this embodiment, the abrasive medium compartment <b>80</b> is disposed at an angle with respect to a tangent plane of the guide surface <b>44</b>, although any orientation desired can be provided for the abrasive medium compartment <b>80</b> in the cleaver structure <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A technician can insert the carrier <b>56</b> containing the abrasive medium <b>54</b> prior to cleaving.

The carrier <b>56</b> is designed and sized such that the abrasive medium <b>54</b> disposed thereon does not come into contact with the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> disposed along the guide surface <b>44</b> when a force is not exerted against the carrier structure <b>50</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. However, when a force is exerted on the carrier structure <b>50</b>, the sizing of the carrier <b>56</b> disposed in the abrasive medium compartment <b>80</b> is such that the abrasive medium <b>54</b> disposed on the carrier <b>56</b> comes into contact with the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b>, thereby inducting a flaw, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> described above may be used by a technician to cleave an optical fiber to prepare an end face in the field to prepare a termination. For example, the termination may be prepared for splicing the optical fiber to another optical fiber or connectorizing the optical fiber. Preparing the termination may also include employing other components, such as connectors, crimp rings, boots, and other tools, as examples. In this regard, a fiber optic package <b>90</b> may be provided like illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> as a convenient manner to store these components for easy transport and access by a technician. The fiber optic package <b>90</b> includes an enclosure <b>92</b> having a plurality of bins or compartments <b>94</b> for storing components used by the technician. A cover <b>96</b> may be attached to the enclosure <b>92</b> to close off access to the compartments <b>94</b> to protect the components stored therein. The bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> may also be stored in a compartment <b>94</b> of the fiber optic package <b>90</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, as a convenient means to include a cleaver with the fiber optic package <b>90</b> containing other fiber optic components used to prepare and complete an optical fiber termination. Alternatively, a bladed cleaver may be stored in the compartment <b>94</b> of the fiber optic package <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For additional convenience, the fiber optic package <b>90</b> is configured to allow a technician to cleave an optical fiber without having to remove the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> from the fiber optic package <b>90</b>. In this regard, an opening <b>97</b> is disposed through the enclosure <b>92</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The opening <b>97</b> is disposed through the enclosure <b>92</b> to provide access to the compartment <b>94</b> containing the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b>. The opening <b>97</b> in this embodiment is aligned with the first end <b>62</b> of the guide surface <b>44</b> of the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b>. In this manner, when it is desired to cleave an optical fiber using the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> disposed in the fiber optic package <b>90</b>, the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> is disposed through the opening <b>97</b> in the enclosure <b>92</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Because the opening <b>97</b> is aligned with the first end <b>62</b> of the guide surface <b>44</b>, inserting the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> through the opening <b>97</b> inserts the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> through the fiber stripper <b>60</b>. The bladeless cleaver <b>40</b> need not be removed from the fiber optic package <b>90</b>. The portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> can be continued to be pushed through the opening <b>72</b> wherein the portion <b>46</b> is disposed along the guide surface <b>44</b> of the body <b>42</b>, as previously described. The portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> can be continued to be disposed along the guide surface <b>44</b> until the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> reaches a fiber stop <b>98</b>, which in this embodiment is an interior wall <b>99</b> of the compartment <b>94</b> containing the bladeless cleaver <b>40</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>

The portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b> can now be cleaved. In this manner, as previously discussed, a force can be exerted downward on the cleaver structure <b>50</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, to cleave the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b>. As previously discussed with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, exerting a force to push the cleaver structure <b>50</b> into the body <b>42</b> causes the abrasive medium <b>54</b> disposed on the carrier <b>56</b> disposed in the abrasive medium compartment <b>80</b> to come into contact with the portion <b>46</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b>.

The locking mechanism <b>132</b> serves to attach the cleaver structure <b>121</b> to the body <b>102</b> of the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b>. The locking mechanism <b>132</b> may be compressed such that it fits through the cleaver structure opening <b>136</b> and when uncompressed, the at least one compressible curved lip <b>134</b> fits against the body <b>102</b> such that the cleaver structure <b>121</b> is attached to the body <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The body <b>102</b> may also have a spring fiber guide <b>138</b> and a stop <b>140</b> located at a proximal end <b>142</b> of the body <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> as it is ready for cleaving an optical fiber. The flexible tongue <b>106</b> contains a fiber guide surface <b>107</b> to guide a portion <b>146</b> of an optical fiber <b>148</b> to be cleaved, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. A portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> may be stripped of any coating disposed on the outside of the optical fiber <b>148</b> by any conventional means prior to placing the optical fiber <b>148</b> onto the flexible tongue <b>106</b>. The optical fiber <b>148</b> may have any of the attributes of the optical fiber <b>10</b> or optical fiber <b>48</b> discussed above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b>, as an example. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the flexible tongue <b>106</b> has been bent such that the tab <b>116</b> is snapped into the slot <b>120</b> of the body <b>102</b> of the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> and the flexible tongue <b>106</b> is locked into place. The flexible tongue <b>106</b> in the bent and locked position provides a bent radius of radius R<sub>5 </sub>for the optic fiber <b>148</b> to follow.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> together, the method of operation of the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> to create a flaw in the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> in order to create a cleaved end face on the optical fiber <b>148</b> may be as follows. In the unlocked position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a technician may place an optical fiber <b>148</b> onto the flexible tongue <b>106</b> from the distal end <b>108</b> of the body <b>102</b> of bladeless cleaver <b>100</b>. Any coating disposed on the outside of the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber may be removed (stripped) prior to placing the optical fiber <b>148</b> onto the flexible tongue <b>106</b> by any conventional stripper. The flexible tongue <b>106</b> contains a fiber guide surface <b>107</b> to guide the portion <b>146</b> of an optical fiber <b>148</b> to be cleaved. The optical fiber <b>148</b> may be allowed to follow the fiber guide surface <b>107</b> until the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> (with exposed glass) makes contact with the stop <b>140</b>. The fiber guide surface <b>107</b> may include a groove or channel (not shown) to help guide the optical fiber <b>148</b> and hold the optical fiber <b>148</b> in place, although such a groove or channel is not required. Once the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> makes contact with the stop <b>140</b>, the technician may close the hinge <b>110</b> such that the opening <b>112</b> of hinge <b>110</b> fits over notch <b>114</b>. Closing the hinge <b>110</b> allows the optical fiber <b>148</b> to be secured in place along the flexible tongue <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The flexible tongue <b>106</b> is then bent and the tab <b>116</b> is snapped into the slot <b>120</b> of the body <b>102</b> of the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> such that the flexible tongue <b>106</b> is locked into place. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, the hinge <b>110</b> is used to hold the optical fiber <b>148</b> against the fiber guide surface <b>107</b>, and then a bending force at the deformation <b>118</b> creates a separation to induce tension against a spring in the spring fiber guide <b>138</b>. The bending of the flexible tongue <b>106</b> provides a bent radius for the portion <b>146</b> of the optic fiber <b>148</b> to follow. In one embodiment, the radius provided by the bent flexible tongue <b>106</b> may be of radius R<sub>5</sub>. R<sub>5 </sub>may be equivalent to R<sub>1 </sub>as discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The bend of radius R<sub>5 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> places a bend in the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> prior to cleaving the optical fiber <b>148</b>. In one embodiment, the bent radius R<sub>5 </sub>may be between approximately three (3) and four (4) inches, although the bent radius R<sub>5 </sub>may be of any radius desired.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The bending of the flexible tongue <b>106</b> also applies the necessary tension to the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> to be able to introduce a flaw in the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b>, which is necessary to make a cleave of the optical fiber <b>148</b>, as discussed above. After the tab <b>116</b> is snapped into the slot <b>120</b> of the body <b>102</b> of the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> such that the flexible tongue <b>106</b> is locked into place, the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> will appear as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, once the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> has tension applied to it as a result of the bent flexible tongue <b>106</b>, the technician can actuate the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> such that the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> is moved across the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> to induce the flaw in the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b>. In one embodiment, the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> may be controlled by human hand or a cleaving structure, as discussed above, to place the abrasive medium <b>126</b> in contact with the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> to induce the flaw in the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b>. The abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> may include an actuator <b>144</b> for actuating the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> such that the abrasive medium <b>126</b> is placed into contact with the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> bent around the flexible tongue <b>106</b> to induce a flaw in the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b>. In one embodiment, the actuator <b>144</b> may be spring-actuated with the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> in a manner similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> can be actuated to be moved in a direction D<sub>5 </sub>towards the body <b>102</b> and fiber guide surface <b>107</b> by exerting a force on the actuator <b>144</b> towards the body <b>102</b>. When the force exerted on the actuator <b>144</b> is released, the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> is returned to its original position. When the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> is moved towards the body <b>102</b>, the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> places the abrasive medium <b>126</b> into contact with the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> bent around the flexible tongue <b>106</b> to induce a flaw in the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b>. The optical fiber <b>148</b> is cleaved due to the bend and tension disposed in the optical fiber <b>148</b> as a result of the flexible tongue <b>106</b> being bent and held in place in the locked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the optical fiber <b>148</b> is held in place by the closed hinge <b>110</b> while the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> is moved in a direction D<sub>5 </sub>towards the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> bent around the flexible tongue <b>106</b> to bring the abrasive medium <b>126</b> in contact with the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b>. The abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> may be controlled in a swiping motion for example. The swiping motion may be in a linear motion in the direction D<sub>5</sub>, or the swiping motion may follow an arcuate path. Once the flaw is created, the tension and bend provided by the bent flexible tongue <b>106</b> will propagate the cleave through the optical fiber <b>148</b> creating a usable end face.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the cleave is made, the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> to be used may be removed from the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b>. A scrap portion <b>147</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> will remain held in place by the hinge <b>110</b>. The scrap portion <b>147</b> may then be removed from the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> by the technician opening the hinge <b>110</b> and the scrap portion <b>147</b> can be discarded. Alternatively, if the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> is designed as a single use cleaver or a disposable cleaver whose recommended number of uses has been reached, the entire bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> with the retained scrap portion <b>147</b> may be thrown away. In one embodiment, where the abrasive medium <b>126</b> is provided in the form of tear away sheets of film, the body <b>102</b> of the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> may be used multiple times, with the sheets of film being torn away after each use by opening the cover portion <b>124</b> of the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The abrasive medium <b>126</b> may be similar to the abrasive medium <b>20</b> disclosed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the abrasive medium <b>126</b> may be material provided in grit form on the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b>. The abrasive medium <b>126</b> may be provided by any type of material or combination or compound of elements or materials. Non-limiting examples of the abrasive medium <b>126</b> include, but are not limited to diamond, silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, cerium oxide, and ferrous oxide. The size of the abrasive medium <b>126</b> may be any size. As an example only, the size of the abrasive medium <b>126</b> may be between five (5) and twenty (20) micrometers (&#x3bc;m) as a non-limiting example. For example, the abrasive medium <b>126</b> may be fifteen (15) &#x3bc;m diamond, or eight (8) &#x3bc;m carbide, as non-limiting examples.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, the abrasive medium <b>126</b> may be in the form of tear away sheets of film in one embodiment. The film may be a polishing film as an example. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the tear away sheets are held in place by abrasive medium holding members <b>128</b>A and <b>128</b>B. The abrasive medium <b>126</b> may be disposed or deposited on the entire surface area of the film or only a portion of the surface area of the film. For example, the abrasive medium <b>126</b> may be disposed on an edge of the film.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> may be rigid or flexible. Providing a flexible abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> allows a precise portion of the abrasive medium <b>126</b> disposed or deposited thereon to be placed into contact with the portion <b>146</b> of the optical fiber <b>148</b> to induce the flaw. Providing a flexible abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> may also allow the deploying of the abrasive medium <b>126</b> in cleavers and other packagings that may not be possible or convenient if a conventional blade cleaver were employed. The abrasive medium <b>126</b> does not include a conventional sharp blade that can easily be placed into precise contact with an optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the embodiments where the abrasive medium <b>126</b> is disposed on sheets of film, the attachment of the film may be of low tolerance. In addition, the film comprising the abrasive medium <b>126</b> may be configured such that the film has a slight bow to it, which will translate into a downward force against the portion <b>146</b> (with exposed glass) of the optical fiber <b>148</b> during cleaving. The amount of the bow in one embodiment is enough to ensure that the film having the abrasive medium <b>126</b> is in contact with the portion <b>146</b> (with exposed glass) of the optical fiber <b>148</b> during as much of the swiping motion of the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> as possible. In this manner, the flexible film will allow the abrasive medium <b>126</b> to remain in contact with the portion <b>146</b> (with exposed glass) of the optical fiber <b>148</b> without having to maintain high tolerances for the location of the film.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Other non-limiting examples of carriers for the abrasive medium <b>126</b> include, but are not limited to, a wire, a string, a block, and a body. The abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> may be of any size and made from any type of material desired, including but not limited to a polymer, plastic, and metal, as non-limiting examples. The quality and nature of the abrasive medium <b>126</b> and the abrasive medium carrier <b>122</b> determine the life or number of uses to cleave the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> may be designed as a single (or low use) cleaver to be used in a cost effective way. The bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> may be shipped as a consumable with the other parts, such as connectors, used by a technician to establish an optical connection in the field. In this manner, cleaver maintenance may be eliminated as the cleaver will simply be disposed of after its life is used up. In addition, because of the use of a flexible abrasive medium carrier, the components of the cleaver may have simpler designs with low precision molded components. This low precision should allow for the components to be manufactured inexpensively and any necessary assembly will not require critical alignment. In one embodiment, the body of the bladeless cleaver <b>100</b> may be an inexpensive plastic component that allows for a flexible tongue <b>106</b> to be molded into it. In addition, the use of the hinge <b>110</b>, particular in the form of living hinges, will allow for the entire assembly to be molded which will keep the components cheap. However, although the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> includes a hinge <b>110</b> to hold the optical fiber <b>148</b> in place during the cleaving process, such a hinge <b>110</b> is not required. For example, the optical fiber could be held in place by an adhesive provided on the fiber guide surface <b>107</b> of the flexible tongue <b>106</b>, or the optical fiber <b>148</b> could even be held in place by the technician during the induction of the bend.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The embodiments disclosed herein are not limited to any particular optical fiber, abrasive medium, carrier, angle of cleaving, stress, and fiber stripping, and method of applying the abrasive medium to the optical fiber. The cleaved optical fiber ends disclosed herein may be disposed or formed on individual fibers or arrays of fibers. A polishing process may be performed after the optical fiber is cleaved.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As used herein, it is intended that terms &#x201c;fiber optic cables&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;optical fibers&#x201d; include all types of single mode and multi-mode light waveguides, including one or more bare optical fibers, loose-tube optical fibers, tight-buffered optical fibers, ribbonized optical fibers, bend-insensitive optical fibers, or any other expedient of a medium for transmitting light signals. An example of a bend-insensitive, or bend resistant, optical fiber is ClearCurve&#xae; Multimode fiber commercially available from Corning Incorporated. Suitable fibers of this type are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008/0166094 and 2009/0169163.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Bend insensitive multimode optical fibers may comprise a graded-index core region and a cladding region surrounding and directly adjacent to the core region, the cladding region comprising a depressed-index annular portion comprising a depressed relative refractive index relative to another portion of the cladding. The depressed-index annular portion of the cladding is preferably spaced apart from the core. Preferably, the refractive index profile of the core has a parabolic or substantially curved shape. The depressed-index annular portion may, for example, comprise a) glass comprising a plurality of voids, or b) glass doped with one or more downdopants such as fluorine, boron, individually or mixtures thereof. The depressed-index annular portion may have a refractive index delta less than about &#x2212;0.2% and a width of at least about one (1) &#x3bc;m (micron), said depressed-index annular portion being spaced from said core by at least about 0.5 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments that comprise a cladding with voids, the voids in some preferred embodiments are non-periodically located within the depressed-index annular portion. By &#x201c;non-periodically located&#x201d; we mean that when one takes a cross section (such as a cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal axis) of the optical fiber, the non-periodically disposed voids are randomly or non-periodically distributed across a portion of the fiber (e.g. within the depressed-index annular region). Similar cross sections taken at different points along the length of the fiber will reveal different randomly distributed cross-sectional hole patterns, i.e., various cross sections will have different hole patterns, wherein the distributions of voids and sizes of voids do not exactly match for each such cross section. That is, the voids are non-periodic, i.e., they are not periodically disposed within the fiber structure. These voids are stretched (elongated) along the length (i.e. generally parallel to the longitudinal axis) of the optical fiber, but do not extend the entire length of the entire fiber for typical lengths of transmission fiber. It is believed that the voids extend along the length of the fiber a distance less than about 20 meters, more preferably less than about ten (10) meters, even more preferably less than about 5 meters, and in some embodiments less than one (1) meter.</p>
