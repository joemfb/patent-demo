<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Provided are assemblies and processes for efficiently coupling wideband differential signals between balanced and unbalanced circuits. The assemblies include a broadband balun having an unbalanced transmission line portion, a balanced transmission line portion, and a transition region disposed between the unbalanced and balanced transmission line portions. The unbalanced transmission line portion includes at least one ground and a pair of conductive signal traces, each isolated from ground. The balanced portion does not include an analog ground. The transition region effectively terminates the analog ground, while also smoothly transitioning or otherwise shaping transverse electric field distributions between the balanced and unbalanced portions. Beneficially, the balun is free from resonant features that would otherwise limit operating bandwidth, allowing it to operate over a wide bandwidth of 10:1 or greater. Assemblies can include RF chokes with back-to-back baluns, and other elements, such as balanced filters, and also can be implemented as integrated circuits.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a Continuation In Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/610,258, filed on Sep. 11, 2012 which is a Continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 8,283,991, issued on Oct. 9, 2012. The entire content of the above applications is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various embodiments are described herein relating generally to the field of microwave and RF circuits and the like, and more particularly to baluns used in such circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Transmission of a signal over a differential transmission line reduces the influence of noise or interference due to external stray electric fields. Any external signal sources tend to induce only a common mode signal on the transmission line and the balanced impedances to ground minimizes differential pickup due to stray electric fields. A differential transmission line allows a differential receiver to reduce the noise on a connection by rejecting common-mode interference. The transmission lines have the same impedance to ground, so the interfering fields or currents induce the same voltage in both wires. Use of such balanced circuits for differential signals, however, has generally been applied at lower frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A circuit element referred to as a balun is generally used to convert unbalanced transmission line inputs into one or more balanced transmission line outputs or vice versa. Baluns operating at low-frequency bands generally consist of a concentrated, constant component such as a transformer. Such low-frequency baluns often leverage ferrite and air coil transformer technology to achieve high performance and very broad bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Trends in electronics, however, are generally toward ever increasing operational frequencies and bandwidths. Thus, baluns are being employed in various demanding applications often requiring high-frequency and/or wideband operation. For example, baluns are being incorporated in output stages of delta-sigma modulator direct digital synthesizers, Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs), Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), differential digital signaling, RF mixers, SAW filters, and antenna feeds. Such applications demand miniature, wide-bandwidth (wideband) baluns compatible with integrated circuits and capable of rejecting common mode energy from differential inputs or providing differential outputs lacking common mode energy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At radio-wave frequencies (e.g., microwave) and higher it becomes increasingly difficult to fabricate broadband baluns having ferrite and air coil transformer, necessitating other techniques. Baluns that operate at such high-frequency bands generally consist of a distributed, constant component. Since most of these baluns each of which consists of a distributed, constant component include a quarter-wavelength matching element or are transformers whose size is determined according to usable wavelengths, a disadvantage to them is that their frequency bands are fundamentally narrow. Moreover, such high frequency signals (e.g., RF, microwave, millimeter wave) typically rely on single-ended and unbalanced anti-phase signals, rather than balanced differential signals. Namely, a signal is driven with reference to a ground. Such single-ended signals may be beneficial in controlling electromagnetic interference (consider high-frequency transmission lines, such as coaxial cable, in which an outer conductor is grounded). Unfortunately, such structures are not well suited to accommodate balanced differential signals, which are necessarily isolated from ground.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Described herein are embodiments of systems and techniques for coupling differential signals between unbalanced transmission lines and balanced transmission lines using balun structures supporting ultra-wideband operation. In at least some embodiments, the coupling is accomplished for at least one of microwave and millimeter wave operating ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, at least one embodiment described herein provides a broadband balun including an unbalanced transmission line portion, a balanced transmission line portion, and a transition region disposed between the unbalanced transmission line portion and the balanced transmission line portion. The unbalanced transmission line portion includes a first in-phase trace extending along a longitudinal axis, a first anti-phase trace extending parallel to the first trace, and at least one ground plane parallel to, electromagnetically coupled with, and physically isolated from each of the first in-phase and anti-phase traces. The balanced transmission line portion includes a second in-phase trace and a second anti-phase trace. The second in-phase trace is in electrical communication with the first in-phase trace and a second anti-phase trace in electrical communication with first anti-phase trace. Further, each of the second in-phase and anti-phase traces is vertically parallel (broadside) with its respective first in-phase and anti-phase traces, while also being substantially uncoupled to the at least one ground plane.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, at least one ground plane is disposed between the first in-phase trace and the first anti-phase trace. Consequently, each of the in-phase and anti-phase traces together with an adjacent side of the at least one ground plane forms a respective microstrip waveguide. More generally, the unbalanced transmission line portion can be one of: a microstrip waveguide; a coplanar stripline; a parallel plate stripline; a finite-ground coplanar waveguide (FGCPW); a coplanar waveguide; a coplanar stripline; an asymmetric stripline; and a slot line. In at least some embodiments, the unbalanced and balanced transmission lines are capable of at least one of millimeter wave transmission and microwave transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, each of the microstrip transmission lines has a respective first characteristic impedance, the characteristic impedances being substantially equal. Additionally, the balanced transmission line portion has a second characteristic impedance, which is approximately twice that of either first characteristic impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The transition region includes a respective terminal edge defining a boundary of each of the at least one ground planes between the unbalanced and balanced transmission line portions. A ground plane edge variation is also provided, extending along the longitudinal axis for a predetermined length measured from the respective terminal edge. Additionally, respective cross sections of each of the unbalanced, balanced and transition regions are substantially symmetric with respect to the longitudinal axis. In some embodiments, the ground plane edge variation defines a tapered extension of the ground plane extending away from the unbalanced transmission line portion with a narrow end directed towards the balanced transmission line portion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, each of the unbalanced transmission line portion, the balanced transmission line portion and the transition region are incorporated into an integrated circuit. The integrated circuit can be implemented according to any suitable integrated circuit device technologies, for example, being selected from the group consisting of: Si; Ge; III-V semiconductor; GaAs, and SiGe; and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the balun can be combined with or otherwise adapted to include a differential filter. For example, such a differential filter can be coupled to an end of the balanced transmission line portion opposite the transition region.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Alternatively or in addition, the balun can be combined with or otherwise adapted to include a second broadband balun of similar construction. When so configured, the baluns are coupled together along their respective balanced transmission line portions, in a back-to-back configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect, at least one embodiment described herein relates to a process for efficiently coupling differential signals between an unbalanced differential transmission line and a balanced differential transmission line. In particular, the unbalanced differential transmission line has at least one analog ground reference; whereas, the balanced differential transmission line does not have any such analog ground reference. The process includes receiving electromagnetic energy by way of a propagating transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave from one of the unbalanced and the balanced differential transmission lines. The TEM wave has a first transverse electric field distribution, which is symmetric about an axial centerline. The received electromagnetic energy is transferred to the other one of the unbalanced and the balanced differential transmission lines (i.e., unbalanced-to-balanced or balanced-to-unbalanced). The TEM wave, likewise, has a second transverse electric field distribution, which is also symmetric about an axial centerline. The process further includes symmetrically reconfiguring the first electromagnetic field distribution to conform to the second electromagnetic field distribution. Such symmetric reconfiguration is accomplished along a transition region disposed between the unbalanced and balanced differential transmission lines. The reconfiguration minimizes reflection of electromagnetic energy over a bandwidth of at least 10:1, for electromagnetic energy including at least one of a millimeter wave transmission and a microwave transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Symmetrically reconfiguring can be accomplished gradually along the axial centerline. In some embodiments, the act of symmetrically reconfiguring is accomplished by way of interaction of the TEM wave with at least one analog ground along the transition region. For example, symmetrically reconfiguring can be accomplished by shaping the transverse electric field distribution by way of a longitudinal taper in the at least one analog ground reference.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another aspect, at least one embodiment described herein provides a broadband balun including an unbalanced transmission line portion, a balanced transmission line portion, and a transition region disposed between the unbalanced and the balanced transmission line portions. The broadband balun includes means for receiving electromagnetic energy by way of a propagating transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave or Quasi-TEM wave from one of the unbalanced differential transmission line and the balanced differential transmission line. The TEM wave has a first transverse electric field distribution, which is symmetric about an axial centerline. The balun also includes means for transferring the received electromagnetic energy to the other one of the unbalanced differential transmission line and a balanced differential transmission line. The TEM wave has a second transverse electric field distribution, which is also symmetric about the axial centerline. Still further, the balun includes means for symmetrically reconfiguring the first electromagnetic field distribution to conform to the second electromagnetic field distribution. The reconfiguring means are disposed along a transition region between the unbalanced and balanced differential transmission lines. The reconfiguring means minimizes reflection of the electromagnetic energy over a bandwidth of at least about 10:1.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one aspect, at least one embodiment described herein provides an electrical system. The electrical system includes at least one ground plane defining one or more apertures; and a broadband balun. The broadband balun includes an unbalanced transmission line portion, including a first in-phase trace extending along a longitudinal axis, a first anti-phase trace extending parallel to the first in-phase trace, and the at least one ground plane parallel to, electromagnetically coupled with, and physically isolated from each of the first in-phase and anti-phase traces; a balanced transmission line portion, the balanced transmission line portion including a second in-phase trace in electrical communication with the first in-phase trace, and a second anti-phase trace in electrical communication with the first anti-phase trace, each of the second in-phase and anti-phase traces being vertically broadside with its respective first in-phase and anti-phase traces and substantially uncoupled to the at least one ground plane, wherein at least a portion of the one or more apertures defined by the at least one ground plane is positioned at least one of between, above, or below the second in-phase trace and the second anti-phase trace, a transition region disposed between the unbalanced transmission line portion and the balanced transmission line portion, the transition region comprising a respective terminal edge defining a boundary of each of the at least one ground planes between the unbalanced and balanced transmission line portions and a ground plane edge variation extending along the longitudinal axis for a predetermined length measured from the respective terminal edge, wherein respective cross sections of each of the unbalanced, balanced and transition regions are substantially symmetric with respect to the longitudinal axis.</p>

In some embodiments the electrical system includes a differential filter coupled to an end of the balanced transmission line portion opposite the transition region; and a second balun configured to transition a balanced, filtered output of the differential filter to a second unbalanced transmission line portion.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A description of embodiments of systems and processes for interconnecting unbalanced and balanced structures adapted for carrying differential signals over a substantially wide bandwidth follows. More particularly, travelling wave structures without elements resonant at any particular frequency, are arranged along a central, longitudinal axis, having in-phase and anti-phase conductive traces configured to collectively support the transfer of differential signals. The travelling wave structures can include transmission lines, otherwise referred to as waveguide sections, configured as parallel-plate waveguides, co-planar waveguides, microstrip waveguides and differential stripline waveguides, including parallel-plate and co-planar stripline waveguides. The structures are referred to as baluns and can accommodate efficient transfer of differential signals in either direction (e.g., from unbalanced to balanced and from balanced to unbalanced), with minimal reflections or other reductions in signal integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The baluns include an unbalanced portion having at least one analog or digital ground herein generally referred to as ground. The ground is physically isolated (i.e., no direct-current path) from either the in-phase or anti-phase traces. At non-zero frequencies, however, the traces and ground together support common mode signals along the differential signal traces. Such common mode signals are sometimes referred to as even mode signals. The at least one analog ground is substantially removed, or otherwise isolated from the differential signal traces in the balanced portion. The transition from ground to no-ground occurs in the transition region. Consequently, common mode signals are no longer supported along the balanced portion as an effective common mode impedance measured between either trace and the at least one analog ground approaches an open circuit (i.e., infinite impedance). The differential signal traces, however, remain capable of supporting differential mode propagation. Such differential mode signals without common mode signals represents a balanced configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A schematic diagram of an embodiment of a broadband, differential-signal balun <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In various embodiments, it may be preferable to avoid electrical resonance (resonance) in an electrical system or device (e.g., one including a broadband balun <b>300</b>) because resonance can be detrimental to the operation of a circuit. In particular, resonance may cause unwanted sustained and transient oscillations which may cause noise, signal distortion, and damage to circuit elements. It may also, in various embodiments, be preferable to prevent reflection of electromagnetic radiation because such reflection may lead to increased insertion loss through the circuit to the output of the broadband balun <b>300</b>. Increased insertion loss is a measure of the loss of signal power resulting from the insertion of a device (e.g., broadband balun <b>300</b>) into a transmission line or optical fiber. Insertion loss may be detrimental to various applications where maintaining high signal power is desirable. Imbalances in the current flow through a circuit can cause electrical resonance and insertion loss in the circuit. One source of imbalances can be geometric features in the circuit (e.g., dimensional features or particular shapes of electrical traces). For example, electrical traces that are not symmetric, or which have different lengths, can create imbalances in the circuit. Certain geometric features can therefore create an undesirable imbalance in the current flow through the circuit. Therefore, and as described with further detail below, designing or configuring electrical circuits such that they employ particular dimensions and shapes of the ground plane aperture <b>314</b> may be desirable to, for example, prevent slot resonances and/or prevent electromagnetic radiation (reflection) in a particular electrical system or application.</p>

Such embodiments have non-negligible fringe E-field effects and a length less than h may prevent the fringe E-fields of the desired differential signal from transitioning smoothly. A non-smooth transition will cause unwanted reflections, resulting in increased insertion loss.

In many embodiments, an electrical system including the broadband balun <b>300</b> may be designed to resonate at one-quarter wavelengths below the highest operating frequency of the system. Therefore, if L<sub>1 </sub>and/or L<sub>2 </sub>exceeds the maximum length, the reflected return path of the slotline may produce quarter-wavelength reflected energy, resulting in resonance.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments the slotline may be symmetrical about the propagation direction <b>301</b> of the broadband balun <b>300</b> (i.e., L<sub>1</sub>=L<sub>2</sub>) and in other embodiments it may be desirable to provide an asymmetrical slotline portion <b>340</b> (i.e., L<sub>1</sub>&#x2260;L<sub>2</sub>). Further, although the slotline portion <b>340</b> is illustrated as a rectangular shape, it will be apparent in view of this disclosure that any suitable shape may be used (e.g., circular, elliptical, or octagonal).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described in further detail below with reference to the particular embodiments illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B</figref>, <b>14</b>A, and <b>14</b>B, the width (W) of the slotline portion <b>340</b> varies depending on the particular application and/or electrical system in which the broadband balun <b>300</b> is used. Generally, the width of the slotline portion <b>340</b> affects the impedance and reflection characteristics of the electrical system, thereby affecting resonance and insertion loss properties.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The slotline open portion <b>350</b> may, in various embodiments, include an open taper section <b>352</b>. In such embodiments, the open taper section <b>352</b> extends outward from the slotline portion <b>340</b> and broadens at an open angle (&#x3b8;). For embodiments having a maximum operating frequency of less than 1 GHz, any &#x3b8; between 0 and 180 degrees is suitable. In such embodiments the use of 0 or 180 degrees in particular may provide for simplicity of design and cost-effective fabrication in comparison to other angles. However, in wider-band applications having a maximum operating frequency greater than 1 GHz, a narrower angular range is required to limit unwanted electromagnetic emissions. Therefore, various such embodiments may incorporate a &#x3b8; between 60 and 110 degrees for the open taper section to avoid unwanted electromagnetic emissions. If &#x3b8; is too small, the transition will be too gradual and exhibit distributed reflection characteristics, acting less like an open circuit. If &#x3b8; is too large, the transition becomes more abrupt and will radiate additional electromagnetic energy, resulting in unwanted reflections.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The slotline open portion <b>350</b> may also include an end region <b>354</b>. The end region <b>354</b> may be any suitable shape including, for example, completely open-ended (i.e., the open taper section <b>352</b> runs to the edge of the substrate <b>303</b> or circuit board on which the ground plane aperture <b>314</b> is formed), flat-ended (i.e., the end region <b>354</b> is a flat edge of the central ground plane <b>306</b> at an end of the open taper section <b>352</b> opposite the slotline portion <b>340</b>), fully circular, or semi-circular. End regions <b>354</b> that are completely open-ended or flat-ended are simpler and more cost-efficient to design and fabricate than more complex shapes. However, use of such designs in electrical systems having a maximum operating frequency greater than 1 GHz may cause additional electromagnetic emissions, because these particular electrical trace features create an imbalance in the current flow through the circuit that results in unwanted differential signal reflections. Therefore, various such embodiments may incorporate a fully circular or semi-circular as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) end-region <b>354</b> to avoid such unwanted differential signal reflections and, consequently, increased insertion loss.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The minimum radius (R) of circular or semi-circular end regions <b>354</b> may, for various embodiments, be one quarter of the wavelength of the maximum operating frequency of the electrical system in which the broadband balun <b>300</b> is used. If R is too small, the end region <b>354</b> will not behave like an open at lower operating frequencies. Rather, an end region <b>354</b> having too small a radius R may cause additional electromagnetic emissions, resulting in unwanted differential signal reflections at transition <b>300</b> and, consequently, increased differential signal insertion loss through to <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The maximum R of circular or semi-circular end regions <b>354</b> may, for various embodiments, be largely dependent on a particular physical design of the ground plane aperture <b>314</b>. Generally, the maximum R of such end regions <b>354</b> will be equivalent to the wavelength of a frequency between the minimum and maximum operating frequency of the electrical system in which the broadband balun <b>300</b> is used. In various embodiments, the maximum R will be a wavelength of a frequency in a middle portion of the operating range of the electrical system (e.g., between 25% and 75% of the operating range; between 40% and 60% of the operating range; between 45% and 55% of the operating range). If the value of R was selected to be less than the minimum or greater than the maximum, the system would experience unwanted resonant behavior or high insertion loss performance during operation.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In various embodiments, additional impedance matching at transition <b>300</b> may be achievable by providing a horizontal offset from vertical alignment between an in-phase trace and an anti-phase trace to effectively increase h without actually increasing the vertical dimension h.

By relying on travelling wave structures (e.g., waveguides), without any resonant elements, the balun <b>300</b> performs well over a wide bandwidth. By providing a smooth transition of electric field distributions, the balun <b>300</b> avoids unwanted reflections, again supporting wideband operation.

The balun <b>400</b>&#x2032; includes an unbalanced portion <b>402</b>, a transition region <b>420</b> and a balanced portion <b>412</b>. The unbalanced region <b>402</b> includes a vertically aligned pair of opposing microstrip waveguides formed along opposite sides of a central ground plane <b>406</b> (again, the ground plane is illustrated as shaded, being visible through a dielectric layer). A first microstrip waveguide includes an in-phase conductive trace <b>404</b><i>a </i>and a second microstrip waveguide includes a parallel anti-phase conductive trace <b>404</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In at least some embodiments, the transition region <b>420</b> also includes an extension <b>416</b> projecting away from the bounding edge <b>413</b>.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, a width of the traces <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b </i>of the unbalanced portion <b>402</b> is different than a width of the traces <b>414</b><i>a</i>, <b>414</b><i>b </i>of the balanced portion <b>412</b>. For example, the traces of the balanced portion <b>412</b> can be wider than the traces of the unbalanced portion. Alternatively or in addition, a separation between the traces can also differ between the unbalanced and balanced regions <b>402</b>, <b>412</b>. Selection of such physical parameters as the widths, heights or separation spacing, thicknesses and dielectric constant can be selected to control a physical property of a respective waveguide, such as its characteristic impedance. For example, the physical parameters of the microstrip waveguides of the unbalanced portion <b>402</b> can be selected for a characteristic impedance of about 50 Ohms. Similarly, the physical parameters of the parallel-plate waveguide of the balanced portion <b>420</b> can be selected for a characteristic impedance of about 100 Ohms. Preferably, characteristic impedances of the unbalanced portion <b>402</b> and balanced portion <b>412</b> are such that the possibility of any unwanted reflections or mismatch to electromagnetic waves propagating along the balun <b>400</b>&#x2032; are minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Unwanted reflections can be characterized according to such parameters as a reflection coefficient (e.g., a ratio of a reflected wave voltage to an incident wave voltage) or as another parameter generally known as a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR). Another value known as the return loss can be determined as an estimate of inefficiency of energy transfer along the balun, for example, due to unwanted reflections. As a broadband device, the balun <b>400</b>&#x2032; exhibits favorable performance (e.g., reflection coefficient, VSWR, return loss) over a relatively wide range of operating frequencies. Such measures of favorable performance may include a VSWR of less than about 2:1, or a return loss of greater than about &#x2212;9.54 dB. In some embodiments, wideband includes operating frequency range of at least ten times its lower frequency (i.e., 10:1). In at least some embodiments, the balun <b>400</b>&#x2032; is capable of operation over at least one of frequency band of operation generally known as millimeter wave transmission and microwave transmission.</p>

Such vertical ground screens <b>469</b><i>a</i>, <b>469</b><i>b </i>can be provided, for example, by vertically aligned conductive elements. In the illustrative embodiment, the vertical conductive elements are provided by conducting (i.e., plated-through) vias extending between and electrically interconnecting the upper and lower ground planes <b>446</b><i>a</i>, <b>446</b><i>b</i>. In at least some embodiments, the conductive vias are disposed adjacent to edges of the left and right-hand portions <b>466</b><i>a</i>, <b>466</b><i>b </i>facing the central axis. Spacing between adjacent vias of such a &#x201c;picket fence&#x201d; arrangement can be controlled, for example, having a maximum separation between adjacent vias of less than one-quarter minimum-operating wavelength. Preferably, separation between adjacent vias is no more than about one-tenth of a minimum-operating wavelength.</p>

In other embodiments the widths are different, as illustrated. For example, the traces of the balanced portion <b>452</b> can be narrower or wider (as shown) than the traces of the unbalanced portion <b>442</b>. Alternatively or in addition, a separation between the traces <b>444</b><i>a</i>-<b>444</b><i>b</i>, <b>454</b><i>a</i>-<b>454</b><i>b </i>can also differ or be the same (as shown) between the unbalanced and balanced regions <b>442</b>, <b>452</b>. Selection of such physical parameters as the widths, heights or separation spacing, thicknesses and dielectric constant can be selected to control a physical property of a respective waveguide, such as its characteristic impedance. For example, the physical parameters of the parallel-plate stripline waveguide of the unbalanced portion <b>442</b> can be selected for a characteristic impedance of typically about 50 Ohms to 100 Ohms. Similarly, the physical parameters of the embedded parallel-plate waveguide of the balanced portion <b>452</b> can be selected for a preferred characteristic impedance, for example, of about 50 Ohms to 100 Ohms. Preferably, characteristic impedances of the unbalanced portion <b>442</b> and balanced portion <b>452</b> are chosen such that the possibility of unwanted reflections or mismatch to electromagnetic waves propagating along the balun <b>400</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; are minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some of the embodiments described herein, transitions between traces having different widths can be accomplished in a stepped or graded fashion (e.g., a rectangular transition from one width to the next).

The taper can be linear, curved, or any suitable combination of linear and curved. Additionally, for embodiments in which the difference in widths is relatively substantial, the transition can be accomplished in multiple transitions occurring over a series of steps. For example, in the illustrative embodiment, intermediate traces <b>464</b><i>a</i>, <b>464</b><i>b </i>are provided in the transition region <b>460</b>, having a width between the widths of the unbalanced portion traces <b>444</b><i>a</i>, <b>444</b><i>b </i>and the balanced portion traces <b>454</b><i>a</i>, <b>454</b><i>b. </i></p>

Electromagnetic energy is first received at step <b>710</b> from one of the unbalanced and the balanced differential transmission lines.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The electric field distribution is symmetrically reconfigured at step <b>730</b> along a transition region between the unbalanced and balanced differential transmission lines.

In the re-configuration, the first electromagnetic field distribution is preferably modified in a gradual manner along the axial centerline to conform to the second electromagnetic field distribution. Preferably, the reconfiguration minimizes reflection of electromagnetic energy over a relatively wide operational bandwidth. For example, the operational bandwidth can be at least 10:1. In at least some embodiments, the operational bandwidth includes sub-centimeter wavelengths. Alternatively or in addition, the operational bandwidth includes sub-millimeter wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">SiGe Example:</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In a first example, an integrated circuit implementation of a balun includes differential microstrip unbalanced portion and a parallel-conductor balanced portion. Considering an IBM SiGe-7hp process, five metal layers are available, each separated from adjacent layers by a material having a dielectric constant (&#x2208;<sub>r</sub>) of about 3.1 and a distance (H<sub>U</sub>) of about 1.2 &#x3bc;m, and deep trench isolation for substantial termination of a grounded substrate in the transition region of the balun. A characteristic impedance Z<sub>0 </sub>of a microstrip waveguide can be calculated according to well known techniques, such as those developed by H. A. Wheeler and described in &#x201c;Microwave Engineer's Handbook, Vol. I&#x201d;, by T. Saad, Ed., 1971, p. 137. The Saad reference includes a series of parametric curves according to dielectric constant for a microstrip's characteristic impedance versus its width-to-height ratio. In particular, the curves are provided for ratios greater than 0.1 (w/h&#x3e;0.1), which is referred to as a wide strip approximation. From Saad, a width-to-height ratio of about 2.4 is required for a Z<sub>0 </sub>of 50 Ohms, which requires a width (W<sub>U</sub>) of about 3 &#x3bc;m. Thus, for an embodiment of a wideband balun constructed a semiconductor according to the IBM SiGe-7hp process, and having an &#x201c;over-under&#x201d; arrangement in the unbalanced portion (e.g., similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), the width (W<sub>U</sub>) of each of the respective in-phase and anti-phase traces would be about 3 &#x3bc;m, for a design characteristic impedance Z<sub>0U</sub>=50 Ohms for each of the in-phase and anti-phase microstrip waveguides.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The balanced portion can be formed by removal of the ground plane layer resulting in a parallel plate waveguide arrangement (e.g., similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Removal of the ground plane results in a separation between the in-phase and anti-phase traces (H<sub>B</sub>) of the balanced portion of about 3.25 &#x3bc;m. This represents twice the separation distance between layers (i.e., 2&#xd7;1.2 &#x3bc;m), plus the thickness of the removed metal layer (i.e., about 0.85 &#x3bc;m).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">An approximate relationship between trace width (w), separation distance (h) and characteristic impedance (Z<sub>0</sub>) of a parallel plate waveguide is provided by Z<sub>0</sub>=377/(&#x2208;<sub>r</sub>)*(h/w), discussed in &#x201c;Microwave Engineering and Applications,&#x201d; by O. P. Gandhi, 1981, p. 53. This relationship can be used to estimate the approximate trace widths (W<sub>B</sub>) for a design characteristic impedance (e.g., 100 Ohms), neglecting fringe capacitance. Thus, for target characteristic impedance of 100 Ohms and given a separation distance (H<sub>B</sub>) of 3.25 &#x3bc;m, the width (W<sub>B</sub>) of the in-phase and anti-phase traces of the balanced over-under configuration is about 7 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Transition from the unbalanced portion trace width (W<sub>U</sub>) of 3 &#x3bc;m to the balanced portion trace width (W<sub>B</sub>) of 7 &#x3bc;m can be implemented as a step discontinuity. Alternatively, such a transition can be accomplished using well known techniques to compensate for excess reactance associated with such size differences. At least one approach is to provide linear chamfer (taper) at the discontinuity. For example, a 45 deg. linear taper can be provided in the transition region. The taper length depends upon the step ratio, the dielectric constant value, and the substrate thickness. As described by K. C. Gupta et al., three such width transitions include linear tapers, curved tapers, and partial linear tapers. Under some circumstances, a taper may not be necessary.</p>
