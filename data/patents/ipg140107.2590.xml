<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the invention relate generally to integrated circuit chip packages and, more particularly, to chip package build-up. Chip packages are manufactured using a technique that protects the die from contamination during a build-up process of the chip package.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Integrated circuit (IC) chip packages are typically fabricated to include one or more dies that are attached to a laminate re-distribution layer. The laminate re-distribution layer is comprised of a dielectric laminate material, such as Kapton&#xae;, and is affixed to the die by way of an adhesive layer. The die(s) are electrically connected to an input/output system by way of metal interconnects routed through a plurality of additional laminate re-distribution layers that are adhered to the base re-distribution layer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A standard chip package manufacturing or build-up process typically begins with providing of the base laminate re-distribution layer and application of an adhesive on one surface thereof. The one or more dies are then secured relative to the base laminate re-distribution layer by applying a front or active face of the die(s) onto the adhesive layer such that a bond is formed between the active face of the die(s) and the adhesive layer across the full face of the die(s). Metal interconnects are then formed and routed through the base laminate re-distribution layer and through any additional laminate re-distribution layers that are subsequently added during build-up of the chip package.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Deposition of the die(s) onto the base re-distribution layer in this manner, however, has inherent limitations in regards to the production process and the structure and functionality of the resulting chip package that is produced. That is, in some applications it is desirable that the active face of the die(s) be protected from possible contamination during the build-up process of the chip package. For example, for application of the chip package in an imaging device such as an ultra camera or similar sensing device, it is desired that the imager area (i.e., the die) be protected from contamination during the build-up process. As the imager area/die in such an application is to be left exposed upon completion of the build-up of the chip package, it is undesirable for a bond to be formed between the active face of the die and the adhesive layer across the full face of the die during the build-up process. Such a build-up would require subsequent removal of the adhesive from the imaging area and could introduce contaminates to the imaging area, thereby negatively affecting the performance of the ultra camera/sensing device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly there is a need for a method for chip package fabrication that protects the die from contamination during the build-up process. There is a further need for the fabrication method to be readily incorporated into an assembly process, be compatible with laser drilling, be scalable, and provide for a low cost assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the invention overcome the aforementioned drawbacks by providing a method of chip fabrication in which the chip package is manufactured using a removable shield element that is placed over the die and separated therefrom by an air pocket. The shield element protects the die from contamination during the build-up process and can be subsequently removed therefrom to expose a clean front surface of the die.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a chip package includes a base re-distribution layer having an opening formed therein in a center area of the base re-distribution layer, an adhesive layer applied to one side of the base re-distribution layer having a window formed therein free of adhesive material, and a die having a front surface affixed to the base re-distribution layer by way of the adhesive layer, wherein the die is aligned with the window formed in the adhesive layer such that only a perimeter of the front surface of the die is in contact with the adhesive layer. The chip package also includes a plurality of vias and a plurality of metal interconnects formed in the base re-distribution layer to electrically connect the base re-distribution layer to the die and a shield element positioned between the base re-distribution layer and the adhesive layer and generally aligned with the opening formed in the base re-distribution layer and the window of the adhesive layer such that only a perimeter of the shield element is attached to the adhesive layer, with the shield element being separated from the die by an air gap. The shield element is configured to be selectively removable from the adhesive layer so as to expose the front surface of the die.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method of forming a chip package includes providing an initial polymer laminate layer, depositing a metallic shield element on one surface of the initial polymer laminate layer so as to cover a portion thereof, and applying an adhesive layer to the initial polymer laminate layer and over the metallic shield element, the adhesive layer having a portion removed therefrom to form a window in the adhesive layer that corresponds substantially to a surface area of the metallic shield element and aligned therewith. The method also includes adhering a die to the initial polymer laminate layer by way of the adhesive layer, with the die being positioned over the window such a perimeter of the die is in contact with the adhesive layer and an air pocket is formed between a center portion of the die and the shield element. The method further includes patterning the initial polymer laminate layer to include a plurality of vias and a plurality of metal interconnects so as to electrically connect the initial polymer laminate layer to the die, defining a portion of the initial polymer laminate layer corresponding to the window in the adhesive layer, and removing the portion of the initial polymer laminate layer and the metallic shield element from the adhesive layer so as to expose a front surface of the die.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a method for manufacturing a chip module includes providing a base re-distribution layer, depositing a shield element on one surface of the base re-distribution layer so as to cover a portion thereof, applying an adhesive layer to the base re-distribution layer and over the shield element, ablating a portion of the adhesive layer in an area adjacent to the shield element so as to expose at least a majority of the shield element, and applying a front surface of a die to the adhesive layer such that the die is aligned with the shield element, wherein a perimeter of the die is in contact with the adhesive layer and a center portion of the die is separated from the shield element by an air gap formed therebetween. The method also includes maintaining the shield element in place during a subsequent patterning of the base re-distribution layer that forms a plurality of vias and a plurality of metal interconnects to electrically connect the base re-distribution layer to the die, ablating a portion of the base re-distribution layer adjacent to the shield element, and removing the shield element and the portion of the base distribution layer so as to expose the front surface of the die.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the present invention provide for a method of forming a chip package. The chip package is manufactured using a shield element or protective layer to protect the surface of a die during build-up and patterning of laminate re-distribution layers of the chip package.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of manufactured chip packages <b>10</b> or chip modules are shown. Each chip package <b>10</b> includes a die <b>12</b> connected with a plurality of re-distribution layers <b>14</b> (i.e., laminate layers). Each die <b>12</b> is formed from a monosilicon crystal ingot or polysilicon crystal ingot and prepared such that an integrated circuit (IC) layout is formed on its surface. According to one embodiment of the invention, die <b>12</b> is configured for use in an imaging device such as an ultra camera, cellular phone camera, or similar sensing device. Die <b>12</b> is thus constructed as a &#x201c;camera die&#x201d; that forms an imaging area for image sensing. Regarding re-distribution layers <b>14</b> of chip package <b>10</b>, each of the plurality of re-distribution layers <b>14</b> is in the form of a pre-formed laminate sheet or film that can be placed relative to the die <b>12</b>. The re-distribution layers <b>14</b> can be formed of Kapton&#xae;, Ultem&#xae;, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or another polymer film, such as a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) or a polyimide material. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each chip package <b>10</b> is formed by dicing through re-distribution layers <b>14</b> in an area between adjacent chip packages <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref>, steps in a technique for manufacturing a plurality of chip packages <b>10</b> (i.e., a chip build-up) are set forth, according to an embodiment of the invention, with side cross-sectional views and top views of chip package(s) <b>10</b> being shown at various stages of the build-up process. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a complete frame of an initial or base re-distribution layer <b>16</b> is provided and mounted on a frame <b>18</b> to allow for additional manufacturing steps to be performed thereon. As set forth above, the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> is in the form of a flexible polymer laminate layer, such as Kapton&#xae;, Ultem&#xae;, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or another polymer/polyimide film, and is of a size that allows for the production of a plurality of chip packages <b>10</b> therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A portion of the complete frame of the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>, and of additional layers and components added thereto, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref>, such that build-up of a single chip package <b>10</b> is illustrated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> is provided. According to the build-up process, a metal layer <b>18</b> is then deposited on one side of initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, with the metal layer <b>18</b> being formed of a material that will provide a suitable bond with an adhesive that will subsequently be applied (e.g., Ti/Cu/Ti, chrome, etc.). The metal layer <b>18</b> may be sputtered on initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> or added in any other suitable manner, such as electroplating. The metal layer <b>18</b> is patterned such that a protective shield element <b>20</b> is formed having an area that, according to one embodiment, substantially matches an area of die <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to be subsequently added to chip package <b>10</b>, as will be explained in detail below. Alternatively, it is recognized that protective shield element <b>20</b> could be formed to have an area much smaller than an area of a die <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, metal layer <b>18</b> is further patterned to form a vent base <b>21</b> that extends out from shield element <b>20</b> past an area of die <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to be added. According to one embodiment, metal layer <b>18</b> may be further patterned so as to form a plurality of base metal interconnects <b>22</b> on initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in a next step of the build-up technique of chip package <b>10</b>, an adhesive layer <b>24</b> is applied to initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> and over metal layer <b>18</b>. The adhesive layer <b>24</b> may be applied to initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> via a spin coating application of an ablatable epoxy or may alternatively be in the form of an adhesive film that is applied onto initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>. The adhesive layer <b>24</b> is then partially cured or baked. Upon partial curing, the adhesive layer <b>24</b> is ablated, such as by way of an ultraviolet (UV) laser, so as to form a window <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. Specifically, the adhesive layer <b>24</b> that was applied over shield element <b>20</b> is laser ablated so as to form a window <b>26</b> that exposes the shield element <b>20</b>. Additionally, the adhesive layer <b>24</b> that was applied over vent base <b>21</b> is laser ablated so as to also form a small vent <b>28</b> to the outside of the die area (i.e., extending out from window <b>26</b>). During laser ablation of adhesive layer <b>24</b> to form window <b>26</b> and vent <b>28</b>, it is recognized that shield element <b>20</b> and vent base <b>21</b> act as a &#x201c;back stop&#x201d; that prevents the laser from passing therethrough to the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an alternative embodiment of the manufacturing technique for build-up of chip package <b>10</b>, it is recognized that a pre-cut laminate film could be applied to initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>. That is, rather than applying a continuous adhesive layer <b>24</b> via spin coating and subsequently laser ablating the adhesive layer <b>24</b> to form window <b>26</b>, as shown in FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>A/<b>6</b>B, an adhesive film with a window pre-formed therein could be applied to initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>, such that no laser ablating of the adhesive layer is required.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Upon completion of the laser ablation of adhesive layer <b>24</b>, a portion <b>30</b> of the adhesive layer <b>24</b> surrounding the ablated area (i.e., window <b>26</b>) is exposed to UV light. This exposure to UV light partially cures portion <b>30</b> such that the adhesive layer <b>24</b> is prevented from encroaching into the ablated window <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the build-up of chip package <b>10</b> continues with the aligning and placing of die <b>12</b> (i.e., IC) onto initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> by way of adhesive layer <b>24</b>. The die <b>12</b> is centered over window <b>26</b> and is pressed onto adhesive layer <b>24</b>, at which time the adhesive layer <b>24</b> is fully cured so as to secure the die <b>12</b> to initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>, such as by way of a vacuum lamination and pressure bake curing process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the die <b>12</b> is sized such that it extends out past shield element <b>20</b>. Beneficially, die pads <b>32</b> formed around a periphery of the die <b>12</b> thus are positioned outside the area of die <b>12</b> covered by shield element <b>20</b>, allowing for subsequent electrical connection to the die pads <b>32</b>. Additionally, as die <b>12</b> extends out past shield element <b>20</b>, the die <b>12</b> thus rests on adhesive layer <b>24</b> and forms an air pocket <b>36</b> between the die <b>12</b> and shield element <b>20</b>. The air gap <b>36</b>, in conjunction with shield element <b>20</b>, functions to keep a top surface of die <b>12</b> clean of contamination. As set forth above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a vent port <b>28</b> is ablated into adhesive layer <b>24</b>, with the vent port <b>28</b> extending outward from air pocket <b>36</b> to a region of chip package <b>10</b> outside of that covered by die <b>12</b>. As the vent port <b>28</b> provides fluid communication between air gap <b>36</b> and an ambient environment outside an area covered by die <b>12</b>, pressure in the air gap <b>36</b> can thus be controlled, such as pressure that might otherwise increase in air pocket <b>36</b> during temperature cycling associated with the build-up process of chip package <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, upon securing of the die <b>12</b> to initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>, the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> is patterned to have a plurality of vias <b>38</b> which are drilled through the polymer material forming the re-distribution layer <b>16</b>. According to an exemplary embodiment, the vias <b>38</b> are formed by way of a laser ablation or laser drilling process and are formed at positions corresponding to base metal interconnects <b>22</b> and to die pads <b>32</b>, so as to expose the base metal interconnects <b>22</b> and die pads <b>32</b>. Alternatively, it is also recognized that vias <b>38</b> may be formed by way of other methods including: plasma etching, photo-definition, or mechanical drilling processes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the patterning of the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> includes the application of a metal layer/material (e.g., a seed metal and/or copper) applied onto the re-distribution layer <b>16</b> by way of, for example, a sputtering or electroplating process and the subsequent patterning/etching of the deposited metal layer/material to form metal interconnects <b>40</b>. According to one embodiment of the invention, the metal layer/material is patterned and etched such that metal interconnects <b>40</b> are formed that extend from a top surface of initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> and down through vias <b>38</b>. Metal interconnects <b>40</b> thus form an electrical connection with base metal interconnects <b>22</b> and die pads <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in a next step of the manufacturing technique, one or more additional re-distribution layers <b>42</b> are laminated onto the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> on a side of chip package <b>10</b> opposite from which the die <b>12</b> was applied. The additional re-distribution layer(s) <b>42</b> are applied to the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> through a series of lamination and patterning steps. An adhesive layer <b>44</b> is applied between the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> and an additional re-distribution layer <b>42</b> applied thereto. A plurality of vias <b>38</b> is formed in the additional re-distribution layer(s) <b>42</b>, and metal interconnects <b>40</b> are formed/patterned to extend down through vias <b>38</b> and through the additional re-distribution layer(s) <b>42</b>, so as to electrically connect each additional re-distribution layer <b>42</b>. While only one additional re-distribution layer <b>42</b> is shown applied to initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> to form chip package <b>10</b>, it is recognized that more re-distribution layers could be applied based on a desired configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in further steps of the build-up process, a solder mask <b>46</b> can be applied to an outermost additional re-distribution layer <b>42</b> and subsequently patterned so as to provide protection thereto. It is also envisioned that additional components, such as passive devices (not shown), may also be added to chip package <b>10</b>, with the passive attach being performed while protective shield <b>20</b> is in place, such that die <b>12</b> is protected during such a passive attach.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a next step of the chip manufacturing technique, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>, additional re-distribution layer(s) <b>42</b>, and adhesive layer(s) <b>44</b> are laser ablated along a path <b>48</b> corresponding to a perimeter of protective shield <b>20</b>, so as to define or separate out a portion <b>50</b> of the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>, additional re-distribution layer(s) <b>42</b>, and adhesive layer(s) <b>44</b>. The laser ablation is performed through the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>, additional re-distribution layer(s) <b>42</b>, and adhesive layer(s) <b>44</b> down to protective shield <b>20</b>, where the laser is stopped by the protective shield <b>20</b>. Upon completion of the ablation, the portion <b>50</b> of the initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b>, additional re-distribution layer(s) <b>42</b>, and adhesive layer(s) <b>44</b> positioned above protective shield <b>20</b>, about which the laser ablation was performed, is removed from chip package <b>10</b> along with protective shield <b>20</b>. That is, protective shield <b>20</b> sticks to initial re-distribution layer <b>16</b> and tears readily from adhesive layer <b>24</b>, such that it can be removed from chip package <b>10</b> along with portion <b>50</b> in a single removal step. According to embodiments of the invention, portion <b>50</b> and protective shield <b>20</b> can be removed via one of several techniques, such as vacuum pickup or water scrubbing.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, removal of portion <b>50</b> and protective shield <b>20</b> exposes the front surface <b>52</b> of die <b>12</b> (i.e., die front) in the completed chip package <b>10</b>. Beneficially, and based on the presence of protective shield <b>20</b> above die front <b>52</b> (spaced therefrom by air pocket <b>36</b>) during a duration of the build-up process, the die front <b>52</b> should be clean of contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Beneficially, construction of chip package <b>10</b> according to the technique illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref>, provides for a chip package build-up that protects die <b>12</b> from contamination during the build-up process. Additionally, the build-up technique provides for manufacturing of a chip package <b>10</b> having a decreased thickness, limited only be minimum thickness requirements of die <b>12</b> and re-distribution layer(s) <b>16</b>, <b>42</b>. Such a reduced thickness chip package <b>10</b> may be configured for use in an imaging device such as an ultra camera, cellular phone camera, or similar sensing device, with the build-up process allowing for mounting of a camera lens (not shown) directly to chip package <b>10</b>. However, it is also recognized that the reduced thickness chip package <b>10</b> could be configured for use in other device types, such as microwave devices, or other devices that would benefit from the manufacturing technique set forth above.</p>
