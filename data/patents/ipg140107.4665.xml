<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method, system, and medium are provided for delivering recallable messages via Internet or telephony paths. A sender may configure a message as a recallable message on a communication device that is communicatively connected to a messaging alert platform. The request is delivered to a messaging alert platform, which then delivers the recallable message on the Internet or telephony paths. The messages are formatted by the messaging alert platform based to comply with the requirements of the selected communication path. The messaging alert platform attempts delivery until all paths are exhausted or a response, not an auto-reply, is received from the recipient of the message. The responses are filtered by the messaging alert platform before delivering the response from the recipient to the user.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the invention are defined by the claims below. Embodiments of the invention provide wireless devices, methods, and computer-readable media for, among other things, routing a recallable messages to a recipient. The embodiments of the invention have several practical applications in the technical arts including providing visibility of a message across multiple communication services, reaching a recipient within a sender defined period of time, and providing recall of the recallable message from communication services where the recipient was unavailable or unresponsive.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an embodiment, a computer system generates recallable messages. The computer system includes a sender's communication device and messaging alert platform. The messaging alert platform is communicatively coupled to the sender's communication device. The messaging alert platform is configured to receive a request to transmit recallable messages. In turn, the messaging alert platform attempts delivery of the recallable messages at communication paths available for recipients of the recallable messages. The messaging platform may receive and filter replies in accordance with preferences established by the sender. In some embodiments, the messaging alert platform includes an account manager, a transcoder, a control manager, a parser, storage, recall logic, and communication interfaces.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The subject matter of embodiments of the present invention is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements. But the description itself is not intended to necessarily limit the scope of claims. Rather, the claimed subject matter might be embodied in other ways to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Terms should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of individual steps is explicitly described.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the invention provide a messaging alert platform that allows senders to track delivery of a recallable message on multiple communication paths. The messaging platform provides the senders with notifications when recallable messages transmitted by the senders are delayed during transmission to an intended recipient or not delivered to the intended recipient. The senders are able to configure the message alert platform with message handling options that specify alternate communication paths, alternate communication formats, or alternate accounts for delivery of the recallable messages. The alternate accounts include short messaging service accounts, multimedia message service accounts, instant messaging accounts, and social networking accounts. The message handling options include various forms of electronic messaging and social networking accounts. When an alternate communication path, alternate communication format, or alternate account is selected and the messaging alert platform retries delivery of the recallable message, the original recallable message is recalled. Because senders have grown accustomed to near instant communication, delivery delays of the recallable message to the intended recipient are not tolerated. Accordingly, embodiments of the invention allow senders to specify a reply period that indicates a maximum length of time that may transpire before the sender expects to receive a reply.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It should be understood that this and other arrangements described herein are set forth only as examples. Other arrangements and elements (e.g., machines, interfaces, functions, orders, and groupings of functions, etc.) can be used in addition to, or instead of those shown, and some elements may be omitted altogether. Further, many of the elements described herein are functional entities that may be implemented as discrete or distributed components or in conjunction with other components, and in any suitable combination and location. Various functions described herein as being performed by one or more entities may be carried out by hardware, firmware, and/or software. For instance, various functions may be carried out by a processor executing instructions stored in memory.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Throughout this description, several acronyms and shorthand notations are used to aid the understanding of certain concepts pertaining to the associated system and services. These acronyms and shorthand notations are intended for the purpose of providing an easy methodology of communicating the ideas expressed herein and are not meant to limit the scope of the embodiments of the invention.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to the drawings generally, and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> in particular, an exemplary communication device <b>115</b> for practicing embodiments of the invention is provided. It will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the communication device <b>115</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is merely an example of one suitable communication device <b>115</b> and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the present invention. Neither should the communication device <b>115</b> be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement related to any single component or combination of components illustrated therein. The single unit depictions are meant for clarity, not to limit the scope of embodiments in any form.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a component diagram of an exemplary messaging alert platform <b>200</b> in accordance with embodiments of the invention. MAP <b>200</b> includes an account manager <b>210</b>, control manager <b>220</b>, parser <b>230</b>, recall component <b>240</b>, communication interfaces <b>250</b>, storage <b>260</b>, and transcoder <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">MAP <b>200</b> allows users to subscribe via the account manager <b>210</b>. The account manager <b>210</b> is configured to establish and manage user accounts associated with service providers. In this regard, the account manager <b>210</b> may obtain account data associated with pre-existing user accounts established with the service providers. Account data refers to data associated with a user account (i.e., an account established for a user that uses a service) established with a service provider. For example, assume the user has accounts with the social networking service provider <b>114</b>, the email service provider <b>112</b>, and the voice service provider <b>120</b>. In this instance, the account manager <b>210</b> may be used to receive, retrieve, access, identify, or reference account data for each of the user accounts associated with such service providers. In some embodiments, the user identifies MAP <b>200</b> as a trusted service that shares personal information across several of the user's accounts. Account data may include, for example, a user identifier that identifies an account user (e.g., a user name), a user device identifier that identifies a device associated with an account user (e.g., an IP address, a mobile device number, etc.), a password for an account, an account identifier that identifies a particular account or service provider thereof, and/or the like. Such account data might be input by a user, for example, via the communication device. Alternatively, account data might be provided via the service provider or identified by the account manger <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, a database may be used to store user account data in storage <b>260</b>. For instance, the data store may store an indication of a user account and account data (e.g., user identifier and password) associated therewith in connection with a particular user. The data store may store account data for any number of users. As discussed more fully below, such account data can be referenced and, thereafter, used to obtain and/or recall messages associated with a corresponding user account.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, the account manger <b>210</b> allows the user to establish an account with MAP <b>200</b> and link other communication accounts to MAP. The other communication accounts include voice accounts, email accounts, instant messaging accounts, MMS accounts, SMS accounts, social networking accounts, and the like. MAP <b>200</b> may be a trusted server that stores existing account identifiers and passwords for the communication accounts. Optionally, MAP <b>200</b> may provide users the option to establish an interaction preference. The interaction preference specifies whether the users prefer interacting with MAP <b>200</b> as an agent on the communication device or as an Internet web service that is accessible from any device.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">MAP <b>200</b> allows users to identify recipients of the recallable message via the control manager <b>220</b>. Control Manager <b>220</b> allows the user to establish a contact sequence and reply period. For instance, the user may specify that urgent messages should be replied to by an intended recipient within 30 seconds. Also, the user may specify, via the control manager <b>220</b>, a number of different contact methods for the intended recipient. If the user has three contact methods for the intended recipient: phone, email, social network, and the user may specify a contact sequence for the intended recipient to be first: phone, second: social network, and third: email. Thus, if the user unsuccessfully attempts to call the phone of the intended recipient with an urgent MAP communication, MAP <b>200</b> will then forward the message to the social network contact for the user. If the user is unable to reach the intended recipient via the social network contact, MAP forwards the message to the email contact of the intended recipient. MAP <b>200</b> reports the success or failure of message delivery to the user. When MAP <b>200</b> receives an indication that the intended recipient is unavailable or nonresponsive, an alternate contact method is selected and if necessary the message is reformatted for delivery via the alternate contact method.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, control manger <b>220</b> stores contact information from each account registered with MAP <b>200</b> in a contact database. In other embodiments, users may provide MAP <b>200</b> with access to the user's contact database. The contact database may be stored on the communication device. In one embodiment, the contact database is stored at a remote location accessible by the control manager via uniform resource locator specified by the user. If required to access the contact information, the contact manager identifier and password may be stored by the control manager <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Accordingly, control manger <b>220</b> may leverage accessibility to the various accounts and automatically synch contacts with the most recent contact information stored by the various accounts. In one embodiment, the user will also be provided an option to manually synch contacts and communication methods across the various accounts and the contact database maintained by the control manager <b>220</b>. The synched contact database is utilized by the control manager <b>220</b> to enable the MAP user to specify the contact sequence for intended recipients with updated and accurate contact information.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">MAP <b>200</b> determines whether the intended recipient replied to the message via a parser <b>230</b>. Parser <b>230</b> extracts the reply from the response message received from the intended recipient. The reply may be generated via the social networking service, email service, SMS service, etc. For instance, the MAP <b>200</b> may receive an auto-reply from the intended recipient. In this case, parser <b>230</b> extracts information from the reply, which may state &#x201c;I am unavailable until May 13. Please contact Bob at xxyz@acme.corp.&#x201d; The parser <b>230</b> may recognize new contact information included in the extracted information. In some embodiments, the parser <b>230</b> extracts the new contact information and may transmit the new contact to the control manager <b>220</b>. In turn, the control manager <b>220</b> updates the contact database with the new contact.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Moreover, the control manager <b>220</b> may update the contact sequence for the intended recipient to include the new contact. In one embodiment, the user positions the new contact in the desired position within the contact sequence. In an alternate embodiment, the control manager <b>220</b> places the new contact at the last position in the contact sequence. Accordingly, the parser <b>230</b> is able to extract the response from the replies in any format that it is received.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the message transmitted to the intended recipient may be recallable if the intended recipient did not read the message. The recall component <b>240</b> is configured to manage messages transmitted by the user. For instance, the recall component <b>240</b> enables a user to manage messages generated via email service, social networking service, instant messaging service, tweet/blogging service, MAP service, SMS, MMS, Push-to-Talk, and the like. MAP <b>200</b> may recall the message when a response from the intended recipient is not received within a specified period of time, e.g., 10 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In other embodiments, MAP <b>200</b> may continue generating messages within the contact sequence and recall previous messages that were sent using a different contact method once the contact sequence is exhausted. For example, the contact sequence for an intended recipient may include SMS, email, and voicemail. MAP <b>200</b> initially attempts delivery of the message via SMS. When as SMS reply is not received within a specified time period, MAP <b>200</b> transmits the message to the intended recipient via email. Similarly, when an email reply is not received within a specified time period, MAP <b>200</b> transmits the message to the intended recipient via voice, e.g. voicemail. If the intended recipient fails to respond to all the messages within a specified time period, e.g. 90 seconds, recall component <b>240</b> recalls each message (SMS, email, and voicemail) sent to the intended recipient. The recall component <b>240</b> removes the messages from the intended recipient's message box. The recall component <b>240</b> manages messages sent via a voice service, a text message service, an email service, and a social network service. In some cases, the recall component <b>240</b> may be a part of or hosted by one of the services or a network. In other cases, the recall component <b>240</b> may operate independent from the services and may reside on a wireless device, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">MAP <b>200</b> includes communication interfaces <b>250</b> that connect to the network elements that provide the email service, social networking service, instant messaging service, tweet/blogging service, MAP service, SMS, MMS, Push-to-Talk, and the like. The communication interfaces <b>250</b> may include Ethernet or the like. The messages are transmitted over the communication interfaces <b>250</b>. In turn, the replies are received over the communication interfaces <b>250</b>. Accordingly, MAP <b>200</b> may interface with the wireless devices and services to implement a recallable message delivery system.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">MAP <b>200</b> may include storage <b>260</b>. The storage <b>260</b> may be configured to store a contact database for each user that authorized MAP <b>200</b> to store contacts for the intended recipients. In some embodiment, the storage <b>260</b> may store all contacts for the intended recipients a user may communicate with. In an alternate embodiment, the storage <b>260</b> may store only selected contacts for less than all of the intended recipients that the user communicates with. The storage <b>260</b> may also store the contact sequence specified for the intended recipients. The storage <b>260</b> may also include user-preferences. The user may specify a preference to receive responses via SMS. Further, the user may specify a reply period to be 30 seconds for an intended recipient. Alternatively, the user may specify that a default reply period is 120 seconds. These types of preferences may be stored for each user in storage <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Moreover, in some embodiments, the messages generated by the user are stored in storage <b>260</b>. By way of example, the storage <b>260</b> might store each message sent via one of the services when the user indicates the message should be recallable. For example, the storage <b>260</b> may store messages indicated as high priority, messages of a particular type (e.g., text message, voice message, email message), messages communicated via a particular service, messages sent at a particular time or within a particular time duration, or the like. In other embodiments, the storage <b>260</b> may retain only a portion of the messages, or data associated therewith, that correspond with the user.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In other embodiments, storage <b>260</b> maintains a recall log that includes a history of actions taken with respect to the stored messages. The recall log can be accessible to a user, for example, via a user interface. In this regard, a user can view message actions taken in connection with sent messages. For example, a user may view which sent messages have been recalled, view sent messages, etc. In some cases, even if a message is recalled with respect to an intended recipient, the message may not be deleted from the message recall system such that the user can view the contents of previously sent messages, or data associated therewith. A recall log may also include details regarding deletion of a message(s). For example, a recall log may include an indication of a success or failure of a recall, a date and/or time of a recall, a recipient(s) for which the recall was successful or a failure, whether a recipient(s) viewed a particular message, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In most embodiments, MAP <b>200</b> includes a transcoder <b>270</b> that reformats the message. The transcoder <b>270</b> may reformat the message for each communication method included in the contact sequence. For instance, the contact sequence may include voice service, email service, SMS, etc. The formats of the message between each contact method may be different. The user may provide a voice message initially, but when a reply to the voice message is not received, the transcoder <b>270</b> reformats the voice message and sends the textual message via the email service. The email message generated by transcoder <b>270</b> may include text that transcribes the content of the voice message. In one embodiment, the email message may include an attachment that is the voice message. Moreover, the SMS message generated by transcoder <b>270</b> includes text transcribed from the voice message. If necessary, the transcoder <b>270</b> may truncate the text as necessary to comply with the requirements for an SMS messages. In some embodiments, the user input may specify important parts of the message that should be retained by the transcoder <b>270</b> when switching between formats.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The transcoder <b>270</b> may reformat any message to a format supported by MAP <b>200</b>. For instance, the transcoder <b>270</b> may provide text to voicemail, SMS to email, social networking to voicemail, MMS to SMS, MMS to email, cropping, resizing, and the like. In some embodiments, the transcoder <b>270</b> may receive updates from existing service providers to support new formats. And the transcoder <b>270</b> may receive new formats from new service providers that are added to MAP <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Accordingly, MAP <b>200</b> generates recallable messages for the users. The recallable messages are transmitted in various formats to the intended recipients. If the recipients are unresponsive, the messages are recalled.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an architecture diagram of an exemplary communication device <b>310</b> connected to a messaging alert platform <b>340</b> in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The communication device <b>310</b> may connect to MAP <b>340</b> via a BSC <b>320</b> or router <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment, the communication device <b>310</b> includes social network application <b>311</b>, SMS application <b>312</b>, MMS application <b>313</b>, email application <b>314</b>, blog application <b>315</b>, and push-to-talk application <b>316</b>. These applications <b>311</b>-<b>316</b> allow the user to generate various types of messages for transmission to one or more intended recipients. The social network application <b>312</b> allows the user to generate messages on a social networking site. The message may include board messages, instant messages, or email message. The MMS application <b>313</b> allows the user to generate multimedia messages that include video, images, etc. The email application <b>314</b> allows the user to generate email messages. The blog application <b>315</b> allows the user to provide blog messages. The push-to-talk application <b>316</b>, allows the user to send voice messages.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the communication device <b>310</b> may also include a listener <b>317</b>, a renderer <b>318</b>, and MAP agent <b>319</b>. The listener <b>317</b> may intercept communications from the applications <b>311</b>-<b>316</b>. The renderer <b>318</b> may generate appropriate graphical user interfaces that allow the user to provide information regarding communication preferences. Also, the renderer <b>318</b> may provide an interface for generating messages or viewing replies, recall logs, etc. The MAP agent <b>319</b> allows the communication device to interface with the MAP <b>340</b> via bidirectional communication.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The listener <b>317</b> may determine whether the user has initiated one of the applications <b>311</b>-<b>316</b> to generate a message. For instance, if the user initiates an email application <b>314</b>, the listener <b>317</b> may intercept the request and trigger the renderer <b>318</b> to display a graphical user interface that inquires whether the user wishes to transmit the message via MAP <b>340</b>. If the user opts to deliver the email message via MAP, the user may compose the email message via an interface provided by the email application <b>314</b>. In turn, the MAP agent obtains the message from the email application <b>314</b> and communicates the message to the intended recipient via the MAP <b>340</b>. The response may be received at MAP <b>340</b>, which determines whether the response should be transmitted to the communication device <b>310</b>. If the response is an actual reply from the intended recipient, MAP <b>340</b> formats the reply in accordance with the preferences stored for the user and communicates the formatted reply to the communication device. The reply may be displayed via renderer <b>318</b> or email application <b>314</b> in accordance with the preferences selected by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the user may select the MAP agent <b>319</b> as the communication agent for all communication sent or received from the communication device. Alternatively, the user may specify certain communication formats for the MAP agent <b>319</b>. For instance, the user may indicate that only voice and SMS communication messages should be MAP communications that are transmitted via MAP <b>340</b>. Further, the user may specify that the graphical user interface presented to the user for all MAP communications should be provided by renderer <b>318</b>. Or the user may select to utilize the applications' graphical user interface to generate messages and view replies. As an example, the user may specify that MMS and social networking messages and replies should utilize the interface for MMS application <b>313</b> and social networking application <b>311</b> when generating the MAP messages and receiving the MAP replies.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Accordingly, the user of the communication device <b>310</b> may utilize the device in two modes: normal or MAP. In normal mode, the communications are routed to the intended recipients without consideration of the user preferences for delivery format, graphical user interface preferences, etc. In MAP mode, the preferences established by the user are consulted to determine whether a MAP communication is desired. If so, the appropriate graphical user interfaces are presented to generate a recallable message in the contact sequence established for the intended recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">MAP provides various graphical user interfaces to determine whether the user wishes to generate a normal message or a MAP message. If the user opts to select a MAP message, the preferences established by the user are considered when generating the response, contact sequence, and communicating the reply. Further, the MAP messages are recallable in the event that the intended recipient fails to respond within a specified period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate several exemplary graphical user interfaces. These graphical user interfaces are generated and displayed on the communication devices that generated the messages.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is an illustration of an exemplary graphical user interface <b>410</b> that allows a sender to initiate delivery of recallable messages on available communication paths to a recipient in accordance with embodiments of the invention.

The graphical user interface provides a &#x201c;YES&#x201d; button and a &#x201c;NO&#x201d; button. The user may select the &#x201c;YES&#x201d; button if the user intends to generate recallable messages via MAP. The user may select the &#x201c;NO&#x201d; button if the user intends to generate a normal message. The graphical user interface <b>410</b> may be generated by the renderer on the communication device when the user opens the MAP agent to initiate a MAP communication.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, a graphical user interface that inquiry about the message preference format for a current communication may be presented to the user. The format may include any format supported by the MAP. In turn, the user may select the desired message format for transmitting the message.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is another illustration of an exemplary graphical user interface <b>420</b> that allows a sender to format recallable messages in accordance with embodiments of the invention.

The social network format <b>425</b> allows the user to contact the intended recipient via a recallable social network wall post, instant message, or email. The blog format <b>426</b> allows the user to contact the intended recipient via a recallable blog post. The MAP format <b>427</b> allows the user to contact the intended recipient via a recallable MAP message. The MAP message is delivered via MAP.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In yet another embodiment, a graphical user interface that inquiries about the message preference format for a reply may be presented to the user. The format may include any format supported by the MAP. In turn, the user may select the desired message format for receiving the reply message. The user may also be provided with a graphical user interface for specifying a reply period. Additionally, an intercept graphical user interface may be provided when the listener on the communication device intercepts a normal communication.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is another illustration of an exemplary graphical user interface <b>510</b> that allows a sender to specify response formats in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The formats displayed on the graphical user interface <b>510</b> are the formats supported by MAP. As MAP is updated to support additional formats, the renderer is updated to create new graphical user interfaces <b>510</b> that include the additional formats. In one embodiment, the graphical user interface <b>510</b> may provide selection for the following formats: email <b>511</b>, push-to-talk <b>512</b>, SMS <b>513</b>, voice call <b>514</b>, social network <b>515</b>, blog <b>516</b>, and MAP <b>517</b>. The email format <b>511</b> allows the user to receive the response from the intended recipient via email. The push-to-talk format <b>512</b> allows the user to receive the response from the intended recipient via push-to-talk. The SMS format <b>513</b> allows the user to receive the response from the intended recipient via SMS. The voice call format <b>514</b> allows the user to receive the response from the intended recipient via a voicemail or voice call.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is another illustration of an exemplary graphical user interface <b>520</b> that allows a sender to specify response time periods in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The user may specify a response from the intended recipient should be received within a selected reply period. The reply period includes the time it takes to generate and transmit formatted message via the contact methods included in the contact sequence for the intended recipient. The reply period may be 30 seconds <b>521</b>, 90 seconds <b>522</b>, 30 minutes <b>523</b>, 60 minutes <b>524</b>, or other <b>525</b>, which is a user generated reply period.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> is another illustration of an exemplary graphical user interface <b>530</b> that allows a sender to specify whether all communications should be routed through a messaging alert platform in accordance with embodiments of the invention.

The graphical user interface includes a checkbox <b>531</b> that allows the user to inform the listener that all communication on the device should be routed via MAP.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A computer storage media may store instructions to execute a method for routing recallable message. In some embodiment, the computer storage media may be a component of MAP. MAP receives a request to transmit a recallable message to an intended recipient. In turn, delivery is attempted in accordance with the contact sequence for the intended recipient and the reply period for the user. Based on whether a response is received from the intended recipient, an alternate communication mode is used to contact the recipient and the prior message sent via the previous communication mode is recalled.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart that provides an exemplary method for routing recallable messages in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In step <b>610</b>, MAP may receive a request to transmit a recallable message to the intended recipient. In some embodiments, the request may specify a response time period. MAP attempts delivery of the message on a communication path available for the intended recipient, in step <b>620</b>. The available communication paths include any one of the following: electronic mail, social networking, instant messaging, blogs, tweets, and message alert platform messages, short message services, multimedia messaging services, and push-to-talk.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In step <b>630</b>, MAP receives a response from the device of the intended recipient. The response is checked to verify that it was read by the intended recipient, in step <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If the response was not from the intended recipient, the method returns to step <b>620</b> and the next available communication path specified in the contact sequence for the intended recipient is attempted. In some embodiments, the contact sequence or delivery chain for the intended recipient may be specified by the sender or intended recipient. The contact sequence is used by MAP to select the next available communication path. In certain embodiments, MAP may generate a notification to inform the sender of the current communication path where delivery is being attempted.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">If the response was from the intended recipient, in step <b>650</b>, MAP transmits the response to the sender. In turn, if messages were sent via nonresponsive paths, those messages may be recalled by MAP, in step <b>660</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In an optional embodiment, a method to deliver recallable messages to a recipient is executed by MAP. MAP may send a recallable message from a sender to a recipient. The recallable message may include an importance level. In turn, MAP waits for a response from the recipient within a period of time. If no reply is received or an auto-reply is generated, MAP attempts delivery of the message on alternate communication paths associated with the recipient. In one embodiment, the communication paths comprise telephony communication services and Internet communication services. In another embodiment, the period of time that MAP waits is the same for each communication path. Alternatively, the period time that MAP waits for each path is proportional to the ratio of the total time set by the sender and the number of available paths for the recipient. In turn, MAP may reformat the message based on the message limitations associated with the selected communication path. If a reply that is not an auto-reply is received, MAP transmits the reply to the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In one embodiment, the user halts a contact sequence. For instance, a user may send an SMS message to an intended recipient. In turn, while MAP is attempting the various communication paths, the intended recipient may contact the user via a communication path not known (new email, phone, etc, neighbor's phone) to the user. Because the user was able to successfully communicate with the intended recipient, the user may stop the MAP from completing the contact sequence. In some embodiments, MAP may display a graphical user interface to allow the user to select which of the transmitted messages to recall.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Users expect messages to be delivered in real-time and have a lower tolerance for delays. Because of these expectations, users maintain multiple paths in which they communicate with each other. Often these communications via the multiple paths occur simultaneously. MAP provides a system for allowing the user to coordinate communication among these multiple communication methods.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">For instance, a user may send an SMS to a friend for assistance with a car that has broken down. In this instance, the user may request that the friend pick them up at a specific location. If the message is delayed, or if their friend is not available, the sender will typically not receive any feedback that this occurred. This could leave them in a situation where they wait an unnecessary amount of time before determining an alternate course of action.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">MAP provides the necessary notification to the user of delivery success. MAP provides a system to generate recallable messages via the multiple communication paths known for the friend. The user's communication device may be configured to generate a recallable message in response to a request by the user to format one or more messages as recallable messages. In turn, MAP which is communicatively coupled to the communication device receives a request to transmit a recallable message from the communication device. MAP notifies the user of delivery failures and successes. MAP attempts delivery of the recallable message on a first communication path of the multiple communication paths available for the friend. MAP may retry delivery of the recallable message on subsequent communication paths as specified in a contact sequence associated with the request or the friend. MAP may provide the user with a summary of the contact sequence for the friend and the current status of the delivery attempt. For instance, MAP may inform the user that an email and SMS message were sent, the times that those messages were sent, the wait period associated with those messages, whether those messages are recalled, the type of reply received, a summary of the reply, and the current format of the delivery attempt. MAP may filter responses received from the friend before transmitting the response to the user. Moreover, MAP may recall the recallable messages delivered to nonresponsive communication paths for the friend.</p>
