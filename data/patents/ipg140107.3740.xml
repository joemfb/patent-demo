<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Hereinafter, one or more embodiments of the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Like reference numerals denote like elements in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In general, an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display emits light by electrically exciting fluorescent organic compounds and displays an image by voltage driving or current driving of a plurality of OLEDs arranged in the form of matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating the layers of an OLED.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the OLED includes an anode layer (e.g., indium tin oxide (ITO)), an organic thin film, and a cathode layer (e.g., metal). The organic thin film includes an emission layer (EML), an electron transport layer (ETL), and a hole transport layer (HTL) in order to balance electrons and holes so as to improve luminescent efficiency. In addition, the organic thin film may further include a hole injecting layer (HIL) or an electron-injecting layer (EIL).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram of a pixel circuit formed of P-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (PMOS) transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a switching transistor M<b>2</b> is turned on by a selection signal from a scan line Sn, a data voltage from a data line DM is transmitted to a gate of a driving transistor M<b>1</b> due to the turn-on of the switching transistor M<b>2</b>, and a potential difference between the data voltage and a VDD voltage of a voltage source is stored in a capacitor C<b>1</b> connected between a gate and a source of the driving transistor M<b>1</b>. Driving current I<sub>OLED </sub>flows through the OLED due to the potential difference between the data voltage and the VDD voltage, and the OLED emits light. Here, according to the applied data voltage, a corresponding contrast and gradation may be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, driving transistors M<b>1</b> of a plurality of pixel circuits may each have a different threshold voltage. If the threshold voltages of the driving transistors M<b>1</b> are different, current outputs from the driving transistors M<b>1</b> differ, and thus a uniform image may not be displayed. The threshold voltage differences among the driving transistors M<b>1</b> may increase as a size of an OLED display increases, thereby causing quality deterioration of the image displayed by the OLED display. Accordingly, in order to have a uniform image, a pixel circuit of the OLED display may compensate for the threshold voltage of a driving transistor in the pixel circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">There are various application circuits for compensating for the threshold voltage of the driving transistor in the pixel circuit. In most cases, initiation and compensation for the threshold voltage of the transistor may be performed at the same time in a regular period of time. In this case, undesired light may be emitted during initialization, and thus a contrast ratio (C/R) of the displayed image may be lowered. Also, as a size of the OLED display increases, a load during the initialization time increases. Thus, when initialization and compensation for the threshold voltage of the driving transistor are performed at the same time, the time needed for initialization may be relatively reduced. Thus, a pixel circuit for driving by separately performing the initialization time and the compensation for the threshold voltage is required.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of an OLED display <b>300</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the OLED display <b>300</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention includes a display unit <b>310</b>, a first scan driving unit <b>302</b>, a second scan driving unit <b>304</b>, a data driving unit <b>306</b>, and a power driving unit <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The display unit <b>310</b> includes n&#xd7;m pixel circuits P (where n and m are positive integers) each including an OLED, n scan lines S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, . . . , and Sn which extend in a row direction and transmit scan signals, m data lines D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, . . . , and Dm which extend in a column direction and transmit data signals, n light emitting control lines E<b>2</b>, E<b>3</b>, . . . , and En+1 which extend in the row direction and transmit light emitting control signals, m first and second power lines (not illustrated) for transmitting power.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The display unit <b>310</b> displays an image by emitting light using the OLEDs according to scan signals, data signals, light emitting control signals, a first power ELVDD, and a second power ELVSS.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first scan driving unit <b>302</b> is connected to the light emitting control lines E<b>2</b>, E<b>3</b>, . . . , and En+1 and applies the light emitting control signals to the display unit <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The second scan driving unit <b>304</b> is connected to the scan lines S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, . . . , and Sn and applies the scan signals to the display unit <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The data driving unit <b>306</b> is connected to the data lines D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, . . . , and Dm and applies the data signals to the display unit <b>310</b>.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The power driving unit <b>308</b> applies voltages including the first power ELVDD and the second power ELVSS to each of the pixel circuits P.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit diagram of a pixel circuit P employed in the OLED display <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For the convenience of description, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the pixel circuit P to which an m<sup>th </sup>data line Dm, (n&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>and n<sup>th </sup>scan lines Sn&#x2212;1 and Sn, and n<sup>th </sup>and (n+1)<sup>th </sup>light emitting control lines En and En+1 are connected.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pixel circuit P according to the current embodiment of the present invention includes first through sixth N-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) transistors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, M<b>4</b>, M<b>5</b>, and M<b>6</b> connected, directly or indirectly, to an OLED, the data line Dm, the scan lines Sn and Sn&#x2212;1, and the light emitting control lines En and En+1 for controlling current supplied to the OLED, and a storage capacitor C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An anode electrode of the OLED is connected to the first NMOS transistor M<b>1</b>, which is a driving transistor, and a cathode electrode of the OLED is connected to the second power ELVSS. Here, the voltage of the second power ELVSS may be set to be significantly lower than that of the first power ELVDD, and the second power ELVSS may be set to a ground voltage GND. The OLED emits light having a brightness (e.g., a predetermined brightness) in correspondence to a current supplied from the transistor M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An NMOS transistor included in the pixel circuit P includes a first electrode, a second electrode, and a gate electrode, and is turned off when the control signal is low and is turned on when the control signal is high.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The NMOS transistor has a higher operating speed than that of a PMOS transistor and thus may be used in manufacturing a large-sized display. That is, electron mobility is higher than hole mobility, and the NMOS transistor uses an electron as a carrier so that the response speed of the NMOS transistor to a driving signal is faster than that of the PMOS transistor, which uses a hole as a carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, an amorphous-silicon (Si) transistor process may be realized with a lower cost than that of a Poly-Si process. Also, the temperature in the amorphous-Si transistor process is higher than the temperature in the Poly-Si process so that a manufacturing process using amorphous-Si is more advantageous than that of using Poly-Si. However, according to a characteristic of the amorphous-Si transistor, the pixel circuit P may be realized only by NMOS transistors. Also, according to a characteristic of the oxide TFT, a pixel may be realized only by an oxide thin film transistor (TFT).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The fourth NMOS transistor M<b>4</b> is connected to the data line Dm and n<sup>th </sup>scan line Sn and applies a data signal to a node A when a scan signal is applied from the n<sup>th </sup>scan line Sn.</p>

The second electrode of the first NMOS transistor M<b>1</b>, which is a source electrode, is connected to the anode electrode of the OLED. The first NMOS transistor M<b>1</b> supplies current, which corresponds to a voltage applied to the node B, to the second power ELVSS from the first power ELVDD through the OLED.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The second NMOS transistor M<b>2</b> is connected between the node B and the first electrode of the first NMOS transistor M<b>1</b> (a node C) and diode-connects the first NMOS transistor M<b>1</b> when the scan signal is applied from the n<sup>th </sup>scan line Sn. Here, diode-connect denotes that a gate electrode and a source electrode of a transistor or a gate electrode and a drain electrode of a transistor are connected to each other so that the transistor operates as a diode.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The third NMOS transistor M<b>3</b> is connected between the first power ELVDD and the first electrode of the first NMOS transistor M<b>1</b> (the node C) and is turned on when a light emitting control signal is applied from the n<sup>th </sup>light emitting control line En.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a first period (a) is an initialization period and is where the (n&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>scan line Sn&#x2212;1 and the (n+1)<sup>th </sup>light emitting control line En+1 are applied with logic high signals.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The driving of the pixel circuit P according to each period of the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates driving of the pixel circuit P during the initialization period, which is the first period (a).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates that the threshold voltage of the driving transistor is compensated for and the data signal is applied in the second period (b).</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The pixel circuit in the first period (a) has the connection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The (n&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>scan line Sn&#x2212;1 and the (n+1)<sup>th </sup>light emitting control line En+1 are applied with logic high signals in the first period (a) as shown in the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Accordingly, the fifth NMOS transistor M<b>5</b> is turned on, and thus the reference voltage Vref is applied to the node A. In addition, the sixth NMOS transistor M<b>6</b> is turned on, and a voltage of the first power ELVDD is applied to the node B. Accordingly, the storage capacitor C<b>1</b> connected between the node A and the node B is initialized.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The pixel circuit in the second period (b) has the connection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Only the n<sup>th </sup>scan line Sn is applied with a logic high signal in the second period (b) as shown in the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Accordingly, the fourth NMOS transistor M<b>4</b> and the second NMOS transistor M<b>2</b> are turned on. The fourth NMOS transistor M<b>4</b> is turned on, and thus a data voltage is applied to the node A. Also, the second NMOS transistor M<b>2</b> is turned on, and thus the first NMOS transistor M<b>1</b>, which is the driving transistor, is diode-connected. Accordingly, the node B has a voltage corresponding to the threshold voltage of the driving transistor and the threshold voltage of the OLED. Thus, an electric charge based on a voltage corresponding to the deviation of the voltage of the node B and the data voltage applied to the node A is charged to the terminals of the storage capacitor C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The pixel circuit P in the third period (c) has the connection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Only the n<sup>th </sup>light emitting control line En is applied with a logic high signal in the third period (c) as shown in the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Accordingly, only the third NMOS transistor M<b>3</b> is turned on, and a voltage of the first power ELVDD is applied to the first electrode of the first NMOS transistor M<b>1</b>, which is the node C.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The pixel circuit in the fourth period (d) has the connection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to Equation 4, the driving current I<sub>oled </sub>flowing through the OLED is determined by the reference voltage Vref and the data voltage Vdata. That is, the current flows through the OLED regardless of the threshold voltage Vth of the first NMOS transistor M<b>1</b>, which is the driving transistor, the threshold voltage Vto of the OLED, and the voltage of the second power ELVSS.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Thus, the pixel circuit according to the current embodiment of the present invention compensates for the threshold voltage of the driving transistor and is not sensitive to voltage deviations of the first power and the second power, thereby achieving uniform brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Unlike a pixel circuit in which initialization and compensation for the threshold voltage of the driving transistor are performed in a first period, in an embodiment of the present invention, initialization is performed in the first period, and the threshold voltage of the driving transistor is compensated for in the second period. Accordingly, problems in that initialization is not completely performed in some parts of the pixel circuits due to a large-sized panel and a high load due to fast operation may be resolved. As such, in order to separate an initialization period of the storage capacitor from the period of compensating for the threshold voltage of the driving transistor, a light emitting control signal and the sixth NMOS transistor M<b>6</b> are further added in one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, the sixth NMOS transistor M<b>6</b> is used to separate the initialization time, and thus a contrast ratio (C/R) may be improved in one embodiment of the present invention. In the related art, current flows through the OLED during the initialization period; however, a transistor is further added to perform initialization in the embodiment of the present invention. Accordingly, current does not flow through the OLED during the initialization period, and thus the OLED does not emit light, thereby improving the C/R.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the embodiment of the present invention, a light emitting control driver for transmitting a light emitting control signal is included so that duty control is available and motion blur may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, cross-talk is reduced in the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a graph showing a simulation result of the pixel circuit P, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a change of driving current I<sub>oled </sub>flowing through the OLED according to the data voltage Vdata may be identified. Referring to Equation 4, the driving current I<sub>oled </sub>flowing through the OLED is changed according to the data voltage Vdata in the pixel circuit according to the current embodiment, and the result is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a circuit diagram of a pixel circuit employed in the OLED display <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Elements in the pixel circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> that correspond to the elements in the pixel circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are the same or perform similar functions. Thus, a detailed description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Also, the pixel circuit according to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is different from the pixel circuit described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> in that the fifth NMOS transistor M<b>5</b> is connected to the first power ELVDD, instead of to the reference voltage Vref. The driving methods are the same or similar with those described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and thus a detailed description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the driving current I<sub>oled </sub>flowing through the OLED included in the pixel circuit is determined by the voltage of the first power ELVDD and the data voltage Vdata, as represented in Equation 5.</p>
