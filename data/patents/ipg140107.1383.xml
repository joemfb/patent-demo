<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This non-provisional patent application claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 61/418,441 filed on Dec. 1, 2010, titled Lighted Glove.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to lighted gloves and, more particularly, to a glove having lights integrated therein that may be worn by police, airline personnel, stadium parking and traffic control staff, or others that need to direct traffic flow in dim light conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Law enforcement officers or other traffic control staff frequently direct traffic around a traffic accident scene, emergency detours, into or out of special event parking arrangements, direction of airplanes near airport terminals and taxiways, or other environments where traditional stop signs or stop lights are not feasible or do not provide adequate control in a heavy traffic situation. In low light situations, such as at dusk or after sunset, traffic control personnel may hold a flashlight or a lighted wand so that drivers can more easily see and discern when to go, stop, or what direction they are being encouraged to follow.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although flashlights and lighted wands may be generally effective for their intended purposes, it is inconvenient and possibly tiring to the traffic control officer to grasp the flashlight for long periods of time. The existing devices present only a single color and may, as a result, not provide an immediate indication to a driver as to the action intended by the officer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it would be desirable to have a glove wearable by a traffic control officer that includes multiple light modules positioned on the palm and finger sections so as to provide an easily viewable light source to drivers and eliminate the need for holding a traditional flashlight. Further, it would be desirable to have a glove that may be toggled between lights having different colors so as to immediately indicate a desired action to a driver. In addition, it would be desirable to have a lighted glove that substantially covers an entire hand of the traffic control officer for stability, protection, and effectiveness.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A lighted glove according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a glove member configured to substantially cover an entirety of a wearer's hand and having finger and thumb sections. A plurality of light modules is positioned in a spaced apart arrangement on a palm section and on interior surface of the finger and thumb sections. Each light module preferably includes multiple LED's having different colors. The light modules are electrically connected to a battery. Different color LED's may be selected using a toggle switch.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, a general object of this invention is to provide a lighted glove having multiple light emitting diodes for use in directing vehicle traffic in low ambient light conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of this invention is to provide a lighted glove, as aforesaid, in which each lighting module may include LED's of multiple colors that may be selectively toggled by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still another object of this invention is to provide a lighted glove, as aforesaid, on which the light modules are positioned on the palm and fingers such that the glove may be used in the manner of a stop sign or stop light, as directed by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another object of this invention is to provide a lighted glove, as aforesaid, that substantially covers a user's entire hand and fingers so as to keep the position of the lights stable for effective traffic control.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further object of this invention is to provide a lighted glove, as aforesaid, that is easy to use and cost-effective to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein is set forth by way of illustration and example, embodiments of this invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A lighted glove according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> of the accompanying drawings. The lighted glove <b>10</b> includes a glove member <b>20</b>, a plurality of light modules <b>40</b>, a toggle switch <b>52</b>, and an activation button <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The glove member <b>20</b> includes a palm section <b>22</b> integrally connected to a back section <b>24</b> so as to define an open end <b>26</b>. Finger sections <b>28</b> including a thumb section <b>30</b> extend from the palm section <b>22</b> and back section <b>24</b> in a traditional construction so that the glove member <b>20</b> may be worn on a user's hand. Preferably, the glove member <b>20</b> provides substantially full coverage of a user's hands and fingers for protection from weather elements or other harsh conditions. The full coverage design also maintains the light modules <b>40</b> (described below) in preferred positions. The glove member <b>20</b> may be constructed of a durable but flexible material such as a spandex material that is characterized by its stretchy elastic characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A plurality of light modules <b>40</b> are mounted on the palm section <b>22</b> and interior surfaces of the finger sections <b>28</b> and thumb section <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The light modules <b>40</b> are spaced apart from one another. Preferably, each of the light modules <b>40</b> includes three light emitting diodes (LED's) although more or fewer LED's would also work. Each of the LED's in a light module <b>40</b> presents a different color when activated with current. The light modules <b>40</b> are electrically connected to a battery <b>42</b> and selectively activated with an on/off button <b>44</b>. The on/off button <b>44</b> may be positioned adjacent the open end <b>26</b> for convenience in use although other positions may also be suitable. Each light module <b>40</b> may include red <b>46</b>, yellow <b>48</b>, and green <b>50</b> LED's so as to correspond to respective colors used in stoplights. Further, a toggle switch <b>52</b> may be positioned on the glove member <b>20</b> and electrically connected to the light modules <b>40</b> such that a user may select which color LED should be illuminated when electrically actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The glove member <b>20</b> includes one or more pockets <b>54</b> configured to contain the battery <b>42</b> and other electronic circuitry <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). It is understood that the light modules <b>40</b>, battery <b>42</b>, and control circuitry <b>56</b> may be connected by wires (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In use, a user such as a law enforcement officer or parking staff may insert his hand through the open end <b>26</b> of the glove member <b>20</b> and into the finger sections <b>28</b> and thumb section <b>30</b>. In low ambient lighting conditions, the on/off button <b>44</b> may be actuated such that electrical current is allowed to flow from the battery <b>42</b> to the plurality of light modules <b>40</b> causing the LED's to be illuminated. Depending on a particular driving action or direction the user desires to communicate to drivers of vehicles, the user may manipulate the toggle switch <b>52</b> to cause particular LED's to be illuminated. For example, the user may communicate the directive &#x201c;stop&#x201d; by setting the toggle switch <b>52</b> to the red LED <b>46</b> and then hold his gloved hand up in a manner that is indicative of a stop sign or stop light. Conversely, the green LED <b>50</b> may be activated such that the glove member <b>20</b> may indicate a &#x201c;go&#x201d; command. Similarly, the yellow LED <b>48</b> may be used to urge drivers to drive slowly.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, the lighted glove <b>10</b> may be used to direct traffic more effectively than in the past and in a manner that is more convenient and less tiresome to the traffic officer.</p>
