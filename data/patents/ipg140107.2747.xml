<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a nucleic acid, a gene delivery polymer, and at least one adjunctive chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of mammalian cancer or hyperproliferative disorders. This invention also relates to methods of treating mammalian cancer or hyperproliferative disorders, said method comprising contacting cancer cells or any other hyperproliferative cells with said compositions by intratumoral, intraperitoneal or systemic injection.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cancer is the most common cause of death in many parts of the world and over 2.5 million cases of cancer are diagnosed globally every year. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of cancer have shown that cancer is a genetic disease resulting in the abnormal proliferation of the affected cell. Therefore, cancer therapists are now focusing on therapeutic strategies that involve macromolecules carrying genetic information, rather than a therapeutic protein itself, allowing for the exogenously delivered genes to be expressed in the tumor environment. Gene therapy is believed to offer therapeutic benefits to cancer patients in a number of ways that are not possible with conventional approaches. Traditional small molecule drugs usually function by non-specific interaction with the cellular targets, produce undesirable side effects and do not treat the root cause of the disease. Protein drugs which have been introduced over the last several years have their own limitations due to their rapid degradation and high doses that are required which often leads to undesirable side effects. Gene therapy uses the body's own cellular machinery to produce sustained therapeutic levels of proteins in specific tissues and cells after a single injection, thus providing a safe and effective method of treatment with better patient compliance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The most commonly applied cancer gene therapy strategies include immunotherapy, cell ablation and anti-angiogensis accomplished by 1) local, 2) loco-regional, or 3) systemic injection. Cancer immunotherapy is a potent approach to combat cancer by stimulating the immune system against the cancer cells. Immunocytokines play an important role in the development of the host immune response by activation, maturation and differentiation of the immune cells. Several cytokines have been tested against a variety of cancers in human and in animal models of cancers. See <i>Hum Gene Ther., </i>1998, vol. 9, 2223; <i>Gene Ther. </i>1999, vol. 6, 833; <i>Cancer Gene Ther. </i>2000, vol. 7, 1156; <i>J. Control Rel. </i>2003, vol. 87, 177; and <i>Cancer Res., </i>2002, vol. 62, 4023. Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is an immunostimulatory cytokine that shows great promise in the treatment of human cancer. See <i>The Oncologist, </i>1996, vol. 1, 88. IL-12 is a 70-kD heterodimer consisting of two covalently linked chains, p35 and p40. The biological effects of IL-12 include the induction of IFN-&#x3b3; production both by resting and activated CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. IL-12 also enhances the proliferation of activated T and NK cells, increases the lytic activity of NK/lymphokine-activated killer cells, and facilitates specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In animal models, recombinant IL-12 has been demonstrated to induce profound T-cell mediated antitumor effects causing regression of established tumors, followed by systemic immune memory. See <i>The Oncologist, </i>1996, vol. 1, 88. However, systemic administration of recombinant IL-12 has resulted in dose limiting toxicity in several experimental trials and in an initial human trial. See <i>Lab Invest., </i>1994, vol. 71, 862; <i>Science, </i>1995, vol. 270, 908; <i>J. Interferon Cytokine Res., </i>1995, vol. 14, 335. Dose limiting toxicity was also observed with intraperitoneal administration of recombinant IL-12 in a recent human clinical trial. <i>Clin. Cancer Res., </i>2002, vol. 8, 3686. A gene delivery approach that can provide therapeutic levels of IL-12 locally at the tumor site would have the advantage of generating an anticancer response without causing systemic toxicity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Both viral and non-viral gene delivery systems have been used for IL-12 gene delivery in animal models of cancer. The viral approach has serious practical limitations due to toxicity concerns mainly because of an increased incidence of cancer and a strong immune reaction to viral antigens by the host system. There is considerable interest in the development of non-viral gene delivery systems due to their lesser toxicity. Using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a non-viral gene delivery system, for the delivery of IL-12 to treat renal carcinoma (Renca) and colon cell carcinoma (CT26) has been demonstrated. See <i>Gene Ther., </i>1999, vol. 6, 833. When tumors were subjected to this gene therapy, they displayed all the characteristics of IL-12 protein therapy, e.g., an increased infiltration of NK cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, coupled with an increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. IL-12 gene delivery was well tolerated and highly effective against both Renca and CT26 tumor bearing animals. Tumor rejecting mice were also protected from a subsequent rechallenge, suggesting the presence of a long lasting systemic immunity. A functionalized and less toxic water soluble lipopolymer (WSLP) has been tested for delivery of the IL-12 gene to CT26 colon carcinoma tumors. See Mahato et al, <i>Mol. Ther., </i>2001, vol. 4, 130. IL-12 plasmid (pIL-12) and WSLP (pIL-12/WSLP) treatment gave higher levels of intratumoral gene expression than naked DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, secondary effects of the cytokine IL-12 production, namely IFN-&#x3b3; and nitric oxide (NO) levels were also higher in WSLP treated tumors when compared with naked DNA. A single injection of pIL-12/WSLP complexes produced suboptimal effects on tumor growth and animal survival, while repeated delivery yielded better efficacy which indicates insufficient delivery by the system. <i>J. Control Release </i>2003, vol. 87, 177. Similarly, intratumoral injection of IL-12 plasmid in another polymeric carrier, PAGA, produced only partial inhibition of CT26 tumors. See <i>Gene Ther., </i>2002, vol. 9, 1075. These results warrant the need for more efficient delivery systems. Despite their insufficiencies in earlier preclinical trials, the excellent molecular flexibility of polymeric gene carriers allows for complex modification and novel functionalization imperative for the development of more efficient gene delivery systems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is widely recognized that employing a single treatment strategy against cancer is generally ineffective due to the multi-factorial nature of this disease. The combination of more than one drug to maximize the anticancer response is being increasingly utilized. See <i>Gene Ther., </i>2000, vol. 11, 1852. It has been demonstrated that there is a synergistic relationship between IL-12 gene therapy and IFN-&#x3b1; gene therapy. Co-treatment of Renca tumors with these two genes led to 100% tumor rejection which was higher than that achieved by treatments with either IL-12 (58%) or IFN-&#x3b1; (25%) alone. Similarly, CT26 tumors showed a 50% rejection rate with combination gene therapy which was higher than the 17% and 0% rejection rate achieved from single treatments of IL-12 and IFN-&#x3b1;, respectively. Tumors treated by combination therapy showed increased tumor-infiltration of NK and CD8 T cells when compared to tumors treated by single gene therapy. Gene transfer of methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) into stem cells alongside with chemotherapy protected normal cells from chemotherapy and reduced chemotherapy systemic toxicity. <i>Nature Reviews Cancer </i>2004, vol. 4, 296.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, combination gene therapy increased the number of CD40 molecules on antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the tumors to levels higher than was achieved with single treatments. Increased upregulation of CD40 on APCs is associated with higher activation status for antigen presentation. See <i>Nature, </i>1998, vol. 393, 480; <i>Nature, </i>1998, vol. 393, 474; and <i>Nature, </i>1998, vol. 393, 478. A similar increase was observed in the levels of mRNA for the chemokines IP-10 and TCA-3. Combination gene therapy therefore synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor immunity and this effect was found to be long lasting in tumor rechallenge studies. Similar combination gene therapy studies have been reported by other groups. See <i>Laryngoscope </i>2001, vol. 111, 815. Established tumors were treated with pIFN-&#x3b1;/PVP, pIL-2/lipid, or pIL-12/PVP alone or a combination thereof. The pIFN-&#x3b1;/PVP combination compared with the other two therapies significantly increased the antitumor effects when compared with single treatments. In another study utilizing the same tumor model, it has been demonstrated that combined treatment with pIL-12/PVP and pIL-2/lipid gave significantly higher anti-tumor effects when compared with single treatments. See <i>Arch. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, </i>2001, vol. 127, 1319.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another study, intratumoral injection of polyplexes of linear polyethylenimine (PEI) with an anti-oncogene and somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2), produced a significant inhibition of growth of pancreatic tumors and metastases to the liver. <i>Curr Opin Biotechnol, </i>2002, vol. 13, 128. The PEI-mediated delivery of sst2 in tumors led to increased apoptosis and activation of the caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) pathways. Sustained delivery of DNA/PEI polyplexes into solid tumors produced higher expression than achieved by bolus delivery. <i>Gene Ther., </i>1999, vol. 10, 1659. Dendrimers were used for inhibition of pancreatic carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma by intratumoral gene transfer of Fas-L and HSV-1 thymidine kinase, respectively. See <i>Gene Ther., </i>2003, vol. 10, 434; and <i>Gene Ther., </i>2000, vol. 7, 53.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Chemo-immunotherapy using cytotoxic drugs and cytokines offers a new approach for improving the treatment of neoplastic diseases. The therapeutic efficacy of combinations of IL-12 proteins with cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, cisplatin or doxorubicin has been investigated in the murine L1210 leukemia model. See <i>Int. J. Cancer, </i>1998, vol. 77, 720. Treatment of L1210 leukemia with IL-12 or one of the above chemotherapeutic agents given alone resulted in moderate antileukemic effects. Combination of IL-12 with cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel produced no augmentation of antileukemic effects in comparison with these agents given alone. However, combination of IL-12 with doxorubicin augmented the antileukemic effect, while combination with cisplatin had a moderate enhancing effect.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in murine melanoma MmB16 model the IL-12+paclitaxel combination was more effective than the individual therapies. <i>Cancer Lett., </i>1999, vol. 147, 67. The antitumor efficacy of IL-12 protein in combination with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, or 5-FU in MB-49 bladder carcinoma and B16 melanoma has also been examined. See, <i>Clin. Cancer Res., </i>1997, vol. 3, 1661. In combination with chemotherapy, IL-12 administration increased antitumor activity without causing additional toxicity. In mouse sarcoma MCA207 that is refractory to treatment by either IL-12 or cyclophosphamide, combination of recombinant IL-12 and cyclophosphamide gave a better antitumor response than the individual treatments. <i>J Immunol., </i>1998, vol. 160, 1369. In mouse mammary tumors, combination therapy comprising intravenous paclitaxil chemotherapy and intratumoral IL-12 gene therapy (IL-12/WSLP) was more efficacious than the individual therapies. See, <i>Molecular Therapy, </i>2004, vol. 9, 829. The benefit of this combination therapy was dependent on the delivery vehicle used for paclitaxel. The synergistic interaction between paclitaxel and IL-12 gene therapy was observed when paclitaxel was formulated in a polymeric formulation. In comparison, combination with Cremophor EL (Taxol&#xae;), a widely used paclitaxel formulation for cancer therapy, was not synergistic, suggesting that the observed benefits were formulation specific.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To achieve a desirable outcome from a combination approach involving gene therapeutics, the selection of an appropriate gene delivery system is important. The gene delivery system used in the aforementioned combination experiments (<i>Molecular Therapy, </i>2004, vol. 9, 829) is a water soluble lipopolymer, PEI-Cholesterol (WSLP). In the present invention, we describe the use of a novel class of polymeric carriers (PEG-PEI-Cholesterol) structurally distinct from WSLP in that it contains a hydrophilic polymer designed to improve pharmacokinetics, safety and potency of the gene delivery system and membrane interacting ligands (e.g., cholesterol) that are oriented in numerous geometrical configurations to promote transfection activity of anticancer genes either alone or in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent. The transfection activity advantage of PPC compared to WSLP in tumor tissue is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The combination of either two chemotherapeutic agents or a chemotherapeutic agent and a cytokine has been examined clinically. Although these combinations have produced greater tumor regression, the long-range survival benefits are marginal and cytotoxicity has been a problem. This is due to the inherent systemic toxicity associated with chemotherapy and recombinant protein therapy. New and more effective combinational approaches must be designed to improve future cancer therapy. In this present invention, we describe a novel combinational approach for treatment of cancer comprising a nucleic acid based therapeutic delivered with a polymeric carrier and at least one chemotherapeutic agent.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">This present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a nucleic acid, a gene delivery polymer, and at least one pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of cancer. In addition, the present invention also provides a method for inhibiting the growth and metastasis of tumor cells and improving survival in mammals by the in vivo administration of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a nucleic acid, a gene delivery polymer, and at least one pharmaceutical agent.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The nucleic acid is a member selected from the group consisting of plasmid DNA, siRNA, sense RNA, antisense RNA, and ribozymes. The plasmid DNA is a gene expression system containing a DNA sequence which encodes for an anticancer or anti-proliferative protein selected from the group consisting of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-7, interleukin-12, interleukin-15, interferon-&#x3b1;, interferon-&#x3b2;, interferon-&#x3b3;, colony stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor, anti-angiogenic agents, tumor suppressor genes, thymidine kinase, eNOS, iNOS, p53, p16, TNF-&#x3b1;, Fas-ligand, mutated oncogenes, tumor antigens, viral antigens or bacterial antigens. The plasmid DNA may also encode for an shRNA molecule designed to inhibit protein(s) involved in the growth or maintenance of tumor cells or other hyperproliferative cells. A plasmid DNA may simultaneously encode for a therapeutic protein and one or more shRNA. Furthermore, the nucleic acid of the said composition may also be a mixture of plasmid DNA and synthetic RNA including sense RNA, antisense RNA or ribozymes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The gene delivery polymer is a cationic polymer or a non-condensing polymer. The cationic polymer is selected from the group comprising polylysine, polyethylenimine, functionalized derivatives of polyethylenimine (PEI), polypropylenimine, aminoglycoside-polyamine, dideoxy-diamino-b-cyclodextrin, spermine and spermidine. One example of a cationic gene delivery polymer suitable for the present invention is a PEI derivative comprising a PEI backbone, a lipid, and a hydrophilic polymer spacer wherein the lipid is directly bound to the polyethylenimine backbone or covalently bound to the polyethylene glycol spacer, which in turn is bound, via a bio compatible bond, to the PEI. The cationic gene delivery polymer of the present invention may further comprise a targeting moiety including antibodies or antibody fragments, cell receptors, growth factor receptors, cytokine receptors, folate, transferrin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, asialoorosomucoid, mannose-6-phosphate (monocytes), mannose (macrophage, some B cells), Lewis<sup>x </sup>and sialyl Lewis<sup>x </sup>(endothelial cells), N-acetyllactosamine (T cells), galactose (colon carcinoma cells), and thrombomodulin (mouse lung endothelial cells), fusogenic agents such as polymixin B and hemaglutinin HA2, lysosomotrophic agents, nucleus localization signals (NLS) such as T-antigen, and the like. Another gene delivery polymer is a non-condensing polymer selected from the group comprising polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylalcohol, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and triblock copolymers of PLGA and PEG. The gene delivery polymer may also be a non-condensing polymer. Examples of such non-condensing polymers include polyvinyl pyrollidone, polyvinyl alcohol, poloxamers, polyglutamate, gelatin, polyphosphoesters, silk-elastin-like hydrogels, agarose hydrogels, lipid microtubules, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) and polyethyleneglycol-linked poly(lactide-co-glycolide).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment of the foregoing composition the pharmaceutical agent is a chemotherapeutic drug selected from the group consisting of taxanes, platinums, adriamycins, cylcophosphamide, topotecan, carmustine (BCNU) or a combination thereof. Paclitaxel, carboplatin, topotecan, gemcitabine and any combination thereof are particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment of the foregoing compositions the pharmaceutical agent is an anti-cancer antibody selected from the group consisting of CD20 antibody, HER2/neu antibody, anti-VEGF antibody, epidermal growth factor receptor antibody and radioisotopic conjugates thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">This present invention also provides a method for treatment of mammalian cancer by intratumoral, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, intracranial or systemic administration of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a nucleic acid, a nucleic acid delivery polymer, and at least one adjunctive chemotherapeutic drug. The mammalian cancer is selected from a group consisting of primary or metastasized tumors of ovary, breast, brain, head and neck, liver, lung, prostate, kidney, colon, pancreas, thyroid, urinary bladder, abdominal cavity, thoracic cavity and skin. The nucleic acid and gene delivery polymer is administered by intratumoral, intraperitoneal, intratracheal or oral or systemic administration before or after the administration of the pharmaceutical agents. For example, in some instances it is preferred to administer the nucleic acid (e.g., pIL-12 DNA/polymer) prior to the pharmaceutical agent (e.g., chemotherapy), as this would potentially enhance tumor sensitivity to the pharmaceutical agent and boost the anti-cancer response. In another instance, it is preferred to give the pharmaceutical agent (e.g., chemotherapy) prior to gene delivery (e.g., pIL-12/PPC) to allow the pharmaceutical agent to cause tumor destruction and release of tumor antigens later to be used by the therapeutic gene (e.g., pIL-12/polymer) for eliciting highly specific and robust therapeutic response (e.g., immune response) against the target cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The treatment of tumors with the said pharmaceutical composition (nucleic acid plus gene delivery polymer and one or more chemotherapeutic agents) results in tumor shrinkage and extension of life span. The combination of gene therapy (nucleic acid and gene delivery polymers) with chemotherapy (chemotherapeutic agents) according to the method of the present invention produce additive and/or synergistic efficacy. The efficacy of the method of this invention is defined as but not limited to shrinkage in tumor size or reduction in tumor density, an increase in lymphocyte count or increase in neutrophil count or improvement in survival, or all of the above. In addition, the combination of gene therapy (nucleic acid and gene delivery polymers) with chemotherapy (chemotherapeutic agents) according to the method of the present invention lowers the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent and reverses tumor resistance to chemotherapy. The toxicity herein is defined as any treatment related adverse effects on clinical observation including but not limited to abnormal hematology or serum chemistry or organ toxicity. Furthermore, the combination of gene therapy (nucleic acid and gene delivery polymers) with a suboptimal dose of chemotherapy (chemotherapeutic agents) according to the method of the present invention enhances the anticancer effect to a level equal to or higher than that of achieved with the optimal dose of the chemotherapeutic agent but with lesser toxicity.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the said combination therapy, the nucleic acid is a member selected from the group consisting of plasmid DNA, siRNA, sense RNA, antisense RNA, and ribozymes.

The plasmid DNA may also encode for an shRNA molecule designed to inhibit protein(s) involved in the growth or maintenance of tumor cells or other hyperproliferative cells. A plasmid DNA may simultaneously encode for a therapeutic protein and one or more shRNA molecules. Furthermore, the nucleic acid of the said composition may also be a mixture of plasmid DNA and synthetic RNA. The gene delivery polymer is a cationic polymer or a non-condensing polymer. The cationic polymer is selected from the group comprising polylysine, polyethylenimine, functionalized derivatives of polyethylenimine, polypropylenimine, aminoglycoside-polyamine, dideoxy-diamino-b-cyclodextrin, spermine and spermidine. One example of a cationic gene delivery polymer suitable for the present invention is a polyethylenimine derivative comprising a polyethylenimine (PEI) backbone, a lipid, and a polyethylene glycol spacer wherein the lipid is directly bound to the polyethylenimine backbone or covalently bound to the polyethylene glycol spacer, which in turn is bound, via a biocompatible bond, to the PEI. The cationic gene delivery polymer of the present invention may further comprise a targeting moiety including antibodies or antibody fragments, cell receptors, growth factor receptors, cytokine receptors, folate, transferrin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, asialoorosomucoid, mannose-6-phosphate (monocytes), mannose (macrophage, some B cells), Lewis<sup>x </sup>and sialyl Lewis<sup>x </sup>(endothelial cells), N-acetyllactosamine (T cells), galactose (colon carcinoma cells), and thrombomodulin (mouse lung endothelial cells), fusogenic agents such as polymixin B and hemaglutinin HA2, lysosomotrophic agents, nucleus localization signals (NLS) such as T-antigen, and the like. The gene delivery polymer is a non-condensing polymer selected from the group comprising polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylalcohol, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and triblock copolymers of PLGA and PEG. The chemotherapeutic drug is a member selected from the group consisting of texanes, platinums, adriamycins, cylcophosphamide, topotecan, carmustine (BCNU) or a combination thereof. Paclitaxel, carboplatin, topotecan, gemcitabine and any combination thereof are particularly preferred.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">This present invention also provides a method for treatment of mammalian cancer or hyperproliferative disorders by intratumoral, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, intracranial or systemic administration of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a plasmid-based gene expression system and a gene delivery polymer, without a chemotherapeutic drug. The mammalian cancer is selected from a group consisting of primary or metastasized tumors of ovary, breast, brain, head and neck, thyroid, liver, lung, pancreas, intestine, spleen, prostate, kidney, urinary bladder, colon, and melanoma. Preferably, the nucleic acid is a plasmid-based gene expression system containing a DNA sequence which encodes an anticancer or anti-proliferative protein selected from the group consisting of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-7, interleukin-12, interleukin-15, interferon-&#x3b1;, interferon-&#x3b2;, interferon-&#x3b3;, colony stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor, anti-angiogenic agents, tumor suppressor genes, thymidine kinase, eNOS, iNOS, p53, p16, TNF-&#x3b1;, Fas-ligand, mutated oncogenes, tumor antigens, viral antigens or bacterial antigens.

The cationic polymer is selected from the group comprising polyethylenimine, functionalized derivatives of polyethylenimine, polypropylenimine, aminoglycoside-polyamine, dideoxy-diamino-b-cyclodextrin, spermine and spermidine. One example of a cationic polymer suitable for presentation is a polyethylenimine derivative comprising polyethylenimine (PEI), a lipid, and a hydrophilic polymer spacer wherein the lipid is directly bound to the polyethylenimine backbone or covalently bound to the hydrophilic polymer spacer, which in turn is bound via a biocompatible bond to the PEI.

Thus, for example, reference to a polymer containing &#x201c;a disulfide link&#x201d; includes reference to two or more of such disulfide links, reference to &#x201c;a ligand&#x201d; includes reference to one or more of such ligands, and reference to &#x201c;a drug&#x201d; includes reference to two or more of such drugs.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set out below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">&#x201c;Transfecting&#x201d; or &#x201c;transfection&#x201d; shall mean transport of nucleic acids from the environment external to a cell to the internal cellular environment, with particular reference to the cytoplasm and/or cell nucleus. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is to be understood that nucleic acids may be delivered to cells either after being encapsulated within or adhering to one or more cationic polymer/nucleic acid complexes or being entrained therewith. Particular transfecting instances deliver a nucleic acid to a cell nucleus. Nucleic acids include DNA and RNA as well as synthetic congeners thereof. Such nucleic acids include missense, antisense, nonsense, as well as protein producing nucleotides, on and off and rate regulatory nucleotides that control protein, peptide, and nucleic acid production. In particular, but not limited to, they can be genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, hybrid sequences or synthetic or semi-synthetic sequences, and of natural or artificial origin. In addition, the nucleic acid can be variable in size, ranging from oligonucleotides to chromosomes. These nucleic acids may be of human, animal, vegetable, bacterial, viral, or synthetic origin. They may be obtained by any technique known to a person skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutical agent&#x201d; or &#x201c;drug&#x201d; or any other similar term means any chemical or biological material or compound suitable for administration by the methods previously known in the art and/or by the methods taught in the present invention, which induce a desired biological or pharmacological effect, which may include but are not limited to (1) having a prophylactic effect on the organism and preventing an undesired biological effect such as preventing an infection, (2) alleviating a condition caused by a disease, for example, alleviating pain or inflammation caused as a result of disease, and/or (3) either alleviating, reducing, or completely eliminating a disease from the organism.

The only limitation to the genus or species of bioactive agent to be delivered is that of functionality which can be readily determined by routine experimentation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As used herein, the term &#x201c;biocompatible&#x201d; or &#x201c;biodegradation&#x201d; is defined as the conversion of materials into less complex intermediates or end products by solubilization hydrolysis, or by the action of biologically formed entities which can be enzymes and other products of the organism.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; means the amount of a nucleic acid or a bioactive agent that is sufficient to provide the desired local or systemic effect and performance at a reasonable risk/benefit ratio as would attend any medical treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; means peptides of any length and includes proteins.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">New cancer treatment strategies are focused on delivering macromolecules carrying genetic information, rather than a therapeutic protein itself, allowing for the exogenously delivered genes to be expressed in the tumor environment. Methods that utilize non-viral gene delivery systems are considered safer compared to viral delivery systems, but the practical application of current polymeric systems has not been satisfactory due to poor efficiency. A strategy has recently been disclosed whereby the gene transfection efficiency of a low molecular weight PEI was enhanced by covalent attachment of cholesterol forming a water soluble lipopolymer (WSLP). See, <i>Mol. Ther., </i>2001, 4, 130. IL-12 gene transfer to solid tumors with WSLP was significantly better than by the unmodified PEI and led to more significant tumor inhibition.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present invention provides a novel polymeric system, PEG-PEI-Cholesterol (PPC), which differs from WSLP (PEI-Cholesterol) in that it contains PEG moieties and yields significantly higher transfection efficiency in tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The addition of PEG is designed to enhance the stability of the nucleic acid/polymer complexes in the biological milieu to circumvent for this deficiency in the prior art (WSLP). Furthermore, the addition of PEG chains allows for the incorporation of ligands on to the PPC chain to improve the tissue selectivity of delivery. For example, the cholesterol moiety which is directly linked to the PEI back bone in the prior art (WSLP) may be extended farther from the PEI backbone to create a more flexible geometry for cell receptor interaction. Controlling the number of PEG molecules per unit of the PEI backbone is important to achieve optimal enhancement in transfection activity. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the magnitude of tumor gene transfer is dependent on the ratio between the different PPC components, the PEG, PEI and cholesterol. A preferred range of composition was a PEG:PEI molar ratio of 2-4 at a fixed cholesterol content. The optimal ratio between PEI and cholesterol was 1:0.5 to 1:1. The ability of PPC to promote gene transfer into tumors was examined with a therapeutic gene. Expression plasmid containing mouse IL-12 genes (pmIL-12) were complexed with PPC at a nitrogen (N) to phosphate (P) ratio (N:P ratio) of 11:1 and administered intratumorally into mice with solid 4T1 tumors or intraperitoneally in mice with peritoneal disseminated ovarian tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In both tumor models IL-12 gene transfer was manifested by an increase in IL-12 levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In peritoneal tumor bearing mice post-treatment IL-12 levels rose within 24 hours and declined to baseline level by 7 days. The kinetics of IL-12 action was closely related to a rise in IFN-&#x3b3;, a downstream mediator of IL-12 actions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The rise in IFN-&#x3b3; levels was a bit delayed as expected and remained elevated above baseline after 7 days. These data demonstrate compositions comprising IL-12 expression plasmids and PPC are capable of manifesting IL-12 gene transfer in different tumor types and by different administration routes. The IL-12 gene transfer mediated by pmIL-12/PPC is therapeutically significant as it leads to a significant inhibition of tumor growth.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In mice with peritoneal disseminated ovarian tumors, intraperitoneal administration of pmIL-12/PPC complexes (N:P ratio 11:1) at a DNA dose of 10-250 &#x3bc;g significantly reduced the tumor burden (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and improved survival (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) in a dose dependent manner. The therapeutic effect of pmIL-12/PPC (N:P ratio 11:1) was also observed in colorectal cancer. Intraperitoneal administration of 25 &#x3bc;g of pmIL-12/PPC complexes in mice with peritoneal disseminated colorectal cancer significantly prolonged their survival compared to untreated animals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The anticancer efficacy of IL-12 gene transfer by pmIL-12/PPC was also observed in solid tumors following intratumoral administration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the effects of intratumoral injection of pmIL-12/PPC on the growth of GL261 brain tumors. Treatment of intracranial implants of mouse GL261 glioma by local delivery of pIL-12/PPC complexes (N:P ratio 11:1) significantly enhanced survival. In mice with subcutaneously implanted squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, intratumoral administration of pmIL-12/PPC complexes once every week for four weeks produced a significant inhibition of the rate of tumor growth (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The anticancer effect of pmIL-12/PPC complexes was also observed in ovarian and breast tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The composition of the present invention (nucleic acid and gene delivery polymer) does not exert adverse side effects when administered in vivo. For example, no compound related deaths or clinical signs of toxicity were associated with pmIL-12/PPC administration, intraperitoneally or subcutaneously. pmIL-12/PPC was well tolerated in both male and female mice at doses of 10, 50 and 250 &#x3bc;g per animal. Histopathologic examination of animals in both the IP and SC dose groups demonstrated no evidence of systemic toxicity due to pmIL-12/PPC, mild inflammation was noted in organs located in or adjacent to the injection site but which subsided during a one month recovery period. These results demonstrate that nucleic acid/polymer compositions for treatment of cancer are effective against a wide variety of cancers when given by different modes of administration and that repetitive in vivo delivery does not cause serious toxicity.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is widely recognized that a single treatment strategy against cancer is generally ineffective due to the multi-factorial nature of this disease. The benefit of combination of more than one drug to maximize anticancer response is being increasingly recognized. Despite encouraging preclinical data the clinical success of the chemo-chemo combinations or chemo-cytokine combinations examined to date have not been satisfactory due to the inherent toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs and recombinant cytokine proteins. This warrants the need for a safer chemo-immunotherapy approach to curtail protein toxicity and improve efficacy. In the present invention we have combined a chemotherapeutic agent with gene delivery of an anticancer gene administered locally to the tumor site to improve treatment safety and efficacy. Combining safe and efficient local delivery of an anticancer gene with a standard chemotherapeutic agent will enhance anticancer response and patient survival without augmenting toxicity. This combination therapy will reduce the chemotherapy dose and increase tumor sensitivity to the chemotherapy. In this invention, it is demonstrated that pharmaceutical compositions comprising an anticancer gene complexed with a cationic gene delivery polymer, and at least one adjunctive chemotherapeutic drug is more effective than gene therapy or chemotherapy treatment administered alone. Furthermore, the combination therapy is effective against a wide variety of tumors when given by different routes of administration and does not augment toxicity over individual therapies.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The anticancer response to combination therapy is demonstrated against ovarian tumors implanted into the peritoneal cavity. Intravenous administration of paclitaxil (Taxol&#xae;) (8 mg/Kg) or intraperitoneal administration of mIL-12 plasmid (25-100 &#x3bc;g)/PPC complexes (N:P ratio 11:1) produced tumor reduction and improved survival in tumor bearing mice. The pmIL-12/PPC treatment was more efficacious than the paclitaxel treatment. The combination IL-12 gene and paclitaxel therapy produced greater treatment response than the individual treatments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). A similar effect of the combination therapy on ovarian cancer was observed when IL-12 gene therapy was combined with another chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine (Gemzar&#xae;) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The anti-cancer activity of gemcitabine was significantly enhanced when used alongside with the pmIL-12/PPC treatment. The combination of IL-12 gene therapy with a mixture of two chemotherapeutic agents was investigated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, combining IL-12 gene therapy with a carboplatin (Paraplatin&#xae;)/paclitaxel cocktail resulted in enhanced survival when compared to either IL-12 therapy alone or chemotherapy alone. Addition of IL-12 gene therapy to a suboptimal dose of carboplatin/paclitaxel enhanced the therapeutic efficacy similar to that achieved with a high chemotherapy dose (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) without augmenting the toxicity.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The improvement in anticancer response by combination therapy was also observed in solid tumors. For example in subcutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, intravenous administration of the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg) significantly reduced the tumor growth but did not completely inhibit it (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Intratumoral injection of pmIL-12/PPC alone caused about 30% inhibition of tumor growth. In contrast to the individual treatments, the cyclophosphamide plus pmIL-12/PPC combination treatment caused a complete inhibition of tumor growth. The complete rejection rate dramatically increased from only 10% with cyclophosphamide to 55% with cyclophosphamide plus pmIL-12/PPC complexes. A single intratumoral injection of a suboptimal dose (1.5 &#x3bc;g) of pmIL-12/PPC complexes in GL261 brain tumors did not significantly enhance the animal survival rate. However, combination of this suboptimal dose of pmIL-12/PPC with the chemotherapeutic agent BCNU (Gliadel&#xae; wafer) produced a significant enhancement in the survival rate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Cancer treatment with high dose chemotherapy is associated with serious toxicity. To examine if the addition of IL-12/PPC to low dose chemotherapy augments treatment-related toxicity, peritoneal disseminated ovarian tumor-bearing mice were treated with three treatment cycles (as compared to single treatment cycle) of IL-12/PPC and low dose chemotherapy and monitored for signs of toxicity. Direct comparison was made with animals treated with three cycles of high dose chemotherapy treatment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, 50% of high dose chemotherapy group died due to treatment related toxicity (i.e., before reaching 40 gram) while none of IL-12/PPC+low dose chemotherapy group died from treatment toxicity. These results demonstrate that the toxicity of conventional chemotherapy (high dose) for cancer can be significantly reduced by lowering the chemotherapy dose and adding safer and efficacious IL-12 gene therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">These data demonstrate the anticancer efficacy of the said compositions comprising IL-12 plasmids and a novel gene delivery polymer, and its augmentation with a single or a mixture of chemotherapeutic agents. The combination approach provides a method by which the efficacy of a suboptimal dose of a chemotherapy regimen is enhanced without increasing toxicity.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The ability of local delivery of pIL-12/PPC complexes to produce IL-12 levels in subcutaneous and peritoneal disseminated tumor bearing mice was examined. For subcutaneous tumor studies, female BALB/c mice (7 weeks, 14-18 grams) mice were injected subcutaneously (sc) in the left and right flanks, with 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>4T1 cells each. After the tumors had reached an approximate tumor size of 60 mm<sup>3 </sup>they were injected with pmIL-12/PPC complexes containing 6 &#x3bc;g of DNA.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Frontline chemotherapy for ovarian cancer continues to be a platinum agent (carboplatin, cisplatin) and paclitaxel. Thus, we were interested in evaluating the use of IL-12 gene therapy in combination with a carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen. Mice (C57BL/6) were injected intraperitoneally with 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>ID8 cells in a volume of 500 &#x3bc;l. Chemotherapy treatment was started 15 days after tumor implantation. Carboplatin (Paraplatin&#xae;) administration was at either 40 mg/kg ip in 250 ml (high dose) or 15 mg/kg in 250 &#x3bc;l (low dose) and paclitaxel (Taxol&#xae;) administration was given at either 8 mg/kg ip in 250 &#x3bc;l (high dose) or 3 mg/kg intraperitoneally in 250 ml (low dose). Carboplatin was give once weekly for a total of 4 treatments and paclitaxel was given q2w for a total of two treatments. When carboplatin and paclitaxel were given on the same day the paclitaxel was administered first and then carboplatin two hours later.

In contrast when low dose chemotherapy was combined with IL-12 gene therapy the efficacy improved to a level that was nearly identical to that of the high dose chemotherapy treatment regimen. It would be advantageous to be able to use IL-12 gene therapy in combination with low dose chemotherapy in order to maintain therapeutic efficacy while using lower chemotherapy doses in order to minimize toxicities. This would potentially allow patients to remain on chemotherapy treatment regimens for prolonged periods of time offering the chance for a greatly enhanced therapeutic response.</p>

Mice bearing peritoneal disseminated ovarian tumors were administered with three treatment cycles of IL-12/PPC+low dose chemotherapy or high dose chemotherapy as compared to only one treatment cycle used in the previous examples. Animal mortality occurring prior to reaching the 40 gram body weight cut-off (criterion for sacrificing animals due to disease advancement) and not showing significant tumor burden at necropsy were considered treatment related. Mice (C57BL/6) were injected intraperitoneally with 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>ID8 cells in a volume of 500 &#x3bc;l. Chemotherapy treatment was started 15 days after tumor implantation. Carboplatin (Paraplatin&#xae;) administration was at either 40 mg/kg ip in 250 ml (high dose) or 15 mg/kg in 250 &#x3bc;l (low dose) and paclitaxel (Taxol&#xae;) administration was given at either 8 mg/kg ip in 250 &#x3bc;l (high dose) or 3 mg/kg intraperitoneally in 250 ml (low dose). Carboplatin was give once weekly for a total of 4 treatments and paclitaxel was given q2w for a total of two treatments. On treatment days paclitaxel was administered first and then carboplatin two hours later. Starting 18 days after tumor implantation, mice in selected groups were treated intraperitoneally with 100 &#x3bc;g of IL-12 plasmid complexed with PPC at a 11:1 N:P ratio in a volume of 500 &#x3bc;l. Plasmid administration was repeated weekly for a total of four treatments. The entire treatment cycle was repeated three times (12 weeks total), and the animals were monitored for survival. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, 30% of high dose chemotherapy group died due to treatment related toxicity (i.e., before reaching 40 gram) compared to 0% treatment related death in IL-12/PPC+low dose chemotherapy group, in the low dose chemotherapy group or the IL-12/PPC only treatment group. These results demonstrate that in comparison to a high dose chemotherapy regimen, combining IL-12/PPC with low dose chemotherapy produces relatively fewer treatment related deaths but produces similar anticancer efficacy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
