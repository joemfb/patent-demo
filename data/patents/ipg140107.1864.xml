<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a surgical device for suturing tissue. More particularly, the present invention relates to a suturing device that enables the manipulation and control of the suturing needle and suturing material during operation, and methods for using such a device for suturing tissue.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sutures are used in a variety of surgical applications including closing ruptured or incised tissue, soft tissue attachment, anastomosis, attachment of grafts, etc. Conventionally, suturing of ruptured or incised tissues, for example, is accomplished by the surgeon passing the sharpened tip of a curved suturing needle with a suture attached to the opposite blunt end of the needle through the incised tissue segments to be sutured such that the needle tip penetrates the tissue segments causing the needle to span the incision. The needle is then pulled through the tissue segments manually causing the attached suture to follow the curved path of the needle. Usually a knot is tied at the trailing end of the suture to anchor the first stitch. This action is performed repetitively with application of tension to the needle to pull the entire suture through the tissue segments through subsequent stitches until the entire incised segments are sutured together with a plurality of stitches.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, conventional, open abdominal surgery, including OB-Gyn procedures such as Cesarean delivery, creates a substantial incision (typically eight or more inches in length) in the fascia. In major orthopedic surgery, such as total hip replacement, even longer incisions in two layers of fascia must be closed. The closure of fascia must be done carefully at the conclusion of the surgical procedure, prior to skin closure. Closing fascia by hand suturing is a routine, repetitive, and time-consuming procedure. Typical abdominal incisions may take as long as twenty minutes, while in the case of hip replacement surgery, fascia closure can take even longer. Alternative mechanical suturing devices, as well as staplers, bone anchors, and suture-based arterial closure devices have been used as alternatives to hand suturing in other applications, since manual suturing is a tedious and the speed of the procedure is mostly dependent on skill of the surgeon. Moreover, manual suturing involves the handling and manipulation of a sharp suturing needle with an instrument such as a needle forceps, which can result in slipping and inadvertent, accidental needle pricks through a surgeon's or nurse's gloves, posing a potential risk of infection for the surgeon, nurse, staff, and patient. Furthermore, the direct handling of the needle can cause the needle to become contaminated with pathogenic bacteria that can cause onset of infection at the site of the sutures. There is also a risk of the needle penetrating the bowel and causing a serious, and often fatal infection.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Suturing devices described in the art designed to overcome these limitations are, however, either unduly complex design and economically non-viable or relatively difficult to use and unsuited for precise manipulation for suturing areas that are not easily accessible. For example, the device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,557,265 has to be held sideways in relation to the direction of the incision being closed. Another limitation of prior art suturing devices is their inability to provide positive control over the needle and suture during the suturing process. This can result in non-uniform sutures with either overly loose or overly tight stitches, which can cause excessive bleeding and risk tearing the repaired tissue in the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A suturing device that maintains a positive control over the suturing needle and is capable of providing uniform stitches is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,437,681 and 5,540,705. The disclosed device requires a &#x201c;scissors-like&#x201d; grip and is operated by the surgeon's thumb that provides articulation of the drive mechanism that causes rotation of a linear drive shaft encased in a barrel, which in turn causes a suturing needle encased in a disposable cartridge mounted at the distal end of the barrel to rotate in an advancing motion through the tissue. The device is, however, limited in its efficient operability in the following ways: (1) the rotational direction of the needle and the drive shaft is in a direction that is perpendicular to the device actuating handles, thereby rendering the device relatively difficult to manipulate and control, (2) does not allow the user to view the needle and its progress through the tissue during the suturing operation, since the barrel containing the drive shaft leading to the needle cartridge does not have an open construction to permit such observation, because the action of the needle is blocked from user's view by the nature of the instrument design, thereby making it difficult for the user to position the advancing needle with high accuracy along the junction of the incised tissue segments and (3) the rate of needle advancement and, therefore, the size and uniformity of the stitches is essentially controlled by the user by the extent to which the articulation mechanism is depressed, thereby rendering the process of obtaining uniform needle rotation, tissue penetration and suture advancement difficult and entirely dependent on the skill of the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a suturing device that closely emulates or replicates the manual suturing actions carried out by a surgeon. The suturing device of the present invention provides greater ease of use and allows better visualization for the user during its operation than present mechanical suturing methods, while maintaining control over needle movement, advancement and suturing thread management during all phases of the suturing process, thereby preventing entanglement of the suturing thread material during needle movement.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A benefit provided the suturing device of the present invention is that it enables maneuvering a suturing material through a tissue incision in a manner substantially similar to the way a surgeon would do so by hand. In particular, the suturing device first pushes a suturing needle from the tail of the needle and drives the point of the needle through the tissue. The device then picks up the point of the needle after it has been driven through the tissue, and pulls the remainder of the suturing needle and the suture attached to the suturing needle through the tissue. The suturing needle thus consistently follows the arc of its own curve, which is the preferred method of suturing, in the most non-traumatic way of passing a needle through tissue. A benefit provided by the suturing device of the present invention is the ability of the suturing needle to pull the suturing thread entirely through the tissue segments being closed, following each stitch. The present invention also relates to a suturing device comprising a suturing needle that is protected by a housing cartridge, whereby the suturing needle is not exposed to or handled directly by the user, thereby precluding inadvertent needle sticks. The configuration of the suturing device of the present invention also protects against inadvertent penetration of a bowel by the needle, since the cartridge acts as a shield between the bowel and the needle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The suturing needle of the present invention is configured to fit into a cartridge, which in turn, is removably attached to the distal end of the suturing device. The present invention further provides an actuating means and a shaft and drive assembly that provides a torquing force to the suturing needle to cause the needle to advance through tissue during a suturing process without inadvertent retraction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The suturing device of the present invention offers several advantages over conventional methods used by surgeons for suturing tissue in that it provides a hand-held suturing instrument of relatively simple mechanical construction and which requires no external motive source. The present invention provides relative ease of operation for the surgeon with only one hand, thereby enabling the surgeon to move obstructing tissue, debris and biological fluids from the suturing site with a free hand, while eliminating the need for needle holders, pick-up forceps, and other tools normally required for suturing by hand. Furthermore, the suturing device of the present invention can be configured as to length, tip, needle, suture, and needle cartridge size for use in conventional open surgery as well as in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and in &#x201c;less-invasive&#x201d; surgery, such as through natural orifices or through small incisions. Additionally, the suturing head can be oriented in any preferred direction and either fixed in a particular orientation, or rendered movable in a variety of orientations by an articulation means.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other advantages of the present invention will be obvious through the embodiments described hereinafter. The present invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combination of elements and arrangement of parts that will be exemplified in the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The surgical suturing device of the present invention is configured to provide a &#x201c;pistol like&#x201d; grip for the user that includes a barrel assembly and a handgrip that extends from the proximal end of the barrel. The barrel assembly has either a linear or non-linear configuration, including but not limited to, straight, curved and angled configurations. The barrel assembly comprises a plurality of hollow segments capable of being coupled together by one or more universal joints that do not require a permanent connection between the segments, enabling segments to be pulled apart individually and separated. A cartridge holder is removably attached to the distal end of the barrel assembly by a plurality of support arms to which is releasably mounted a disposable cartridge that is capable of accommodating a suturing needle and a suturing thread material.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The disposable cartridge has a generally cylindrical housing with an aperture in the sidewall of the housing at the distal or working end thereof. An arcuate suturing needle having a sharp, pointed tip at one end of the needle is slidably mounted in a circular track at the distal end of the housing and opposite to the location of the aperture. The needle is connected to a terminal end of a suturing material or thread with a suturing thread source, such as for example, a spool assembly that is contained either entirely within, or remains external the cartridge. The radius of the arc defining the arcuate suturing needle is approximately equal to the circumference to the cartridge housing at the aperture therein. The needle normally resides in a &#x201c;home&#x201d; position in its track such that the gap in the arcuate suturing needle is in alignment with the aperture in the cartridge housing. The sharp, pointed end of the needle is situated on one side and entirely within the confines of the housing aperture; the pointed end is, therefore, always shielded by the cartridge housing. The blunt end of the suturing needle that is attached to the suturing thread is located at the opposite side of the aperture. The sharp, pointed end of the needle is, therefore, wholly contained within the cartridge and does not protrude and be exposed to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with the present invention, the needle may be releasably engaged by a driving means that is rotatably mounted within the barrel assembly so that the needle can be rotated from its home position by about 360&#xb0; about the central vertical axis of the cartridge. Such a rotatory action of the needle causes its sharp tip to advance across the cartridge housing so as to span the aperture. Thus, when the device is positioned such that the incised tissue segments to be sutured are situated at the housing aperture, the needle penetrates the tissue segments and spans the incision between them. A continued rotatory movement of the needle causes it to return it to its original &#x201c;home&#x201d; position, and thereby causes the suturing thread attached to the needle to be pulled into and through the tissue in an inward direction on one side of the tissue incision, and upwards and out through the tissue on the opposite side of the incision. Thus, the suture follows the curved path of the needle to bind the tissues together with a stitch of thread across the incision in a manner identical to that of a surgeon suturing manually, wherein the needle is &#x201c;pushed&#x201d; from the tail and then &#x201c;pulled&#x201d; from the point by the drive mechanism. Preferably, an anchoring means is provided at the trailing terminal end of the suturing material to prevent the material from being pulled completely through and out of the tissue segments. For example, the anchoring means can be a pre-tied or a welded loop, a knot wherein the suture is simply tied, or a double-stranded, looped suture is that attached to the suturing needle.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The rotatory movement of the needle within the needle cartridge is accomplished by a needle driver that may be operated by the user by holding the suturing device with one hand in a pistol-like grip around the handle, and using at least one finger of that hand to activate a triggering lever. The suturing device includes a finger operated trigger lever located proximally to the handle, which when actuated, operates a drive shaft encased within the universal joint barrel assembly through a drive mechanism so as to cause the drive shaft to undergo a rotatory motion, thereby causing the suturing needle to advance in a circular motion. Thus, by placement of the device with the needle cartridge aperture spanning the incised tissue segments and actuating the trigger lever, the suturing device enables the user to lay down a running stitch or interrupted stitch to close the tissue incision in a time efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The needle cartridge of the present invention is disposably mounted on a cartridge holder assembly that is removably attached to the distal end of the universal joint barrel assembly. The cartridge holder assembly is supported by a plurality of support arms that extend from the distal end of the universal joint barrel assembly. The minimalized structural design of the support arms enables the user to have a clear, unobstructed view of the suturing needle as it advances through the tissue segments during the course of a suturing operation, thereby enabling precise placement of the suturing device to provide uniform sutures and precluding the risk of tearing tissue by its placement too close to the edge of the incision. The suturing device of the invention is then advanced a short distance along the incision and the aforementioned operation is repeated to produce another stitch comprising the suturing material. The suturing device of the invention can either pull the entire suture material through the tissues automatically under controlled tension thereby replicating the actions of a surgeon suturing manually so as to tighten the formed stitches without tearing tissue. Alternatively, the surgeon simply pulls the thread by hand to tighten the stitch placed over the incised tissue segments by passage of the suturing needle of the suturing device of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The user may continue to manipulate the suturing device, alternately advancing and actuating rotation of the needle about an axis that is generally parallel to the direction of advancement to create a continuous suture which may extend through the entire length of the incision or a series of interrupted stitches. After each individual stitch is laid down, it is tightened by exerting a pull on the suturing material so that the resultant suture is neat and tensioned uniformly along the length of the incised tissue segments. Therefore, a tight closure of the segments is accomplished and bleeding and tearing of tissue are minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As will be described in greater detail below, the needle driver may be operated by the surgeon holding the instrument with one hand, and using at least one finger of that hand. The suturing device includes a finger-operated lever that is functionally coupled with internal gearing and forms part of a handgrip that is located at one terminal end of the device, that enables the surgeon to efficiently and effectively lay down a running stitch, or a series of interrupted or uninterrupted stitches, to close a tissue incision in a minimum amount of time.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The suturing device of the present invention can additionally include an associated thread management system, which operates in conjunction with the needle driver to control or handle the suturing material or thread during rotation of the suturing needle. For example, the thread management roller pushes the thread away from the track so the suture does not get pinched by the needle as the needle re-enters the track. Thus, there is minimal probability of the thread becoming tangled or hung up during the suturing operation. The thread management system can also include a mechanism whereby the suturing material or thread is controllably &#x201c;paid out&#x201d; during the suturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When using the suturing device of the present invention, no ancillary instruments or tools such as needle holders, pick-up forceps or the like are needed to complete the suture. Also, the suturing device may be configured in different ways with respect to length and angle of the universal joint barrels, the angle between barrel segments and the number and shape of the support arms. The size of the needle, needle cartridge, cartridge aperture and aperture position may also be varied for use in open surgery to perform procedures such as closing of the fascia, skin closure, soft tissue attachment, anastomosis, fixation of mesh, grafts and other artificial materials. The suturing device or the present invention may also be designed with a very small working end or tip at the end of a long rigid shaft or a flexible shaft that can be oriented in any preferred direction so that the instrument may be used for MIS, such as suturing in the course of endoscopic surgery, including laparoscopy, thoracoscopy and arthroscopy, as well as less-invasive surgical procedures.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">While the above-identified drawings set forth preferred embodiments of the present invention, other embodiments of the present invention are also contemplated, as noted in the discussion. This disclosure presents illustrative embodiments of the present invention by way of representation and not limitation. Numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art which fall within the scope and spirit of the principles of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The suturing device of the present invention is shown generally at <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the suturing device <b>1</b> of the present invention can be used to produce a continuous or interrupted stitch or suture so as to enable closure of the segments of an incised tissue. The suturing device <b>1</b> includes an actuator handle <b>12</b> comprising a proximal end <b>6</b> and a distal end <b>8</b>, that allows the device <b>1</b> to be held in a pistol grip by the user, and a trigger lever <b>16</b>. The actuator handle <b>12</b> is attached to a pusher <b>9</b> at the distal end of handle <b>12</b>. The pusher <b>9</b> comprises a of shaft barrel assembly <b>10</b> comprising a plurality of shaft segments capable of housing a drive shaft (not shown) that extend outwardly from a housing <b>14</b> at the distal end <b>8</b> of the actuator handle <b>12</b>. The shaft barrel assembly <b>10</b> is comprised of at least two segments with symmetric coupling assemblies that are coupled to one another with a universal joint coupler (not shown). The coupled assembly is enclosed within a universal joint sleeve <b>18</b> such that the universal joint barrel is configured at an angle of about 30&#xb0; from horizontal. The shaft segment <b>10</b> distal from the actuator handle <b>12</b> is attached removably to a support arm assembly <b>22</b> that is comprised of a pair of &#x201c;skeletalized&#x201d; arms extending along mutually divergent axes so as to provide an opening <b>23</b> to view the device working end <b>19</b> during its operation. The working end <b>19</b> of the suturing device <b>1</b> comprises a cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b> that is removably attached to the support arm assembly <b>22</b>, to which the needle cartridge <b>24</b> is disposably attached.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-13</figref> provide detailed views of the various components of one embodiment of the suturing device <b>1</b> and the manner in which the components are configured in the final assembled device to enable its operation via a &#x201c;side-drive&#x201d; mechanism in the manner described.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the working end <b>19</b> of the suturing device <b>1</b> including the universal joint coupling sleeve <b>18</b>, the universal joint segment distal to the actuator handle (not shown) a &#x201c;pusher&#x201d; <b>9</b> comprising a support arm assembly <b>22</b> and a cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b> with an attached disposable needle cartridge <b>24</b>, and a universal joint assembly (hidden) encased in a joint sleeve <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> provide detailed segmental views of the suturing device working-end <b>19</b> showing the disposable needle cartridge <b>24</b> in a disengaged mode and a curved suturing needle <b>26</b> separated from the needle cartridge <b>24</b> to illustrate the relative configuration of these segments with respect to the cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b>, the pusher <b>9</b> comprising the support arm assembly <b>22</b> and the universal joint segments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the coupled junction mode involving coupling of the shaft segments <b>10</b> comprising a universal joint coupler (hidden), while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the coupled shaft segments <b>10</b> encased in a coupling joint sleeve or &#x201c;sweep&#x201d; <b>18</b> that aligns the cartridge mount <b>20</b> from the stem to the actuator handle at about 30&#xb0;. The sweep <b>18</b> can be either pre-configured to provide a pre-determined fixed angle for the cartridge mount (relative to actuator handle), or can be configured to be adjustable to provide the user with the ability to vary the cartridge mount angle to a setting optimal for a particular procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-C</figref> show expanded views of the hollow universal joint segment and the manner in which two identical segments are coupled. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the shaft segment <b>10</b> comprises a hollow cylindrical barrel <b>28</b> with two open ends, and two pairs of arcuate slots <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> at one end, wherein one pair of arcuate slots is narrower than the other. Additionally, the joint segment contains a plurality of circular openings <b>36</b> located on the cylinder surface to accommodate a corresponding number of restraining pins in the universal joint sleeve (&#x201c;sweep&#x201d;) <b>18</b> that are identical in diameter. Two shaft segments <b>10</b> having identical arcuate slot configurations <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> may be coupled together using a universal joint coupler <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) comprising a plurality of pins <b>40</b> such that the coupler engages the pair of narrow slots <b>32</b> of the conjoining joint segments <b>32</b>, thereby providing a junction connecting the two shaft segments <b>10</b> that is non-rigid (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>). The angle between coupled segments <b>10</b> can, therefore, be varied. The coupled segments <b>10</b> provide a conduit for passage of a drive shaft (not shown) for activating needle movement.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a &#x201c;transparent&#x201d; view of the universal joint sleeve or &#x201c;sweep&#x201d; <b>18</b>, which comprises of a hollow tubular segment with two open ends <b>29</b>, <b>31</b> whose tubular axis bends over a predetermined angle. The sleeve <b>18</b> additionally comprises a plurality of slots <b>30</b> positioned along its side wall that are capable of engaging the corresponding slots <b>36</b> on the shaft segments <b>10</b> that are positioned appropriately by means of restraining bolts on pins <b>38</b>. The sweep <b>18</b> therefore, enables the angle of the coupled shaft segments <b>10</b> to be &#x201c;locked&#x201d; in a preferred angle. The sleeve <b>18</b> can be configured to have either a fixed angle, or to have the capability to provide the user the ability to adjust the angle to a preferred setting. In one embodiment, the sweep <b>18</b> provides an angle of about 30&#xb0; from horizontal. The angle for the coupled universal joint segments <b>10</b> determined by the sweep in turn, determines the angle of the cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b> which is attached to the shaft segment <b>10</b> at the distal end <b>8</b> of the actuator handle <b>12</b> (via the support arm assembly <b>22</b>). The cartridge holder angle relative to actuator handle <b>12</b>, in turn, determines the accessibility of the suturing device <b>1</b> at the site of the suturing procedure which is critical, depending on whether it is open and planar, or non-planar and narrow.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a detailed view of the pusher <b>9</b> that includes a cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b> that is attached to a support arm assembly comprising a pair of &#x201c;skeletalized&#x201d; support arms <b>22</b> which in turn, is attached to the terminal end of shaft segment <b>10</b>. The open configuration of the &#x201c;skeletalized&#x201d; support arms <b>22</b> that are minimal in bulk is an essential feature of suturing device <b>1</b> that provides a relatively wide opening <b>23</b> that allows the user to directly view the aperture in the needle cartridge and cartridge (not shown) holder assembly <b>20</b>, the incision in the tissue and needle advancement through the incised tissue segments during operation of suturing device <b>1</b>. Although the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> has a plurality of support arms <b>22</b>, other variants include a support arm assembly comprising a single support arm as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. The improved viewing ability offered by the shape and configuration of the support arm assembly <b>22</b> enables precise device placement over the incision, and uniform advancement of the suturing device after every stitch to provide a uniform and symmetric suture, thereby minimizing the risk of tearing tissue and bleeding due to a stitch being positioned too close to the edge of the incised tissue. The cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b> is composed of a sterilizable medical grade material which can either be a metallic material such as stainless steel to enable its reuse subsequent to sterilization following a prior use, or a sterilizable medical grade plastic material, in which case, it may discarded and disposed after a single use. The cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b> has a cylindrical configuration with a distal edge <b>40</b> and a proximal edge <b>42</b> with respect to the device actuator handle (not shown), with an aperture <b>45</b> that corresponds in dimension and location to coincide with a substantially similar aperture located in the disposable needle cartridge. The cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b> additionally comprises a plurality of slots <b>44</b> located along on the distal edge <b>40</b> in that are located diametrically opposite to one another, and are capable of engaging the same plurality of retaining clips correspondingly located in the needle cartridge housing (not shown). The cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b> further comprises a cylindrical slot <b>46</b> located on the distal edge <b>40</b> that is capable of engaging a positioning pin of identical diameter correspondingly located on the needle cartridge housing (not shown). The proximal edge <b>42</b> of the cartridge holder assembly is attached to the shaft segment <b>10</b> distal to the actuator handle <b>12</b> via a support assembly comprising at least one &#x201c;skeletalized&#x201d; support arm <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show two different views of an embodiment of a disposable suturing needle cartridge <b>24</b> of the present invention, which is preferably offered in a sterilized sealed package. The cartridge <b>24</b> comprises a circular housing <b>48</b> that may be formed of a suitable rigid medical grade sterilizable metal or plastic material. The housing may be releasably retained by the cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b> at the distal end <b>19</b> of suturing device <b>1</b> (working end) by known means, such as a plurality of clips <b>50</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) located along on the edge of an inner lip <b>52</b> in diametrically opposite positions that are capable of engaging the same plurality of slots correspondingly located in the cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b>. The cartridge <b>24</b> further comprises a cylindrical positioning pin <b>54</b> located on the edge of the inner lip <b>52</b> that is capable of engaging a cylindrical slot of identical diameter correspondingly located on the cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b>. While the retaining clips <b>50</b> when engaged enable the cartridge to be retained by the cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b>, the positioning pin <b>54</b> when engaged in the slot causes the aperture in the cartridge <b>24</b> to be aligned with the corresponding aperture in the cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b>. The needle cartridge <b>24</b> further comprises an aperture <b>56</b> and a circular groove or &#x201c;track&#x201d; <b>58</b> that is inscribed in the inside surface of the housing <b>48</b>, which lies in a plane that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of both the housing <b>48</b> and that of the suturing device <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the cartridge-housing aperture <b>56</b> interrupts the track <b>58</b>. An arcuate surgical suturing needle <b>26</b> composed of medical grade stainless steel or similar material is slidably positioned in the track <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that cartridge <b>24</b> includes a generally circular, &#x201c;C&#x201d;-shaped body B having an outer diameter D, a first end <b>24</b><i>a </i>and a second end <b>24</b><i>b </i>separated by an aperture <b>56</b>.

Body B further includes at least one engagement surface S for engaging a distal end of the suturing device. Body B has a height H perpendicular to a circular plane defined by the needle track T, wherein the height is substantially less than about one half of the diameter D of the body B. In the depicted embodiments of cartridges herein, H is less than about one quarter of the diameter D of the body B. As is also evident, needle <b>26</b> is disposed in track T and is configured to advance along the track T but is prevented from falling out of the track T by at least one protrusion <b>24</b><i>c </i>extending radially inwardly from the inner wall C. It will be appreciated that the cartridge embodied in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(A)</figref> has a body B with a diameter D and height H that are very similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>. However, the cartridge of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(A)</figref> additionally includes a cleat <b>98</b> that depends downwardly from the distal face W of the cartridge (that is, the face that forms the distal end of the suturing instrument when the cartridge is installed). Cleat <b>98</b> also depends radially outwardly with respect to the central axis of the suturing instrument and terminates in tip <b>98</b><i>a</i>, wherein the cleat cooperates with the body B to define a gap G therebetween for receiving and guiding suturing material.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> show embodiments of the arcuate suturing needle <b>26</b> of the present invention. In one embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), the needle <b>26</b> is formed as a circular split ring with a gap <b>59</b>, a sharp, pointed end <b>60</b>, and a blunt end <b>62</b>. The needle <b>26</b> further comprises an opening to accommodate the leading end of the suturing material. In one embodiment, the opening is the form of an eye <b>64</b> though which the leading end of the suturing material may be passed through for attaching it to the needle <b>26</b>. In the illustrated needle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), the eye <b>64</b> is located adjacent to the blunt end <b>62</b>. The eye <b>64</b> however, can be positioned anywhere along the arc or the needle <b>26</b> between its apex <b>61</b> and the blunt end <b>62</b>. In a preferred embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>), the needle <b>26</b> comprises an opening in the form of a cylindrical bore <b>66</b> aligned axially with respect to the needle <b>26</b>, located at the blunt end <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>). The leading end of the suturing material is inserted into the bore and restrained by mechanically crimping. To enable the needle <b>26</b> to penetrate tissue to the required depth, the needle preferably has an arcuate extent between about 280&#xb0; and about 330&#xb0;, and more preferably, greater than about 270&#xb0;. The needle <b>26</b> comprises two symmetric notches <b>68</b> along the radially inner edge (&#x201c;inner notches&#x201d;) that are positioned proximally to the sharp, pointed end <b>60</b> and the blunt end <b>62</b> of the needle <b>26</b>. The notches <b>68</b> are located directly opposite to each other, each having a perpendicular (about 90&#xb0;) segment and an angular segment that makes an angle of about 60&#xb0; with the perpendicular segment. The inner notches <b>68</b> are engaged by the drive mechanism in the cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b> and enable the needle <b>26</b> to undergo a rotatory movement upon actuation of the drive mechanism, thereby causing it to penetrate into and advance through tissue. A similar triangular notch <b>70</b> is located on the radially outer edge (&#x201c;outer notch&#x201d;) of the needle proximally to the inner notch <b>68</b> closer to the sharp, pointed end <b>60</b>. The outer notch <b>70</b> engages with an &#x201c;anti-rotate&#x201d; pin located in the cartridge holder assembly <b>20</b>, whereby rotation of the needle <b>26</b> in a direction opposite to the advancing direction or &#x201c;needle backing-up&#x201d; is prevented. The positive engagement of the needle outer notch <b>70</b> during operation of the suturing device <b>1</b>, and thereby precludes needle <b>26</b> from straying out of sequence during the suturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The width of the aperture <b>56</b> in the cartridge housing <b>48</b> is comparable to and corresponds with the width of the gap in the needle <b>26</b> so that when the needle <b>26</b> is in the &#x201c;home&#x201d; position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) it does not project materially into the aperture <b>56</b>. Such an alignment causes the needle to reside entirely within the cartridge holder <b>20</b>, thereby preventing inadvertent contact of the sharp pointed end <b>60</b> with the user's fingers during handling of the disposable needle cartridge <b>24</b> for its placement on the cartridge holder <b>20</b> or its disposal after use, and while operating the suturing device <b>1</b>. Such protection of the needle <b>26</b> in the suturing device of the present invention prevents accidental &#x201c;needle-pricks&#x201d; from occurring, thereby substantially reducing the risk of infection caused by pathogenic bacteria or viruses that may contaminate the needle during or after its use prior to its disposal. The needle <b>26</b> may be rotated in its curved track <b>58</b> about the longitudinal axis of the suturing device <b>1</b> to advance the pointed needle tip <b>60</b> so that the needle first spans the aperture and then return to its original or home position. Since the suturing material is attached to the needle <b>26</b>, it follows the path of the needle <b>26</b>. The terminal end of the suturing material may contain a knot or button to prevent it from pulling through the sutured tissue during placement of the first stitch. The suturing material or thread may be stored in an enclosed packaging either externally or internally with respect to the needle cartridge housing <b>48</b>, and be pulled out of that packaging prior to placement of the first stitch in the suturing process. In a preferred embodiment, the cartridge housing <b>48</b> comprise the suturing needle <b>26</b> attached to the terminal end suturing material or thread, and an appropriate length of suturing material are all packaged in a terminally sterilizable medical packaging material.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a thread management roller <b>72</b> of the present invention which acts to push the thread away from the track so the suture does not get pinched by the needle as the needle re-enters the track. The thread management roller <b>72</b> comprises a spring operated stop pin <b>74</b> that maintains a positive pressure against the suturing material or thread, thereby preventively retaining the suturing material in the thread retaining slot of the suturing needle, while keeping the thread out of the needle track to preclude the thread from jamming needle movement. The stop pin <b>74</b>, therefore, prevents jamming of needle movement by an inadvertent entry of the suturing material into the needle slot within the needle cartridge <b>24</b> when the material is pulled forward by the advancing movement of the needle <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an expanded view of the anti-rotate pin <b>75</b> that is capable of engaging the outer notch of the needle <b>26</b> to prevent rotation of the needle <b>26</b> and prevent &#x201c;needle backing-up&#x201d; and thereby precluding the needle <b>26</b> from straying out of sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows an expanded view of a pusher assembly comprising pusher <b>76</b> and a pawl <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>) located at its tip, which resides in a corresponding slot in the support arm <b>22</b> of the pusher assembly, and is connected the support arm <b>22</b> by a pivot pin <b>80</b>. The needle <b>26</b> is driven in a circular path by a rigid arm (&#x201c;pusher&#x201d;) that extends from a hub located in the center of the suturing device <b>1</b>. The pawl <b>78</b> at the tip of the pusher <b>76</b> is capable of interfitting with the wedge shaped notches located along the radially inner edge of the needle. The pusher <b>76</b> is activated by the user upon operation of the actuator trigger in the actuator handle <b>12</b>, and is capable of sweeping back and forth in an arc spanning about 280&#xb0;. The outer surface of the pusher <b>76</b> is shaped to accommodate a C-shaped spring (not shown) that causes the wedge-shaped pawl <b>78</b> to push up against the needle <b>26</b> and thereby remain in intimate contact. The advancing movement of needle <b>26</b> during its operation causes the triangular slots <b>68</b> along the radially inner edge of needle <b>26</b> align with the wedge-shaped pawl <b>78</b> in the pusher <b>76</b>, thereby causing the pawl <b>78</b> to engage the slots <b>68</b> due to a positive pressure exerted on the pin by the C-shaped spring, and to &#x201c;lock&#x201d; into the slots <b>68</b>. The rotatory advancing movement of the needle <b>26</b> is therefore controlled to occur sequentially through about 280&#xb0; each time it is actuated.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a preferred embodiment of the curved suturing needle <b>102</b> of the invention. The needle <b>102</b> is formed as a circular split ring with an aperture (or gap) <b>106</b>, as sharp, pointed end <b>108</b> and the opposite end <b>110</b>. A cylindrical bore <b>112</b> aligned axially with respect to the needle, located at the blunted <b>110</b>. The leading end of the suturing material is inserted into the bore and restrained by mechanically crimping. Alternatively, the opening for accommodating the suture material can be in the form of an &#x201c;eye&#x201d; wherein the leading end of the suturing material may be passed through for attaching it to the needle <b>102</b>. To enable the needle <b>102</b> to penetrate tissue to the required depth, the needle <b>102</b> preferably has an arcuate extent between about 280&#xb0; and about 330&#xb0;, and more preferably, greater than about 270&#xb0;. Needle <b>26</b> comprises two symmetric notches (&#x201c;rear notches&#x201d;) <b>114</b> along the radially rear edge, i.e. the edge proximal to the cartridge holder <b>82</b>, that are positioned proximally to the sharp pointed end <b>108</b> and the opposite blunt end <b>110</b> of the needle <b>102</b>, respectively. The rear notches <b>114</b> are located directly opposite to one another, each having a perpendicular (about 90&#xb0;) segment and an angular segment that makes an angle of about 60&#xb0; with the perpendicular segment. The rear notches <b>114</b> are engaged by the drive mechanism in the cartridge holder assembly and enable the needle to undergo a rotational movement upon actuation of the drive mechanism, thereby causing it to penetrate and advance through tissue. A similar triangular notch <b>116</b> is located on the radially outer edge (&#x201c;outer notch&#x201d;) of the needle proximally to the rear notch <b>114</b> that is closer to the sharp, pointed end <b>108</b>.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a suturing needle is provided, having a curved toroidal body that defines a longitudinal axis &#x201c;X&#x201d; along the curved toroidal body, wherein the longitudinal axis defines a center point &#x201c;Y&#x201d; and the curved toroidal body includes a radially inner surface &#x201c;A&#x201d;, a radially outer surface &#x201c;B&#x201d;, a first sharp pointed <b>108</b> end and a second end <b>110</b>, and wherein the longitudinal axis and the center point of the curved toroidal body define a first plane P<b>1</b>.

The cartridge holder assembly <b>82</b> further comprises a gate assembly <b>124</b> that prevents needle <b>102</b> from leaving its track and falling out into the back of the cartridge holder assembly <b>82</b>. The gate assembly <b>124</b> is maintained in a closed &#x201c;home&#x201d; position by a torque force exerted by a spring <b>126</b> to which it is coupled via a pin <b>128</b>, thereby restricts lateral movement of needle <b>102</b>. The gate assembly <b>124</b> opens during each actuation of the suturing device to permit a circular movement of the drive mechanism that engages needle <b>102</b>, and closes to the home position immediately after passage of the drive mechanism to preclude lateral movement and dislocation of needle <b>102</b> within cartridge holder assembly <b>82</b>.</p>

Actuation of the device causes the drive shaft <b>132</b> to rotate in a clockwise direction, thereby causing driver arm <b>130</b> to move circularly from its &#x201c;home&#x201d; rest position and move up to and the past gate assembly <b>124</b>, causing it to open in the process (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>). The driver arm <b>130</b> continues to move circularly until it comes to rest once again in the &#x201c;home&#x201d; position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>). The gate assembly <b>124</b> returns to its closed home position after passage of the driver arm <b>130</b>, thereby allowing driver arm <b>130</b> to &#x201c;drive&#x201d; needle <b>102</b> in a circular motion, while preventing the needle <b>102</b> from becoming dislocated from track <b>118</b>. Thus, each time suturing device <b>1</b> is actuated, driver arm <b>130</b> moves past the gate assembly <b>124</b>, opening the gate assembly <b>124</b> in the process. Since the gate assembly <b>124</b> moves back into its closed &#x201c;home&#x201d; position after passage of the driver arm <b>130</b>, it precludes lateral movement of the needle <b>102</b>, thereby preventing needle <b>102</b> from jamming due to misalignment during operation.</p>

An advantage offered by the ratchet mechanism <b>134</b> of the present invention is that the actuation step of the suturing device <b>1</b> is pre-determined, that is, the ratchet assembly <b>134</b> prevents the user from performing an incomplete actuating event that could result in an improper or incomplete suture by causing the needle <b>102</b> to snag in the tissue. Furthermore, the ratchet assembly <b>134</b> is capable of operation by the trigger <b>16</b> in a manner independent of its orientation with respect to the trigger <b>16</b> and actuator handle <b>12</b>, such as for example, when it is oriented in an upside down or sideways configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The actuating means of the suturing device <b>1</b> of the present invention may comprise of a triggering mechanism that is known in the art, such as for example, the triggering mechanisms disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,053,908 and 5,344,061, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Alternatively, the actuating means can be either a manually operable button or switch, or a mechanically operable by an automated electrical or a fuel driven device, such as for example, an electrical, electromagnetic or pneumatic motor powered by electrical, electromagnetic, compressed air, compressed gas, hydraulic, vacuum or hydrocarbon fuels.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">To commence suturing, any embodiment of the suturing device <b>1</b> of the present invention is placed at the site of the wound or tissue incision such that it spans the wound or the two tissue segments created by the incision, following which it is actuated by operation of the actuator trigger <b>16</b> on the actuator handle <b>12</b>. The detailed operation of the suturing device <b>1</b> of the present invention is described with reference to the preferred embodiment, and is equally applicable to all other embodiments of the invention described and contemplated herein. The pawl <b>156</b> in the pusher mechanism of the suturing device <b>1</b> engages the notch <b>114</b> located radially rear edge proximal to the blunt end or &#x201c;tail&#x201d; of the suturing needle <b>102</b> and pushes the needle in a circular path in an arc spanning about 280&#xb0;. The sharp, pointed end <b>108</b> of the needle <b>102</b> crosses the aperture <b>96</b> defined by the cartridge <b>84</b> and the cartridge holder <b>82</b>, and penetrates the first tissue segment located within the aperture <b>96</b>, traverses the tissue segment to penetrate the second tissue segment, and re-enters the device on the opposite side of the aperture <b>96</b>. The pusher <b>9</b> then returns to its original location, whereupon the pawl <b>156</b> engages the notch located radially rear edge <b>114</b> proximal to the sharp, pointed end of the needle <b>102</b>. The needle <b>102</b> with the attached suturing material or thread is consequently pulled in a circular path through an arc of about 280&#xb0;. The blunt end <b>110</b> of the needle <b>102</b> and the suturing material therefore, pass through the tissue segments and across the wound or incision so as to span the wound or incision. The needle <b>102</b> comes to rest at its original &#x201c;home&#x201d; position within the track in cartridge holder <b>82</b>, having advanced through a complete circular arc of about 360&#xb0;. The needle <b>102</b> including the sharp, pointed end <b>102</b> remains entirely contained within the cartridge <b>84</b>. The suturing material or thread may then be cut and secured by an appropriate method, such as for example, by tying, or additional stitches may be placed along the entire wound or incision by repeating the aforementioned process. Every stitch, whether a single, interrupted stitch, or one of a series of continuous, running stitches may be placed in like manner. The suturing device <b>1</b> of the present invention, therefore, may be used to insert either a single stitch, or to insert a suture comprising a plurality of continuous stitches as a replacement method for a more tedious and time-consuming manual suturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">While a suturing device <b>1</b> having the separable suture cartridge <b>84</b> containing the suturing needle <b>102</b>, a pusher <b>9</b> comprising a cartridge holder <b>82</b> with the support arms <b>80</b>, a drive shaft assembly comprising the driver arm <b>130</b>, and an actuator handle <b>12</b> comprising the actuating trigger <b>16</b> and drive mechanism has been described, the entire suturing device <b>1</b> can be designed as a single unit which may be either reusable or disposed in its entirety after a single use.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It will thus be seen that the examples set forth above among those made apparent from the preceding description are efficiently attained in the suturing device of the present invention. Also, since certain changes may be made in the above description without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative, and not in a limiting sense.</p>
