<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a 371 national phase application of PCT/JP2008/053717 filed 25 Feb. 2008, claiming priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-051890 filed 1 Mar. 2007, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a packaging method using a packaging container including an outer case such as a cardboard box internally provided with a bag for containing contents such as resin material, and also relates to the packaging container.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Heretofore, for example, a material <b>100</b> is carried in a plant or factory in such a manner that the material <b>100</b> is packed in a bag <b>101</b> and contained in a cardboard box <b>102</b> which is an outer case as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cardboard box <b>102</b> is formed at its bottom with two pairs of gatefold flaps <b>103</b>. The flaps <b>103</b> are closed with a sealing adhesive tape or the like. The bag <b>101</b> is formed at its bottom with an opening <b>104</b>. The bag <b>101</b> is therefore folded to close the opening <b>104</b> and set in the cardboard box <b>102</b>. The bag <b>101</b> is provided with a holding part <b>105</b> at the top.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The contents packed in such a packaging container are usually taken out by manual works. Specifically, the cardboard box <b>102</b> is turned upside down, the adhesive tape is removed from the flaps <b>103</b>, the opening <b>104</b> is opened, and a worker takes out the content.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the case where the material <b>100</b> contained in the cardboard box <b>102</b> is carried in the plant or factory, it is inefficient to manually take out the materials <b>100</b> from the packaging containers one by one.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore conceivable that the worker opens the flaps <b>103</b> of the cardboard box <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> while grasping the holding part <b>105</b> to have the material <b>100</b> fall by its own weight. If the material <b>100</b> has a certain weight and the opening <b>104</b> is not sealed with adhesive tape or the like, the material <b>100</b> can push open the opening <b>104</b> and fall out of the bag <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">JP2002-225937A discloses a container including a container body <b>106</b> and a bag <b>107</b> joined to an edge of an open end of the container <b>106</b>, in which margarine <b>108</b> is filled, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The bag <b>107</b> has an open one end opening in the same position as the open end of the container body <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To release the margarine <b>108</b>, the container body <b>106</b> is turned upside down to bring the open end downward, and air holes formed in the bottom of the container body <b>106</b> are opened as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Thus, air enters the container body <b>106</b> through the air holes, peeling the bag <b>107</b> and allowing the margarine <b>108</b> to fall by its own weight as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the conventional packaging containers and methods have the following disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">(1) In the packaging container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, if the material <b>100</b> has high stickiness, an upward adhesive force A will occur between the bag <b>101</b> and the material <b>100</b> as shown in FIG. <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">If the adhesive force A is equal to or larger than the self weight B of the material <b>100</b> acting downward, the material <b>100</b> may not be separated from the bag <b>101</b> nor fall down. If the adhesive force A is smaller than but nearly equal to the self weight B, it takes long for the material <b>100</b> to be separated from the bag <b>101</b>, needing much time to fall down.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">(2) The packaging container of JP '937 allows even the margarine <b>108</b> having high stickiness to be easily separated or separated from the bag <b>107</b>. However, the edge of the bag <b>107</b> is joined to the open end of the container body <b>106</b> and thus the bag <b>107</b> could not cover over the margarine <b>108</b>. Thus, a lid is required for sealing the container.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and has an object to provide a packaging method capable of sealingly containing a high-adhesive material in a simple configuration and of easily separating the material from a bag of a packaging container, and to provide the packaging container.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">(1) To achieve the above objects, the present invention provides a packaging method comprising the steps of: setting a bag in which contents is packed, in an openable outer case provided with an opening flap; turning back part of the bag at fold portions so that the part of the bag having an open end is turned inside out; fixing at least part of the out-turned part as a fixing part to any part other than the bag; bringing inner surfaces of the bag at the fold portions into contact with each other, forming a contact portion, to seal the content; and placing the contact portion of the bag in correspondence with an openable part of the flap of the outer case.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">(2) Preferably, the packaging method (1) further comprises the step of fixing at least the part of the out-turned part to the outer case.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">(3) In the packaging method (1) or (2), preferably, at least two opposite surfaces of side surfaces of the outer case are formed with cutouts, and the bag is partially inserted in the cutouts to be fixed to the outer case.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">(4) In the packaging method (2) or (3), preferably, the fixing part of the bag is placed in a position to pull the out-turned part of the bag when the outer case is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">(5) Further, according to another aspect, the present invention provides a packaging container comprising: an openable outer case provided with an opening flap; and a bag with an open end for packaging contents in the outer case; wherein the bag is partially turned back at fold portions so that part of the bag having the open end is turned inside out, at least part of the out-turned part of the bag is fixed as a fixing part to any part other than the bag, and inner surfaces of the bag at the fold portions are placed into contact with each other, forming a contact portion, to seal the content, and the contact portion is placed in correspondence with an openable part of the flap of the outer case.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">(6) In the packaging container (5), preferably, at least the part of the out-turned part is fixed to the outer case.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">(7) In the packaging container (5) or (6), preferably, the outer case is formed with cutouts in at least two opposite surfaces of side surfaces of the outer case and the bag is partially inserted therein to be fixed to the outer case.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">(8) In the packaging container (6) or (7), preferably, the fixing part of the bag is placed in a position to pull the out-turned part of the bag when the outer case is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The operations and advantages of the above mentioned packaging method and packaging container will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The contents such as a high-adhesive material is sealingly packed in the bag and contained in the openable outer case such as a cardboard box. At that time, the bag is partially turned back at the fold portions so that the inner surfaces of the bag at the fold portions are placed in contact with each other, forming a contact portion, to sealingly hold the content. The contact portion of the bag is placed in correspondence with the openable part of the flap of the outer case.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Specifically, the inner surfaces of the bag at the fold portions are in contact with each other so that the bag covers over the content. The contact portion is placed in contact relation in such a manner that fold lines of the fold portions abut on each other or slightly overlap one on the other. Accordingly, the contents made from a high-adhesive material can stick to the bag. The bag thus seals the content.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The bag covers over the contents as above and the contact portion through which outside air may enter the bag is sealed by the bag. Thus, the contents can be contained in a sealed state. The contents in this state can be transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, the fold portions of the bag are placed in contact with each other to seal the content. When the size of the bag is appropriately selected, the bag can surely sealingly contain the contents even where the contents and the outer case are different in shape and size.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a place where the contents are to be used, the outer case is supported with the opening flaps downward so that the flaps are not opened and then is conveyed to a material feeding section. There only the outer case is retained and the flaps are made free, allowing the flaps of the outer case to begin to open by the weight of the content. Since the end portions of the bag are fixed to any parts other than the bag, the flaps of the outer case are opened while causing the bag covering the contents to be peeled from the content. When the flaps of the cardboard box are turned to about 90 degrees or more, the bag is peeled from the lower surface of the content. The contents will further fall down.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The end portions of the out-turned parts of the bag are fixed to the parts other than the bag. Accordingly, when the contents further fall down, the bag is left on the side of the outer case. The bag will be peeled from the contents in an opposite direction to the falling direction of the contents at an angle of about 180 degrees (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;180-degree opposite direction&#x201d;) to the sides of the content. The adhesive contents stick to the bag. However, when the bag is being peeled in the 180-degree opposite direction, a force against the local adhesive force acts on a portion to be peeled, thereby separating the contents and the bag. As a result, the contents will be separated from the bag and fall by its own weight.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In other words, when the outer case is opened downward, a reaction force occurs in a fixed portion of the bag against the weight of the contents and acts as a force to peel the bag from the content. Thus, the contents can be easily taken out.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Since the end portions of the out-turned parts of the bag are fixed to the outer case, any additional means for fixing and holding the bag is not required in facilities. Thus, there is no need for installing extra equipment, resulting in a cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The sides of the outer case are formed with cutouts in which the end portions of the bag can be inserted to fix the bag to the outer case. Accordingly, any other methods such as bonding and heat-welding are not required to fix the bag to the outer case.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the outer case is held with the opening flaps downward, the contents begin to fall by its own weight from the outer case. In this state, the bag comes peeled from the contents in the 180-degree opposite direction, a force to separate the bag from the outer case due to the adhesive force of the contents is decreased. Because of the cutouts formed in two opposite sides of the outer case, such force is further dispersed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Accordingly, even a simple configuration that the end portions of the bag are inserted in the cutouts formed in the sides of the outer case allows the bag to be removed or fixed to the outer case at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The part for fixing the bag is provided in a position to pull the end portions of the out-turned parts of the bag when the outer case is opened. Further, the outer case includes the gatefold flaps which can be opened/closed. Accordingly, when the contents contained in the outer case begins to fall by its own weight, for instance, the contents will push and open the flaps or the flaps will open by their own weight, generating a force to pull the bag rightward and leftward. Here, the position to pull the end portions of the out-turned parts of the bag by the flaps may be selected from a position in which the end portions of the bag are directly fixed to the flaps, a position in which the end portions of the bag are fixed to the sides of the outer case, and other positions.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The force to pull the bag rightward and leftward acts on the bag to be peeled from the content, allowing the contents to fall off the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the above manner, the part for fixing the bag is provided in the position to pull the end portions of the out-turned parts of the bag in opening the outer case, so that the contents packed in the bag of the outer case can be more easily taken out.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A detailed description of preferred embodiments of a packaging method and a packaging container embodying the present invention will now be given referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Firstly, a first embodiment of the packaging method and the packaging container will be described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a packing container <b>1</b> in which a resin material <b>15</b> is contained in an outer case <b>10</b> in the first embodiment. The packing container <b>1</b> includes the outer case <b>10</b> and a bag <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The outer case <b>10</b> is a rectangular parallelepiped case such as a paper cardboard box and a plastic corrugated box. The outer case <b>10</b> has double opening flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>on one side. The flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>can be opened like a gate and closed with their edges abutting on each other to cover the opening of the outer case <b>10</b>. The outer case <b>10</b> is attached with a handle <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> on a side (an upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) opposite to the side on which the closed flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the outer case <b>10</b>, the bag <b>11</b> is set along the inner wall of the outer case <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The bag <b>11</b> is partially turned back at fold portions <b>11</b><i>d </i>so that a part of the bag <b>11</b> with open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>is turned inside out, and the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> are inserted and held in slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>formed as cutouts in the sides of the outer case <b>10</b>. The bag <b>11</b> is retained at only the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the outer case <b>10</b>. When the bag <b>11</b> is partially turned in this manner, the out-turned part <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the bag <b>11</b> covers the flaps <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>are formed in four sides of the outer case <b>10</b> individually. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each slit <b>10</b><i>b </i>is a straight slit but may be a V-shaped cutout or other shapes to further prevent the bag <b>11</b> from slipping off.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the bag <b>11</b>, the resin material <b>15</b> is packed as contents. The resin material <b>15</b> in this state is an adhesive material such as a material for resin molding of a coil end of a stator of a motor. Accordingly, the resin material <b>15</b> packed in the bag <b>11</b> sticks to the inside of the bag <b>11</b>. The bag <b>11</b> is a multilayered polyolefin film having a high gas barrier property. Instead of the polyolefin material, any materials capable of preventing styrene gas generated from the resin material <b>15</b> from escaping to the outside may be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The resin material <b>15</b> packed in the bag <b>11</b> is contained in the outer case <b>10</b>. This outer case <b>10</b> is loaded with the opening flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward and then transferred and stored.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The resin material <b>15</b> is packed in the bag <b>11</b> and contained in the outer case <b>10</b>, that is, the resin material <b>15</b> is enclosed by the bag <b>11</b>. Then, the resin material <b>15</b> is sealed therein by its own weight and blocked from outside air. It is therefore unnecessary to close the bag <b>11</b> and the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the outer case <b>10</b> with an adhesive tape or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The following explanation will be given to the operations of the packaging method and packaging container in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic sectional view showing a state where the resin material <b>15</b> is packed in the outer case <b>10</b>. This outer case <b>10</b> in which the resin material <b>15</b> is contained, with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>being closed, is carried in a production line. In this state, the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the outer case <b>10</b> are placed at the bottom as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, so that the resin material <b>15</b> is pressed against a contact portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the bag <b>11</b> by its own weight.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bag <b>11</b> is illustrated as if it is spaced from the outer case <b>10</b> (the flaps <b>10</b><i>a</i>) for easy understanding. When the outer case <b>10</b> is put with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward, actually, the bag <b>11</b> is pressed against the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>by the weight of the resin material <b>15</b>. The contact portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the bag <b>11</b> seals the resin material <b>15</b> from the outside by the stickiness of the resin material <b>15</b> and its own weight.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The outer case <b>10</b> carried in the production line is put so that the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>are at the bottom and the handle <b>12</b> is on the top. The outer case <b>10</b> is lifted up with the handle <b>12</b> grasped by hand or mechanically, arms <b>20</b> are inserted under the outer case <b>10</b> to support the bottom thereof, preventing the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>from opening, and the outer case <b>10</b> is transferred to a predetermined place.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic sectional view showing a state where the arms <b>20</b> are removed from the bottom of the outer case <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic sectional view showing a state where the resin material <b>15</b> is falling off the outer case <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged view of a part of the resin material <b>15</b> and bag <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, showing how the bag <b>11</b> is peeled from the resin material <b>15</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic sectional view showing a state where the resin material <b>15</b> separated from the bag fully falls off the bag <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the outer case <b>10</b> is carried above a hopper for feeding the resin material <b>15</b> in an injection molding machine, the handle <b>12</b> is supported by a carrier device and the arms <b>20</b> are removed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">After the arms <b>20</b> are removed from the outer case <b>10</b>, the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>which are not particularly attached with the adhesive tape or the like, are allowed to easily open by the force of the resin material <b>15</b> falling down and the self weight of the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>are opened, the bag <b>11</b> covering the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>is caused to open outward by the flaps <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the bag <b>11</b> begins to be peeled, at the contact portion <b>11</b><i>b</i>, from the lower surface of the resin material <b>15</b>. Then, a downward force is given to the resin material <b>15</b> by the self weight thereof and therefore a force that pulls the bag <b>11</b> rightward and leftward in the figure acts on the contact portion <b>11</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the bag <b>11</b> can be peeled from the lower surface of the resin material <b>15</b> even if having high stickiness.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the arms <b>20</b> are removed, the resin material <b>15</b> is not supported from below and begins to fall together with the bag <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The resin material <b>15</b> having high stickiness as mentioned above is sticking to the inner surface of the bag <b>11</b>. Under the downward force of the resin material <b>15</b>, therefore, the bag <b>11</b> which is not supported by the inner surface of the outer case <b>10</b> is moved such that the portions covering the lower surface of the resin material <b>15</b> are peeled therefrom and the portions sticking to the side surfaces and upper surface of the resin material <b>15</b> fall partway together with the resin material <b>15</b> while separating from the inner surface of the outer case <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The bag <b>11</b> is fixedly held by the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>inserted in the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the outer case <b>10</b>. Accordingly, when the resin material <b>15</b> falls down partway, the bag <b>11</b> with the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>serving as a fixed end is pulled downward by the resin material <b>15</b>. At that time, a reaction force is generated in a direction opposite to the falling direction of the resin material <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Consequently, the resin material <b>15</b> and the bag <b>11</b> are gradually separated from each other at 180 degrees as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This separation begins with peeling of the bag from the lower surface of the resin material <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the resin material <b>15</b> is completely peeled and separated from the bag <b>11</b> and thus charged in the hopper not shown located under the resin material <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The bag <b>11</b> with the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>being inserted in the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the outer case <b>10</b> is held by a frictional force occurring between the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> and the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the outer case <b>10</b> without slipping off.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The following explanation will be given to the advantages of the packaging method and packaging container of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A first advantage is that the resin material <b>15</b> having relatively high stickiness can be easily separated from the bag <b>11</b> set in the outer case <b>10</b> in such a simple manner of only lifting up the outer case <b>10</b> with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward by use of the handle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the conventional method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the high adhesive material <b>100</b> would not fall depending on a balance between the adhesive force A and the self weight B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. On the other hand, in the present embodiment, the bag <b>11</b> is peeled from the resin material <b>15</b> in the 180-degree opposite direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, so that the resin material even if having the stickiness equal to that in the conventional method can be easily separated.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For instance, a simple trial calculation using the model shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows that it is conceivable that a tensile shear force is exerted on the bag because the self weight B acts in parallel with the adhesive force A. Assuming the weight of the resin material <b>100</b> is 15 kg, an approximate calculation based on the size of the outer case <b>102</b> and a result of sticking evaluation test of the resin material <b>100</b> to the bag <b>101</b> indicates that about 100 kgf is required to separate the resin material from the bag <b>101</b> set in the outer case <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The tensile shear force acts on a surface, i.e., the surface of the bag <b>101</b> to which the resin material <b>100</b> sticks. To separate the resin material <b>100</b> from the bag <b>101</b>, accordingly, a force about seven times the weight of the resin material <b>100</b> is required as indicated by the trial calculation. The resin material <b>100</b> could not be easily removed by its own weight from the bag <b>101</b> set in the outer case <b>102</b>. This requires a work of scraping the resin material <b>100</b> from the outer case <b>102</b> by hand or other troublesome works. In short, the work of taking the resin material <b>100</b> out of the outer case <b>102</b> could not be automated.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the method of the first embodiment, on the other hand, the peeling in the 180-degree opposite direction can be caused as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The bag <b>11</b> is pulled against the resin material <b>15</b> because the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>are fixed to the outer case <b>10</b>, so that the interfaces of the resin material <b>15</b> and the bag <b>11</b> are separated from each other from an end (the contact portion <b>11</b><i>b</i>). In this separating or peeling pattern, a force required to peel acts linearly. Specifically, the peeling occurs on each of the peripheral side surfaces of the resin material <b>15</b> contacting with the bag <b>11</b>, which indicates that a force of about 2 kgf is enough for the peeling.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The resin material <b>15</b> is likely to fall by its own weight and can be taken out from the bag <b>11</b> set in the outer case <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">This trial calculation was made without setting detailed conditions such as consideration of a frictional force and therefore may cause deviation from an actually required force. In an experiment by the applicant, however, the resin material <b>15</b> could be sufficiently removed by its own weight from the outer case <b>10</b>. The trial calculation indicates that, for taking out the resin material <b>15</b> from the bag <b>11</b>, the conventional model of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> requires a force about fifty times a force required by the model of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref> of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the first embodiment, the arms <b>20</b> pressing the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>are removed from the outer case <b>10</b> with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward, the resin material <b>15</b> sticking to the bag <b>11</b> is temporarily allowed to freely fall down. From the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the resin material <b>15</b> is allowed to nearly free fall, somewhat boosting the falling speed, even though the resin material <b>15</b> is influenced by for example resistance in deformation of the bag <b>11</b> and contact resistance against the outer case <b>10</b> in which the resin material <b>15</b> is contained. Accordingly, by not only the self weight of the resin material <b>15</b> but also the inertia force, the resin material <b>15</b> begins to separate from the bag <b>11</b>. Thus, a situation allowing easier separation is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If only the outer case <b>10</b> is put with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward, the resin material <b>15</b> can be taken out by its own weight from the outer case <b>10</b>. A work of taking the resin material <b>15</b> out of the outer case <b>10</b> can be automated.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the first embodiment, the resin material <b>15</b> is used for injection molding to injection mold a coil end of a motor. The weight of the resin material <b>15</b> is generally set at about 15 kg in view of circumstances such as transfer. The resin material <b>15</b> is also required to be supplied to the hopper of the injection molding machine at relatively frequent intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Such works are heavy labors to workers due to the weight of the resin material <b>15</b> and also require personnel costs. To reduce personnel costs and improve labor environment, automation has been demanded. According to the method of the first embodiment, such heavy labors are not required and a cost reduction can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A second advantage is that the outer case <b>10</b> is formed with two flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>and there is no particular need for sealing the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the bag <b>11</b>, so that the resin material <b>15</b> can be easily taken out.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The container body <b>106</b> shown in FIG. 14 of JP2002-225937A is formed with tapered side surfaces for facilitating separation of the margarine <b>108</b>. Such configuration requires a lid separate from the bag <b>107</b> for ensuring sealing property. Further, there is a case where an aluminum film or the like is adhered to the opening of the container body <b>106</b> to enhance the gas barrier property. In this case, the lid and the film have to be removed by hand before taking the margarine <b>108</b> out of the container body <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">On the other hand, according to the method of the first embodiment, the resin material <b>15</b> is sealed by its adhesive force in the bag <b>11</b>, so that the bag <b>11</b> and the outer case <b>10</b> are not particularly required to be sealed by the adhesive tape or the like. Thus, no additional lid and adhesive tape are needed and no work of removing the lid and adhesive tape is required in opening the outer case <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the outer case <b>10</b> with the resin material <b>15</b> contained as with the arrival state to a plant is carried into a production line and is held with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward, the resin material <b>15</b> can be easily taken out.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the case where a lid is separately provided or the lid is fixed with an adhesive tape, a work of opening the lid or removing the adhesive tape requires high personnel costs if a worker has to do such work. It is conceivable to open the lid or remove the adhesive tape mechanically, but an introduction cost of an opening device is expensive. According to the present embodiment, on the other hand, the outer case <b>10</b> is provided with the opening flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>which are closed with no adhesive tape. Thus, the personnel cost and the introduction cost of the opening device are not required, resulting in a cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A third advantage is that the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> are fixedly inserted in the slits <b>10</b><i>b</i>, so that no work is required to bond the bag <b>11</b> to around the opening of the outer case <b>10</b>. Since the resin material <b>15</b> can be separated from the bag <b>11</b> by the 180-degree peeling, only a small force will be exerted on the bag <b>11</b>. The aforementioned trial calculation estimates the load at about 2 kgf. Since this load is distributed to four side surfaces, each slit <b>10</b><i>b </i>receives a load of 0.5 kgf. Against such a level of load, it is sufficient to insert the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>in the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>to fix the bag <b>11</b> to the outer case <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">If the bag <b>11</b> is bonded to the outer case <b>10</b>, it is disadvantage at the time of reuse of the outer case <b>10</b> and further a work of removing adhesive or the like in recycling the bag <b>11</b> is required.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">With a configuration that the outer case <b>10</b> is formed with the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>in which the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> are inserted, the resin material <b>15</b> can be peeled in the 180-degree opposite direction to be separated from the bag <b>11</b>. Thus, no large force is exerted on the bag <b>11</b>, no work of bonding is required, and a cost reduction can be achieved, contributing to improvement of recyclability.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> are inserted from outside in the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the outer case <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the weight of the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>induces the bag <b>11</b> to be peeled from the resin material <b>15</b> when the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>are opened. The resin material <b>15</b> is allowed to freely fall down by a distance corresponding to the length of each flap <b>10</b><i>a</i>. When the bag <b>11</b> is to be peeled from the resin material <b>15</b> in the 180-degree opposite direction, a certain level of inertia force is added, thereby enabling peeling in shorter time.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Since the outer case <b>10</b> is configured as above, the side surfaces thereof are not needed to be tapered for facilitating the peeling of the bag <b>11</b>. The tapered side surfaces may contribute to a reduction in frictional force between the inner surface of the outer case <b>10</b> and the outer surface of the bag <b>11</b>. However, in view of storage space efficiency and producing easiness of the outer case <b>10</b>, the rectangular parallelepiped shape is advantageous in cost.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As described above in detail, the packaging method and the packaging container of the first embodiment can exhibit the following configuration, operations, and advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">(1) Specifically, the packaging container <b>1</b> includes the openable outer case <b>10</b> and the bag <b>11</b> set in the outer case <b>10</b> for containing the resin material <b>15</b>. The bag <b>11</b> is partially turned back and at least the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the out-turned part <b>11</b><i>c </i>are fixed as a fixing part to any part other than the bag <b>11</b>. The inner surfaces of the fold portions <b>11</b><i>d </i>of the bag <b>11</b> are placed in contact with each other, forming the contact portion <b>11</b><i>b</i>, to seal the resin material <b>15</b>. The contact portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>is placed in correspondence with the side of the outer case <b>10</b> having the flaps <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, a packaging method can be provided without needing any work of manually opening the outer case <b>10</b> carried in a plant and manually taking the resin material <b>15</b> out of the outer case <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">When the outer case <b>10</b> is placed with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward and then the supports are removed from the flaps <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the resin material <b>15</b> will fall by its own weight and thus can be easily taken out. The open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> are retained by the part other than the bag <b>11</b>. Therefore, when the resin material <b>15</b> is separated from the bag <b>11</b> set in the outer case <b>10</b>, a force is generated in the direction opposite the falling direction of the resin material <b>15</b>, causing the bag <b>11</b> to be peeled from the resin material <b>15</b> in the 180-degree opposite direction. This 180-degree peeling makes it possible to take out the resin material <b>15</b> by about one-fiftieth of the force needed in the prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Accordingly, the resin material <b>15</b> can be taken out of the bag <b>11</b> set in the outer case <b>10</b> by the self weight of the resin material <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">(2) In the above packaging method (1), the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the out-turned parts <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the bag <b>11</b> are fixed to the outer case <b>10</b>. When the outer case <b>10</b> is placed with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward, the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> fixed to the outer case <b>10</b> generate a force in a direction opposite to the falling direction of the resin material <b>15</b> when the resin material <b>15</b> begins to fall down. Thus, a packaging method can be provided to cause the 180-degree peeling of the bag <b>11</b> from the resin material <b>15</b>, thereby allowing the resin material <b>15</b> to be easily taken out.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">(3) In the packaging method (1) or (2), the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>are formed in at least two opposite surfaces of the side surfaces of the outer case <b>10</b> so that the bag <b>11</b> is partially inserted therein to be fixed to the outer case <b>10</b>. The bag <b>11</b> is not required to be fixed to the outer case <b>10</b> in any other manners such as bonding and heat-welding.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When the outer case <b>10</b> is put with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward, the resin material <b>15</b> begins to fall off the outer case <b>10</b> by its own weight. At that time, the bag <b>11</b> and the resin material <b>15</b> are separated in opposite directions 180 degrees. A force of the bag <b>11</b> tending to slip off the outer case <b>10</b> due to the adhesive force of the resin material <b>15</b> is decreased and further dispersed because of the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>formed in the two opposite surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Accordingly, even a simple configuration that the outer case <b>10</b> is formed with a cutout or slit in a side surface can prevent the bag <b>11</b> from slipping off the outer case <b>10</b>, thus allowing the bag <b>11</b> to be fixed to the outer case <b>10</b> in a costless manner.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">(4) The packaging container includes the openable outer case <b>10</b> and the bag <b>11</b> for containing the resin material <b>15</b> in the outer case <b>10</b>. The bag <b>11</b> is partially turned back at the fold portions <b>11</b><i>d </i>so that the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the out-turned part <b>11</b><i>c </i>are fixed as a fixing part to any part other than the bag <b>11</b>. The inner surface of the fold portions <b>11</b><i>d </i>of the bag <b>11</b> are placed in contact with each other to seal the resin material <b>15</b> and the contact portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>is placed in correspondence with the openable part of the outer case <b>10</b>, i.e., with the abutting edges of the flaps <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, a packaging container can be provided, with no need to manually open the outer case <b>10</b> when carried in a plant and manually take the resin material <b>15</b> out of the outer case <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">(5) In the packaging container (4), the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the out-turned part <b>11</b><i>d </i>of the bag <b>11</b> are fixed to the outer case <b>10</b>. When the outer case <b>10</b> is placed with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward, the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> fixed to the outer case <b>10</b> generates a force in a direction opposite to the falling direction of the resin material <b>15</b> when the resin material <b>15</b> begins to fall down. Thus, a packaging method can be provided to cause the 180-degree peeling of the bag <b>11</b> from the resin material <b>15</b>, thereby allowing the resin material <b>15</b> to be easily taken out.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">(6) In the packaging container (4) or (5), at least two opposite surfaces of the side surfaces of the outer case <b>10</b> are formed with the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>in which the bag <b>11</b> is partially inserted to be fixed to the outer case <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the bag <b>11</b> can be held in the outer case <b>10</b> in a simple manner without slipping off the outer case <b>10</b> when the resin material <b>15</b> is separated from the bag <b>11</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A second embodiment of the present invention will be described below. The configuration of the second embodiment is substantially identical to that of the first embodiment excepting the positions at which the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> are fixed to the outer case <b>10</b>. The following explanation is therefore made on differences from the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a sectional view of the outer case <b>10</b> of the second embodiment. The open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> set in the outer case <b>10</b> are fixed to the opening flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the outer case <b>10</b>. A fixing manner thereof may be achieved for example by inserting the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the bag <b>11</b> in cutouts formed as in the first embodiment or by using adhesive or a fixing member as needed. The outer case <b>10</b> has only two flaps <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the outer case <b>10</b> may supplementarily be formed with the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>in the side surfaces to allow the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>to be inserted in the slits <b>10</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The second embodiment has the above configuration and can exhibit the following operations and advantages. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view showing a state where the resin material <b>15</b> contained in the outer case <b>10</b> begins to fall down.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the outer case <b>10</b> of the second embodiment, as the resin material <b>15</b> begins to fall down, the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>are opened by the self weight of the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the falling force of the resin material <b>15</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. When the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>begin to open, the bag <b>11</b> is pulled to be peeled from the surface of the resin material <b>15</b> because of the end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>fixed to the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the outer case <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Such peeling may be caused by the fixing manner of the first embodiment. However, in the present embodiment in which the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>are fixed to the flaps <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the length of the bag <b>11</b> can be shortened with reduced allowance, thus more efficiently inducing the peeling of the bag <b>11</b> from the resin material <b>15</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">A third embodiment of the present invention will be described below. The configuration of the third embodiment is substantially identical to that of the first embodiment excepting the configuration of the outer case <b>10</b>. The following explanation is therefore made on differences from the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view of the outer case <b>10</b> of the third embodiment. The outer case <b>10</b> includes carrying holes <b>13</b> in a surface opposite the surface formed of the closed flaps <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Each hole <b>13</b> can be a simple hole and is formed in the outer case <b>10</b>, instead of the handle <b>12</b> in the first embodiment. The holes <b>13</b> may be arranged appropriately at four corners or two diagonally opposing positions in one surface of the outer case <b>10</b>. The size of each hole <b>13</b> may be determined according to the size of a jig for carrying the outer case <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The third embodiment has the above configuration and can exhibit the following operations and advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The third embodiment can provide the same advantages as those in the first embodiment even without the handle <b>12</b>. In the third embodiment, the outer case <b>10</b> can be lifted up by inserting a hook in each hole <b>13</b>. Thus, there is no need for attaching an additional component such as the handle <b>12</b> to the outer case <b>10</b> and the equivalent advantages can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">If the outer case <b>10</b> is provided with a protrusion such as the handle <b>12</b>, the protrusion may become an obstacle in transfer or storage of the outer case <b>10</b> when placed with the surface including the holes <b>13</b> downward. In the present embodiment, on the other hand, the holes <b>13</b> are directly formed in the outer case <b>10</b>, so that the holes <b>13</b> will not protrude as obstacles.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">A fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described below. The configuration of the fourth embodiment is substantially identical to that of the first embodiment excepting the configuration of the outer case <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the fourth embodiment, different from the first embodiment in which the bag <b>11</b> is partially inserted in the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>from outside, the bag <b>11</b> is partially inserted in the slits <b>10</b><i>b </i>from inside of the outer case <b>10</b>. Accordingly, only the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>are exposed outside of the outer case <b>10</b> when the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>are closed. Even though the bag <b>11</b> is made of a material thinner than the outer case <b>10</b>, the bag <b>11</b> will be less damaged if only small portions of the bag <b>11</b> are exposed outside.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the present embodiment, different from the first embodiment, the bag <b>11</b> will not be pulled at the same time when the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>are opened after the outer case <b>10</b> is placed with the flaps <b>10</b><i>a </i>downward and any supports are removed from the flaps <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Since the open end portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>are fixed to the outer case <b>10</b>, the contact portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>receives the weight of the resin material <b>15</b> and thus the bag <b>11</b> begins to be peeled from the resin material <b>15</b> from the contact portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>in a 180-degree opposite direction. Consequently, the bag <b>11</b> is peeled from the resin material <b>15</b>, allowing the resin material <b>15</b> to fall by its own weight to be taken out of the outer case <b>10</b>.</p>
