<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the physical sciences, and, more particularly, to the field of heterojunction solar cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Direct gap III-V semiconductor materials have strong absorption properties and have been found to be suitable for high efficiency solar cell applications, particularly portable applications. Small thicknesses of these materials, in the order of a few microns, are sufficient for absorbing a large portion of the solar spectrum. Conventional techniques for making high efficiency III-V solar cells can involve the epitaxial growth of relatively complicated structures using MOCVD (metalorganic chemical vapor deposition) and MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) systems. Despite the high efficiency of epitaxially grown III-V solar cells, the high cost of epitaxy presents challenges to the production of cost-competitive III-V solar cells for terrestrial applications.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">GaAs has a relatively wide energy gap (1.4 eV) and in turn offers a high open circuit voltage. Such properties make it suitable for single junction solar cells. GaAs further exhibits high absorption of the solar spectrum that can be converted to a high short circuit current.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Principles of the invention provide a heterojunction III-V solar cell structure including an interlayer that is effective in reducing the contribution of the surface recombination in the dark current within the structure and improving the open circuit voltage. Techniques for fabricating such a structure are further provided. In accordance with a first aspect, a method is provided that includes obtaining a base layer comprising one of gallium arsenide and In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>1-y</sub>As where y&#x3c;x, having a first doping type, forming an epitaxial In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As layer on the base layer where 0.01&#x3c;x&#x3c;1 having the first doping type, forming an intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon semiconductor layer on the epitaxial In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As layer, and forming a doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer on the intrinsic semiconductor layer. The method may further include forming a transparent conductive layer on the amorphous hydrogenated silicon layer. The intrinsic semiconductor layer can contain germanium and carbon atoms and can be comprised of a plurality of intrinsic semiconductor layers, one or more of which may include germanium and carbon atoms. The doping type of the hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer formed on the intrinsic semiconductor layer may be the opposite type of the base doping type if used to form an emitter and can be the same type as the base if used to form a back surface field (BSF).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another aspect, an exemplary heterojunction III-V solar cell structure includes a base layer comprising gallium arsenide, an intrinsic semiconductor layer such as intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon, an epitaxial In<sub>1x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interlayer between and interfacing with the base layer and the intrinsic semiconductor layer, wherein 0.01&#x3c;x&#x3c;1.0, a doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer on the intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer, and a transparent conductive layer above the doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer. The base layer and the In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interlayer have a first doping type while the doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer has a second doping type opposite from the first doping type if used to form the emitter. However, if it is used to form a back-surface field, the doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer has the first doping type as well.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a still further aspect, a heterojunction III-V solar cell structure that includes a base layer comprising one of GaAs and In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>1-y</sub>As where y&#x3c;x, an epitaxial In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interlayer between and interfacing with the base layer and the intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer, wherein 0.01&#x3c;x&#x3c;1.0. The base layer and the In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interlayer have the same doping type. A doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer is on the intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer and a transparent conductive layer is on the doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As used herein, &#x201c;facilitating&#x201d; an action includes performing the action, making the action easier, helping to carry the action out, or causing the action to be performed. Thus, by way of example and not limitation, instructions executing on one processor might facilitate an action carried out by instructions executing on a remote processor, by sending appropriate data or commands to cause or aid the action to be performed. For the avoidance of doubt, where an actor facilitates an action by other than performing the action, the action is nevertheless performed by some entity or combination of entities.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One or more embodiments of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of a computer program product including a tangible computer readable recordable storage medium with computer usable program code for performing the method steps indicated. Furthermore, one or more embodiments of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of a system (or apparatus) including a memory, and at least one processor that is coupled to the memory and operative to perform exemplary method steps. Yet further, in another aspect, one or more embodiments of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of means for carrying out one or more of the method steps described herein; the means can include (i) hardware module(s), (ii) software module(s), or (iii) a combination of hardware and software modules; any of (i)-(iii) implement the specific techniques set forth herein, and the software modules are stored in a tangible computer-readable recordable storage medium (or multiple such media).</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">Heterojunction III-V solar cell structures based on a-Si:H/III-V heterostructures offer a path for low-cost, high efficiency PV (photovoltaic) technology when implemented in conjunction with a layer transfer technique. The use of a-Si:H as an intrinsic layer (i-a:Si:H) can significantly improve the surface passivation of GaAs. US Pub. No. 2010/0307572 entitled &#x201c;Heterojunction III-V Photovoltaic Cell Fabrication&#x201d;, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, discloses techniques for forming single and double heterojunction III-V PV cells.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> show single and double heterojunction solar cell structures <b>10</b>, <b>30</b>, respectively, that can be produced using techniques disclosed in US Pub. No. 2010/0307572. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the structure <b>10</b> includes a base layer <b>12</b> comprising a III-V substrate that may be n-type or p-type. An optional BSF (back surface field) layer <b>14</b> is formed on the base layer. A doped amorphous hydrogenated silicon layer <b>18</b> is formed on an intrinsic amorphous silicon layer <b>16</b> on the base layer <b>12</b>. The doped amorphous hydrogenated silicon layer <b>18</b> may have a doping type opposite from the doping type of the base layer. A transparent layer <b>20</b> such as a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) is formed above and preferably on the amorphous silicon layer <b>18</b>. Front metal contacts including fingers and bus bars (not shown) may be formed on the transparent layer. Although, the i-a:Si:H layer <b>16</b> improves surface passivation of a GaAS base layer, the relatively high interface trap density at the a-Si/GaAs heterointerface leads to a significantly high dark current, degrading the open circuit voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">The double-heterojunction structure <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> includes two base/i-a:Si:H interfaces and two doped, amorphous hydrogenated silicon layers <b>18</b>, <b>32</b>. If the doped a-Si:H layer is used to form an emitter, its doping type is opposite to that (n-type or p-type) of the base layer. If used to form a BSF, its doping type would be the same as the base layer. As discussed above with respect to the single-heterojunction structure <b>10</b>, high interface state density limits the open circuit voltage. In these particular examples, such voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) may be in the range of 500-600 mV.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a structure <b>40</b> comprising a portion of the structures <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> and is provided for purposes of comparison to the embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a corresponding portion of a solar cell structure <b>50</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, which may comprise part of a single or double-heterojunction solar cell structure. The structure <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an epitaxial In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interlayer <b>52</b> as described further below. This interlayer <b>52</b> is formed on the base layer. Such an interlayer <b>52</b> helps reduce the contribution of a dark current component due to surface recombination at the heterointerface and improves V<sub>oc</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">The structure <b>50</b> of the exemplary embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interlayer <b>52</b> that facilitates solar cell efficiency. The In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interlayer can be grown epitaxially using conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods such as metal organic CVD (MOCVD) or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).

The transparent conductive layer <b>20</b> in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may comprise TCO's such as indium tin oxide (ITO), tin oxide (SnO), fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>:F) or aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al). Transparent conducting films such as carbon nanotube-based films and graphene-based films may alternatively be employed to form this transparent conductive layer <b>20</b>. These examples are to be considered exemplary as opposed to limiting. The thickness of the transparent conductive layer may vary depending on the type of transparent conductive material employed as well as the technique used in forming this layer. Typically, and in one exemplary embodiment, the thickness of the transparent conductive layer <b>20</b> is between 20-500 nm. Other thicknesses, including those less than 20 nm and/or greater than 500 nm, can alternatively be employed. The preferred thickness of the transparent conductive layer for minimizing reflection from the surface of Si is in the range of 70-110 nm for a TCO. Nanotube and graphene-based films may in the range of 2-50 nm. The transparent conductive layer is typically formed using a deposition process such as sputtering or CVD. Examples of CVD processes usable for a number of types of such layers include APCVD, LPCVD, PECVD, MOCVD and combinations thereof.

<p id="p-0025" num="0028">The intrinsic amorphous hydrogenated silicon semiconductor layer <b>16</b> formed on the In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interlayer lacks a crystal structure with long range order. This layer can be referred to as an intrinsic semiconductor or undoped or i-type semiconductor, that is a substantially pure semiconductor without any significant electrical dopant impurity present. The number of charge carriers in the intrinsic semiconductor is determined by the properties of the material itself rather than the amount of impurities, i.e. dopants. The intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous semiconductor layer <b>16</b> provided in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is formed using any suitable physical or chemical vapor deposition process including appropriate source materials. In one embodiment, the intrinsic hydrogenated semiconductor layer is deposited in a process chamber containing a semiconductor precursor source gas and a carrier gas including hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms within the carrier gas are incorporated into the deposited material to form the intrinsic hydrogenated semiconductor containing material of the intrinsic semiconductor layer. The intrinsic semiconductor layer <b>16</b> may contain germanium and carbon atoms. The germanium and carbon distribution can be graded or constant throughout the layer. The intrinsic semiconductor layer <b>16</b> can be a multi-layer structure comprising a combination of layers, one or more of which contain graded or ungraded germanium and carbon and one or more of which do not contain these elements.</p>

The improved surface passivation using the epitaxial In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interlayer is believed to be due to lower density of active interface traps at the i-a:Si:H/In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interface compared to that of an i-a:Si:H/GaAs interface and additional field-effect passivation at the In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As/GaAs interface due to the band discontinuity.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides a comparison of SRV (surface recombination velocity) for In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As (specifically In<sub>0.53</sub>Ga<sub>0.47</sub>As) vs. GaAs. The reduction of the SRV at the heterointerface using the epitaxial In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As interlayer is believed attributable to the more forgiving nature of In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As, which is easier to passivate as compared to GaAs and the field effect induced passivation due to the band discontinuity at the In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As/GaAs interface. Prior to the deposition of the i-a-Si:H layer <b>16</b>, the native oxide should be removed from the surface of the III-V layer. III-V materials are prone to rapid oxidation in the presence of oxygen. To prevent the formation of the native oxide, the oxide desorption and the subsequent processing step, i.e. deposition of i-a-Si:H, should be done in situ using an ultra high vacuum (UHV) system. Solar cell processing costs may, however, necessitate ex situ desorption of the native oxide. As a result, the formation of some native oxide during sample transfer in air for i-a-Si:H deposition can be inevitable. If some native oxide is formed during the sample transfer, the SRV between the III-V material and its native oxide plays a role in the total dark current of the structure.</p>
