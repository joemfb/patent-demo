<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate comprising a surface-treated metal foil, which allows the production of a metal-wiring polyimide resin substrate exhibiting excellent adhesiveness to an anisotropic conductive film (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;ACF&#x201d;) and an adhesive such as an epoxy resin used for bonding an IC chip to the film; and a process for producing the same. The present invention particularly relates to a metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate which allows the production of a metal-wiring polyimide resin substrate which may be used for high-performance electronic devices, especially for a flexible wiring substrate with high density wiring, which may be suitably used for reduction in size and weight of an electronic device, a build-up circuit board, an IC carrier tape, or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A surface-treated copper foil has a surface treated by roughening, rust-proofing or the like in order to improve properties such as adhesive strength to a polyimide resin substrate for a copper-clad laminated sheet. A roughened surface of a surface-treated copper foil is bonded to a polyimide resin substrate to form a copper-clad laminated sheet. Then, a wiring pattern is formed by etching the surface-treated copper foil of the copper-clad laminated sheet, to provide a printed wiring board. On the printed wiring board are mounted electronic components, to provide a circuit board. In this process, electronic components are usually connected to wirings by soldering or wire bonding. Alternatively, an &#x201c;anisotropic conductive film&#x201d; (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;ACF&#x201d;) is sometimes employed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An electronic component mounted on the circuit board must be connected to a wiring with adequate mounting strength for the prevention of the detachment of the component from the printed wiring board during use. The mounting strength is ensured by a soldering area in a soldering method or final resin sealing in a wire bonding method. Meanwhile, in an ACF mounting method, an ACF consisting of a resin component and conductive particles is used to electrically connect an electronic component to a wiring. However, the conductive particles contained in the ACF have no adhesion. Accordingly, due to the presence of the conductive particles, an area where an ACF, an electronic component, and a wiring are laminated may not have adequate adhesion strength. In a circuit board on which electronic components are mounted with an ACF, mounting strength of the electronic components depends on adhesion strength between &#x201c;a surface of a polyimide resin substrate which is exposed by removing a surface-treated copper foil by etching&#x201d; (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;resin base material surface&#x201d;) and the ACF.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1 discloses a copper-clad laminated sheet comprising a copper foil as a conductive layer which is bonded to a flexible insulating layer and contains 0.1 to 10 at % of nickel on the surface bonded to the insulating layer; and a flexible printed wiring board comprising the same. Patent Document 1 explains that when electric connection is established using an ACF, the copper-clad laminated sheet and the flexible printed wiring board have excellent adhesiveness to the ACF and electric and physical connectivity with the ACF. The flexible printed wiring board is produced by selectively etching the copper foil such that nickel remains in an area where the insulating layer is exposed. Specifically, Examples of Patent Document 1 show that a two-layer flexible printed wiring board comprising a surface-treated copper foil which has a thickness of 12 &#x3bc;m and the surface bonded to the insulating layer with a surface roughness Ra of 1.0 &#x3bc;m exhibits excellent rust-prevention properties, etching properties, connectivity of a laser via hole, and adhesiveness to an ACF when the copper foil contains 0.1 to 10 at % of nickel on the surface bonded to the insulating layer as determined by XPS.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 2 discloses a process for producing a metal wiring board comprising providing a metal foil-heat resistant resin substrate laminate wherein a metal foil is laminated on a polyimide resin substrate, and the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate is treated with at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ni, Cr, Co, Zn, Sn and Mo, and alloys containing at least one of these metals; forming a metal wiring on the resin substrate; and then cleaning the surface of the resin substrate on which the metal wiring is formed with an etching solution capable of removing the metal used in the surface treatment so as to improve adhesiveness of the resin substrate surface.

<p id="p-0041" num="0045">A metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate of the present invention is excellent in adherence and adhesiveness of the resin substrate surface between metal wirings which is exposed by removing the metal (resin base material surface). When an adhesive organic material layer is directly laminated on the resin substrate surface exposed by removing the metal, excellent adherence and adhesiveness between the organic material layer and the substrate surface may be achieved. Therefore, when the adhesive organic material layer acts as at least one of a conductive layer (for example, an anisotropic conductive layer etc.), an insulating layer, a protective layer (for example, a solder resist layer etc.), an adhesion layer, a sealing layer, and a seal layer, for example, improved reliability may be achieved. For example, a metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate of the present invention may exhibit excellent adherence and adhesiveness of a polyimide film surface to a material adhered thereto such as an epoxy resin and an anisotropic conductive film, and therefore an ACF may be bonded to a metal-wiring polyimide resin substrate with improved reliability, and an IC chip may be bonded to a metal-wiring polyimide resin substrate via such an adhesive with improved reliability.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0052">A surface roughness (Rzjis) of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate is defined as an average value of 20 measured value of ten-point average roughness, which is specified by JIS standards, of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0053">In the present invention, a surface roughness (Rzjis) of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate has the upper limit of 3.0 &#x3bc;m. In the present invention, as described later, metal particles, preferably substantially spherical metal particles (roughening particles) may be formed on the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate by roughening treatment. When a surface roughness (Rzjis) of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate is 3.0 &#x3bc;m or less, fine metal particles as roughening particles are formed and stuck on the surface of the metal foil by electrolysis without extremely high concentration of current, and there are very few metal particles deposited on each other, and thus no or very few extraordinarily-protruding electro-deposited roughening particles are formed on the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate. Accordingly, a surface-treated metal foil, preferably a surface-treated copper foil having a surface to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate with a surface roughness (Rzjis) of 3.0 &#x3bc;m or less may be suitable for the production of a fine-pitch printed wiring board. Furthermore, a metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate which comprises a metal foil having a surface to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate with a surface roughness (Rzjis) of 3.0 &#x3bc;m or less may exhibit excellent adherence of the surface of the polyimide resin substrate, which is exposed by removing the metal foil, for example, by etching, to an adhesive organic material layer.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0054">When the surface roughness (Rzjis) of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate is 2.5 &#x3bc;m or less, the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate may have excellent filling characteristics between the polyimide resin substrate and the metal foil, resulting in improvements in reliability of the wiring board. In addition, a metal foil having a surface to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate with a surface roughness (Rzjis) of 2.5 &#x3bc;m or less may be suitably used for the production of a printed wiring board wherein fine wiring is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0055">In the light of stable peel strength between the polyimide resin substrate and the metal foil, a surface roughness (Rzjis) of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate is preferably 1.3 &#x3bc;m to 3.0 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 1.4 &#x3bc;m to 2.5 &#x3bc;m, particularly preferably 1.6 &#x3bc;m to 2.4 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0056">In the present invention, the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate has a surface area ratio (B), which is calculated as a ratio [A/6550] of &#x201c;a surface area of a two-dimensional region with a surface area of 6550 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>which is determined by a laser method (three-dimensional area: A &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>)&#x201d; to &#x201c;the area of the two-dimensional region (6550 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>)&#x201d;, of 1.25 to 2.50, preferably 1.40 to 2.30, more preferably 1.60 to 2.20, further preferably 1.70 to 2.10. The surface area ratio (B) is an alternative index of the contact area between the surface-treated metal foil and the polyimide resin substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0057">A metal foil of a metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate preferably has the largest contact area with the polyimide resin substrate with the smallest amount of roughening particles, when the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate is used for the formation of fine wiring by etching. In addition, roughening particles preferably have a substantially spherical shape to provide stable adhesion strength by an anchor effect. When roughening particles have a substantially spherical shape, a &#x201c;replica having a shape of roughening particles&#x201d; (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;replica&#x201d; for short) which is formed in the resin base material surface of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate has a substantially spherical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0058">When an electronic component is mounted on the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate using an adhesive organic material layer (an ACF and an adhesive such as an epoxy resin), the replica is filled with the resin component in the adhesive organic material layer, which means the adhesive organic material layer takes the shape of a roughening particle formed on the surface of the metal foil bonded to the polyimide resin substrate. Accordingly, the shape of a roughening particle formed on the surface of the metal foil bonded to the polyimide resin substrate has an effect on adhesion strength between the resin base material surface of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate (the surface of the polyimide resin substrate which is exposed by removing the metal foil by etching) and the adhesive organic material layer in all cases including in a case where chemical adhesiveness never contributes to adhesion strength in the contact area between the resin base material surface and the adhesive organic material layer, in a case where chemical adhesiveness hardly contributes to adhesion strength in the contact area, and in a case where chemical adhesiveness contributes to adhesion strength in the contact area. The shape of the replica is preferably fine and minute in high density for stable adhesion strength or adhesiveness between the resin base material surface and the adhesive organic material layer. In other words, it may be ideal that the fine roughening particles are uniformly formed on the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate by roughening treatment. Accordingly, a surface area ratio (B) is important, which reflects the shape and the state of the roughening particle, and is an alternative index of the contact area between the metal foil and the polyimide resin substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0059">The shape of the roughening particle formed by roughening treatment, and the state of the metal foil surface considerably vary, depending on the roughening treatment conditions. When the B value of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate after roughening treatment is less than 1.25, the distribution of the roughening particles formed by roughening treatment is more likely to be uneven and/or the roughening particles is more likely to have a shape (for example, a conical shape, a hemispheric shape, or the like) which does not provide a sufficient anchor effect. In such cases, adequate adhesion strength between the resin base material surface of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate and the adhesive organic material layer may not be achieved, and adhesion strength and the like may not be uniform more frequently. Thus, it is not preferred that the B value is less than 1.25.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0060">The B value is particularly preferably 1.60 or more because adhesion strength between the resin base material surface of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate and the adhesive organic material layer may be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0061">When the B value is more than 2.5, the roughening particles formed may vary greatly in particle size, resulting in the state in which smaller particles are hidden among larger particles. When the roughening particles have widely varying size, it may be difficult to reduce an over-etching time in forming a wiring by etching. Additionally, the resin component in the adhesive organic material layer may less satisfactorily fill the replica formed in the resin base material surface of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate. Thus, it is not preferred that the B value is more than 2.5.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0062">Therefore, the B value is preferably 1.25 to 2.50, more preferably 1.40 to 2.30, further preferably 1.60 to 2.20, particularly preferably 1.70 to 2.10, which means that the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate has a shape to provide excellent adhesion strength between the resin base material surface of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate and the adhesive organic material layer, and to exhibit improved adherence of the surface of the metal foil to the polyimide resin substrate and excellent chemical resistance such as resistance to a chemical agent used for substrate cleaning and substrate processing, for example, metal plating such as tin plating.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0063">As for roughening treatment of a metal foil, there will be briefly described a technique for forming and attaching fine metal particles (roughening particles) on a surface of an untreated metal foil (unroughened metal foil).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0064">Substantially spherical metal roughening particles may be formed by electrolytic plating or electroless plating, for example. In the case of electrolytic plating, roughening particles may be formed by metal plating in two steps; specifically, by forming a core of a particle on a surface of an untreated metal foil (unroughened metal foil) in the first step, and providing firmer adhesion of the core to the untreated metal foil and growing the core in the second step.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0065">There will be described an example of a process for plating a copper foil with copper as an example of metal plating for the formation of roughening particles.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0066">In the first step, copper particle cores are formed on a surface of an untreated copper foil by electrolysis under the burnt plating conditions wherein a electrolyte solution containing 10 g/L to 25 g/L of copper, 50 g/L to 150 g/L of free sulfuric acid, and optionally an additive such as gelatin as a copper sulfate-based electrolyte solution is used, the electrolyte solution temperature is 15&#xb0; C. to 30&#xb0; C., the untreated copper foil acts as a cathode, and the cathode current density is 20 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>to 50 A/dm<sup>2</sup>. Subsequently, in the second step, roughening particles in the desired shape are formed by plating the copper particle cores with copper under the conditions wherein a electrolyte solution containing 45 g/L to 100 g/L of copper and 50 g/L to 150 g/L of free sulfuric acid as a copper sulfate-based electrolyte solution is used, the electrolyte solution temperature is 30&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C., and the cathode current density is 30 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>to 60 A/dm<sup>2</sup>, whereby the copper particle cores are covered with copper to smooth out and give a desired shape to them.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0067">In the present invention, it is preferred that a surface of an untreated metal foil such as an untreated copper foil to be used, which is to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate, has a surface roughness (Rzjis) of less than 1.0 &#x3bc;m before surface roughening. In addition, a ratio [b/a] of the surface area after surface roughening (three-dimensional area: b &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>) to the surface area before surface roughening (three-dimensional area: a &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>) of a two-dimensional region with a surface area of 6550 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>which is determined by a laser method is preferably in the range of 1.20 to 2.50, more preferably 1.40 to 2.40, further preferably 1.65 to 2.30, particularly preferably 1.70 to 2.20.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0068">As described above, an untreated metal foil (unroughened metal foil) preferably has a surface roughness (Rzjis) of less than 1.0 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 0.9 &#x3bc;m or less, further preferably 0.8 &#x3bc;m or less, before surface roughening. An untreated metal foil (unroughened metal foil) having a surface roughness (Rzjis) of less than 1.0 &#x3bc;m is used so as to prevent the formation of roughening particles predominantly in an extraordinarily-protruding part, an uneven part, and the like, which results in the local formation of roughening particles by roughening treatment. It is preferred that an untreated metal foil (unroughened metal foil) has a smooth and flat surface, which is to be roughened.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0069">Meanwhile, conventional copper foils used for a printed wiring board, which are not used in the present invention, are electrolytic copper foils having a deposition surface which is treated by surface roughening. The deposition surface of the electrolytic copper foil has a shape in which copper is deposited in the shape of a mountain or a cone; and the deposition surface has a surface roughness (Rzjis) of 2 &#x3bc;m or more before surface roughening. When such a deposition surface of an electrolytic copper foil is subjected to surface roughening, larger roughening particles are formed on the apex of the cone of the deposition surface and roughening particles are hardly formed on the base and edge of the cone. Thus, when the surface roughness (Rzjis) is 1.0 &#x3bc;m or more, roughening particles are more predominantly formed on a protrusion and the like by roughening treatment, which results in the occurrence of an extraordinary protrusion, or an extraordinarily-protruding part. When the surface roughness (Rzjis) exceeds the above upper limit, the deposition surface frequently has undulations and/or irregularities of the surface which is observed with a scanning electron microscope.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0070">When the ratio [b/a] of the surface area after surface roughening (three-dimensional area: b &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>) to the surface area before surface roughening (three-dimensional area: a &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>) as described above is less than 1.20, the surface is not uniformly and satisfactorily roughened, and substantially spherical roughening particles are not formed; therefore an adequate anchor effect may not be achieved by the surface roughening. In such cases, a resin base material surface of a metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate comprising such a metal foil may not exhibit adequate adherence to a resin component in an adhesive organic material layer. When the ratio [b/a] is more than 2.50, the surface is excessively roughened, and the roughening particles formed may vary greatly in particle size, and/or the roughening particles may not be deposited in a fine state, and/or the roughening particle may be massive, and not substantially spherical in shape. In such cases, a resin base material surface of a metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate comprising such a metal foil may not exhibit stable adherence to a resin component in an adhesive organic material layer due to less uniform anchor effect.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0071">In the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate of the present invention, the metal foil has a surface to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate in which a chromium content per unit area of the two-dimensional region is 2.0 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>or more. In other words, not less than 2.0 mg of chromium is present in 1 m<sup>2 </sup>of the two-dimensional region of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate. Chromium is a rust inhibitor component, which is widely used for rust-proofing a surface-treated copper foil for a printed wiring board. Chromium is a passive metal, which forms an oxygen-containing passive film on the surface thereof, and has high corrosion resistance. Therefore, a printed wiring board having excellent chemical resistance may be obtained when using a surface-treated metal foil such as a surface-treated copper foil which has a chromium component on a surface to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0072">When the chromium content per unit area of the two-dimensional region is 2.0 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>or more, a chromium passive film adequately covers the surface of the metal foil such as a copper foil which is to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate; therefore stable adhesiveness between the metal foil and the polyimide resin substrate may be achieved, and adhesiveness of the resin base material surface of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate, which is exposed by etching, to an adhesive organic material layer may be improved. When the chromium content per unit area of the two-dimensional region is less than 2.0 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, neither adhesiveness between the polyimide resin substrate and the surface-treated metal foil in the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate nor adhesiveness of the resin base material surface of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate, which is exposed by etching, to an adhesive organic material layer may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0073">Meanwhile, in a typical chromate treatment process used for the production of surface-treated copper foils, the upper limit of chromium content is approximately 7.0 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>due to the composition of the chromate treatment solution, and the like. However, when an excessive amount of chromium is present on or in a surface of a metal foil such as a copper foil which is to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate, chromium may remain on the resin base material surface, depending on the etching conditions for forming a wiring. Accordingly, and also in view of migration resistance, a chromium content per unit area of the two-dimensional region of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate is preferably 2.2 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>to 6.0 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 2.5 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>to 5.0 mg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0074">The term &#x201c;chromium content&#x201d; as used herein refers to the amount of chromium both in a case where chromium is present alone and in a case where chromium is present in combination with other rust inhibitor components. Examples of the combination of rust inhibitor components include combinations of a zinc rust inhibitor, a brass rust inhibitor, a zinc-nickel alloy rust inhibitor, a zinc-cobalt alloy rust inhibitor, or the like, and chromate or chromium. The term &#x201c;chromium content of a surface of a metal foil to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate&#x201d; as used herein refers to the amount of chromium which is present in the side of the metal foil to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate. The metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate of the present invention may comprise a layer containing another rust inhibitor component, for example, between the metal foil and the layer containing chromium (hereinafter, also referred to as &#x201c;chromium layer&#x201d;). The chromium content, or the amount of chromium means the amount of chromium atom.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0075">A chromium component may be deposited on a surface of a metal foil such as a copper foil (surface to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate) by a chromate treatment process, for example. One example of the chromate treatment processes is electrolysis in which a chromate treatment bath containing 0.5 g/L to 2 g/L of CrO<sub>3 </sub>is used, the electrolyte solution temperature is 15&#xb0; C. to 35&#xb0; C., and the cathode current density is 0.2 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>to 4 A/dm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0076">Furthermore, in the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate of the present invention, the total amount of nickel and zinc present in 1 m<sup>2 </sup>of the two-dimensional region of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate is preferably 40 mg or more, more preferably 40 mg to 100 mg, further preferably 42 mg to 90 mg, further preferably 45 mg to 80 mg, particularly preferably 48 mg to 70 mg. When the total amount of nickel and zinc as rust inhibitor components is less than 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, the nickel-zinc alloy layer may not adequately cover the surface of the metal foil in some parts, and adhesion strength or adhesiveness between the polyimide resin substrate and the metal foil in the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate may not be improved. 40 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of nickel-zinc alloy is required for covering a completely flat ideal plane with a nickel-zinc alloy layer with a thickness of about 40 &#x212b; (about 4 nm). When nickel-zinc alloy is used in an amount sufficient to cover an ideal plane with a nickel-zinc alloy layer with a thickness of 40 &#x212b;, substantially all of the roughened surface, in which roughening particles are formed on a smooth surface of a metal foil, including the surfaces of the roughening particles, may be two-dimensionally covered with a nickel-zinc alloy, so long as the fine and similarly-shaped roughening particles are formed. Meanwhile, when the total amount of nickel and zinc is more than 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, it may be difficult to remove the nickel-zinc alloy layer with a copper etchant solution, and therefore undesired nickel-zinc alloy may remain after etching. Thus, it is preferred that the total amount of nickel and zinc is 100 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>or less.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0077">In the present invention, nickel and zinc are formed as a nickel-zinc alloy layer. The nickel-zinc alloy layer to be formed may preferably have the following composition.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0078">The nickel-zinc alloy layer may preferably contain 65 wt % to 90 wt % of nickel and 10 wt % to 35 wt % of zinc based on the total amount of nickel and zinc, excepting incidental impurities. Herein, the percentage by weight (wt %) of nickel and zinc are based on the total amount of nickel and zinc (total amount of nickel and zinc: 100 wt %), excepting incidental impurities. Due to the presence of nickel in the nickel-zinc alloy layer, wettability of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate may be enhanced when laminating the metal foil on the polyimide resin substrate for the production of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate. Consequently, adhesiveness between the polyimide resin substrate and the metal foil, as well as rust-prevention properties, may be improved by the formation of the nickel-zinc alloy layer. In addition, the nickel-zinc alloy layer acts as a barrier to prevent direct contact between the metal foil and the polyimide resin substrate when a flexible printed wiring board comprising the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate is subjected to heat treatment. Consequently, deterioration of the resin catalyzed by a metal component in the metal foil may be prevented, and therefore peel strength of a wiring after heat treatment may not be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0079">When the amount of nickel in the nickel-zinc alloy layer is more than 90 wt %, it may be difficult to remove the nickel-zinc alloy layer with a metal etchant solution such as a copper etchant solution, and therefore undesired nickel-zinc alloy may remain after etching. Thus, it is not preferred that the amount of nickel in the nickel-zinc alloy layer is more than 90 wt %. When the amount of zinc in the nickel-zinc alloy layer is more than 35 wt %, adhesiveness between the metal foil and the polyimide resin substrate in the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate may be reduced, and chemical resistance such as resistance to a metal plating solution may be reduced in the polyimide resin substrate and the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate, resulting in the occurrence of deposition of tin in the polyimide resin substrate and the metal foil during tin plating, for example. Thus, if a nickel-zinc alloy layer is formed, the nickel-zinc alloy layer preferably contains 65 wt % to 90 wt % of nickel and 10 wt % to 35 wt % of zinc, more preferably 70 wt % to 85 wt % of nickel and 30 wt % to 15 wt % of zinc, so that adhesiveness between the metal foil and the polyimide resin substrate may be improved, for example, and no undesired nickel-zinc alloy may remain after etching reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0080">The nickel-zinc alloy layer as described above is preferably formed by electrolytic plating in which a solution containing 1 g/L to 35 g/L of nickel from nickel sulfate, 0.1 g/L to 1 g/L of zinc from zinc pyrophosphate, and 50 g/L to 250 g/L of potassium pyrophosphate is used, the solution temperature is 20&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C., the pH is 8 to 11, and the current density is 0.3 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>to 10 A/dm<sup>2</sup>, for example. A nickel-zinc alloy layer with high uniformity of thickness may be formed by electrolytic plating under the conditions as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0081">The surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate may be preferably treated with a silane coupling agent as the final surface treatment. A silane coupling agent acts as an auxiliary for improving wettability of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate, and peel strength between the polyimide resin substrate and the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0082">Examples of the silane coupling agent to be used include various silane coupling agents such as epoxy-functional silane coupling agents, which are most commonly used, olefin-functional silane coupling agents, and acryl-functional silane coupling agents. The silane coupling agent may be preferably an amino-functional silane coupling agent, or a mercapto-functional silane coupling agent. When using an amino-functional silane coupling agent, or a mercapto-functional silane coupling agent, adhesion strength, and the like may be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0083">Specific examples of the silane coupling agent include coupling agents which are used on a glass cloth in a prepreg for a printed wiring board; specifically, vinyl trimethoxy silane, vinyl tris(2-methoxy ethoxy) silane, vinyl phenyl trimethoxy silane, &#x3b3;-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane, &#x3b3;-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxy silane, 4-glycidyl butyl trimethoxy silane, &#x3b3;-aminopropyl triethoxy silane, N-&#x3b2;-(aminoethyl)-&#x3b3;-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, N-3-(4-(3-aminopropoxy)butoxy)propyl-3-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, imidazole silane, triazine silane, and &#x3b3;-mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0084">A similar effect may be achieved when the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate is treated with a titanate-based coupling agent, or a zirconate-based coupling agent, instead of a silane coupling agent.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0085">A surface treatment with a silane coupling agent may be conducted by a known method. A surface treatment with a silane coupling agent may be conducted by applying a solution containing a silane coupling agent to a surface of a metal foil to be bonded to a polyimide resin substrate, and then heating the metal foil to remove the solvent therefrom, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0086">In the present invention, the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate preferably has an L value in the Lab color coordinate system of from 47 to 63. The &#x201c;L value in the Lab color coordinate system&#x201d; as used herein indicates lightness. A greater L value indicates a lighter color. The concept of an L value may be applied to the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate. A surface having a lighter color may have the roughening particles which are ununiformly formed thereon and/or have widely varying size, for example, and therefore a lighter color, or an L value may be used as an index to inadequate surface roughening treatment level. Accordingly, when the L value is more than 63, the surface may not be adequately roughened, and the resin base material surface, which is exposed by removing the metal foil of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate, may not exhibit adequate adherence to an adhesive organic material layer. In addition, adhesion strength between the polyimide resin substrate and the metal foil in the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate may be reduced. Thus, it is not preferred that the L value is more than 63.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0087">The L value may be measured in accordance with JIS-Z8722.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0088">When the L value is less than 47, the surface may be excessively roughened, and some coarse roughening particles may be formed in part. Even though some coarse roughening particles are formed, replica of fine roughening particles provides an anchor effect, and therefore the resin base material surface, which is exposed by removing the metal foil of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate, may exhibit adequate adherence to an adhesive organic material layer. Meanwhile, a thinner polyimide resin substrate is sometimes used in a metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate so as to reduce the weight and improve the flex resistance and the heat resistance. In the case where a polyimide resin substrate is thinner, and some coarse roughening particles may be formed on a surface of a metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate, the coarse roughening particles may reach into a base material which is not thermocompression-bondable, e.g. a heat-resistant polyimide layer, through a thermocompression-bondable layer for laminating (thermo-compression bonding) the metal foil onto the polyimide resin substrate, if the coarse roughening particles are too large. In that case, some of the roughening particles are in direct contact with the base material which is not thermocompression-bondable, and little adhesiveness may be achieved in such an area. Accordingly, the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate obtained may have peel strength between the polyimide resin substrate and the metal foil which varies greatly with position. Thus, it is not preferred that the L value is less than 47.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0089">Thus, the L value is preferably in the range of 47 to 63, more preferably 48 to 60, further preferably 48 to 58, particularly preferably 49 to 57, so that the resin base material surface of the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate may exhibit adequate adherence to an adhesive organic material layer, and adequate adhesion strength between the polyimide resin substrate and the metal foil may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0090">In the present invention, if the polyimide resin substrate has a thermocompression-bondable layer to be bonded to the metal foil, the thickness of the thermocompression-bondable layer is preferably equal to or greater than the surface roughness (Rzjis) of the surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the polyimide resin substrate. When the thickness of the thermocompression-bondable layer is less than the surface roughness (Rzjis) of the metal foil, the whole roughening particle may not be buried in the thermocompression-bondable layer of the polyimide resin substrate. In that case, as described above, the metal foil laminated polyimide resin substrate obtained may have peel strength between the polyimide resin substrate and the metal foil which varies greatly with position.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0091">Examples of the metal foil to be used in the present invention include, but not limited to, metal foils such as a copper foil and a copper alloy foil including an electrolytic copper foil and a rolled copper foil, an aluminum foil and an aluminum alloy foil, a stainless steel foil, and a nickel foil and a nickel alloy foil (alloy 42, for example).

There are no particular restrictions to the material for the protective foil (carrier foil), so long as it may be bonded to a metal foil such as an ultrathin copper foil, and serve to reinforce and protect the metal foil. Examples of the protective foil (carrier foil) to be used include an aluminum foil, a copper foil, and a metal-coated resin foil. There are no particular restrictions to the thickness of the protective foil (carrier foil), so long as the protective foil may reinforce an ultrathin metal foil.

The metal foil and the films may be preferably preheated at a temperature of from about 150&#xb0; C. to about 250&#xb0; C., particularly at a temperature of higher than 150&#xb0; C. but not higher than 250&#xb0; C., for about 2 sec to about 120 sec, preferably in-line just before introducing into the thermocompression-bonding apparatus, using a pre-heating apparatus such as a hot-air blower and an infrared heater.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0205">2) A three-layer laminate of a metal foil, a thermocompression-bondable polyimide film and a non-thermocompression-bondable film (metal foil/polyimide/polyimide (non-thermocompression-bondable film)) is heated and pressed at a temperature equal to or higher than the temperature higher by 20&#xb0; C. than the glass transition temperature of the polyimide (S2), but not higher than 400&#xb0; C., particularly at a temperature equal to or higher than the temperature higher by 30&#xb0; C. than the glass transition temperature of the polyimide (S2), but not higher than 400&#xb0; C., in the thermocompression-bonding zone, using a pair of press rolls or a double-belt press.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0206">3) In the case of a double-belt press, in particular, after the thermocompression-bonding, the laminate is cooled under pressure, preferably to a temperature equal to or lower than the temperature lower by 20&#xb0; C. than the glass transition temperature of the polyimide (S2), particularly to a temperature equal to or lower than the temperature lower by 30&#xb0; C. than the glass transition temperature of the polyimide (S2), in the cooling zone, thereby laminating the metal foil and the non-thermocompression-bondable film onto the thermocompression-bondable polyimide film, and then the laminate is wound into a roll.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0207">Thus a single-sided metal foil laminated polyimide film in roll form may be prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0208">In the process as described above, the preheating prior to the thermocompression-bonding allows prevention of defects in appearance of the laminate after the thermocompression-bonding, which is due to foaming caused by water and the like in the polyimide, and prevention of foaming caused by immersion in a solder bath for forming an electronic circuit, leading to the reduction in product yield. It is impractical to place a whole thermocompression-bonding apparatus in a heating furnace, because the thermocompression-bonding apparatus to be used is substantially limited to a compact one, leading to the restriction to the shape of the metal foil laminated polyimide film. If out-line preheating is conducted, a polyimide may absorb water before lamination, which result in defective appearance of the laminate after the thermocompression-bonding due to foaming, and reduction in solder heat resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0209">A preferable double-belt press may be a hydraulic-pressing type using a heat medium, which is capable of conducting high-temperature heating/cooling under pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0210">When a metal foil is laminated onto a polyimide film having a thermocompression-bondable polyimide layer on both sides or one side by thermocompression-bonding/cooling under pressure, using a double-belt press, the take-off speed may be preferably 1 m/min or higher, and there may be provided a long and wide metal foil laminated polyimide film having a width of about 400 mm or more, particularly about 500 mm or more, which has high adhesive strength (i.e. high peel strength between the metal foil and the polyimide layer) and such good appearance that substantially no wrinkles are observed in the metal foil surface.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0211">It is preferred that one or more combinations of a thermocompression-bondable polyimide film and a metal foil, together with two protective films, each of which is placed between the outermost layer and the belt, are fed and laminated by thermocompression-bonding/cooling under pressure so as to mass-produce a double-sided or single-sided metal foil laminated polyimide film having good appearance. There are no particular restrictions to the material for the protective film, so long as it is non-thermocompression-bondable and has excellent surface smoothness. Preferable examples of the protective film include a metal foil such as a copper foil, a stainless steel foil and an aluminum foil, and a highly heat-resistant polyimide film (UPILEX S from Ube Industries, Ltd, for example) which has a thickness of about 5 &#x3bc;m to about 125 &#x3bc;m.</p>

<p id="p-0214" num="0221">The conditions of cleaning with an etchant (A) may be appropriately selected depending on the type of the etchant to be used. The cleaning may be preferably conducted by immersion (dipping) or spraying at a temperature of from 30&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C., more preferably from 40&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C., for 0.3 min to 20 min, more preferably 0.5 min to 10 min, particularly preferably 1 min to 7 min.</p>

<p id="p-0247" num="0257">(Surface Roughening)</p>

<p id="p-0250" num="0260">(Rust-Proofing)</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0261">Subsequently, both surfaces of the roughened electrolytic copper foil were subjected to inorganic rust-proofing as follows.</p>

<p id="p-0253" num="0263">After rust-proofing with zinc-nickel alloy, a chromate layer was formed by electrolysis under the conditions wherein a solution at pH 12 containing 1 g/L of chromic acid was used, and the solution temperature was 25&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0264">(Surface Treatment with a Silane Coupling Agent)</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0265">After the completion of the rust-proofing as described above, the roughened electrolytic copper foil was washed with water, and a silane coupling agent solution was sprayed onto the deposition surface of the electrolytic copper foil by showering in a chamber for surface treatment with a silane coupling agent immediately, to attach the silane coupling agent onto the rust-proofing layer (chromate layer) on the deposition surface. The silane coupling agent solution was an aqueous solution of aminopropyl trimethoxy silane with a concentration of 3 g/L, which was prepared using pure water as a solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0266">Finally, after the completion of the treatment with the silane coupling agent, water on the electrolytic copper foil was vaporized, using an electric heater.</p>

<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Preparation of Double-Sided Copper Foil Laminated Polyimide Films</heading>
<p id="p-0266" num="0303">The three-layer polyimide film A1, which was preheated in-line by hot air at 200&#xb0; C. for 30 sec immediately before being fed to a double-belt press, and two surface-treated electrolytic copper foils (thickness: 9 &#x3bc;m) shown in Table 3, each of which was laminated onto the polyimide film A1, were fed to a heating zone or thermocompression-bonding zone (the highest heating temperature: 330&#xb0; C.) and then to a cooling zone (the lowest cooling temperature: 180&#xb0; C.) to laminate the copper foils onto the polyimide film A1 by continuous thermocompression-bonding and cooling in which the thermocompression-bonding pressure was 3.9 MPa, and the thermocompression-bonding time was 2 min. Thus eight different types of double-sided copper foil laminated polyimide films (width: 540 mm; length: 30 m) were prepared and wound into a roll.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0304">All of the double-sided copper foil laminated polyimide films thus obtained were double-sided copper foil laminates of copper foil/polyimide film A1/copper foil, and the same copper foils (shown in Table 3) were laminated on both sides of the polyimide film.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0305">The double-sided copper foil laminated polyimide films thus obtained were evaluated for adhesion strength between the copper foil and the polyimide film, and the filling characteristics between the copper foil and the polyimide. The results are shown in Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0306">(Preparation of Polyimide Films after Copper Removal)</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0307">The double-sided copper foil laminated polyimide film in roll form thus obtained was cut into a sample with a size of 10 cm&#xd7;10 cm. The sample was immersed in a solution of ferric chloride, which was an etchant for copper, (temperature: 30&#xb0; C.) for 30 min and the copper foil was fully removed by etching. And then, the polyimide film obtained by fully removing copper in the copper foil laminated polyimide film by etching was washed with water. Subsequently, the polyimide film was immersed in a solution of FLICKER-MH (Nihon Kagaku Sangyo Co., Ltd.), which was a Ni&#x2014;Cr seed layer remover, (temperature: 30&#xb0; C.) for 20 min. And then, the polyimide film was washed with water, and immersed in a 3 vol % hydrochloric acid solution (room temperature: about 20&#xb0; C.) for 30 sec. Thus the polyimide film after removing copper by etching, and washed with the Ni&#x2014;Cr seed layer remover was prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0308">(Preparation of an Adhesive Sheet)</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0309">In 25 g of a mixed solvent of toluene/methyl ethyl ketone (1 parts by volume/1 parts by volume) was dissolved 25 g of Epicoat 1009 (Japan Epoxy Resins Co., Ltd.), and then to the mixture were added 25 g of a latent curing agent HX3941HP (Asahi Kasei Corporation) and 0.5 g of a silane coupling agent KBM-403 (Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.), to prepare a dope. The dope thus obtained was applied to a mold-release film and dried at 80&#xb0; C. for 5 min, to prepare an epoxy bonding sheet (thickness: about 30 &#x3bc;m).</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0310">(Preparation of a Laminated Sheet in which the Adhesive Sheet is Laminated on the Surface of the Polyimide Film after Removal of the Copper Foil)</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0311">The polyimide film after removing copper by etching and the epoxy bonding sheet were directly laminated and pressed by a pressure of 30 kgf/cm<sup>2 </sup>at a temperature of 170&#xb0; C. for 5 min, using a hot-press machine (MP-WNH made by TOYO SEIKI), to prepare a laminated sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0312">The laminated sheet thus obtained was subjected to moist heat treatment (treatment conditions: temperature: 105&#xb0; C.; humidity: 100% RH; treatment time: 12 hr), and then 90&#xb0; peel strength was measured as described below. The results are shown in Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0313">(Method for Measuring 90&#xb0; Peel Strength of a Laminated Sheet)</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0314">The bonding sheet side of the laminated sheet, in which the epoxy bonding sheet was laminated on the polyimide film, was fixed to a support fitting for 90&#xb0; peel strength measurement with a double-faced tape. And then, 90&#xb0; peel strength was measured while grasping the polyimide film in the laminated sheet, using a tensile tester made by TS Engineering Inc. (Model: AC-20C-SL). The measurement was conducted for 4 samples, and an average of the measured values in a stable range except overshoot at the initiation of measurement, for example, was defined as 90&#xb0; peel strength. The measurement conditions were as follows: temperature: 23&#xb0; C.; humidity: 65%; sample size: about 50 mm (tensile direction)&#xd7;about 2 mm (width); tensile speed: 50 mm/min; peeling length: 20 mm or more.</p>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Comparative Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0278" num="0315">A double-sided copper foil laminated polyimide film in roll form (width: 540 mm; length: 30 m) was prepared in the same way as in Example 1, except that the surface-treated copper foils I were used as surface-treated electrolytic copper foils (thickness: 9 &#x3bc;m) as shown in Table 3, and the three-layer polyimide film A2 was used as a polyimide film. Furthermore, a laminated sheet in which the adhesive sheet is laminated on the surface of the polyimide film after removing copper foil by etching from the double-sided copper foil laminated polyimide film was prepared in the same way as in Example 1. The double-sided copper foil laminated polyimide film and the laminated sheet thus obtained were evaluated in the same way as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 3.</p>

<p id="p-0283" num="0320">In Comparative Example 1, adhesion strength of the copper foil laminated polyimide film was not less than 1 N/mm, and filling characteristics was also satisfactory. However, 90&#xb0; peel strength of a laminated sheet was as low as 0.16 N/mm.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0321">The results of measurements of 90&#xb0; peel strength of laminated sheets, in which the epoxy bonding sheet was laminated on the polyimide film, indicate that the copper foil laminated polyimide films of Examples 2-7 were superior to the copper foil laminated polyimide film of Example 1.
