<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to the field of airbag modules for use in motor vehicles. More specifically, this disclosure relates to an airbag module having an improved configuration and method of assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to a disclosed embodiment, an airbag module for use in a vehicle to provide restraint to an occupant of the vehicle is provided. The module includes a cushion pack having an inflatable airbag cushion configured to inflate to restrain the occupant of the vehicle. The module also includes an inflator configured to provide inflation gas for inflating the airbag cushion and an annular retaining member that engages with the cushion pack to thereby retain a portion of the cushion pack in the airbag module during deployment of the airbag cushion. An annular locking member is connected to the inflator and to the retaining member. The locking member is configured to prohibit substantial displacement of the inflator relative to the locking member during deployment of the airbag.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The retaining member may include inwardly protruding tabs that engage with a structural member located in the cushion pack. Both the retaining member and the locking member may be formed by connecting two portions together. The retaining member and the cushion pack may include corresponding alignment members or features that engage to ensure proper alignment of the cushion pack to the retaining member. The airbag module may also include a cover that is connected to the retaining member. The cover may be deformable or frangible to allow the airbag cushion to deploy through the cover into a compartment of the vehicle. The retaining member may include a mounting member to be connected to a structural member of the vehicle to thereby secure the airbag module in position in the vehicle a mounting member for connecting the airbag module to the vehicle.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With general reference to the figures, disclosed herein are airbag modules having an improved configuration to reduce the number of components, mass, and packaging volume. The airbag modules disclosed herein further allow for an improved assembly process by having independent attachment or coupling features, which permit the airbag modules to be assembled using a sequential build process. This allows for more flexibility of the assembly process and permits the automated manufacturing process to be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Airbag modules are typically located in vehicles to protect occupants from injury during a vehicle dynamic impact event, such as a frontal impact or roll-over event. Typically, airbag modules are connected to sensors located in the vehicle, which initiate deployment of the airbag based on information received and monitored through the sensors. Airbag modules often include at least one inflatable airbag cushion, which may deploy and inflate from high pressure gas, typically generated by an inflator. The inflator may contain an explosive charge (e.g., pyrotechnic device) or may include some other device for rapidly generating inflation gas, which enters the airbag cushion at a high volumetric flow rate and expands the cushion by increasing the internal chamber pressure of the airbag cushion. Airbags are typically packaged through a process of folding and rolling to compact the airbag in order to minimize its required packaging space. The packaging volume of airbags may be minimized by using a vacuum folding process, which may use a chamber having a hermetic seal that has a pressure significantly lower than the atmospheric pressure. For example, the vacuum folding process may include a sealing member (e.g., plastic bag) that encompasses the airbag cushion, which then is reduced in pressure relative to atmospheric pressure to reduce the volume occupied by the sealing member and internal airbag cushion. The sealing member then may be sealed hermetically to maintain the small volume and airtight seal during assembly and installation of the airbag module into the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">During a vehicle dynamic impact event, a passenger-side airbag (PAB) module may deploy from the upper portion (i.e., above the glove box) of the dashboard, in substantially rearward and upward directions to protect the head and torso of the occupant. PAB modules may also deploy from the rear facing portion of the dashboard in substantially a rearward direction towards the passenger. Driver-side airbag (DAB) modules are typically stored within the steering column and are typically packaged through a process of folding and rolling to compact the airbag in order to minimize its required packaging space. During a vehicle dynamic impact event, a driver airbag may deploy in substantially a rearward direction towards the driver to protect the head and torso of the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a motor vehicle <b>10</b> may include a DAB module <b>20</b> to provide driver protection by restraining the driver. The motor vehicle <b>10</b> may further include a PAB module or other airbag modules to provide protection to additional occupants. The vehicle <b>10</b> is illustrated as a typical sedan, but the airbag modules disclosed herein may be used within any type of passenger vehicle as well as other moving vehicles (e.g., military, mass-transit) that offer occupant protection to seated passengers in the form of frontal airbags. The airbag modules as disclosed herein may be used within any vehicle to provide any occupant (e.g., driver, passenger) with improved protection during a vehicle dynamic event that triggers deployment of an airbag cushion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the DAB module <b>20</b> may include an inflatable airbag cushion <b>23</b>, which is illustrated in the deployed or inflated position provided between the occupant <b>13</b> the steering column <b>12</b>. The inflated airbag cushion <b>23</b> of the DAB module <b>20</b> provides the occupant (e.g., driver) with protection by restraining the driver, such as, for example, from contacting the steering column <b>12</b> and/or instrument panel <b>11</b> of the vehicle <b>10</b> during an airbag deploying event of the vehicle <b>10</b>. Typically, deployment of a DAB module <b>20</b> is triggered by a dynamic impact of the vehicle, whereby impact sensors (not shown) communicate to a vehicle control module (not shown) or other device which communicates to the inflator <b>21</b> of the airbag module <b>20</b> to initiate generation of inflation gas, which is then forced into the inflatable airbag cushion <b>23</b>. As the inflation gas forced into the airbag cushion of the DAB module increases, the internal chamber pressure of the airbag cushion <b>23</b> increases, allowing the airbag cushion <b>23</b> to breach the steering column (or other storing member) and the airbag module <b>20</b>, whereby the airbag cushion <b>23</b> deploys substantially outward (i.e., substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal or fore-aft axis of the vehicle or at an oblique angle relative to the fore-aft direction of the vehicle <b>10</b>) and rearward toward the occupant <b>13</b>. The airbag module <b>20</b> improves occupant safety by providing restraint to the occupant <b>13</b> through the airbag cushion <b>23</b> and limiting displacement of the decelerating occupant to mitigate the momentum and kinetic energy of the occupant <b>13</b>. The deployed airbag cushion <b>23</b> absorbs energy (e.g., kinetic energy) and the forces exerted from the occupant <b>13</b> from being decelerated. The airbag cushion <b>23</b> of the airbag module <b>20</b> further reduces occupant injury by reducing or eliminating impact of the occupant <b>13</b> with substantially rigid vehicle components, such as the steering column <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7B</figref> disclose a DAB module <b>20</b>. The module <b>20</b> includes an inflator <b>21</b>, a cushion pack <b>22</b>, a cover <b>30</b>, a retaining member (or ring) <b>40</b>, and a locking member (or ring) <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the assembled DAB module <b>20</b>, whereby the retaining member <b>40</b> retains the cushion pack <b>22</b> and connects to the locking member <b>50</b>, which retains the inflator <b>21</b> adjacent to the cushion pack <b>22</b>. The cover <b>30</b> is provided over the cushion pack <b>22</b>, and engages the retaining member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cushion pack <b>22</b> includes an inflatable airbag cushion <b>23</b> and may include a structural member (e.g., cushion ring) <b>24</b>. The inflatable airbag <b>23</b> may be coupled to the structural member <b>24</b> thereby forming a retaining groove <b>26</b> in the cushion adjacent to the structural member <b>24</b>. The retaining groove <b>26</b> is configured to allow retention of the cushion pack <b>22</b> by the retaining member <b>40</b>. The airbag cushion <b>23</b> may be configured through folding, rolling, or a combination of folding and rolling to allow a reduced packaging volume, but does not have to be vacuum sealed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the cushion pack <b>22</b> includes the inflatable airbag cushion <b>23</b>, the structural member (or cushion ring) <b>24</b> provided adjacent to the cushion <b>23</b>, and may also include a sealing member <b>25</b> covering the airbag cushion <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The airbag cushion <b>23</b> may be made from any suitable material (e.g., woven nylon fabric) and may be any suitable shape, which may be tailored to meet specific customer requirements. The airbag cushion <b>23</b> may be coated with a sealant (e.g., silicone) to prohibit inflation gas from escaping through the porosity of the cushion. The structural member <b>24</b> is coupled to the airbag cushion <b>23</b> to provide strength to the cushion pack <b>22</b> (e.g., during airbag cushion <b>23</b> deployment), whereby the structural member <b>24</b> and airbag cushion <b>23</b> form a retaining groove <b>26</b>. The retaining groove <b>26</b> may be configured as an undercut portion of the cushion pack <b>22</b> to aid in retention of the cushion pack <b>22</b> by the retaining member <b>40</b>. The structural member <b>24</b> may be made from steel, a composite (e.g., glass reinforced nylon, glass reinforced polypropylene), or any suitable material that is substantially rigid and provides the necessary strength to withstand the high forces created during airbag deployment.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The sealing member <b>25</b> may be a thin flexible airtight or impermeable material (e.g., a polymer), configured to encompass the coupled inflatable airbag cushion <b>23</b> and to form a vacuum sealed chamber having a relative low pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. The sealing member <b>25</b> may form a hermetic seal of low pressure to optimally reduce the packaging volume of the cushion pack <b>22</b>. The sealing member <b>25</b> is configured to allow the deploying airbag cushion <b>23</b> to breach the sealing member <b>25</b> without impediment or delay.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>, the annular shaped retaining member <b>40</b> may be assembled from two portions. A first retaining portion (or ring) <b>40</b><i>a </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) may form substantially half of the annular retaining member <b>40</b>, and a second retaining portion (or ring) <b>40</b><i>b </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), may form substantially the other half of the annular retaining member <b>40</b>. Alternatively, the retaining member may be made out of more than two portions. Each of the plurality of portions may have substantially similar or varying circumferential lengths (or portions). Thus, each of the plurality of portions may form varying amounts of the retaining member.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first and second retaining portions <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>forming the retaining member <b>40</b> may be made out of a composite material (e.g., glass reinforced nylon, glass reinforced polypropylene) or any suitable material having the strength to withstand the high forces induced during airbag deployment, and may be made through an injection molding or any suitable process. The first retaining portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>may be connected to the second retaining portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>using at least one connector (or first coupling mechanism) <b>41</b>. The portions <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the retaining member <b>40</b> upon connection may retain the cushion pack <b>22</b> in place relative to the retaining member <b>40</b>, prohibiting substantial displacement of the cushion pack <b>22</b> in the longitudinal direction relative to the retaining member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The retaining member <b>40</b> of the DAB module <b>20</b> may include a connector <b>41</b> for coupling a first end of the first retaining portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>to a first end of the second retaining portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>and a connector <b>141</b> for coupling a second end of the first retaining portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>to a second end of the second retaining portion <b>40</b><i>b</i>. The DAB module <b>20</b> may further include an attachment member configured to couple the retaining member <b>40</b> to the locking member <b>50</b>. The retaining member <b>40</b> may also include an attachment member (or second coupling mechanism) <b>42</b> configured to engage an attachment member (or second coupling mechanism) <b>52</b> of the locking member <b>50</b>, thereby coupling the retaining member <b>40</b> to the locking member <b>50</b>. As discussed herein, the locking member <b>50</b> may include a connector for coupling together portions of the locking member <b>50</b>, which may be configured similarly or differently than the connector of the retaining member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The connector <b>41</b> of the retaining member <b>40</b> may include a feature <b>41</b><i>a </i>on the first retaining portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>that is configured to engage a mating feature <b>41</b><i>b </i>on the second retaining portion <b>40</b><i>b</i>. For example, the feature <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the first retaining portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>may be configured as an arc-shaped member that is configured to engage the feature <b>41</b><i>b </i>of second retaining portion <b>40</b><i>b</i>, whereby the feature <b>41</b><i>b </i>is configured as an arc-shaped void, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the connector <b>141</b> of the retaining member <b>40</b> may include a feature <b>141</b><i>b </i>of the second retaining portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>that is configured to engage a feature <b>141</b><i>a </i>of the first retaining portion <b>40</b><i>a</i>. The feature <b>141</b><i>b </i>of the second retaining portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>is a hook (or tab) having an extruded portion with a detent near the end on one side of the extruded portion that is configured to engage the feature <b>141</b><i>a </i>on the first retaining portion <b>40</b><i>a</i>, whereby the feature <b>141</b><i>a </i>is an opening configured to receive the hook feature <b>141</b><i>b</i>. The opening feature <b>141</b><i>a </i>may further include a detent or protrusion that is configured to engage the detent of the hook feature <b>141</b><i>b </i>thereby locking the first and second retaining portions <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>together through the connector <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The connector <b>141</b> or a portion of the connector <b>141</b> may be flexible or compliant. For example, the hook feature <b>141</b><i>b </i>may be flexible or compliant allowing the hook to flex when the detent of the hook feature <b>141</b><i>b </i>is passed over the detent of the opening feature <b>141</b><i>a </i>and allowing the hook to return to the pre-flexed configuration when the detent of the hook feature <b>141</b><i>b </i>passes beyond the detent of the opening feature <b>141</b><i>a</i>. The leading surfaces of the detents of the hook feature <b>141</b><i>b </i>and the opening feature <b>141</b><i>a </i>may be configured as ramps or oblique surfaces (relative to the angle of engagement) to provide easier engagement between the two detents by allowing a lateral force to bend or flex the hook feature <b>141</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The connector <b>141</b> may be configured to lock the first and second retaining portions <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>together. For example, the detents of the hook feature <b>141</b><i>b </i>and opening feature <b>141</b><i>a </i>may be configured to resist separation by having surfaces that engage one another in a direction substantially transverse to the direction of flex (or bending). Upon loading, the hook feature <b>141</b><i>b </i>may be subjected to tensile forces and the detent subjected to shear forces with little or no bending forces, while the detent of the opening feature <b>141</b><i>a </i>may be subjected to shear forces.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to yet another exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first retaining portion <b>240</b><i>a </i>is connected to the second retaining portion <b>240</b><i>b </i>through a plurality of connectors <b>241</b>, thereby forming the retaining portion <b>240</b>. The connector <b>241</b> includes a flexible tab feature <b>241</b><i>b </i>on one retaining portion that is configured to engage or fill an opening (or void) feature <b>241</b><i>a </i>on the mating retaining portion. The tab feature <b>241</b><i>b </i>includes detents on both sides of a slot or void that is configured to have a locking fit with the opening feature <b>241</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The tab feature <b>241</b><i>b </i>may have an interference fit with the opening feature <b>241</b><i>a</i>, whereby insertion of the tab feature <b>241</b><i>b </i>into the opening feature <b>241</b><i>a </i>compresses the tab feature <b>241</b><i>b </i>by displacing the detents into the slot to allow the tab to pass into the opening of the opening feature <b>241</b><i>a</i>. The opening feature <b>241</b><i>a </i>includes a cavity that is larger (i.e., larger cross-section) relative to the opening to allow the detents of the flexible tab feature <b>241</b><i>b </i>to displace back to a substantially non-displaced shape. Thus, the tab feature <b>241</b><i>b </i>may be retained by the opening feature <b>241</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additionally, each end of retaining portions may have a connector feature, so that both ends of the retaining portions may be coupled together. According to other exemplary embodiments, the retaining portions of the retaining member may be coupled by a weld (e.g., sonic weld), an adhesive, or any combination of methods. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any suitable method for coupling the retaining member together may be used, and those disclosed herein are not meant to be limitations.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The retaining member <b>40</b> may further include an aligning member (e.g., emboss, protrusion, key-way) that engages to a mating aligning member on the cushion pack <b>22</b>, which aligns the rotational orientation or relationship (i.e., rotation about the longitudinal axis <b>29</b>) between the retaining member <b>40</b> and the cushion pack <b>22</b>. The aligning member <b>44</b> (e.g., emboss, protrusion, key-way) engages a corresponding aligning void or recess <b>24</b><i>a </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) on the structural member <b>24</b> of the cushion pack <b>22</b>, which aligns the rotational relationship between the retaining member <b>40</b> and the structural member <b>24</b> (and hence the cushion pack <b>22</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref>, the aligning member <b>44</b> of the retaining member <b>40</b> may be configured as a semi-circular emboss, which engages the mating semi-circular aligning void <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the structural member <b>24</b> of the cushion pack <b>22</b>. Thus, the rotational alignment (about the longitudinal axis <b>29</b>) between the retaining member <b>40</b> and the cushion pack <b>22</b> is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The airbag cushion <b>23</b> may be coupled to the structural member <b>24</b> to prohibit rotation of the cushion <b>23</b> about the longitudinal axis <b>29</b> of the DAB module <b>20</b> relative to the retaining member <b>40</b>. Thus, the DAB module <b>20</b> has a repeatable and reliable method for positioning or aligning the airbag cushion <b>23</b> relative to the DAB module <b>20</b>, which may be installed in each vehicle the same way. This repeatable alignment ensures a repeatable deployed airbag cushion location that provides optimal occupant protection, because the airbag cushion design (e.g., shape, tether locations, vent locations) may be configured to provide optimal occupant protection for a predetermined deployed location relative to the occupant and vehicle environment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first and second retaining portions <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>that form the retaining member <b>40</b> may be semi-annular in shape, and include a base <b>45</b> configured to support the structural member <b>24</b> of the cushion pack <b>22</b>. The retaining portions <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>further include an inner wall <b>46</b><i>a </i>and an outer wall <b>46</b><i>b </i>that extend substantially perpendicular from the base <b>45</b> and are separated by a gap <b>47</b><i>a</i>, which is configured to allow access of the cover <b>30</b> into the gap <b>47</b><i>a</i>. Extending in the radial direction towards the center of the retaining member <b>40</b> from the inside surface of the inner walls <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the retaining portions <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>are a plurality of retention members (or protruding tabs) <b>43</b>. The tab <b>43</b> includes a retaining surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>, which is substantially parallel and offset from the base <b>45</b>, thereby forming a second gap <b>47</b><i>b </i>between the base <b>45</b> and the retaining surface <b>43</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second gap <b>47</b><i>b </i>is configured to receive the structural member <b>24</b> of the cushion pack <b>22</b>. Upon coupling the retaining portions <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the retaining member <b>40</b>, the structural member <b>24</b> is retained between the tabs <b>43</b> and the base <b>45</b> of the retaining member <b>40</b>, prohibiting substantial movement along the length of the longitudinal axis <b>29</b> of the structural member <b>24</b> (and hence the cushion pack <b>22</b> as well) relative to the retaining member <b>40</b>. Thus, the structural member <b>24</b> may be retained by the tabs <b>43</b> of the retaining member <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The tabs <b>43</b> of the retaining member <b>40</b> are configured to be substantially rigid to provide strength and withstand the forces induced by the cushion ring during airbag deployment from the expanding airbag cushion. Since the structural member <b>24</b> and/or cushion pack <b>22</b> may be assembled with the retaining member <b>40</b> by bringing the retaining portions <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>together around the structural member <b>24</b> and/or cushion pack <b>22</b>, neither the tabs <b>43</b> nor the structural member <b>24</b> have to be configured to deflect (or flex) relative to the other, such as if the retaining member were one piece and the structural member was coupled by pushing the retaining and structural members together in the axial (longitudinal) direction. It should be noted that the size and quantity of the tabs <b>43</b> may be tailored to meet varying load situations, and those embodiments disclosed herein are not meant as limitations.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The retaining portions <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the retaining member <b>40</b> may further include an attachment member (or second coupling mechanism) <b>42</b> that is configured to connect the retaining member <b>40</b> to the locking member <b>50</b>. According to the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the attachment member <b>42</b> includes two extruded portions <b>42</b><i>a </i>that extend from the bottom surface <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>45</b> of the retaining member <b>40</b>, whereby each extruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>has a ramp (or oblique) shaped detent feature near the end farthest from the base <b>45</b>. Each extruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the attachment member <b>42</b> may be flexibly configured to engage a corresponding mating portion of the attachment member <b>52</b> of the locking member <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the attachment member <b>52</b> located on the locking member <b>50</b> is brought into contact with the mating portion of the attachment member <b>42</b> located on the retaining member <b>40</b> there is an interference fit between the detent of each extruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>and the corresponding mating attachment member <b>52</b> of the locking member <b>50</b> that elastically displaces each extruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>(creating stored biasing energy) so that the mating portion of the attachment member <b>52</b> of the locking member <b>50</b> may pass the detent of each extruded portion <b>42</b><i>a</i>. Each extruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>may have an undercut (or void) provided between the bottom surface <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>45</b> and the detent of the extruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>to lock the extruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>(e.g., the detent) to the mating portion of the attachment member <b>52</b> as the stored biasing energy returns the extruded portions <b>42</b><i>a </i>to their free positions. Thus, when the locking member <b>50</b> is displaced beyond the interference engagement with (i.e., moved closer toward) the retaining member <b>40</b>, the attachment member <b>52</b> of the locking member <b>50</b> engages the undercut portion of the attachment member <b>42</b> allowing the detent to displace back to the free position (i.e., pre-displaced position) due to the stored biasing energy.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The attachment member <b>42</b> of the retaining member <b>40</b> connects to the attachment member <b>52</b> of the locking member <b>50</b>, coupling the retaining member <b>40</b> to the locking member <b>50</b>. The airbag module <b>20</b> may be configured to include any number of such connections, which may be tailored to accommodate the loading that the airbag module is subjected to during airbag deployment. For example, the airbag module <b>20</b> includes four such connections, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The connection between the retaining and locking members may be formed by an attachment member that includes one extruded portion that extends from the bottom surface of the base of the retaining member that engages a mating attachment member of the locking member. According to other exemplary embodiments, the attachment member may be any snap feature configuration or any method for coupling the retaining member to the locking member. The attachment member may be any conventional fastener (e.g., bolt, rivet), may be any chemical method (e.g., adhesive, epoxy), or may be any weld (e.g., sonic weld). For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the attachment member may be configured as a stud <b>342</b> that is integrally formed with the retaining member <b>340</b> and extends substantially perpendicular from the bottom surface <b>345</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>345</b> in a direction away from the base <b>345</b>. The stud <b>342</b> may be separately formed then coupled to the retaining member <b>340</b>. The studs <b>342</b> may be pressed fit, key-way fit, or held by clamp force to the retaining member <b>340</b>, and may be configured to engage an attachment member (e.g., nut) <b>343</b>. The attachment member <b>343</b> may be separately formed then connected to or integrally formed with the locking member <b>350</b> and/or the inflator <b>321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The retaining member <b>340</b> and/or the DAB module <b>320</b> may include a mounting (or attachment or coupling) feature or member to couple the module to the vehicle. According to the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the mounting members <b>380</b> are integrally formed into the retaining member <b>340</b>. The mounting member <b>380</b> may take any suitable or conventional shape. According to other embodiments, the mounting member may be formed separately then coupled to the retaining member. The mounting member may be configured to receive any suitable feature (e.g., conventional fastener, snap), or may be configured to engage a receiving device of the vehicle.</p>
