<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems, and more particularly to devices and processes that authorize and manage wagering agents and associated accounts of wagering game systems and networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wagering game machines, such as slot machines, video poker machines and the like, have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally, the popularity of such machines depends on the likelihood (or perceived likelihood) of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing wagering game machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same (or believed to be the same), players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines, features, and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore, there is a continuing need for wagering game machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, a method comprises detecting a wagering game played on a wagering game machine by a first player account; detecting that a session credit balance, on the wagering game machine, is below a minimum amount for a wagering game bet; prompting the first player account to utilize funds from a community wagering fund; and using a portion of the community wagering fund to increase the session credit balance to meet the minimum amount for the wagering game bet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the method further comprises prompting the first player account to contribute a portion of the session credit balance to a community wagering fund; and transferring the portion of the session credit balance to the community wagering fund.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the method further comprises detecting a request from a second player account to utilize the community wagering fund; and making the community wagering fund available to the second player account.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the method further comprises determining that the session credit balance meets a pre-determined percentage of the minimum bet amount before prompting the first player account to utilize the community wagering fund.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, one or more machine-readable media having instructions stored thereon, which when executed by a set of one or more processors causes the set of one or more processors to perform operations that comprise detecting a request from a first player account to utilize a shared wagering fund to wager on a wagering game, wherein the shared wagering fund is funded by a second player account; making the shared wagering fund available to the first player account to wager on a wagering game; determining a game award produced by the wagering game; and allocating a portion of the game award to the second player account.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This description of the embodiments is divided into six sections. The first section provides an introduction to embodiments. The second section describes example operating environments while the third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments. The fourth section describes additional example embodiments while the fifth section describes additional example operating environments. The sixth section presents some general comments.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">This section provides an introduction to some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Many wagering game enthusiasts enjoy the thrill of winning wagering games. Most enjoy the fun and relaxation of simply playing a wagering game. However, many of those enthusiasts lack the time to play wagering games. Furthermore, according to many jurisdictional rules that regulate wagering games, many wagering game providers have to restrict the geographical location of wagering games to a casino facility. This geographic limitation on wagering games further limits the enthusiasts' ability to access wagering games with their limited time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an embodiment of how to provide a wagering game enthusiast with the thrill of playing and winning wagering games, but without having to be in a casino.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual diagram that illustrates an example of authorizing wagering agents and utilizing shared wagering agency funds, according to some embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) <b>100</b> can include a computer <b>145</b> used to access a first wagering game account <b>103</b>. The system <b>100</b> can provide wagering account settings <b>111</b> that the first player account <b>103</b> can use to designate another, or second player account <b>132</b>, as a wagering &#x201c;agent&#x201d; account. The first player account <b>103</b> can also be referred to herein as an &#x201c;authorizing&#x201d; account <b>103</b>, because it authorizes another account to wager on its behalf. The second player account <b>132</b> can be referred to as the wagering agent account <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The authorizing account <b>103</b> can allocate funds into a shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b> for the wagering agent account <b>132</b> to make wagers with. The authorizing account <b>103</b> can present a list of social contacts <b>113</b> (e.g., friends, family, etc.) that also have a wagering game account. The authorizing account <b>103</b> can include controls <b>121</b> to designate one or more of the social contact accounts as wagering agent account(s) (e.g., Mark Price, owner of the authorizing account <b>103</b> can use the controls <b>121</b> to designate Rob Jones, the owner of the wagering agent account <b>132</b>, as a wagering agent). The authorizing account <b>103</b> can designate more than one wagering agency account, and thus allows for more than one wagering agent. The multiple wagering agent accounts can utilize the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b>. The wagering account settings <b>111</b> can store setting values <b>119</b> that can be used to control how the wagering agent account <b>132</b> can use the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b>. The setting values <b>119</b> can indicate terms of use, such as a shared percentage of winnings and/or points that the wagering agent account <b>132</b> can have. Other terms of use can include, but are not limited to, a loss or &#x201c;stop&#x201d; limit that caps the amount of losses that the wagering agent account <b>132</b> can incur, a maximum amount of a single bet that the wagering agent account <b>132</b> is permitted to make, a window of opportunity for the wagering agent account <b>132</b> to place a bet, and a type of wagering activity that the wagering agent account <b>132</b> can be limited to (e.g., card games, slot games, etc.)</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A wagering agent player can log into a wagering game machine <b>162</b>, using the wagering agent account <b>132</b>, to play a wagering game. The wagering game can be displayed on a wagering game display <b>102</b>. The wagering game machine <b>162</b> can present a prompt screen <b>112</b>, to prompt the wagering agent player to utilize the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b> associated with the authorizing account <b>103</b>. The wagering game machine <b>162</b> can superimpose the prompt screen <b>112</b> above other display information, such as slot reels <b>104</b>. The wagering game display <b>102</b> can also include meters (e.g., bet meter <b>106</b>, credit meter <b>108</b>, etc.) and controls (e.g., spin button <b>110</b>), for controlling and tracking wagering game activities on the wagering game machine <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The terms of use can be displayed on the prompt screen <b>112</b>. The wagering agent player can agree to the terms of use, and then utilize the wagering agency fund to make wagers on the game. According to the terms of use, the authorizing account <b>103</b> can share some, none, or all of the winnings and/or community account points (&#x201c;points&#x201d;). The system <b>100</b> can also provide a way for the wagering agent account <b>132</b> to utilize only a portion of the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b> for bets, and still utilize a portion of the wagering agent account's own money. The system <b>100</b> can divide the winnings proportionate to the percentages of money used from the respective accounts. The system <b>100</b> can also provide a way for the wagering agent account <b>132</b> to use more than one wagering agency account. The system <b>100</b> can divide the game winnings amongst all authorizing accounts proportional to the amount of funds used from each of their respective wagering agency funds.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The computer <b>145</b> can be connected to a community server which can allow the authorizing account owner to access their account and see how their wagering agents are performing. The system <b>100</b> can even provide the ability to replay wagering game wins. Thus, the authorizing account owner can experience the thrill and excitement of wins without ever having to be in a casino.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, although the first player account <b>103</b> is described further above as an &#x201c;authorizing&#x201d; account, in some embodiments the first player account <b>103</b> can also be a wagering agent account.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to some embodiments, the wagering game system <b>100</b> can include numerous capabilities and configurations. The following non-exhaustive list enumerates some example capabilities and configurations
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0051">The system <b>100</b> can track multiple authorizing accounts adding to a single wagering agency fund. This configuration can build up the wagering agency fund to allow for larger bets.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0052">The system <b>100</b> can follow a lottery concept where if many authorizing accounts are contributing to a wagering agency fund, the system <b>100</b> can randomly select one authorizing account to receive a larger portion of the winnings.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0053">The system <b>100</b> can require a player to register with a wagering agent account (e.g., at a kiosk, at a wagering game machine, etc.) before being able to access wagering agency funds.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0054">The system <b>100</b> can provide settings on the wagering agent account that indicates who the wagering agent will funds from (e.g., from friends, from people who play the same types of games, etc.) and/or in what order to take funds from authorizing accounts (e.g., the system <b>100</b> could cycle through a buddy list for taking wagering agency funds).</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0055">The system <b>100</b> can also analyze behavior of wagering game agents and/or authorizing accounts and identify accounts, or automatically place bets, based on the analysis. For example, the system <b>100</b> can watch for &#x201c;lucky&#x201d; players who have had a streak of wins and then match the wagers of those &#x201c;lucky&#x201d; players.</li>
    </ul>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example Operations</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063">This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below, some flow diagrams are described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However, in some embodiments, the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0064">In certain embodiments, the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine-readable media (e.g., software), while in other embodiments, the operations can be performed by hardware and/or other logic (e.g., firmware). In some embodiments, the operations can be performed in series, while in other embodiments, one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover, some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in any flow diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating processing wagering agency funds, according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual diagram that helps illustrate the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to some embodiments. This description will present <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in concert with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the flow <b>300</b> begins at processing block <b>302</b>, where a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) detects a request from a wagering agent player account to utilize a shared wagering agency fund provided by an authorizing player account. For example, as described previously in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>100</b> presents a prompt screen <b>112</b> and detects whether the wagering agent account <b>132</b> requests to utilize the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b>. In some embodiments, a system can utilize a default setting where a wagering agent account can default to utilize a shared wagering agency fund without being prompted.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0066">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>304</b>, where the system makes the shared wagering agency fund available to the wagering agent account to wager on a wagering game. The system can make the shared wagering agency fund available per wager, or per an entire session. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the prompt screen <b>112</b> can include a setting that could prompt whether the wagering agent account <b>132</b> would like to bet using the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b> per wager. The system <b>100</b>, therefore, could make the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b> available for any wager that utilizes the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b>, and can re-prompt the wagering agent player for each wager made during the session. On the other hand, the system <b>100</b> can utilize the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b> per an entire game session, without re-prompting the wagering agent player to select the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b>. The system <b>100</b> can make the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b> available to the wagering agent account <b>132</b> without providing access to any other portion of the authorizing account <b>103</b>. The system <b>100</b> can make an accounting transaction that deducts a wager amount from an account server (e.g., account server <b>270</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that hosts the authorizing account <b>103</b>, causing the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b> to reduce in value by the wager amount. The wagering game machine <b>162</b> can then display an updated bet credit meter <b>106</b> showing a wager amount using funds, or more specifically credit values, transacted from the shared wagering agency fund <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>306</b>, where the system determines an award value from a wagering game. The system can determine a game result. For example a wagering game server (e.g., wagering game server <b>250</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) can have control logic that determines game results (e.g., wins, losses, bonuses, etc.). The wagering game server can determine a wagering game win amount, as well as any game points earned, bonus win amounts, etc. (referred to collectively as &#x201c;award values&#x201d;.) based on game logic. The wagering game server can communicate the award values to the system components (e.g. to the wagering game machine, to an account server, etc.). For example, the wagering game server could communicate the award values to the wagering game machine to update credit meters, point meters, etc., showing an increase in meter value. The wagering game server can also communicate the award values to an account server to perform allocation processes of wins, game points, or other awards obtained from the game.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0068">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>308</b>, where the system allocates a portion of the award value to the authorizing player account. The system can determine a percentage that the authorizing account earns, based on the pre-selected terms of use, for various award values. For example, the terms of use could indicate that the wagering agent account earns a specific percentage of the winnings (e.g., from 0% to 100%), of points, of bonus wins, etc. The system can calculate the percentages and allocate the award values between the authorizing account and the wagering agent account. For example, an account server can update an account balance on both the authorizing account and the wagering agent account based on the agreed terms of use. The system can also determine any other settings for controlling award values. For example, the authorized account may specify that a certain percentage of earnings from agency betting should go directly into a separate holding account, and not back into the shared wagering agency fund balance or the authorizing account balance.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating authorizing a wagering agent account to borrow or use wagering agency funds, according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a conceptual diagram that helps illustrate the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, according to some embodiments. This description will present <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in concert with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the flow <b>400</b> begins at processing block <b>402</b>, where a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) detects a request by a player account to borrow a wager amount on a wagering game. The system can provide a matchmaking service for players who are looking to gamble and people willing to invest in them. The system can provide account settings where a player can indicate what kinds of games they play, how they play them, what their past wagering history has been, etc. The system can also automatically analyze a player's history and determine statistical information about the types of games that a player plays, the winning results, etc. The system can provide account settings for the accounts that are willing to invest or lend funds to a player account. For brevity, wagering accounts that utilize funds from lenders (&#x201c;lending funds&#x201d;) or that utilize funds from investors (&#x201c;investment funds&#x201d;), may be referred to herein collectively as &#x201c;wagering agent accounts&#x201d;, similar to the wagering agent account <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each potential lender or investment account may be referred to herein specifically as a &#x201c;lending&#x201d; account or an &#x201c;investment&#x201d; account, depending on their specific roles or functions. The lending or investment accounts, however, can be referred to collectively as &#x201c;authorizing&#x201d; accounts, similar to the authorizing account <b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each authorizing account can have settings that indicate how much money they are willing to stake, their limits on losses or wins, what they want played, how lucky/skilled they want their wagering agent account to be, etc. The system can detect when a wagering agent account wants to utilize authorized funds. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) <b>500</b> includes a wagering game machine <b>560</b> connected to a communications network <b>522</b>. An account server <b>570</b> is also connected to the communications network <b>522</b>. A wagering game player can login to a wagering game account <b>503</b> using a wagering game machine <b>560</b>. The wagering game account <b>503</b> can also be referred to as a &#x201c;wagering agent account&#x201d; <b>503</b> because the owner of the account can potentially be a wagering agent for one or more authorizing accounts. The wagering game machine <b>560</b> can display information from the wagering agent account <b>503</b> as well as game session information in a display <b>502</b>. The wagering game machine <b>560</b> can display a prompt screen <b>505</b> that prompts the wagering game player to select to play a wagering game or shadow bet (shadow betting is described in more detail in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>). If a player selects to play a regular wagering game, then the prompt screen <b>505</b> can display additional settings that prompt the player to select from different wagering agency options. For example, the player can select to utilize a shared wagering agency fund (e.g., as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), or a different type of agency account, such as a lending or investment account.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0070">The flow <b>400</b> continues at processing block <b>404</b>, where the system determines game play history for the player account. The system can determine game play history of the wagering agent account. The game play history can include any information that an authorizing account would find important in determining whether to lend or invest funds in the wagering agent account. For example, the system can provide settings that an authorizing account can use to set requirements for lending and/or investment. The requirements can relate to minimum game play history criteria for any potential wagering agents. The requirements can relate to game history information such as a win percentage over a specific period of time, a type of game played, a level of gambling stability versus compulsiveness, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an authorizing account <b>502</b> with account settings <b>506</b> that indicate requirements for lending and/or investment criteria <b>508</b>. For example, some criteria <b>508</b> for the requirements may include a player win percentage being higher than a set value, for a specific game <b>504</b>, over a specific number of game plays. The account settings <b>506</b> can also provide settings for lending terms <b>510</b> and investing terms <b>512</b>. For example, if a wagering agent account meets the criteria <b>508</b>, then that player can choose to either borrow funds at the lending terms (e.g., borrow funds at 15% interest with a $100 borrowing limit) or to utilize investment funds at the investment terms (e.g., keep 2% of any winnings with a limit of $50 of usable funds). Investment funds are similar to shared wagering agency funds (described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), but the wagering agent may not necessarily be a social contact of the owner of the investor account.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0071">The flow <b>400</b> continues at processing block <b>406</b>, where the system determines one or more authorizing accounts that approve the request by the player account to borrow the wager amount. The system can utilize the game play history for the wagering agent account and search for potential authorizing accounts. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the system <b>500</b> searches the account server <b>570</b> to find the authorizing account <b>502</b> (e.g., the &#x201c;McCoy Group account&#x201d;). The system <b>500</b> compares the game play history for the wagering agent account <b>503</b> to see if the game play history meets the minimum requirements indicated in the criteria <b>508</b>. If the game play history comports with the criteria <b>508</b>, then the system <b>500</b> can tag the authorizing account <b>502</b> as an &#x201c;approving&#x201d; lender and/or investor for the wagering agent account <b>503</b>. In some embodiments, the system can automatically generate terms of use, such as interest rates. For example, the system can provide a range of requirements for game play history. If the wagering agent account's game play history meets criteria within the requirement range, then the system can automatically determine a risk score for providing funds to the wagering agent account. Based on the value of the risk score, the system can generate customized terms or use (e.g., custom interest rate, custom fund use limit, custom stop limits, etc.) for the wagering agent account.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0072">The flow <b>400</b> continues at processing block <b>408</b>, where the system presents the one or more authorizing accounts to the player account to select any one of the authorizing accounts. The system can present the authorizing accounts on a wagering game machine. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the system <b>500</b> presents the authorizing accounts in the approving accounts display <b>520</b>. The approving accounts display <b>520</b> can include controls for selecting a specific account and for selecting whether to borrow funds according to lending terms of use or to utilize investment funds according to investment fund terms of use. In some embodiments, the system can present controls that allow the wagering agent account to select more than one authorizing account. The system can calculate a percentage of wagers, winnings, limits, etc., between the different authorizing accounts and proportionately allocate award values to the multiple authorizing accounts.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating shadow betting on wagering agent accounts, according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a conceptual diagram that helps illustrate the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, according to some embodiments. This description will present <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in concert with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the flow <b>600</b> begins at processing block <b>602</b>, where a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) detects a request by a first player account to identify a second player account to shadow bet. In other words, the system can identify a first wagering game player, playing on a casino floor, so that a second player can wager on the first player's wagering game activities. The system can identify the first player based on specific rules, or criteria, that the second player has indicated using a player account. The second player can then place wagers in the background, based on the first player's playing activity, without the first player being aware of the background bets. In other words, the second player can &#x201c;shadow&#x201d; bet based on the first's players gambling efforts. Thus, the second player's account can be referred to specifically as a &#x201c;shadow&#x201d; betting account. The second player account can also be referred to as an &#x201c;authorizing&#x201d; account because the second player account is piggy-backing off of the first player's game play efforts; or, in other words, the second player account is designating, or &#x201c;authorizing&#x201d; the first player account as a wagering agent to perform the game playing activity. Consequently, the first player account can be referred to as a &#x201c;wagering agent account.&#x201d; In processing block <b>602</b>, the system can detect when the authorizing account requests that the system identify the wagering agent account. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a system <b>700</b> includes a wagering game machine <b>760</b> connected to a communication network <b>722</b>. A wagering game server <b>750</b> and an account server <b>770</b> are also connected to the communication network <b>722</b>. A player can login to the wagering game machine <b>760</b> using an authorizing account. The system <b>700</b> presents a control <b>703</b> on a display <b>701</b> to initiate a request to search for wagering agents that meet certain criteria settings (&#x201c;criteria&#x201d;) <b>707</b>. The criteria <b>707</b> can relate to game play history (e.g., past win/loss patterns, types of players, types of games, times of day, etc.) that can be used to identify potential wagering agent accounts. In some embodiments, the criteria <b>707</b> can relate to game play history of certain machines, or general statistical patterns of various players, that can relate to one or more specific players playing games on the casino floor.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0074">The flow <b>600</b> continues at processing block <b>604</b>, where the system searches a wagering game network to find the second player account whose wagering activity matches the one or more game criteria settings. The system can utilize the criteria to search the wagering game network. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the system <b>700</b> can store the criteria <b>707</b> in the account server <b>770</b> and search the wagering game server <b>750</b> to find any wagering game accounts actively playing wagering games on the network. The system <b>700</b> can compare the criteria <b>707</b> to game play history (including the most recent wagering activity) of the active wagering game accounts. The system <b>700</b> finds any active wagering game accounts (i.e., wagering agent accounts) whose game play history matches the criteria settings. The system <b>700</b> then presents the wagering agent accounts to the authorizing account. The authorizing account can then select the wagering agent accounts to shadow bet.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0075">The flow <b>600</b> continues at processing block <b>606</b>, where the system places a shadow bet on an active wagering activity performed by the second player account. The system can shadow bet with a variety of options including emulating the wagering agent's betting (e.g., if the wagering agent account bets $5, the authorizing account bets $5), betting a different wager amount (e.g., the wagering agent account bets $5, but the authorizing account bets $1), betting on trends, betting on theoretical holds being exceeded or closed in on over a time period, etc. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the system <b>700</b> can present bet settings <b>713</b> that the authorizing account can use to conduct the shadow betting options. The system can debit wager amounts from both the authorizing account and the wagering agent account before the game play begins. When the system finishes transacting the wager amounts placed by both accounts (or more if other shadow betters are also betting on the same wagering agent account), then the wagering agent can activate the game. For example, the system can prevent the activation of a control button that activates a game play (e.g., a &#x201c;spin&#x201d; button, a &#x201c;deal&#x201d; button, etc.) until all wagers have been transacted and updated on the account server.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0076">The flow <b>600</b> continues at processing block <b>608</b>, where the system utilizes game results for the active wagering activity as shadow bet results. The system can generate game results for the wagering agent's game. The game results will be a win, a loss, a draw, or some other result that applies to the specific game. Game logic in either the wagering game machine and/or the wagering game server controls the game results. The system can apply the game results to both the wagering agent's bet and to the shadow bet(s). For instance, if the wagering agent's game resulted in a win, then the authorizing account's bet could result in a win. In some embodiments, however, the system can provide contra-shadow-betting, or betting against the wagering agent's activities. In that case, the system can apply an opposing result to the contra-shadow-bets. The system can credit the respective accounts for wins or losses based on wager amounts. If the wager amounts were different (e.g., shadow bet was more or less than the wagering agent's bet), the system can calculate the appropriate win amounts and credit the accounts appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating utilizing a community wagering fund, according to some embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a flow <b>800</b> describes an embodiment where a player has some funds on a game session, but the funds are below a minimal playing amount. For example, the funds may be below the player's normal bet or below a minimum required bet. Consequently, the player has the option to transfer the remaining funds into a community wagering fund that anyone can draw from, or to pull from the community wagering fund to complete the bet. The community wagering fund is like a penny tray that a patron can give to if they have extra change, or draw from if short on a transaction amount. Flow <b>800</b> begins at block <b>802</b> where the system detects that a wagering game is being played on a wagering game machine. The player may have utilized most of the allocated player credits for the game session. At block <b>804</b>, the system detects that a session credit balance, on the machine, is below a specific amount to complete a wagering game bet. Consequently, at block <b>806</b>, the system can determine if a community wagering fund is available for the player to use, and if the community wagering fund has sufficient funds to complete the player's wager amount. The system can follow rules that may determine that the session credit balance meet a certain minimum percentage of the minimum bet. For instance, the system could have a limit set where the player's session credit balance should be at least 85% of the minimum required bet before the system will allow the player to utilize the money from the community wagering fund. If, at block <b>806</b>, the system determines that there are sufficient funds in the community wagering fund to complete the player's wager amount, the system, at block <b>808</b>, can prompt the player account if the player would like to take money from the community wagering fund. If the player decides to take from the community wagering fund, at block <b>810</b>, the system permanently removes the money from the community wagering fund and applies it to the wager credit balance on the wagering game machine. The system can then initiate the wager and determine a game result. The system applies any winnings from the wager to the player's account.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0078">If, however, at block <b>806</b>, there are not sufficient funds in the community wagering fund (according to the system rules), or if the player, at block <b>810</b>, decides not to use the community wagering fund, then, at block <b>814</b>, the system can prompt the player account if the player would like to contribute the remainder of the session credit balance to the community wagering fund. If the player, at block <b>816</b>, agrees to contribute, then, at block <b>818</b>, the system can allocate the contribution amount from the player account to the community wagering fund, and player doesn't have an awkward, small number of wagering credits to cash out. The community wagering fund, in some embodiments, can be funded by a progressive, which on each wager, takes a small percentage of each bet and puts it in the community wagering fund for later use. In some embodiments, the community wagering fund can be machine specific, each machine having its own community wagering fund to draw from. On the other hand, in some embodiments, the community wagering fund can be accessible by any machine on a wagering game network.</p>
