<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-250311 filed on Nov. 8, 2010. The contents of this application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a gaming machine that is capable of repeatedly executing a unit game.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A gaming machine adapted to repeatedly execute a unit game is proposed, the gaming machine being adapted to display an additional symbol to a symbol that is displayed on a display (for example, refer to United Patent Application No. 61/023,483 (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-open No. 2009-172350) and United State Patent Application No. 61/027,613 (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-open No. 2009-183671). In addition, there is provided a gaming machine adapted to repeatedly execute a unit game in which the routine migrates from one bonus game to another bonus game (for example, refer to United State Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0081493).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, slot machines that are installed in casinos outside Japan include the one that allows a player to execute a second game or the like, in addition to a basic game to be played in such a manner that symbols to be stopped after reel rotation are rearranged and the amount of prize is determined. In these slot machines, it is determined whether or not the routine is caused to migrate to the second game by means of lottery in the basic game, and then, the second game is executed according to a result of the lottery. Therefore, players have been merely allowed to have a simple entertaining option of whether or not the routine is caused to migrate to the second game.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, in conventional slot machines, a payout rate is set to be comparatively low, which has caused a lowered popularity of the slot machines.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Slot machines that are capable of changing a payout rate in gaming facilities such as casinos have been conventionally known as well. Each of such slot machines has a switch for changing the payout rate. In the gaming facilities, after closing their shops, the staffs can change setting of the payout rate by operating the switch in accordance with a play situation in the gaming facilities. However, players cannot directly check whether the payout rate is highly set or is lowly set. Therefore, even in a case where the payout rate has been highly set, players cannot be informed of the fact, and it has been a low possibility that a player can enjoy game at a slot machine at which the payout rate is highly set. Accordingly, even in the case where the payout rate has been highly set, players who visit the gaming facilities cannot always enjoy game, the number of players who play at slot machines cannot always be increased, and it has been difficult to increase sales in gaming facilities exerted by slot machines.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made in order to solve the conventional problem described above, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a gaming machine that is capable of causing a player to be realistically informed of a payout rate and that is capable of having a variety of entertaining options by means of a variety of games.</p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In this configuration, when the routine migrates to a bonus game, a specific symbol that can be employed in place of another symbol is displayed to be substituted for any of symbols to be scrolled, by means of random determination, whereby there arises a possibility that a prize to be awarded to a player increases every time the specific symbol is entered. Image rendering is made, indicating that a specific symbol is entered into a symbol to be scrolled, whereby a possibility of an increase of a prize to be awarded to a player can be displayed more clearly by way of image. That is, a player can be realistically informed of a payout rate.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In addition, it is randomly determined whether or not the routine migrates to another bonus game subsequent to the completion of this bonus game, thereby enabling a player to be given a sense of expectation that a specific symbol is entered and a sense of expectation that the routine may migrate to another bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram for explaining an outline of an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in a gaming machine according to the embodiment of the present invention, it is determined whether or not the routine is caused to migrate to a bonus game in bonus game trigger determination processing.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In the bonus game trigger determination processing, it is determined whether or not the routine is caused to migrate to a three continuous WILD symbols game. The three continuous WILD symbols game is a game in which, from among two upper and lower image display panels (an upper image display panel <b>131</b> (to be described later) and a lower image display panel <b>141</b> (to be described later)), in a state in which video reels that are displayed on the image display panel that is provided on a lower side are hidden, after rendering has been executed in such a manner that a shadow is displayed on its back side, three continuous WILD symbols are displayed on the reel on which the shadow has been displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">From the three continuous WILD symbols game, it is determined whether the routine migrates to a three options bonus game or whether a prize is awarded and then a bonus game completes, by means of lottery. The three options bonus game is a game to which the routine migrates, directly from the bonus game trigger determination processing or via the three continuous WILD symbols game. The three options bonus game is a game to which the routine can migrate, in a case where three bonus symbols have been displayed in a stopped state on any of the video reels that are displayed on the lower image display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In the three options bonus game, there may be a case in which video reels are re-scrolled in a state in which two bonus symbols have been rearranged. In this re-scrolling, while at least one reel on which two bonus symbols have been displayed in a stopped state is maintained in its fixed state, the remaining reels are re-scrolled after re-lottery has been performed. In this manner, even if re-lottery has been performed without changing a probability table to be employed when such re-lottery has been performed, there can be increased a probability that three bonus symbols are arranged as a while after such re-lottery (re-scroll) has been performed.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">If three bonus symbols are displayed in a stopped state in the three options bonus game, a player is given an opportunity of selecting any of the three bonus symbols that have been displayed in a stopped state. When any of the bonus symbols is selected, a first bonus game (a Koharu bonus game), a second bonus game (a Konatsu bonus game), or a third bonus game (a Koyuki bonus game) is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The first bonus game is a game in which no other player can participate and a prize is randomly determined. Specifically, this bonus game is a game in which a prize according to a playing time of the first bonus game is awarded to a winning player.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The second bonus game is a game in which no other player can participate and a prize is randomly determined. In the second bonus game, one or two WILD symbols are arranged on each reel in each unit game and then scrolling is performed. A prize according to a total number of WILD symbols arranged after a plurality of unit games is awarded to a winning player. In the first and second bonus games described above, lottery is performed as to whether or not the routine is caused to migrate to the third bonus game after the first and second bonus games have been played.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The third bonus game is a game in which at least one player can participate. This game is executed in a case where a player has made a selection in the three options bonus game or in a case where it is determined that the routine migrates to the third bonus game, by means of lottery in the first and second bonus games.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In the third bonus game, a lower image display panel (a touch panel) is employed for operational input from a player, and the contents of the progress of a game are displayed on an upper image display panel. In the upper image display panel, in accordance with the progress of a game responsive to an input operation of the player, a display relating to the game moves from its lower part to its upper part. In this manner, a game starts from a lower part of the upper image display panel, which is close to the lower image display panel having displayed thereon video reels to which a player pays attention in a normal game, and then, the above display moves in an upward direction, whereby movement of the player's eye is lessened, enabling the player to naturally pay his or her attention to the contents of the game.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In addition, in the upper image display panel, the game advances from the bottom to the top, and the relevant top and bottom areas are utilized to be able to avoid an increase in size in a horizontal direction of the image display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">After a goal has been reached in the third bonus game, any of items of awarding of prize in the third bonus game, migration to the first bonus game, and migration to the second bonus game, as the result of the goal, is selected by means of lottery. If an item of migration to the first or second bonus game has been selected, as described above the routine may migrate to the third bonus game after the first or second bonus game has been played. In this way, a loop of migrating from the third bonus game to the first or second bonus game and further migrating to the third bonus game may be occasionally formed. This loop may be occasionally repeated a predetermined number of times (for example, five times) that is defined as its upper limit. This loop completes in a case where a lottery result has not been obtained, the lottery result indicating that the routine migrates to the first or second bonus game after a goal has been reached in the third bonus game, or the lottery result indicating that the routine migrates to the third bonus game in the first or second bonus game, or alternatively, in a case where a specific game result has been obtained partway of the third bonus game (for example, in a case where a specific character has appeared).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">[Explanation of Function Flow Diagram]</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, basic functions of the gaming machine according to the present embodiment are described.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">&#x3c;Coin-Insertion/Start-Check&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">First, the gaming machine checks whether or not a BET button has been pressed by the player, and subsequently checks whether or not a spin button has been pressed by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">&#x3c;Symbol Determination&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Next, when the spin button has been pressed by the player, the gaming machine extracts random values for symbol determination, and determines symbols to be displayed at the time of stopping scrolling of symbol arrays for the player, for a plurality of respective video reels displayed to a display.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">&#x3c;Symbol Display&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Next, the gaming machine starts scrolling of the symbol array of each of the video reels and then stops scrolling so that the determined symbols are displayed for the player.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">&#x3c;Winning Determination&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">When scrolling of the symbol array of each video reel has been stopped, the gaming machine determines whether or not a combination of symbols displayed for the player is a combination related to winning.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">&#x3c;Payout&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">When the combination of symbols displayed for the player is a combination related to winning, the gaming machine offers benefits according to the combination to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">For example, when a combination of symbols related to a payout of coins has been displayed, the gaming machine pays out coins of the number corresponding to the combination of symbols to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Further, when a combination of symbols (trigger symbols) related to a free game trigger has been displayed the gaming machine starts the free game. In the embodiment, as a bonus game, a game (a free game) is performed in such a manner that lottery according to determination of to-be-stopped symbols described previously is performed over a predetermined number of times without consuming a coin.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">When a combination of symbols related to a jackpot trigger is displayed, the gaming machine pays out coins in an amount of jackpot to the player. The jackpot refers to a function which accumulates parts of coins used by players at the respective gaming machines as the amount of jackpot and which, when the jackpot trigger has been established in any of the gaming machines, pays out coins of the accumulated amount of jackpot to that gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In each game, the gaming machine calculates the amount (amount for accumulation) to be accumulated to the amount of jackpot and transmits to an external control device. The external control device accumulates to the amount of jackpot the amounts for accumulation transmitted from the respective gaming machines.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Further, in addition to the aforementioned benefits, the gaming machine is provided with benefits such as a mystery bonus and insurance.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The mystery bonus is a bonus in which a predetermined amount of coins are paid out for winning of a lottery that is intended for the mystery bonus. When the spin button has been pressed, the gaming machine extracts a random value for mystery bonus and determines whether or not to establish a mystery bonus by lottery.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The insurance is a function provided for a purpose of relieving the player from a situation in which a free game has not been played for long periods of time. In the present embodiment, the player can arbitrarily select whether or not to make the insurance effective. Making insurance effective requires a predetermined insurance-purchase amount to be paid in exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In the case where the insurance has been made effective, the gaming machine starts counting the number of games. The gaming machine conducts a payout of coins of the amount that is set for the insurance, when the number of counted games has reached a previously determined number of times without a large amount of payout relating to a free game or the like being conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">&#x3c;Determination of Effects&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The gaming machine produces effects by displaying images to the display, outputting the light from lamps, and outputting sounds from speakers. The gaming machine extracts a random value for effect and determines contents of the effects based on the symbols and the like determined by lottery.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">[Overall Game System]</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The basic functions of the gaming machine have been described above. Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a game system including the gaming machine is described.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">A game system <b>300</b> includes the plurality of gaming machines <b>1</b>, and an external control device <b>200</b> that is connected to each of the gaming machines <b>1</b> through a communication line <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The external control device <b>200</b> is for controlling the plurality of gaming machines <b>1</b>. In the present embodiment, the external control device <b>200</b> is a so-called hall server which is installed in a game facility having the plurality of gaming machines <b>1</b>. Each of the gaming machines <b>1</b> is provided with a unique identification number, and the external control device <b>200</b> identifies transmission sources of data transmitted from the respective gaming machines <b>1</b> by using the identification numbers. Also in the case where the external control device <b>200</b> transmits data to a gaming machine <b>1</b>, the identification numbers are used for specifying the transmission destination.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">It is to be noted that the game system <b>300</b> may be constructed within a single game facility where various games can be conducted, such as a casino, or may be constructed among a plurality of game facilities. Further, when the game system <b>300</b> is constructed in a single game facility, the game system <b>300</b> may be constructed in each floor or section of the game facility. The communication line <b>301</b> may be a wired or wireless line, and can adopt a dedicated line, an exchange line or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">[Overall Configuration of Gaming Machine]</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The game system according to the present embodiment has been described above. Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an overall configuration of the gaming machine <b>1</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">A coin, a bill, or electrically valuable information corresponding to these is used as a game medium in the gaming machine <b>1</b>. Further, in the present embodiment, a later-described ticket with a barcode is also used. It is to be noted that the game medium is not limited to these, and for example a medal, a token, electric money or the like can be adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The gaming machine <b>1</b> includes a cabinet <b>11</b>, a top box <b>12</b> installed on the upper side of the cabinet <b>11</b>, and a main door <b>13</b> provided at the front face of the cabinet <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">A lower image display panel <b>141</b> is provided at the center of the main door <b>13</b>. The lower image display panel <b>141</b> includes a liquid crystal panel, and forms the display. The lower image display panel <b>141</b> has a symbol display region <b>4</b>. To the symbol display region <b>4</b>, five video reels <b>3</b> (<b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>c</i>, <b>3</b><i>d</i>, <b>3</b><i>e</i>) are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">In the present embodiment, a video reel depicts through videos the rotational and stop motions of a mechanical reel having a plurality of symbols drawn on the peripheral surface thereof. To each of the video reels <b>3</b>, a symbol array comprised of a previously determined plurality (22 symbols in the present embodiment) of symbols is assigned (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> which is described later).</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">In the symbol display region <b>4</b>, the symbol arrays assigned to the respective video reels <b>3</b> are separately scrolled, and are stopped after predetermined time has elapsed. As a result, a part (three consecutive symbols in the present embodiment) of each of the symbol arrays is displayed for the player.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The symbol display region <b>4</b> has three regions, namely an upper region, an upper central region, a lower central region, and a lower region, for each video reel <b>3</b>, and a single symbol is to be displayed to each region. That is, fifteen (=five columns&#xd7;three symbols) symbols are to be displayed in the symbol display region <b>4</b>. In the present embodiment, a line formed by selecting one of the aforementioned three regions for each of the video reels <b>3</b> and connecting the respective regions is referred to as a winning line.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">It is to be noted that any desired shape of the winning line can be adopted, and examples of the shape of the winning line may include a straight line formed by connecting the upper central regions for the respective video reels <b>3</b>, a V-shaped line, and a bent line. Also, any desired number of lines can be adopted, and the number can be for example 30 lines.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In addition, the lower image display panel <b>141</b> has a number-of-credits display region <b>142</b> and a number-of-payouts display region <b>143</b>. The number-of-credits display region <b>142</b> is configured to display the number of coins that are owned by a player and are deposited inside a gaming machine <b>1</b> (hereinafter, referred to as the number of credits). In addition, the number-of-payouts display region <b>143</b> is configured to display the number of coins to be paid out to a player when a winning prize has been established (hereinafter, referred to as the number of payouts).</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The lower image display panel <b>141</b> has a built-in touch panel <b>114</b>. The player can input various commands by touching the lower image display panel <b>141</b>. On the lower side of the lower image display panel <b>141</b>, there are arranged various buttons set in a control panel <b>30</b>, and various devices to be operated by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">A spin button <b>31</b> is used when starting scrolling of the symbol arrays of the respective video reels <b>3</b>. A change button <b>32</b> is used when requesting a game facility staff member to exchange money. A CASHOUT button <b>33</b> is used when paying out the coins retained inside the gaming machine <b>1</b> to a coin tray <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">A high power button <b>38</b> is also employed when a player operates to thereby start scrolling of symbol arrays of each video reel <b>3</b>. When the player has operated a spin button <b>31</b>, a unit game is started in a normal state (hereinafter, referred to as a non-high power state). On the other hand, when the player has operated the high power button <b>38</b>, a high power state is established and then a unit game is started.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The high power state is a state in which a payout rate is higher than that set when the non-high power state is established. A high payout rate is established by increasing a winning probability in bonus game by re-scrolling other reels while leaving bonus symbols displayed in a stopped state in a bonus game to be described later. By doing this, a payout rate can be increased without a need to change the winning probability in lottery processing.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">A payout rate is referred to as a value obtained by dividing the number of coins or the number of credits paid out to a player as a result of executing a unit game by the number of coins or the number of credits determined (betted) to start a unit game. A state in which the payout rate is high is a state in which more coins or credits have been seemingly paid out. The state in which the payout rate is high is a state which is advantageous to a player, but is disadvantageous to a gaming facility. On the other hand, a state in which the payout rate is low is a state in which lesser coins or credits have been seemingly paid out. The state in which the payout rate is low is a state which is disadvantageous to a player, but is advantageous to a gaming facility.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">A unit game is a game from start of symbol scroll-display or rearrangement to symbol display in a stopped state. The unit game may be started when a player has operated BET buttons such as a 1-BET button <b>34</b> and a MAX-BET button <b>35</b> or five BET buttons <b>39</b><i>a </i>to <b>39</b><i>e</i>. In addition, the unit game may be started when the spin button <b>31</b> or the high power button <b>38</b> has been operated. Further, the unit game may be completed when payout of a prize responsive to a combination of symbols that are displayed in a stopped state has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The high power state or the non-high power state can be determined according to a value of a flag that is stored in a RAM <b>73</b> of a motherboard <b>70</b> to be described later. When the high power state is established, the flag value is set to 1, or alternatively, when the non-high power state is established, the flag value is set to 0. When the high power state is established, a player operates the spin button <b>31</b> to be thereby able to return the current state to the non-high power state. A processing operation of returning the high power state to the non-high power state will be described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">When a game state of a unit game is in a basic game state, it is preferable that a player operate the high power button <b>38</b> to thereby establish the high power state. In this case, no high power state is established even if the high power button <b>38</b> is operated when there is established a bonus game state or a free game state which is more advantageous to a player than the basic game state. By doing thus, a profit to be given a player is given can be restrained, making it possible to prevent a deficit from which a gaming facility may suffer. On the other hand, even when a bonus game state or a free game state is established, a high power state may be established. In such a case, a player can be given a higher profit to be able to attract the player's interest to a game.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">A 1-BET button <b>34</b> and a maximum BET button <b>35</b> are used for determining the number of coins (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;the number of BETs&#x201d;) to be used in the game from the coins retained inside the gaming machine <b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0232" num="0231">The overall configuration of the gaming machine <b>1</b> has been described above. Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a configuration of the symbol arrays included in the video reels <b>3</b> of the gaming machine <b>1</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The symbol table for normal game shows the arrangements of symbols drawn on the peripheral surfaces of the reels. A first video reel <b>3</b><i>a</i>, a second video reel <b>3</b><i>b</i>, a third video reel <b>3</b><i>c</i>, a fourth video reel <b>3</b><i>e</i>, and a fifth video reel <b>3</b><i>d </i>each is assigned with a respective one of symbol arrays (a first symbol group, a second symbol group, a third symbol group, a fourth symbol group, and a fifth symbol group), consisting of 22 symbols that correspond to respective code numbers from &#x201c;00&#x201d; to &#x201c;21&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">As kinds of symbols, a plurality of kinds of symbols including &#x201c;JACKPOT <b>7</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;bonus symbols&#x201d; are provided. These kinds of symbols are fewer than the number of symbols on each reel (22 symbols), whereby a plurality of symbols of a same kind may also be assigned to one reel. According to the number of assignments, a winning probability in a case where symbols have formed a combination is different from another one, and the number of payouts is set in accordance with the winning probability. That is, in a case where fewer assigned symbols have formed a combination, more payouts are realized.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">[Configuration of Circuit Included in Gaming Machine]</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">The configuration of the symbol arrays included in the video reels <b>3</b> of the gaming machine <b>1</b> has been described above. Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a configuration of a circuit included in the gaming machine <b>1</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">A gaming board <b>50</b> is provided with: a CPU <b>51</b>, a ROM <b>52</b>, and a boot ROM <b>53</b>, which are mutually connected by an internal bus; a card slot <b>55</b> corresponding to a memory card <b>54</b>; and an IC socket <b>57</b> corresponding to a GAL (Generic Array Logic) <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The memory card <b>54</b> includes a non-volatile memory, and stores a game program and a game system program. The game program includes a program related to game progression, a lottery program, and a program for producing effects by images and sounds (e.g. see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> which are described later). Further, the aforementioned game program includes data specifying the configuration of the symbol array assigned to each video reel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">The lottery program is a program for determining to-be stopped symbol of each video reel <b>3</b> by lottery. The to-be stopped symbol is data for determining three symbols to be displayed to the symbol display region <b>4</b> out of the 22 symbols forming each symbol array. The gaming machine <b>1</b> of the present embodiment determines as the to-be stopped symbol the symbol to be displayed in a predetermined region (the upper region) out of the three regions provided for each of the video reels <b>3</b> of the symbol display region <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">The aforementioned lottery program includes symbol determination data. The symbol determination data is data that specifies random values so that each of the 22 symbols (code numbers from &#x201c;00&#x201d; to &#x201c;21&#x201d;) forming the symbol array is determined at an equal probability (i.e. 1/22), for each video reel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">The probabilities of the respective 22 symbols being determined are basically equal. However, the numbers of the respective types of symbols included in the 22 symbols vary, and thus the probabilities of the respective types of symbols being determined vary (i.e. different weights on the probabilities are generated). For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the symbol array of the first video reel <b>3</b><i>a </i>includes one symbol of &#x201c;JACKPOT <b>7</b>&#x201d;, and includes seven symbols of predetermined. Hence, the former is determined at the probability of &#x201c;1/22&#x201d;, whereas the latter is determined at the probability of &#x201c;7/22&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">It is to be noted that, although the data specifies that the equal numbers of symbols be provided to form the symbol arrays of the respective video reels <b>3</b> in the present embodiment, different numbers of symbols may form the respective video reels <b>3</b>. For example, the symbol array of the first video reel <b>3</b><i>a </i>may consist of 22 symbols whereas the symbol array of the second video reel <b>3</b><i>b </i>may consist of 30 symbols. Such a configuration increases the degree of freedom in setting the probabilities of the respective types of symbols being determined for each video reel <b>3</b>.</p>

Then, according to a winning combination, a prize such as payout of coins or start of a bonus game is awarded to a winning player. In a case where a combination of symbols that are displayed on a winning line does not coincide with any the symbol combinations that are specified in accordance with the symbol combination table, no winning combination (so called losing) is established.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Basically a winning prize is established in a case where symbols of any kind have been displayed to be rearranged on a winning line. With respect to specific symbols, however, a winning prize is also established in a case where they have been displayed on a winning line according to one or three video reels <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">For example, in a case where the third symbols have been displayed to be arranged on a winning line according to all of the video reels <b>3</b>, a winning combination is formed as a third winning combination and then &#x201c;10&#x201d; is determined as the number of payouts. A payout of coins is then performed based on the determined number of payouts. The payout of coins is performed by actually discharging coins from a coin payout exit <b>15</b>A, adding to the number of credits, or issuing a barcode ticket.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">The first symbol is a jackpot trigger. In a case where the first symbols have been displayed to be rearranged on a winning line according to all of the video reels <b>3</b>, a winning combination is formed as a &#x201c;jackpot&#x201d; and then the amount of jackpot is determined as the number of payouts.</p>

<p id="p-0279" num="0278">First, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, main control processing is described. First, when the power is supplied to the gaming machine <b>1</b>, the main CPU <b>71</b> reads the authenticated game program and game system program from the memory card <b>54</b> through the gaming board <b>50</b>, and writes the programs into the RAM <b>73</b> (step S<b>11</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Next, the main CPU <b>71</b> conducts at-one-game-end initialization processing (step S<b>12</b>).

In this processing operation, in a case where a winning combination (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is established in accordance with the symbols displayed in a stopped state, a prize according to the established winning combination is awarded to a winning prize. In this manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, two bonus symbols B<b>1</b> are displayed in a stopped state in the symbol display region <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">The main CPU <b>71</b> then performs lottery as to whether or not to execute re-scrolling (step S<b>313</b>). Re-scrolling to be described later is a processing operation to be executed by means of lottery in a case where two bonus symbols are included in the symbols displayed in a stopped state in the symbol display region <b>4</b>, and the main CPU <b>71</b> executes lottery as to whether or not to perform re-scrolling in step S<b>313</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">The probability table that is employed in lottery processing of step S<b>313</b> is provided in plurality, and among these tables, there is obtained a probability table in which a probability that re-scrolling is executed is set to be higher as more BETs are placed. That is, the main CPU <b>71</b> determines which probability table is to be employed, based on a value of a number-of-BETs counter that has been added in accordance with the number of BETs, in coin insertion/start check processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">The main CPU <b>71</b> determines a lottery result indicating whether or not to execute re-scrolling (step S<b>314</b>). If a lottery result indicating that no more re-scrolling is executed is obtained, the main CPU <b>71</b> completes the bonus game processing by obtaining a negative result in step S<b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">On the other hand, if a lottery result indicating that re-scrolling is executed is obtained, the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>314</b> to step S<b>315</b> by obtaining an affirmative result in step S<b>314</b>, sets a unit game time so as to be reduced, and then in a reduced state, performs re-lottery for the symbols to be displayed in a stopped state in the symbol display region <b>4</b> as to video reels other than those including two bonus symbols having stopped in the symbol display region <b>4</b> (step S<b>316</b>). This re-lottery is performed without changing a probability table that is employed in symbol lottery. As the method of reducing a unit game time, a method or the like of reducing a scroll time of each video reel is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">In this way, symbol lottery is performed as to only video reels other than those on which at least one bonus symbol has stopped, whereby even if symbol lottery is performed without changing a probability table (without changing a lottery probability of each symbol), a probability that three bonus symbols are rearranged can be increased as to all of the video reels (as to all symbols on five reels). For example, in a state in which two bonus symbols stop in the symbol display region <b>4</b>, symbol lottery is performed as to only the remaining video reels other than those on which at least one bonus symbol stops in the symbol display region <b>4</b>, whereby if one bonus symbol is selected in the remaining video reel, a total of three bonus symbols are rearranged as to all of the video reels that are displayed in the symbol display region <b>4</b>. Therefore, there can be increased a probability that three bonus symbols are rearranged as a result of lottery in the re-lottery (re-scroll) processing.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">Thus, in a case where the high power button is further operated to be turned on in a state two bonus symbols are rearranged, there occurs a possibility that three bonus symbols are arranged at a high probability as a whole. As a method of increasing a probability that bonus symbols are rearranged at the time of re-scrolling, there may be employed a reel on which more bonus symbols have been assigned or there may be reduced the number of symbols other than bonus symbols in each reel.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">In the embodiment, a player can be given a profit by means of a game having a probability that three bonus symbols are rearranged, and in the re-lottery (re-scroll) game, a unit game time is reduced and then the progress of the game is accelerated, whereby a profit of a gaming facility can be increased, and a balance between the profits of the player and the gaming facility can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">When re-lottery processing completes, the main CPU <b>71</b> scrolls video reels other than those on which at least one bonus symbol which should be displayed in a stopped state in the symbol display region <b>4</b> has already been displayed in a stopped state in the symbol display region <b>4</b> and then stops the symbols that are determined by means of lottery so as to be displayed in a stopped state in the symbol display region <b>4</b>.

<p id="p-0350" num="0349">In this way, in a case where one bonus symbol has appeared in a first scroll, a condition for re-scrolling other symbols while leaving bonus symbols as they are is not met, whereby bonus symbol processing is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">On the other hand, in a case where the high power button <b>38</b> has not been operated, the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>307</b> to step S<b>320</b> by obtaining a negative result in step S<b>307</b>, scrolls all of the symbols in the symbol display region <b>4</b>, and then, stops the symbols that are determined by means of lottery so as to be displayed in a stopped state in the symbol display region <b>4</b>.

In the case where the player has selected the first shop (the Tempura House), the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine from step S<b>485</b> to step S<b>486</b> by obtaining an affirmative result in step S<b>485</b>; displays an image of the first mini-game in the lower image display panel <b>141</b>; and then, executes the first mini-game. For example, in the first mini-game, the player is caused to select one Tempura from among three different kinds of Tempuras and then execute a game in which a prize according to the selected Tempura is awarded to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">On the other hand, in a case where the player has not selected the first shop (the Tempura House), the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine from step S<b>485</b> to step S<b>487</b> by obtaining a negative result in step S<b>485</b> and then determines whether or not the game selected by the player is the second mini-game. In a case where the player has selected the second shop (the Japanese Tea Lounge), the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>487</b> to step S<b>488</b> by obtaining an affirmative result in step S<b>487</b>; displays an image of the second mini-game in the lower image display panel <b>141</b>; and then, executes the second mini-game. For example, in the second game, the player is caused to select one Japanese teacup from three different kinds of Japanese teacups and then execute a game in which a prize according to the selected Japanese teacup is awarded to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">While the amounts of the prizes to be awarded to the player according to a game result are different from each other in the first mini-game executed in the step S<b>486</b> described above and the second mini-game executed in the step S<b>488</b> described above, the average amount of prizes is the same in these two mini-games. For example, while variation margin of prizes in three Tempuras selected in the first mini-game are greater than those in three Japanese teacups selected in the second mini-game, the average amount of prizes in the three Tempuras selected in the first mini-game is identical to that in the three Japanese teacups selected in the second mini-game.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">The main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate to step S<b>489</b> subsequent to the processing operation of the step S<b>486</b> described above or subsequent to the processing operation of the step S<b>488</b> described above and then awards to the player a prize according to a result of the mini-game.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">On the other hand, in a case where the player has selected neither of the first shop (the Tempura House) and the second shop (the Japanese Tea Lounge) in the step S<b>483</b> described above, the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>487</b> to step S<b>490</b> by obtaining a negative result in step S<b>487</b>. Step S<b>490</b> is a processing operation of displaying a landscape image in a region that is indicative of a crossing point according to the progress of a game, on the lower image display panel <b>141</b>. For example, in a case where the CPU <b>71</b> has caused the routine to migrate to step S<b>490</b> by obtaining the negative result in step S<b>487</b>, the fact designates that the player has selected a crossing point indicating an upward direction, in a selection operation made in the region P<b>1</b> that is indicative of the start point. The main CPU <b>71</b> displays a selection operation image in the cross point, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, in the lower image display panel <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">In addition, after the first mini-game in step S<b>486</b> has been executed, or alternatively, after the second mii-game in step S<b>488</b> has been executed, a game moves to a respective one of the corresponding crossing points (a region P<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>) that is indicative of a crossing point after the first mini-game or a region P<b>6</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>) that is indicative of a crossing point after the second mini-game), and in response to this movement, in step S<b>490</b>, a selection operation image in the cross point, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, is displayed on the lower image display panel <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">After the selection operation image has been displayed at the crossing point according to the progress of a game in the lower image display panel <b>141</b> (step S<b>490</b>), the main CPU <b>71</b> waits for the player to make an input operation (a selection operation). The selection operation image (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>) that has been displayed in the lower image display panel <b>141</b> includes images D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> that are indicative of shadows of a plurality of guides. When the player operates to press any of the images D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b>, the main CPU <b>71</b> determines that the player's selection is any of the images D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b>, based on an output signal that is output from the touch panel <b>114</b> in response to this press operation.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">In a case where the player has made no selection operation, the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine from step S<b>491</b> to step S<b>490</b> described above by obtaining a negative result in step S<b>491</b> and then continues display of the selection operation image (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>). On the other hand, in a case where the player has made any selection operation, the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>491</b> to step S<b>492</b> by obtaining an affirmative result in step S<b>491</b> and then displays an image according to the input operation (the selection operation) on the lower image display panel <b>141</b>. For example, in a case where the image D<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>) has been selected, a good guider appears in response to the selected image D<b>1</b> and then the player is guided to advance in an upward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0428">For example, in the region P<b>5</b> that is indicative of a crossing point, a game advances to a region P<b>9</b> that is indicative of a crossing point that is in the upward direction; in the region P<b>6</b> that is indicative of a crossing point, a game advances to a region P<b>10</b> that is indicative of a crossing point that is in the upward direction; and in the region P<b>2</b> that is indicative of a crossing point, a game advances to a region P<b>11</b> that is indicative of a crossing point that is in the upward direction. In this manner, in a case where a good guider has appeared in accordance with the player selection, a game advances to the top that is a goal in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game).</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0429">On the other hand, in a case where the player has selected the image D<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>), for example, a guide appears in response to the selected image D<b>2</b>, the player is guided to a shop in a transverse direction, and then, in the shop to which the player has been guided, a further new selection operation image is displayed on the lower image display panel <b>141</b>. On this new selection operation image, a plurality of former Japanese courtesan called &#x201c;Oiran&#x201d; shadows are displayed on a Former Japanese paper sliding door, and when the player selects any of them, the routine advances to a game according to the selection. For example, if a specific Japanese Geisha girl appears, a predetermined prize is awarded; if a former Japanese courtesan called &#x201c;Oiran&#x201d; appears, roulette lottery is executed; or if a thief appears, the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) completes. Different kinds of prizes are set depending on these characters.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0430">On the other hand, in a case where the player has selected the image D<b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>), for example, a thief appears in response to the selected image D<b>3</b> and then the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) completes.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">On the other hand, in a case where the player has selected the image D<b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>), for example, a former Japanese courtesan called &#x201c;Oiran&#x201d; appears in response to the selected image D<b>4</b> and then roulette lottery is executed. In this roulette lottery, a roulette is displayed on the lower image display panel <b>141</b> and then a prize is determined and awarded by means of this roulette.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432">When any of the images D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> is selected in this way, the main CPU <b>71</b> displays an image of a character according to the selected image, on the lower image display panel <b>141</b>, and then, advances a game in accordance with the selected image. In addition, the main CPU <b>71</b> awards a prize according to the selected image from among the images D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> to a winning player (step S<b>493</b>). Further, the main CPU <b>71</b> changes a light emitting device in the upper image display panel <b>131</b> in response to an input operation (a selection operation) (in response to advance of the game) made by the player (step S<b>494</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0433">After the main CPU <b>71</b> has caused the routine to move from a crossing point to a shop in a transverse direction by means of selection of any of the images D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b>, the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to advance in the transverse direction as is and then move to another crossing point. For example, after the player has selected any of the images D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> at a crossing point P<b>5</b>, a game is executed in a shop P<b>7</b> in the transverse direction of the crossing point P<b>5</b>, the routine in the game is then advanced to a crossing point P<b>2</b> that is provided in the transverse direction of the shop P<b>7</b>. That is, when a shop in the transverse direction is selected at a crossing point, after the game has completed in the shop, the routine advances in a direction opposite to a direction in which the routine has reached the shop. Specifically, in a case where the routine has advanced from the crossing point P<b>5</b> to the shop P<b>7</b> in accordance with the player selection, after the game has completed in the shop P<b>7</b>, the routine advances from the shop P<b>7</b> to the crossing point P<b>2</b>, or alternatively, in a case where the routine has advanced from the crossing point P<b>2</b> to the shop P<b>7</b>, after the game has completed in the shop P<b>7</b>, the routine advances from the shop P<b>7</b> to the crossing point P<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">In this way, if the game in the shop in the transverse direction is selected in a selection operation of any of the images D<b>1</b> to D<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>), the routine advances in a transverse direction that is different from an upward direction in which the routine should advance to a goal, and as a result, more time is required for migration to a lottery game to be played after the goal has been reached, the lottery game suggesting a possibility that a player may obtain a greater prize. In this manner, in a case where a route going up to the goal becomes a roundabout way, there may be a case in which a prize is obtained by means of a game in shop in that route or there may be a case in which the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) forcibly completes, for example, and there may be a case in which a situation is advantageous or disadvantageous to a player in comparison with a case in which the goal is reached in a short route. In this respect, the gaming entertaining property to be imparted to the player can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">The main CPU <b>71</b> advances the game after selection of any of the images D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> at a crossing point (step S<b>492</b>, S<b>493</b>, or S<b>494</b>) and then determines whether or not the goal has been reached (step S<b>495</b>). In a case where the goal has not been reached, the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>495</b> to the step S<b>490</b> described above by obtaining a negative result in step S<b>495</b> and then displays a selection operation image at a cross point according to the progress of a game.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0436">On the other hand, in a case where the goal has been reached, the main CPU <b>71</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, causes light to be emitted from a lamp at the back side of a region P<b>12</b> that is indicative of a goal point in the upper image display panel <b>131</b>, thereby informing a player that the goal has been reached. In addition, the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>495</b> to step S<b>496</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> by obtaining an affirmative result in step S<b>495</b> and then determines whether or not a counter value has reached 5. In a case where the counter value has not reached 5, the fact designates that the number of repetitions of loop migrating to the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game) or the second bonus game (the Konatsu bonus game) after the goal has been reached is 5 times or less. The main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>496</b> to step S<b>497</b> by obtaining a negative result in step S<b>496</b>, increments the counter value, and then performs game lottery (step S<b>498</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0437">The game lottery used here is a processing operation of determining any of items of migration to the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game), migration to the second bonus game (the Konatsu bonus game), and awarding a prize in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) by means of lottery. The main CPU <b>71</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> displays images E<b>1</b> to E<b>3</b> that are indicative of three person's shadows suggesting the first to third bonus games, on the lower image display panel <b>141</b>, and then, causes a player to select any of these person's shadows. The player operates to press any of the three person's shadows that are displayed on the lower image display panel <b>141</b>, whereby the main CPU <b>71</b> recognizes the selected shadow, based on an output signal from the touch panel <b>114</b> that is provided in the lower image display panel <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0438">The main CPU <b>71</b> then determines the contents with which the selected shadow is associated (any of items of migration to the first bonus game, migration to the second bonus game, and awarding a prize in the third bonus game) as the contents of the progress selected by the player. While an association between the three person's shadows that can be selected by the player and the contents of the progress of a game is determined by means of lottery every time game lottery (step S<b>498</b>) is executed, each of the contents of the progress may be determined by means of lottery every time game lottery (step S<b>498</b>) is executed irrespective of which shadow is selected by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0439">The main CPU <b>71</b> determines whether or not an item of awarding a prize in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) has been selected as a result of the game lottery in step S<b>498</b> (step S<b>499</b>). In a case where the item of awarding a prize has not been selected in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game), the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>499</b> to step S<b>500</b> by obtaining a negative result in step S<b>499</b> and then determines whether or not the contents of the progress selected in step S<b>498</b> are an item of migration to the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game).</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">In a case where the contents of the selected progress are the item of migration to the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game), the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>500</b> to step S<b>501</b> by obtaining an affirmative result in step S<b>500</b> and then executes the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game). The first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game) used herein is a game described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. In this manner, in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game), in a case where the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game) has been selected in a selection operation made after the goal has been reached, a processing loop that migrates to the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game) is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">In a case where migration to the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game) has been selected in the step S<b>496</b> described above, light is emitted from the lamps that are provided at the back sides of a right fan symbol and a symbol of a former Japanese courtesan called &#x201c;Oiran&#x201d; that is associated with the right fan symbol, from among the three manual fan symbols that are drawn upward of the goal in the upper image display panel <b>131</b>, whereby the right fan is brightly seen to enable a player to recognize that the routine migrates to the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game).</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">On the other hand, in a case where the contents of the progress selected in the step S<b>498</b> described above are none of the items of awarding a prize in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) and migration to the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game), the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>500</b> to step S<b>502</b> by obtaining a negative result in step S<b>500</b> and then executes the second bonus game (the Konatsu bonus game). The second bonus game (the Konatsu bonus game) is a game described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. In this manner, in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game), in a case where the item of migration to the second bonus game (the Konatsu bonus game) has been selected in a selection operation made after the goal has been reached, a processing loop that migrates to the second bonus game (the Konatsu bonus game) is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">In a case where the item of migration to the second bonus game (the Konatsu bonus game) has been selected in the step S<b>496</b> described above, light is emitted from the lamps that are provided at the back sides of a left fan symbol and a symbol of a former Japanese courtesan called &#x201c;Oiran&#x201d; that is associated with the left fan symbol, from among the three fan symbols that are drawn upward of the goal in the upper image display panel <b>131</b>, whereby the left fan is brightly seen to enable a player to recognize that the routine migrates to the second bonus game (the Konatsu bonus game).</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">In addition, in a case where the game selected in the step S<b>498</b> described above has been the item of awarding a prize in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game), the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>499</b> to step S<b>504</b> by obtaining a negative result in step S<b>499</b>; awards a final prize in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) (the prize of 2,000 credits, for example, to be awarded after the goal has been reached); and completes the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game).</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0445">In this manner, in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game), in a case where the item of awarding a prize in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) has been selected in a selection operation made after the goal has been reached, the item of awarding a prize in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) is executed and then the third bonus game completes without migrating to loop processing of migrating to the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game) or the second bonus game (the Konatsu bonus game). In this case, light is emitted from the lamps that are provided at the back sides of a center fan symbol and a symbol of a former Japanese courtesan called &#x201c;Oiran&#x201d; associated with the center fan symbol, from among the three fan symbols that are drawn upward of the goal in the upper image display panel <b>131</b>, whereby the center fan is brightly seen to enable a player to recognize that the item of awarding a prize is determined in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) and then the game completes.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0446">On the other hand, in a case where the counter value has reached 5, the main CPU <b>71</b> causes the routine to migrate from step S<b>496</b> to step S<b>504</b> by obtaining an affirmative result in the step S<b>496</b> described above; awards a prize in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game); and completes the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game). In this manner, loop processing that migrates from the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) to the first bonus game (the Koharu bonus game) or the second bonus game (the Konatsu bonus game) is repeated up to five times that are defined as its upper limit.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0447">As has been described above, in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, a player operates the lower image display panel <b>141</b> (the touch panel <b>114</b>), whereby the progress of a game according to a result of the operation is displayed on the upper image display panel <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0448">In the upper image display panel <b>131</b>, a start point P<b>1</b> of a game is provided at a bottom part, and a light emitting region at the bottom part moves sequentially in an upward direction in accordance with the progress of the game. In this manner, a player's eye can move upward together with movement of the light emitting region. When the progress of the game reaches a goal, light is emitted in a goal region P<b>12</b> that is provided at the top part of the upper image display panel <b>131</b>, thereby enabling the player to pay his or her attention to the three fan symbols at the top part. Any of the three fan symbols emits light, thereby enabling the player to recognize a lottery result after the goal has been reached in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game). At the top part of the upper image display panel <b>131</b>, rendering that allows the fan or the symbol of a former Japanese courtesan called &#x201c;Oiran&#x201d; to emit light is performed, thereby enabling another player in hall to be informed that the goal has been reached in the third bonus game (the Koyuki bonus game).</p>
