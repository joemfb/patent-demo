<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a communications network, a plurality of nodes may form an overlay network and thus be connected to one another. By way of example, the overlay network may be of the peer-to-peer type, referred to below as a P2P network. In such an overlay network, the nodes, referred to as &#x201c;peers&#x201d;, are interchangeable and possess capacities and responsibilities within the network that are equivalent, in contrast to an architecture of the client-server type. Such an overlay network does not rely on its own infrastructure, but on one or more communications networks that are already in place. It makes use of the resources of said underlying network(s) but without necessarily having any knowledge of their physical topology(ies). A communications network is said to underlie the overlay network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The article entitled &#x201c;Towards autonomic service control in next generation networks&#x201d; by A. Klenk et al. and published in the ICAS08 Conference proposes a method of enabling a service to be introduced in autonomic manner in the overlay network. In an initial stage, an operator seeking to offer access to the service and a supplier of the service negotiate a contract prior to receiving a first request to implement the service, with the contract, referred to as a &#x201c;multimedia transport service agreement&#x201d;, including at least one constraint for implementing the service, e.g. a quality of service constraint. This first stage of negotiation serves to break down a service request into a chain of individual functions. For example, such functions are a video stream transcoding function, an error correction function, a watermarking function, . . . . In a second stage, implemented when a service access request is received from a client entity, nodes having processing modules needed for implementing the individual functions are then determined. Thereafter, depending on the result of this determination, the interconnections that are needed between the processing modules are in turn determined, while taking account firstly of the constraint(s) for implementing the service as specified in the contract and secondly of the costs of implementing the service. During a third stage, the service is supplied to the client entity while using the connections between the processing modules as set up during the second stage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Nevertheless, one of the determined processing modules may be protected by an access control device. The device supplying the service may also be protected by such a device. The client entity then needs to identify itself with those devices before being able to use the processing modules.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If access by the client entity to any one of the processing modules is not authorized, then it is not possible to supply the service to the client entity. The client entity then needs to reiterate the various stages of the method in order to obtain the same service or indeed to select a new service. Furthermore, there are resources that have been reserved, but that end up not being used.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a first aspect, an embodiment of the invention provides a method of controlling access by a client entity to a service in a communications network, processing modules being designed to be interconnected in said network in order to provide the service to the client entity, where a processing module implements an individual function in a chain of individual functions associated with said service, said method comprising the following steps that are implemented by an access control device associated with an access node giving access to said service, said device being referred to as a main device:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">a step of receiving, from said access node, a chain of processing modules;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">a step of sending, to an access control device referred to as a secondary device and associated with the processing module of the chain, a request to access the processing module in question, said request including an access token negotiated between the main device and the client entity;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">a step of receiving, from the secondary device, a response to the access request; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0013">a step of notifying said access node of the response received.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">In order to implement the service to the client entity, a chain of individual functions is provided. The term &#x201c;individual function&#x201d; is used to mean, for example, a function of transcoding, metering, legal interception, watermarking, . . . . Such an individual function is described by input parameters, a function, and output parameters. The chain of individual functions then represents a sequence of processes to be implemented from a device supplying the service and presenting certain output parameters to the client entity that presents certain input parameters. The processes are implemented by various processing modules in the communications network. The access control method relies on the various secondary access control devices delegating to the primary access control device the negotiation of the confidence relationship between them and the client entity. The primary access control device then verifies with the various access control devices associated with respective ones of the processing modules whether it is possible to use the processing module in order to implement the service for the particular client entity. This verification is performed using an &#x201c;access token&#x201d;. The term access token is used to mean proof of an agreement between two parties. In the present circumstances, it is an agreement between the client entity and the main access control device, representing the operator giving access to the service. Thus, if this is not possible for any of the processing modules, this particular chain of processing modules will not be reserved for the client entity. This avoids reserving resources in the communications network when access by the client entity to one or more of the processing modules is not possible. The access request made to the various secondary access control devices may be sent in parallel or in succession. It should be observed that it is possible for some of the processing modules not to be protected by a secondary device. Furthermore, the access token is sent by the main access control device, which is located in the operator network giving access to the service. The token is thus sent over links that are generally of large capacity. The main access control device may in particular have a large capacity link enabling it to dialog over links of different types simultaneously. In contrast, in the prior art, the client entity may be connected to the communications network via an underlying mobile network. The negotiation by the client entity for access tokens giving access to the various secondary access control devices associated with the processing modules may give rise to heavy use of the resources in the underlying mobile network. Thus, the steps of controlling access with the various processing modules, such as those implemented by the access control method, are performed more quickly and make it possible to reduce the time needed for supplying the service. Furthermore, since controlling access to the chain of processing modules is performed as a preliminary operation, the client entity is not sent any positive response to a request for access to the service it has sent, in the event of it turning out in the end not to be possible for the client entity to access the resources of the communications network.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">According to a particular characteristic, the method further includes a step of negotiating access to the service by the client entity, at the end of which step the access token is generated, prior to receiving the chain of processing modules.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">Since the negotiation step takes place before the step of receiving a chain of processing modules from the service access node, it is then possible, in the event of a failure, to refuse the service to the client entity before reserving resources in the communications network. This serves to optimize utilization of network resources.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0017">According to another particular characteristic, the access token is certified by the main device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">Thus, the operator giving access to the service serves to guarantee the client entity.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">According to another particular characteristic, the access request further includes a request to authorize routing data between the processing module under consideration and a processing module that precedes it in the chain, and between the processing module under consideration and a processing module that follows it in the chain.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">Thus, the device giving access to the processing module has available the information needed for routing data in order to provide the service.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">Correspondingly, an embodiment of the invention also provides a method of determining a chain of processing modules for supplying a service to a client entity in a communications network, the processing modules being designed to be interconnected in the network in order to provide the service to the client entity, where a processing module implements an individual function of a chain of individual functions associated with the service, said method comprising the following steps implemented by an access node giving access to said service:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0022">a step of determining a chain of processing modules from a chain of individual functions associated with the service;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0023">a step of sending the determined chain of processing modules to an access control device that is associated with said access node, and referred to as a main device; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0024">a step of receiving, from the main device, a notification including at least one response to a request for access to an access control device associated with a processing module;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0025">the steps of the determination method being suitable for being reiterated in the event of access to one of the processing modules being refused.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0026">In the event of any one of the access devices refusing access, the service access node then has the option of determining a new chain of processing modules. A refusal, if any, is thus detected as soon as possible, thereby making it possible to obtain a new chain after one or more new iterations, so as to enable the client entity to obtain the service. In the prior art, the only option available to the client entity in the event of a refusal of access to any one of the processing modules consists in making a new request for access to the service or in making a request to access another service.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0027">In a second aspect, an embodiment of the invention provides an access control device for controlling access by a client entity to a service in a communications network, said access control device being associated with an access node giving access to said service, and comprising:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0045">A system <b>1</b> for determining a chain of processing modules for providing a service to a client entity in a communications network <b>2</b> is shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. An overlay network is a particular communications network. Below, the terms are used interchangeably. The system <b>1</b> comprises a plurality of service access nodes SBN-<b>1</b>, . . . , SBN-N for &#x201c;service bootstrap node&#x201d;. A terminal N is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Below the term &#x201c;client entity&#x201d; is used to designate the terminal N or the user U of the terminal N. In an embodiment of the invention, the system <b>1</b> also includes an access control entity referenced IF-OPAC for &#x201c;interface overlay proxy access control&#x201d;, which entity is administered by the operator giving access to the service. This access control entity IF-OPAC includes in particular a device <b>100</b> for controlling the access of a client entity to a service. The system <b>1</b> also includes a database processing module BD-PM that stores the processing modules made available by entities of the communications network. These entities are shown in part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and they are described in greater detail below. For each processing module, there is stored an address in the communications network that gives access to the processing module, the address being stored together with constraints associated with said access. The database may in particular take the form of a distributed hash table (DHT). Optionally, the database BD-PM also stores a secret key that is shared between the access control device IF-OPAC and an access control device associated with the processing module in question.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0046">A portal P is also shown, and for a given service S it stores a service identifier SID and addresses of access nodes SBN to the service.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0047">Other entities of the overlay network are also shown in part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the form of a resource PM-<b>1</b>, PM-<b>2</b>, MS that is made available in the overlay network, and in the form of respective associated access control devices S-OPAC<b>1</b>, S-OPAC<b>2</b>, S-OPAC. Each resource or processing module PM-<b>1</b> and PM-<b>2</b> represents particular means suitable for implementing an individual function in the overlay network. In order to avoid overloading <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, only two processing modules are shown. Naturally, an overlay network entity may offer one or more processing modules. The resource MS constitutes a service module and it is a particular processing module serving to provide the service to the client entities of the overlay network. As an example of a service, mention may be made of a service for broadcasting multimedia data, a service giving access to remote surveillance data, a service for storing files. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each processing module has an associated access control device. Naturally, processing modules need not be protected by such a device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0048">In order to enable the client entity N to access the service S, a chain of individual functions TSID needs to be determined. According to the article entitled &#x201c;Towards autonomic service control in next generation networks&#x201d; by A. Klenk et al. and published in the ICAS08 Conference, such a chain of individual functions is defined during the stage of negotiation between the service supplier and the telecommunications network supplier. At the end of the negotiation stage, the service is defined by:
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0049">a unique service identifier SID;</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0050">a set of individual data-processing functions P<sub>SID</sub>; and</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0051">a set of constraints associated with the service C<sub>SID</sub>. These constraints comprise parameters associated with the service and authorizations for access to the service. By way of example, the parameters associated with the service are the place of access, the time of access, the manner of access, and quality of service parameters, such as a maximum acceptable cost, a maximum acceptable delay, a required passband, . . . . The constraints may also be specified between the elements of the processing chain.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0052">This information that as a whole defines the service identified by the service identifier SID is referred to below as a processing chain template. It comprises an ordered chain of individual functions P<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0053">An individual data-processing function is represented in the form of a triplet (I, P, O) where I represents the input format that the processing function P can process, and O represents the output format that results from implementing the processing function P. When any input format is acceptable, this is represented by the character &#x201c;*&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0054">By way of example, an individual function P<sub>i </sub>is a legal interception, a localization function, a watermarking function, a transcoding function, a cache function, a network address translation (NAT) function, a deep packet inspection (DPI) function, a presence function, a bridge-conference function. This list is naturally not exhaustive. Below, this chain of individual functions is written as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(I<sub>MS</sub>,O<sub>MS</sub>)&#x2dc;(I,P<sub>1</sub>,O)&#x2dc;(I,P<sub>2</sub>,O)&#x2dc; . . . (*,P<sub>i</sub>,O)&#x2dc;(I<sub>MC</sub>,O<sub>MC</sub>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where MS represents the service and MC represents the client entity.
</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0055">The method of controlling access to a service by a client entity as implemented in a particular embodiment of the access control device, and the method of determining a chain of processing modules as implemented by a service access node in this particular embodiment are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0056">A prior negotiation stage is implemented between an operator seeking to offer access to the service and the service supplier S, which negotiation leads to a service contract Cont being defined that comprises a processing chain template, referred to below as a chain of individual functions.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0057">The client entity N seeking access to a service S, supplied by the processing module MS, initially contacts the portal P in order to obtain the service identifier SID and the addresses of access nodes SBN to the service. Thereafter, the client entity N selects an access node SBN-<b>1</b> to the service and sends a request M<b>1</b> to access the service S to said selected access node. This access request M<b>1</b> (SID, Cap, UserID) comprises an identifier of the service SID, the capacities Cap of the client entity, and an identifier UserID of the user of the client entity.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0058">The access request M<b>1</b> is received by the service access node SBN-<b>1</b> in a step E<b>1</b> of the determination method. Still in this step E<b>1</b>, the service access node SBN-<b>1</b> searches for the contract Cont associated with the service, e.g. in a database, and thus obtains a chain of individual functions associated with the service. The access node SBN-<b>1</b> then sends a message M<b>2</b> to the access control entity IF-OPAC. The message M<b>2</b> (Cont, UserID) comprises the contract as negotiated between the operator enabling the service to be accessed and the service supplier S, together with the identifier UserID of the user of the client entity.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0059">The message M<b>2</b> is received by the access control entity IF-OPAC in a step F<b>1</b> of the access control method. The access control entity IF-OPAC negotiates an access token with the client entity N, which token gives access to the service AT. This negotiation is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in the form of an arrow carrying a composite message M<b>3</b> comprising the contract Cont and the identifier UserID of the user of the client entity. Such a negotiation, known as an automatic trust negotiation (ATN) is described in greater detail in the article &#x201c;Secure stateless trust negotiation&#x201d; by A. Klenk et al., published in the 2009 N2S Conference. It serves to guarantee that the client entity N does indeed accept the terms of the contract. A confidence relationship is established between the access control entity IF-OPAC and the client entity N. This confidence relationship is represented by the access token defining the conditions for access to the processing module. This access token may be in the form of a page drawn up in accordance with a language specification such as extensible access control markup language (XACML).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0060">Still during this step F<b>1</b> of the access control method, the access control entity IF-OPAC verifies that the user is indeed the stated user. Once these two substeps of negotiation and of identity verification have been accomplished successfully, the access control entity IF-OPAC stores the negotiated access token AT and sends an agreement M<b>4</b> to the service access node SBN-<b>1</b>. Otherwise, i.e. in the event of either of the two substeps failing, the access control entity sends a refusal to the service access node SBN-<b>1</b>, leading to said node rejecting the request made by the client entity N for access to the service. This rejection takes place before reserving any resources in the communications network. This serves to optimize utilization of the resources of the network.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0061">The message M<b>4</b> is received by the service access node SBN-<b>1</b> in a step E<b>2</b> of the determination method. It then sends a request M<b>5</b> to the database BD-PM searching for nodes in the overlay network that propose the processing modules PM<sub>i </sub>for implementing the individual functions as requested and such that the connections between the various nodes serve to satisfy the constraint C<sub>i </sub>associated with the chain of individual functions. The method then performs the search, e.g. using the technique described in the above-mentioned ICAS08 Conference article. Once the chain of processing modules has been determined, it is sent in a response message M<b>6</b> to the service access node SBN-<b>1</b>. The response message M<b>6</b> comprises in particular the respective addresses in the communications network of the processing modules. As an option, when the database BD-PM has stored a secret key that is shared between a processing module and the access control entity IF-OPAC, the key is also sent in the response message M<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0062">The response M<b>6</b> is received by the service access node SBN-<b>1</b>, still in this step E<b>2</b>. Thereafter, the access node SBN-<b>1</b> sends a message M<b>7</b> to the access control entity IF-OPAC, which message includes the chain of processing modules PM<sub>i </sub>and the addresses of those processing modules in the overlay network. This message M<b>7</b> thus requests the access control entity IF-OPAC to verify whether the processing modules allow access to the client entity N. In the implementation described, the message M<b>7</b> comprises the chain of processing modules (PM-<b>1</b>, PM-<b>2</b>, MS).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0063">The message M<b>7</b> is received by the access control entity IF-OPAC in a step F<b>2</b> of the access control method. The access control entity IF-OPAC then sends a message M<b>8</b>-<b>1</b> to the access control device S-OPAC<b>1</b> associated with the processing module PM-<b>1</b>, which message includes the access token AT as determined and stored during the step F<b>1</b> of the access control method, together with the constraint(s) C<sub>i</sub>. The message M<b>8</b>-<b>1</b> requests authorization to route data to and from the processing module PM-<b>1</b>. More precisely, it also specifies a port number to be used for communicating between two processing modules together with the protocol that is to be used. As an option, when the database BD-PM has stored a secret key shared between the processing module PM-<b>1</b> and the access control entity IF-OPAC, the access token is certified by the control entity IF-OPAC using the secret key.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0064">For example, it is possible to use the XACML language specification to certify the information sent by the client entity or obtained by a third party identity supplier and to make transactions secure in the manner described in the article &#x201c;Secure stateless trust negotiation&#x201d; by A. Klenk et al., published in the 2009 N2S Conference.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0065">Likewise, a message M<b>8</b>-<b>2</b> is sent to the access control device S-OPAC<b>2</b> associated with the processing module PM-<b>2</b>, and a message M<b>8</b>-<b>3</b> is sent to the access control device S-OPAC<b>3</b> associated with the entity that supplies the service MS.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0066">Thus, only the access control entity IF-OPAC negotiates the access token AT with the client entity N, which token is then sent to the various processing modules. Subsequent access by the client entity N is thus simplified since there is no need for client entity to negotiate with each of these processing modules in the chain. The client entity thus benefits from the confidence relationship that exists between the access control devices S-OPAC associated with the processing modules and the access control entity IF-OPAC.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0067">The access control device S-OPAC<b>1</b> verifies whether the client entity N can access the processing module PM-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0068">If the client entity N cannot access the processing module PM-<b>1</b>, the access control device S-OPAC<b>1</b> sends a message M<b>9</b>-<b>1</b> indicating a refusal.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0069">If the client entity N is entitled to access the processing module PM-<b>1</b>, then the access control device S-OPAC<b>1</b> authorizes data to be routed between the processing module under consideration and the preceding processing module in the chain of processing modules, and also between the processing module under consideration and the following processing module in the chain of processing modules. The access control device S-OPAC<b>1</b> also reserves the resources needed for providing the service, as defined by the constraint(s) C<sub>1</sub>. In the implementation described, the access control device S-OPAC<b>1</b> authorizes data to be routed between the client entity N and the processing module PM-<b>1</b>, and then between the processing module PM-<b>1</b> and the processing module PM-<b>2</b>. Thereafter, the access control device S-OPAC<b>1</b> sends a message M<b>9</b>-<b>1</b> indicating an agreement.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0070">The same applies for the access control device S-OPAC<b>2</b> or S-OPAC, each of which sends a respective response message M<b>9</b>-<b>2</b> or M<b>9</b>-<b>3</b> to the access control entity IF-OPAC.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0071">These responses messages M<b>9</b>-<b>1</b>, M<b>9</b>-<b>2</b>, M<b>9</b>-<b>3</b> are received in a step F<b>3</b> of the access control method.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0072">By way of example, the messages M<b>8</b>-<b>1</b>, M<b>8</b>-<b>2</b>, and M<b>8</b>-<b>3</b> are authorization request messages in accordance with the XACML language specification. By way of example, the messages M<b>9</b>-<b>1</b>, M<b>9</b>-<b>2</b>, and M<b>9</b>-<b>3</b> are authorization response messages, still in accordance with that specification.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0073">In a step F<b>4</b> of the access control method, the control entity IF-OPAC sends a message M<b>10</b> to the service access node SBN-<b>1</b>, which message includes the results obtained for the verifications that have been performed. If one of the processing modules has not accepted access by the client entity N, the message M<b>10</b> is a message rejecting the chain of processing modules. Otherwise, i.e. if all of the processing modules in the chain have accepted access by the client entity N, then the message M<b>10</b> is a message agreeing to the chain of processing modules.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0074">The message M<b>10</b> is received by the service access node SBN-<b>1</b> in a step E<b>3</b> of the determination method. If during a step E<b>4</b> of the determination method it is determined that the message is a rejection, then the determination method returns to the step E<b>2</b> in order to reiterate steps E<b>2</b>, E<b>3</b>, and E<b>4</b> of the method. Thus, a refusal by any one of the processing modules is detected before the chain of processing modules is sent to the client entity N, and this allows the determination system <b>1</b> to determine a new chain of processing modules. Under such circumstances, in the prior art, resources used to be reserved without being used subsequently. Furthermore, the client entity N then needed to send a new service access request or indeed to select a new service.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0075">In this step E<b>4</b> of the determination method it is possible to verify that the number of iterations that have been performed for the purpose of determining a chain of processing modules is below a predetermined threshold. This serves to avoid overloading the determination system <b>1</b> and to limit the waiting time for the client entity N.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0076">If during the step E<b>4</b> of the determination method it is determined that there is an agreement, i.e. that a chain of processing modules has been determined in which all of the processing modules accept access by the client entity N, then the determination method sends a message M<b>11</b> in a step E<b>5</b>, which message contains the address in the overlay network of the first processing module PM-<b>1</b> and the constraint(s) with which the client entity N needs to comply in order to access the service. Since the routing of data between the various processing modules has been authorized and since the resources needed for obtaining the requested quality of service have been reserved, the client entity N can now access the service. This is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by double-headed arrow segments between the client entity N and the processing module PM-<b>1</b>, between the processing module PM-<b>1</b> and the processing module PM-<b>2</b>, and then to finish off between the processing module PM-<b>2</b> and the entity that supplies the service. By means of the methods of an embodiment of the invention, the client entity N obtains access more quickly than in the prior art, it being given that the access control entity IF-OPAC guarantees the client entity N with respect to the access control devices. The client entity N will access the service successfully since each of processing modules in the chain as determined has given its agreement to supply the service.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0077">In a variant of the above-described implementation, the access control entity IF-OPAC need not request the reservation of resources between the various processing modules in the messages M<b>8</b>-<b>1</b>, M<b>8</b>-<b>2</b>, M<b>8</b>-<b>3</b>. In this variant, the control entity IF-OPAC requests only the routing of data and it is the service access node SBN-<b>1</b> that requests the processing modules to reserve resources during the step E<b>5</b> of the determination method prior to sending the message M<b>11</b> to the client entity N. This variant presents the additional advantage of remaining compatible with the method described in the ICAS08 Conference article.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0078">As an illustrative example, there follows a description of an implementation of a system for remote surveillance of a home by using the methods of an embodiment of the invention. Naturally, the method is not restricted to this example.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0079">The state of negotiation between the operator offering access to services and the supplier of the remote surveillance service leads to a service contract being recorded, which contract includes a chain of individual functions within the means accessed by the service access node SBN-<b>1</b>. The published service makes the service available to friends only. A client entity &#x201c;alice@orange.fr&#x201d; sends a request to access this service, the request including its own characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0080">During the step F<b>2</b> the access control entity IF-OPAC verifies in particular with the access control device S-OPAC associated with the device that offers the remote surveillance service that the client entity N is indeed authorized to access the service. The access control device S-OPAC verifies that the client entity &#x201c;alice@orange.fr&#x201d; is indeed one of the friends authorized to access the service. It is only the access control device S-OPAC that is in a position to perform such verification. Similarly, the use of a processing module may be reserved for client entities presenting an address in the domain &#x201c;brevet.fr&#x201d;. During this step F<b>2</b>, the access control entity IF-OPAC may verify with the access control device in question whether access is possible by the client entity. The response may thus be negative if the processing module desires not to give access to client entities of the domain &#x201c;orange.fr&#x201d;.</p>
