<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to implantable medical devices (IMDs) and, more particularly, the present invention relates to external RF telemetry module configurations suitable for deployment in IMDs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various types of devices have been developed for implantation into the human body to provide various types of health-related therapies, diagnostics and/or monitoring. Examples of such devices, generally known as implantable medical devices (IMDs), include cardiac pacemakers, cardioverter/defibrillators, cardiomyostimulators, cardiac event monitors, various physiological stimulators including nerve, muscle, and deep brain stimulators, various types of physiological monitors and sensors, and drug delivery systems, just to name a few. IMDs typically include functional components contained within a hermetically sealed enclosure or housing, which is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;can.&#x201d; In some IMDs, a connector header or connector block is attached to the housing, and the connector block facilitates interconnection with one or more elongated electrical medical leads. The header block is typically molded from a relatively hard, dielectric, non-conductive polymer. The header block includes a mounting surface that conforms to, and is mechanically affixed against, a mating sidewall surface of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has become common to provide a communication link between the electronic circuitry hermetically sealed within the can of the IMD and an external programmer, monitor, or other external medical device (&#x201c;EMD&#x201d;) in order to provide for downlink telemetry transmission of commands from the EMD to the IMD and to allow for uplink telemetry transmission of stored information and/or sensed physiological parameters from the IMD to the EMD. Conventionally, the communication link between the IMD and the EMD is realized by encoded radio frequency (&#x201c;RF&#x201d;) transmissions between an IMD telemetry antenna and transceiver and an EMD telemetry antenna and transceiver. Generally, the IMD antenna is disposed within the hermetically sealed housing. However, the typically conductive housing can limit the radiation efficiency of the IMD RF telemetry antenna, thereby traditionally limiting the data transfer distance between the programmer head and the IMD RF telemetry antennas to a few inches. This type of system may be referred to as a &#x201c;near field&#x201d; telemetry system. In order to provide for &#x201c;far field&#x201d; telemetry, or telemetry over distances of a few to many meters from an IMD or even greater distances, attempts have been made to provide antennas outside of the hermetically sealed housing and within the header block. Many of such attempts of positioning an RF telemetry antenna outside of the hermetically sealed housing and in the header block have utilized wire antennas or planar, serpentine antennas, such as the antennas described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,317,946, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. However, the positioning of the antenna in the header block outside of the can has conventionally required the antenna to be connected to RF telemetry circuitry contained within the IMD through electrical feedthroughs that extend through the hermetically sealed can. Given the frequency, nature, and characteristics of the RF telemetry signals that are required to be transmitted from the antenna to the telemetry circuitry, the electrical feedthrough path for such telemetry signals can not typically be filtered, thereby leaving an open pathway for electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals or other types of interference signals to travel into the hermetically sealed can and negatively impact the circuitry contained within the IMD.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one or more embodiments, an implantable medical device (&#x201c;IMD&#x201d;) is provided having an antenna and an RF telemetry module for far field telemetry communications arranged on an exterior of a housing for the IMD. The RF telemetry module and antenna are communicatively coupled together on the exterior of the housing. One or more feedthrough conductive paths extending through the housing to communicatively couple the RF telemetry module to at least one component within the housing. In this manner, the RF telemetry module and antenna are arranged entirely external to the housing to allow telemetry signal processing to occur outside of the housing, such that in some embodiments only power and/or low frequency data bit signals corresponding to radio frequency (RF) telemetry signals are passed through the feedthrough conductive path. This allows the feedthrough conductive path to be filtered to prevent undesired interference signals (e.g., electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals, etc.) from entering the housing through the feedthrough conductive path coupled to the RF telemetry module. In some embodiments, the antenna and RF telemetry module are formed in an integrated antenna and RF telemetry module that is attachable to an exterior portion of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one or more embodiments, the RF telemetry module may be conformally shaped to a corresponding external region of the housing. A hermetic cover may be arranged over the RF telemetry module and sealed against an exterior surface of the housing so as to enclose the telemetry module and protect the RF telemetry module from the environment surrounding the implant location of the IMD. In some embodiments, the hermetic cover may comprise a connection header or header block. In one or more embodiments, a recessed region or shelf region may be within a portion of the exterior surface of the housing, such that the RF telemetry module may be arranged to be received within the recessed region on the exterior of the housing. The hermetic cover may then be arranged over the recessed region and sealed against the exterior surface of the housing so as to enclose the RF telemetry module within the recessed region. In one or more embodiments in which the antenna and RF telemetry module are formed as an integrated antenna and telemetry module assembly, one side of the integrated assembly may include the RF telemetry module attached thereto that is situated within the recessed region while the other side of the integrated antenna and telemetry module assembly serves as the hermetic cover that can serve to enclose the RF telemetry module within the recessed region.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one or more embodiments, the integrated antenna and telemetry module assembly for the IMD may include a ceramic material such that the antenna is embedded within the ceramic material and the telemetry module may be attached to a portion of the ceramic material. In some embodiments, the ceramic material and antenna may be cofired together into a monolithic structure to which the RF telemetry module is attached. Since the RF telemetry module is located on the exterior of the housing, the RF telemetry module may be at least partially covered with a shielding layer for providing electromagnetic interference (EMI) and/or electromagnetic capability (EMC) isolation for the RF telemetry module from interference signals. In some embodiments, the RF telemetry module may comprise a potted external flex radio frequency (RF) module having self-contained RF circuitry and digital circuitry.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following detailed description is merely illustrative and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following description may refer to components or features being &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; together. As used herein, unless expressly stated otherwise, &#x201c;connected&#x201d; means that one component/feature is directly or indirectly connected to another component/feature, and not necessarily mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise, &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; means that one component/feature is directly or indirectly coupled to another component/feature, and not necessarily mechanically. Thus, although the figures may depict example arrangements of elements, additional intervening elements, devices, features, or components may be present in an actual embodiment (assuming that the functionality of the IMDs are not adversely affected).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one or more embodiments, an IMD having an improved antenna structure is provided. For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques and aspects related to RF antenna design, IMD telemetry, RF data transmission, signaling, IMD operation, connectors for IMD leads, and other functional aspects of the systems (and the individual operating components of the systems) may not be described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the various figures contained herein are intended to represent example functional relationships and/or physical couplings between the various elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional functional relationships or physical connections may be present in a practical embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An IMD antenna generally has two functions: to convert the electromagnetic power of a downlink telemetry transmission of an EMD telemetry antenna propagated through the atmosphere (and then through body tissues) into a signal (e.g., a UHF signal or the like) that can be processed by the IMD transceiver into commands and data that are intelligible to the IMD electronic operating system; and to convert the uplink telemetry signals (e.g., a UHF signal or the like) of the IMD transceiver electronics into electromagnetic power propagated through the body tissue and the atmosphere so that the EMD telemetry antenna or antennas can receive the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an IMD <b>10</b> implanted within a human body <b>12</b> in which one or more embodiments of the invention may be implemented. IMD <b>10</b> comprises a hermetically sealed housing <b>14</b> (or &#x201c;can&#x201d;) and connector header or block module <b>16</b> for coupling IMD <b>10</b> to electrical leads and other physiological sensors arranged within body <b>12</b>, such as pacing and sensing leads <b>18</b> connected to portions of a heart <b>20</b> for delivery of pacing pulses to a patient's heart <b>20</b> and sensing of heart <b>20</b> conditions in a manner well known in the art. For example, such leads may enter at an end of header block <b>16</b> and be physically and electrically connected to conductive receptacles, terminals, or other conductive features located within header block <b>16</b>. IMD <b>10</b> may be adapted to be implanted subcutaneously in the body of a patient such that it becomes encased within body tissue and fluids, which may include epidermal layers, subcutaneous fat layers, and/or muscle layers. While IMD <b>10</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in an ICD configuration, it is understood that this is for purposes of illustration only and IMD <b>10</b> may comprise any type of medical device requiring a telemetry antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, hermetically sealed housing <b>14</b> is generally circular, elliptical, prismatic, or rectilinear, with substantially planar major sides joined by perimeter sidewalls. Housing <b>14</b> is typically formed from pieces of a thin-walled biocompatible metal such as titanium. Two half sections of housing <b>12</b> may be laser seam welded together using conventional techniques to form a seam extending around the perimeter sidewalls. Housing <b>14</b> and header block <b>16</b> are often manufactured as two separate assemblies that are subsequently physically and electrically coupled together. Housing <b>14</b> may contain a number of functional elements, components, and features, including (without limitation): a battery; a high voltage output capacitor; integrated circuit (&#x201c;IC&#x201d;) devices; a processor; memory elements; a therapy module or circuitry, etc. These components may be assembled in spacers and disposed within the interior cavity of housing <b>14</b> prior to seam welding of the housing halves. During the manufacturing process, electrical connections are established between components located within housing <b>14</b> and elements located within header block <b>16</b>. For example, housing <b>14</b> and header block <b>16</b> may be suitably configured with IC connector pads, terminals, feedthrough elements, and other features for establishing electrical connections between the internal therapy module and the therapy lead connectors within header block <b>16</b> and for establishing connections between an external RF telemetry module and power or other components on the interior of the housing <b>14</b>. Structures and techniques for establishing such electrical (and physical) feedthrough connections are known to those skilled in the art and, therefore, will not be described in detail herein. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,414,835 describes a capacitive filtered feedthrough array for an implantable medical device, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, header block <b>16</b> may be formed from a suitable dielectric material, such as a biocompatible synthetic polymer. In some embodiments, the dielectric material of header block <b>16</b> may be selected to enable the passage of RF energy that is either radiated or received by a telemetry antenna (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) encapsulated within header block <b>16</b>. The specific material for header block <b>16</b> may be chosen in response to the intended application of IMD <b>10</b>, the electrical characteristics of the environment surrounding the implant location, the desired operating frequency range, the desired RF antenna range, and other practical considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a simplified schematic representation of an IMD <b>10</b> and several functional elements associated therewith. IMD <b>10</b> generally includes hermetically sealed housing <b>14</b> and header block <b>16</b> coupled to housing <b>14</b>, an antenna <b>22</b> arranged on an exterior of housing <b>14</b>, and an RF module <b>24</b> arranged on an exterior of housing <b>14</b>. IMD <b>10</b> includes one or more feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b> extending through housing <b>14</b> for communicatively coupling the telemetry RF module <b>24</b> to at least one interior circuitry component within housing <b>14</b>. In practice, IMD <b>10</b> will also include a number of conventional components and features necessary to support the functionality of IMD <b>10</b> as known in the art, such as a therapy module, a controller, a memory, a power supply, etc. Such conventional elements and the operation of these and other conventional elements will not be described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Antenna <b>22</b> for IMD <b>10</b> is formed at a location exterior to housing <b>14</b> to allow for far field telemetry operations and minimize the reduction in radiation efficiencies that can be caused by the conductive housing <b>14</b>. In one or more embodiments, antenna <b>22</b> is formed from a biocompatible conductive material, such as but not limited to at least one of the following materials: Platinum, Iridium, Platinum-Iridium alloys, Alumina, Silver, Gold, Palladium, Silver-Palladium or mixtures thereof, or Niobium, Molybdenum and/or Moly-manganese or other suitable materials.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Telemetry RF module <b>24</b> or other telemetry circuitry is further arranged at a location exterior to housing <b>14</b>, such that both antenna <b>22</b> and RF module <b>24</b> are arranged on the exterior of housing <b>14</b>. RF module <b>24</b> may include any number of components, including, without limitation: electrical devices, ICs, amplifiers, signal generators, a receiver and a transmitter (or a transceiver), modulators, microprocessors, controllers, memories, power supplies, and the like. RF module <b>24</b> may further include a matching circuit or a matching circuit may be positioned between RF module <b>24</b> and antenna <b>22</b>. A matching circuit may include any number of components, including, without limitation: electrical components such as capacitors, resistors, or inductors; filters; baluns; tuning elements; varactors; limiter diodes; or the like, that are all suitably configured to provide impedance matching between antenna <b>22</b> and RF module <b>24</b>, thus improving the efficiency of antenna <b>22</b>. Briefly, RF module <b>24</b> supports RF telemetry communication for IMD <b>10</b>, including, without limitation: generating RF transmit energy; providing RF transmit signals to antenna <b>22</b>; processing RF telemetry signals received by antenna <b>22</b>, and the like. For some applications, RF module <b>24</b> may be designed to leverage the conductive material used for housing <b>14</b> as an RF ground plane, and RF module <b>24</b> may be designed in accordance with the intended application of IMD <b>10</b>, the electrical characteristics of the environment surrounding the implant location, the desired operating frequency range, the desired RF antenna range, and other practical considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Antenna <b>22</b> is communicatively coupled to RF module <b>24</b> by an electrical interconnect <b>28</b> to facilitate RF telemetry between IMD <b>10</b> and an external device. Generally, antenna <b>22</b> is suitably configured for RF operation (e.g., UHF or VHF operation, 401 to 406 MHz for the MICS/MEDS bands, 900 MHz/2.4 GHz and other ISM bands, etc.). Antenna <b>22</b> may have characteristics resembling a monopole antenna, characteristics resembling a dipole antenna, characteristics resembling a coplanar waveguide antenna, characteristics resembling a stripline antenna, characteristics resembling a microstrip antenna, and/or characteristics resembling a transmission line antenna. Antenna <b>22</b> may also have any number of radiating elements, which may be driven by any number of distinct RF signal sources. In this regard, antenna <b>22</b> may have a plurality of radiating elements configured to provide spatial or polarization diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one or more embodiments, antenna <b>22</b> can thus be positioned at a location on exterior of the housing <b>14</b> and spaced apart a desired distance from housing <b>14</b> to achieve a desirable radiation efficiency. Housing <b>14</b> is typically formed from a conductive material that can limit the radiation efficiency of the IMD RF telemetry antenna <b>22</b>, thereby serving to limit the data transfer distance for the antenna <b>22</b> for RF telemetry operations. Improved far field telemetry operations can be achieved by situating antenna <b>22</b> a desired distance away from the surface of housing <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a side view of an implantable medical device (&#x201c;IMD&#x201d;) is illustrated in accordance with one or more embodiments in which external RF module <b>24</b> may comprise a self-contained RF module (e.g., RF circuitry and/or other digital circuitry is self-contained within an enclosed material). In some embodiments, self-contained RF module <b>24</b> may comprise a potted, printed circuit board (PCB) flex material, IC material, or other modular circuit material. In one or more embodiments, RF module <b>24</b> and antenna <b>22</b> are arranged within header block <b>16</b> on an exterior of housing <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, either or both of RF module <b>24</b> and antenna <b>22</b> may be conformally shaped to an exterior surface of housing <b>14</b> or to the shape of header block <b>16</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, antenna <b>22</b> is shown to conform to the shape of header <b>16</b>. In this manner, antenna <b>22</b> may be shaped to extend away from housing <b>14</b> in order to situate antenna <b>22</b> a desired distance away from the surface of housing <b>14</b> for optimal radiating characteristics, shaped for other operation characteristics, or shaped to otherwise minimize the space it requires within header <b>16</b>. Further, RF module <b>24</b> may be formed to abut an outer surface of housing <b>14</b> adjacent to feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b>. By way of further example of possible conformal shaping, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, RF module <b>24</b> can be formed of a flex PCB material and also conformally shaped to the shape of header block <b>16</b>. Antenna <b>22</b> can be formed to extend adjacent to and along a length of RF module <b>24</b>, such that both antenna <b>22</b> and RF module <b>24</b> are conformal to the shape of header <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, antenna <b>22</b> can be etched on the perimeter of the flex RF module <b>24</b>, and the end of antenna <b>22</b> can be formed to protrude away from RF module <b>24</b> for further improved antenna performance. In one or more embodiments, RF module <b>24</b> may be at least partially plated, coated or covered with a shielding material <b>25</b> for providing electromagnetic interference (EMI) and/or electromagnetic capability (EMC) isolation for the RF module <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one or more embodiments, antenna <b>22</b> and RF module <b>24</b> may formed together in a single, unitary subassembly element. This would provide modularity for the antenna <b>22</b>/RF module <b>24</b> subassembly element to allow it to be interchangeably utilized in a variety of possible combinations of headers <b>16</b> and housings <b>14</b>. In this manner, depending upon the particular housing <b>14</b> to which the antenna <b>22</b>/RF module <b>24</b> subassembly element would be connected, an appropriate header <b>16</b> could be selected to suit the environment surrounding IMD <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, such an antenna <b>22</b>/RF module <b>24</b> subassembly element could be formed by encasing the components within a potting material into a single conformal element, where such an arrangement advantageously provides a controlled thickness for the potting material, thereby providing known parasitics for both the circuitry of RF module <b>24</b> and for antenna <b>22</b>. The potted antenna <b>22</b>/RF module <b>24</b> subassembly element with known parasitics could be positioned within a header <b>16</b> or alternatively at a location exterior to the header <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one or more embodiments, one or more feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b> extend through housing <b>14</b> to communicatively couple RF module <b>24</b> to at least one component situated within housing <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, an electrical interconnect <b>28</b> (e.g., ribbon wire connector or other wired connection) connects RF module <b>24</b> to feedthrough pins <b>30</b> in the feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b> (e.g, via welding), where a biocompatible medical adhesive or epoxy may be used to cover and electrically insulate any exposed portions of the feedthrough pin <b>30</b> or other portions of feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b>. Feedhrough conductive paths <b>26</b> may be located at any location on housing <b>14</b>, such that different possible antenna <b>22</b> and RF module <b>24</b> arrangements may be modified to accommodate different locations for the RF feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b>. Furthermore, depending upon the specific configuration and topology of antenna <b>22</b> and RF module <b>24</b>, a single feedthrough conductive path <b>26</b> may provide insulated routing for any number of separate radiating elements, and/or IMD <b>10</b> may include any number of separate feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b> for a like number of separate antenna elements. Conventional IMDs have traditionally had unfiltered RF feedthroughs connecting external antennas to internal RF telemetry circuitry, which has provided an open pathway for destructive EMI signals to enter into the interior of the IMD housing and negatively impact the operation of circuitry contained therein. For example, patients are often precluded from obtaining MRI's due to such destructive EMI signals. By situating RF module <b>24</b> on the exterior of housing <b>14</b>, signal processing of telemetry signals received by and transmitted from antenna <b>22</b> can be performed by RF module <b>24</b> on the exterior of housing <b>14</b>. In this manner, the signals that are communicated across feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b> can be limited to power signals for RF module <b>24</b> from a power source within housing <b>14</b> and/or low frequency data bit signals corresponding to information contained within radio frequency (RF) telemetry signals that are received by and transmitted from antenna <b>22</b>. This allows the feedthrough conductive path <b>26</b> to be filtered to prevent undesired interference signals (e.g., electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals, noise, etc.) from entering housing <b>14</b> through the feedthrough conductive path <b>26</b> coupled to RF module <b>24</b>. In conventional IMDs in which RF telemetry modules or circuitry are located within the IMD housing, the RF feedthroughs cannot typically be filtered without filtering out the telemetry signals themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present improved configuration of positioning the RF module <b>24</b> on an exterior of housing <b>14</b> allows only low frequency data bit signals to be required to be communicated across the feedthrough conductive path <b>26</b>, thereby allowing the feedthrough conductive path <b>26</b> to contain filter devices (not shown) to prevent the passage of EMI signals and other unwanted signals into the interior of housing <b>14</b> of IMD <b>10</b>. Further, such filtered feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b> may provide a higher level of PC-69 protection, which is the standard developed by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation's (AAMI) EMC working group (AAMI PC69: Active implantable medical devices-Electromagnetic compatibility-EMC test protocols for implantable cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators) that sets forth electromagnetic compatibility test protocols for implantable pulse generators (IPGs) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). The PC-69 standard contains test requirements and procedures for testing such devices for electrical interference in frequency bands of 450 MHz to 3,000 MHz. Still further, such filtered feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b> may provide higher levels of ESD protection as well. Even further, by locating RF module <b>24</b> on the exterior of housing <b>14</b>, interference that the RF module <b>24</b> itself can cause on other internal circuitry (e.g., therapy modules or pulsing circuits) situated within housing <b>14</b> can be avoided while further preventing such other internal circuitry within housing <b>14</b> from interfering with and reducing the performance of RF module <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, a separate integrated antenna and telemetry module assembly <b>42</b> formed in accordance with one or more embodiments is illustrated containing an embedded antenna <b>22</b>, wherein the integrated antenna and telemetry module assembly <b>42</b> may be attached to an exterior surface <b>46</b> of a housing <b>14</b> for IMD <b>50</b>. It is noted that similarly numbered components of IMD <b>50</b> will function substantially identical to such numbered components of IMD <b>10</b> and a description of their operation will not be repeated for ease of description. In one or more embodiments, a recessed region or shelf region <b>32</b> may be formed within a portion of the exterior surface <b>46</b> of housing <b>14</b>, as illustrated in the exploded view of IMD <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The recessed region <b>32</b> may include one or more side surfaces <b>31</b> and a bottom surface <b>33</b>. In one or more embodiments, RF module <b>24</b> may be attached to one side of integrated antenna and telemetry module assembly <b>42</b>. Integrated assembly <b>42</b> may be arranged such that RF module <b>24</b> is received within recessed region <b>32</b> when integrated assembly <b>42</b> is attached to exterior <b>46</b> of housing <b>14</b>. The integrated assembly <b>42</b> includes side surfaces <b>44</b> which may be arranged to engage exterior surface <b>46</b> of housing <b>14</b> when integrated assembly <b>42</b> is situated within recessed region <b>32</b>. In other embodiments, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, integrated assembly <b>42</b> side surfaces <b>44</b> may also be arranged to engage side-surfaces <b>31</b> of recessed region <b>32</b>. In some embodiments, a hermetic cover <b>16</b> may be positioned over the exposed surface of integrated assembly <b>42</b>, where hermetic cover <b>16</b> may comprise a separate header block similar to header block <b>16</b> or may comprise part of the integrated assembly <b>42</b> itself (e.g., a biocompatible layer that is arranged as the outermost surface layer of integrated assembly <b>42</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, filtered feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b> may be positioned within recessed region <b>32</b> so as to engage conductive pads <b>38</b> formed on a bottom surface of integrated assembly <b>42</b> is positioned over recessed region <b>32</b> and attached to housing <b>14</b>. Conductive pads <b>38</b> are communicatively coupled to RF module <b>24</b>. Internal circuitry and other components contained within the interior of housing <b>14</b>, such as on PWB <b>34</b>, may be communicatively coupled to filtered feedthrough conductive paths <b>26</b> through wired connectors <b>36</b> on the interior of the housing <b>14</b>. In one or more embodiments, integrated assembly <b>42</b> may include a ceramic material <b>40</b>, PWB material or another substrate material that is formed around antenna <b>22</b> so as to embed antenna <b>22</b> within ceramic material <b>40</b>. RF module <b>24</b> may then be attached to the bottom surface of ceramic material <b>40</b>. In one or more embodiments, ceramic material <b>40</b> and antenna <b>22</b> may be cofired together into a monolithic structure to which RF module <b>24</b> is attached to form the integrated assembly <b>42</b>. Referring to the partial cutaway view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the edges <b>44</b> of integrated assembly <b>42</b> may then be hermetically sealed to the exterior surface <b>46</b> of housing <b>14</b> by laser welding or other suitable bonding techniques that will provide a hermetic seal without damaging the internal components of the integrated assembly <b>42</b>, as known to those skilled in the art. As used herein, integrated assembly <b>42</b> may then perform the function of hermetic cover or header <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one or more embodiments, the use of recessed region <b>32</b> allows RF module <b>24</b> to be received within recessed region <b>32</b> such that integrated assembly <b>42</b> can be positioned to be substantially flush with the exterior surface of housing <b>14</b> in order to reduce the overall dimensions of IMD <b>50</b> and provide a smoothly contoured shape of IMD <b>50</b> suitable for implantation on space-limited locations in a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one or more embodiments, the use of a cofired ceramic material <b>40</b> allows integrated assembly <b>42</b> to be a specially designed and shaped hermetic cover for desired characteristics of IMD <b>10</b>. In one aspect, the use of a cofired ceramic material allows integrated assembly <b>42</b> to specially formed or shaped to provide a desired passage of RF energy that is either radiated or received by telemetry antenna <b>22</b> encapsulated within integrated assembly <b>42</b>. In one or more embodiments, the cofired ceramic material <b>40</b> for integrated assembly <b>42</b> comprises a high temperature co-fire ceramic (HTCC) material having a melting point between about 1100 C.&#xb0; and 1700 C.&#xb0;, wherein layers of the ceramic material <b>40</b> and antenna <b>22</b> are cofired together at such temperatures to form the monolithic structure for integrated assembly <b>42</b>. In one or more embodiments, the cofired ceramic material <b>40</b> comprises a low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) material having melting point between about 850 C.&#xb0; and 1150 C.&#xb0;. Methods for co-firing layers of ceramic materials together to form monolithic structures for use in IMDs are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,414,835 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,164,572, the contents of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to one or more embodiments, the use of a co-firing technique to form a integrated assembly <b>42</b> that includes the embedded antenna <b>22</b> and is attached to the exterior of housing <b>14</b> allows for the manufacture of low-cost, miniaturized, hermetically sealed antenna structures suitable for implantation within tissue and/or in direct or indirect contact with diverse body fluids. Further, the ceramic materials used to form integrated assembly <b>42</b> can be loaded with powders of a desired dielectric constant so as to produce a structure having a desired effective dielectric value that is situated between antenna <b>22</b> and the surrounding environment.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one or more embodiments, the ceramic integrated assembly <b>42</b> can be formed from one or more layers or sheets of materials (or segments of tape) that comprise the ceramic material <b>40</b>, antenna <b>22</b> and electrical interconnects may be printed with a metalized paste and other circuit patterns, stacked on each other, laminated together and subjected to a predetermined temperature and pressure regimen, and then fired at an elevated temperature(s) during which the majority of binder material(s) (present in the ceramic) and solvent(s) (present in the metalized paste) vaporizes and/or is incinerated while the remaining material fuses or sinters. In some embodiments, the materials suitable for use as cofireable conductors for forming the antenna <b>22</b> are biocompatible metal materials described herein or other materials suitable for the metalized paste, In one or more embodiments, the stacked laminates are then co-fired together at temperatures between about 850 C.&#xb0; and 1150 C.&#xb0; for LTCC materials and between about 1100 C.&#xb0; and 1700 C.&#xb0; for HTCC materials to form the ceramic integrated assembly <b>42</b> having the embedded antenna <b>22</b>.
