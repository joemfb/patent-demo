<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional Application No. 61/349,285 filed May 28, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to the cooling of printed circuit board components of automotive power converters.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Heat generating elements, such as transformers, drivers, capacitors, etc., attached to a printed circuit board may be cooled via convection. That is, air may be caused to circulate around these elements to dissipate the heat generated by them. Alternatively, heat generating elements attached to a printed circuit board may be cooled via conduction. That is, the printed circuit board may be arranged to be in direct contact with a cold plate to dissipate the heat generated by the heat generating elements.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 5,014,904 to Morton, for example, discloses a method and apparatus for dissipating heat from printed circuit boards and electronic devices mounted thereon. Printed circuit boards are provided with apertures therethrough for receiving thermal conductor pads. The thermal conductor pads may be secured in the apertures through the use of glue or by means of an interference fit. Glue may also be deposited on top of the thermal conductor pad to secure an electronic device thereto. The glue is cured in a manner that limits its thickness to a minimum value. The electronic device may be further secured to the printed circuit board by wave soldering. The opposite end of the thermal conductor pad contacts the cold plate.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Certain electrical components, such as transformers, drivers, capacitors, etc., attached to printed circuit boards may generate heat during operation. This heat, if not effectively dissipated, may affect the operation of the electrical circuitry associated with the printed circuit boards.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For packaging reasons, certain printed circuit board systems for automotive power converters (e.g., battery chargers, inverters, etc.) may have a number of printed circuit boards stacked on top of and spaced away from each other. Each of these printed circuit boards may have heat generating elements attached to them. As mentioned above, heat generated by these heat generating elements may need to be dissipated. A cold plate may be arranged, for example, to directly contact the printed circuit board at the bottom of the stack. Heat generated by the heat generating elements attached to the bottom printed circuit board may thus be dissipated via conduction as well as convection. Heat generated by the heat generating elements attached to the other printed circuit boards may be dissipated exclusively via convection as these other printed circuit boards may not directly contact the cold plate. Conduction, however, may be a more effective mechanism to remove heat from heat generating elements as compared with convection.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A thermal path (or paths) may be provided from one or more heat generating elements (mounted to a printed circuit board) to a cold plate in arrangements where the printed circuit board is spaced away from the cold plate. This thermal path, for example, may comprise one or more thermally conductive elements that provide a pathway for heat to travel from the one or more heat generating elements to the cold plate. The one or more thermally conductive elements may be in contact with and/or attached to the heat generating elements and/or the cold plate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As an example, a network of copper wiring (round, flat, etc.) may be arranged to be in contact with a collection of heat generating elements attached to a printed circuit board. Any suitable thermally conductive material having any suitable shape/configuration/etc., however, may be used. The wiring, in this example, at least partially contacts (and lies along) a surface of the printed circuit board (the same surface on which the heat generating elements are attached). In other examples however, the wiring may be spaced away from a surface of the printed circuit board or arranged as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The printed circuit board, in this example, is spaced away from a cold plate by a plurality of thermally conductive (e.g., metal) spacing elements. Other printed circuit boards and/or components, of course, may be disposed between the cold plate and printed circuit board having the network of copper wiring. At least one of the metal spacing elements is in contact with the cold plate and at least a portion of the copper wiring. Hence, heat generated by the heat generating elements may travel through the wiring and spacing elements to the cold plate. Other arrangements are also possible. Wiring, for example, may be arranged to be in contact with and/or attached to the heat generating elements and the cold plate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> (which label fewer elements than illustrated for clarity purposes), a printed circuit board system <b>10</b> includes printed circuit boards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> stacked on top of and spaced away from each other, and a cold plate <b>15</b>. As known in the art, the cold plate <b>15</b> at least partially defines a plurality of fluid passageways <b>16</b>. A coolant, such as water, may pass through the passageways <b>16</b> to cool the cold plate <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The printed circuit board <b>12</b> is in contact with the cold plate <b>15</b>. The printed circuit board <b>14</b> is spaced away from the cold plate <b>15</b> via a plurality of thermally conductive standoffs <b>17</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the standoffs <b>17</b> may include a spacer portion <b>18</b> and a male threaded portion <b>19</b> extending from the spacer portion <b>18</b>. The male threaded portion <b>19</b> is configured to engage a corresponding female threaded portion <b>20</b> in the cold plate <b>15</b>. (The printed circuit board <b>12</b>, in certain embodiments, may include passageways <b>21</b> through which each of the male threaded portions <b>19</b> may pass.) Each of the spacer portions <b>18</b> may further include a female threaded portion <b>22</b> formed therein. As discussed in further detail below, each of these female threaded portions <b>22</b> may receive a threaded fastener <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the printed circuit board <b>12</b> has a plurality of electrical components <b>24</b><i>n </i>(<b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>, <b>24</b><i>c</i>, etc.&#x2014;not all of which are necessarily numbered), such as capacitors, amplifiers, transformers, etc., attached thereto. Likewise, the printed circuit board <b>14</b> has a plurality of electrical components <b>26</b><i>n </i>(<b>26</b><i>a, </i><b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c</i>, etc.&#x2014;not all of which are necessarily numbered), such as capacitors, amplifiers, transformers, drivers, etc., attached thereto. Certain of the electrical components <b>26</b><i>n </i>generate heat during operation. One such component is transformer <b>26</b><i>i. </i></p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, the printed circuit board system <b>10</b> further includes a thermally conductive heat spreader <b>28</b> (e.g., a metal stamping, a wire, etc.) The heat spreader <b>28</b> includes a trunk portion <b>30</b>, at least one branch portion <b>32</b>, and surfaces defining passageways <b>34</b>. The at least one branch portion <b>32</b> is in contact with at least one of the heat generating components (e.g., <b>26</b><i>i</i>). The trunk portion <b>30</b> is mounted to at least one of the standoffs <b>17</b> via, for example, the threaded fasteners <b>23</b>, which pass through the passageways <b>34</b> and engage the female threaded portions <b>22</b> formed within the spacer portions <b>18</b>. (The printed circuit board <b>14</b> may include surfaces defining passageways <b>36</b> through which each of the fasteners <b>23</b> may pass.)</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">During operation, heat generated by the transformer <b>26</b><i>i</i>, for example, is transferred (via conduction) to the branch portion <b>32</b> of the heat spreader <b>28</b> in contact therewith. This heat travels through the trunk portion <b>30</b> and to the spacer portions <b>18</b> of the standoffs <b>17</b> via the threaded fasteners <b>23</b> mounting the trunk portion <b>30</b> to the spacer portions <b>18</b>. Finally, heat transferred to the spacer portions <b>18</b> is transmitted to the cold plate <b>15</b> via the male threaded fastener portions <b>19</b> of the standoffs <b>17</b> engaged with the cold plate <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The branch and trunk configuration of the heat spreader <b>28</b> described above reduces the number of passageways through the printed circuit boards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> needed to accommodate thermally conductive elements configured to transfer heat from the electrical components <b>26</b><i>n </i>to the cold plate <b>15</b>. That is, each of the electrical components <b>26</b><i>n </i>need not have their own dedicated thermally conductive element and corresponding passageway through the printed circuit boards <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> (which may be impractical in circumstances where printed circuit boards are stacked on top of and spaced away from each other as such dedicated thermally conductive elements and corresponding passageways may preclude the packaging of printed circuit board components below them within the stack). Rather, a plurality of branches, each in contact with a respective heat generating electrical component <b>26</b><i>n</i>, may lead to a single trunk. This trunk may have relatively few thermal connections (which may be strategically positioned so as to not interfere with printed circuit board components below them within the stack) to the cold plate <b>15</b> as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, for example, the thermally conductive path from the heat generating element <b>26</b><i>i </i>to the cold plate <b>15</b> includes several components (e.g., the heat spreader <b>28</b>, fasteners <b>23</b> and standoffs <b>17</b>). This thermally conductive path, in other embodiments, may comprise a single component that contacts some/all of the heat generating elements as well as spaces the printed circuit board away from the cold plate. Alternatively, the standoffs <b>17</b> may provide a passageway therethrough for a threaded fastener that connects the heat spreader <b>28</b> to the cold plate <b>15</b>. In still other embodiments, the heat spreader <b>28</b> may include a plurality of sub-elements connected together in any suitable/known fashion, etc. Other arrangements are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Additionally, the features of various implementing embodiments may be combined to form further embodiments of the invention.</p>
