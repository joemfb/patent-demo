<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention was first described in and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/309,075 filed Mar. 1, 2010, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to deer feeders, and in particular, to an apparatus including an air pump for filling a deer feeder with feed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many people enjoy the presence of deer and other wild game in their yards and on their property. In order to attract such animals, many place elevated feeding stations filled with corn, grains or other feed which entice the animals to stay, feed and hopefully return on a daily basis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While most of these feeders work, a primary inconvenience of all such apparatuses is that they need to be refilled on a regular basis. This refilling operation is most often done by climbing a ladder and pouring feed into a top portion of the feeder. However, this is not both time consuming and somewhat dangerous due to the elevated nature of the feeder.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another method available for refilling most deer feeders is to take the feeder down, refill it and then place it back. This is method is even more time consuming and requires significant physical exertion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various attempts have been made to provide wildlife feeder systems. Examples of these attempts can be seen by reference to several U.S. patents, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,862,777; U.S. Pat. No. 6,557,598; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,564,746. However, none of these designs are similar to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While these apparatuses fulfill their respective, particular objectives, each of these references suffer from one (1) or more of the aforementioned disadvantages. Many such apparatuses require significant time and physical exertion to refill. Also, many such apparatuses require additional complex portions to install and maintain. Furthermore, many such apparatuses are aesthetically unpleasing. In addition, many such apparatuses may inhibit the efficacy of an associated feeder. Accordingly, there exists a need for a filling device for deer feeders without the disadvantages as described above. The development of the present invention substantially departs from the conventional solutions and in doing so fulfills this need.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing references, the inventor recognized the aforementioned inherent problems and observed that there is a need for a device to assist in regular refilling of a deer feeder which reduces the time and effort associated with that task. Thus, the object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned disadvantages and provide for this need.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the above objectives, it is an object of the present invention to assist in filling an elevated deer feeder while the operator remains at a ground level, eliminating the need to utilize a ladder or other method for reaching the feeder. The apparatus includes a mobile cart, a blower, and a container for retaining an amount of deer feed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the present invention is to enable portable use of the apparatus by comprising the mobile cart of a wheelbarrow-style structure including a pair of wheels. The mobile cart supports the container and further provides space to contain and transport additional portions of the apparatus including a volume of feed, the blower, and a plurality of flexible hoses.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a hitch receiver to facilitate attachment to a hitch portion of a vehicle, allowing the apparatus to be towed to a desired location.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet still another object of the present invention is to utilize a first flexible hose to connect the container to the elevated deer feeder. An end of the first flexible hose includes a rigid goose-neck fitting which helps the user to reach the top of the deer feeder and hang the hose over the edge of the feeder. The opposing end includes a quick-connect coupling which attaches to a lower portion of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide automated delivery of feed from the container through the first hose and into the deer feeder. A second flexible hose is used to attach the blower. The user can then place a volume of feed in the container and actuate the blower. The blower delivers a flow of air which then passes through the container, receives the feed via gravity, and carries feed up the first hose and into the deer feeder.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a lid for the container to prevent unwanted discharge of feed through the top of the container while the blower is active.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a method of utilizing the device that provides a unique means of procuring the apparatus, storing the blower, the first flexible hose, and the second flexible hose in the container or cart, loading a quantity of deer feed into the cart, transporting the apparatus to an existing deer feeder structure, unloading and positioning the blower on a ground surface adjacent to the cart, connecting the first flexible hose to container and the blower, connecting the second flexible hose to the container, positioning the goose-neck fitting over a top edge of the deer feeder structure, starting the blower, pouring the deer feed into the container, allowing a period of time for the load of deer feed to be conveyed into the deer feeder structure, and benefiting from reduced effort and improved safety while filling deer feeding structures.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.</p>
