<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As semiconductor technology develops, integrated circuits often contain devices operating at a high voltage level, and other devices operating at a low voltage level. The low voltage devices cannot tolerate a high voltage signal. Device failures happen frequently, when the low voltage devices operate with the high voltage signal. In order to protect the low voltage devices from the high voltage signals, the integrated circuit often includes an input/output (I/O) circuit as an interface between the low voltage devices and the high voltage devices. The I/O circuit allows the low voltage devices to communicate with the high voltage devices, while protecting the low voltage devices from being damaged by the high voltage signals.</p>

It is emphasized that, in accordance with the standard practice in the industry, various features are not drawn to scale. In fact, the dimensions of the various features may be arbitrarily increased or reduced for clarity of discussion.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An input/output (I/O) design has a bandwidth of about 8 gigahertz (GHz) or less. The bandwidth of this I/O design is compromised by high parasitic capacitances of electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection circuits that are added to output nodes of the I/O. In some instances, the parasitic capacitances of the ESD protection circuits are reduced. However, the parasitic capacitances cannot be reduced in designing some high bandwidth I/Os.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">During designing an I/O accommodating a bandwidth of about 10 GHz or more, an inductive peaking technique uses a pair of inductors, each of which is electrically coupled between a loading resistor and a supply voltage VDD. In some instances, the inductance of the inductor may be around 0.3 nanoheneries (nH) for a design with a 40-nm technology node or smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As the technology node of integrated circuits shrinks, an area available for an I/O design becomes smaller. In some embodiments, the design of the 0.3-nH inductors for inductive peaking may be too large to fit into a single I/O pitch. The large inductors and the small I/O pitch make the I/O design challenging for the small technology node.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of various embodiments. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic drawing of an input/output (I/O) circuit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an I/O circuit <b>100</b> includes a driver stage <b>110</b> that is electrically coupled with a circuitry <b>130</b>. The driver stage <b>110</b> includes at least one input node, e.g., input nodes N<sub>1 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>, and at least one output node, e.g., output nodes N<sub>3 </sub>and N<sub>4</sub>. The input nodes N<sub>1 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>are electrically coupled with gates of transistors M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>of the driver stage <b>110</b>, respectively. Drains of the transistors M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>each are electrically coupled with the respective output nodes N<sub>3 </sub>and N<sub>4</sub>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the output nodes N<sub>3 </sub>and N<sub>4 </sub>of the driver stage <b>110</b> are the output nodes of the I/O circuit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the driver stage <b>110</b> includes at least one electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection circuit, e.g., ESD protection circuits <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>, which are electrically coupled with the respective output nodes N<sub>3 </sub>and N<sub>4 </sub>of the I/O circuit <b>100</b>. The ESD protection circuits <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>are configured to protect the I/O circuit <b>100</b> from being damaged by a momentary electrostatic discharge event that happens to the output nodes N<sub>3 </sub>and N<sub>4</sub>. In some embodiments, the ESD protection circuits <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>each have a parasitic capacitance of about 400 femtofarads (fF) or more.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the I/O circuit <b>100</b> includes at least one inductor, e.g., inductors L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2</sub>, which are electrically coupled with respective loadings, e.g., resistors R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>in a series fashion. The inductor L<sub>1 </sub>and the resistor R<sub>1 </sub>are electrically coupled between the output node N<sub>3 </sub>and a power line that is configured to provide a supply voltage VDD. The inductor L<sub>2 </sub>and the resistor R<sub>2 </sub>are electrically coupled between the output node N<sub>4 </sub>and the power line that is configured to provide a supply voltage VDD. In some embodiments, the supply voltage VDD is about 1.8 V, the inductance of each inductor is about 0.1 nanohenry (nH) or less, and the resistance of each resistor is about 50 ohm (&#x3a9;). As the inductance of each inductor is low, the area used by the inductor design is small such that the inductors <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>can be designed in a single I/O pitch. In some embodiments, the I/O pitch is about 30 &#x3bc;m or less.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is noted that the inductance, parasitic capacitance, supply voltage and/or resistance described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are merely exemplary. The scope of this application is not limited thereto. In some embodiments, the inductance, parasitic capacitance, supply voltage and/or resistance may be modified in response to a change of the technology node, the bandwidth design of the I/O circuit and/or other design changes.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the circuitry <b>130</b> is operable to increase a current I<sub>T </sub>flowing through the inductor L<sub>1 </sub>or L<sub>2 </sub>during a signal transition. For example, a pair of signals having opposite voltage states are applied to the input nodes N<sub>1 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>. The signals turn off and on the respective transistors M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2</sub>, such that a current is flowing through the inductor L<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">During the signal transition, the signal applied to the input node N<sub>1 </sub>turns on the transistor M<sub>1 </sub>and another signal that applied to the input node N<sub>2 </sub>turns off the transistor M<sub>2</sub>. As the current I<sub>T </sub>flowing through the inductor L<sub>1 </sub>is increased and/or induced by the circuitry <b>130</b>, a portion of the current I<sub>T </sub>flows through the resistor R<sub>1 </sub>and the remaining portion of the current I<sub>T </sub>flows through the circuitry <b>130</b>. Even if the inductance of the inductor L<sub>1 </sub>is small, e.g., about 0.1 nH or less, the voltage differential across the inductor L<sub>1 </sub>is increased due to the increase of the current I<sub>T</sub>. The pull-up of the voltage level on the node N<sub>3 </sub>becomes fast. By increasing the current I<sub>T</sub>, not only can the bandwidth of the I/O circuit <b>100</b> be increased, but also the small inductor L<sub>1 </sub>can be designed in a single I/O pitch.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic drawing illustrating an exemplary I/O circuit including at least one pre-driver stage. The at least one pre-driver stage is operable to generate pre-driver signals applied to the input nodes N<sub>1 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>of the driver stage <b>110</b>. The at least one pre-driver stage is also operable to increase and/or induce the current I<sub>T </sub>flowing through the inductors L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the circuitry <b>130</b> includes at least one pre-driver stage, e.g., pre-driver stages <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>. The pre-driver stages <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>each include respective input nodes N<sub>7</sub>-N<sub>8 </sub>and N<sub>13</sub>-N<sub>14</sub>, and respective output nodes N<sub>9</sub>-N<sub>10 </sub>and N<sub>15</sub>-N<sub>16</sub>. The pre-driver stages <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>each also include respective transistor pairs M<sub>3</sub>-M<sub>4 </sub>and M<sub>5</sub>-M<sub>6</sub>. Gates of the transistors M<sub>3</sub>-M<sub>6 </sub>each are electrically coupled with the respective input nodes N<sub>7</sub>, N<sub>8</sub>, N<sub>13 </sub>and N<sub>14</sub>. The output nodes N<sub>9</sub>, N<sub>10</sub>, N<sub>15 </sub>and N<sub>16 </sub>are electrically coupled with the respective input nodes N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>8 </sub>and N<sub>7</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pre-driver stages <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>include respective resistor pairs R<sub>3</sub>-R<sub>4 </sub>and R<sub>5</sub>-R<sub>6</sub>. In some embodiments, the pre-driver stages <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>are electrically coupled with the node N<sub>5 </sub>between the inductor L<sub>1 </sub>and the resistor R<sub>1 </sub>and the node N<sub>6 </sub>between the inductor L<sub>2 </sub>and the resistor R<sub>2</sub>. For example, nodes N<sub>11 </sub>and N<sub>17 </sub>of the pre-driver stages <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>, respectively, are electrically coupled with the node N<sub>5</sub>. Nodes N<sub>12 </sub>and N<sub>18 </sub>of the pre-driver stages <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>, respectively, are electrically coupled with the node N<sub>6</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As noted, during the signal transition the current I<sub>T </sub>flowing through the inductor L<sub>1 </sub>of the driver stage <b>110</b> is increased. If the nodes N<sub>11 </sub>and N<sub>17</sub>, and N<sub>12 </sub>and N<sub>18 </sub>were not electrically coupled with the respective nodes N<sub>5 </sub>and N<sub>6</sub>, the current I<sub>T </sub>would have been substantially equal to a current I<sub>1 </sub>flowing through the resistor R<sub>1</sub>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as the nodes N<sub>11 </sub>and N<sub>17</sub>, and N<sub>12 </sub>and N<sub>18 </sub>are electrically coupled with the respective nodes N<sub>5 </sub>and N<sub>6</sub>, the current I<sub>T </sub>is substantially equal to the sum of currents I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2 </sub>and I<sub>3 </sub>that flow through the resistors R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>5 </sub>of the driver stage <b>110</b> and pre-driver stages <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b</i>, respectively. In some embodiments, the currents I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2 </sub>and I<sub>3 </sub>are substantially equal to each other. In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;equal&#x201d; here means that the currents I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2 </sub>and I<sub>3 </sub>have the same frequency, phase and/or amplitude.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is noted that the number of the pre-driver stages <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is merely exemplary. The scope of this application is not limited thereto. In some embodiments, a single pre-driver stage or more than two pre-driver stages are applied to increase and/or induce the current I<sub>T</sub>. The number of the pre-driver stages may be changed in response to the design of the inductors, the differences of current phase and/or frequency of the currents flowing through the respective driver stages, and/or other design of the I/O circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic drawing illustrating an exemplary I/O circuit including at least one level shifter.

The level shifters <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b </i>each also include respective transistors M<sub>7</sub>-M<sub>10 </sub>and M<sub>11</sub>-M<sub>14</sub>. In some embodiments, the transistors M<sub>7</sub>-M<sub>8 </sub>and M<sub>11</sub>-M<sub>12 </sub>are N-type transistors and the transistors M<sub>9</sub>-M<sub>10 </sub>and M<sub>13</sub>-M<sub>14 </sub>are P-type transistors. Gates of the transistors M<sub>7</sub>-M<sub>8 </sub>each are electrically coupled with the respective input nodes N<sub>19 </sub>and N<sub>20</sub>. The output nodes N<sub>21</sub>-N<sub>22 </sub>and N<sub>27</sub>-N<sub>28 </sub>are electrically coupled with the respective input nodes N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>20 </sub>and N<sub>19</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the output nodes N<sub>21 </sub>and N<sub>22 </sub>are disposed between the transistors M<sub>7 </sub>and M<sub>9 </sub>and between the transistors M<sub>8 </sub>and M<sub>10</sub>, respectively. The output nodes N<sub>27 </sub>and N<sub>28 </sub>are disposed between the transistors M<sub>11 </sub>and M<sub>13 </sub>and between the transistors M<sub>12 </sub>and M<sub>14</sub>, respectively. In some embodiments, the level shifters <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b </i>are electrically coupled with the node N<sub>5 </sub>between the inductor L<sub>1 </sub>and the resistor R<sub>1 </sub>and the node N<sub>6 </sub>between the inductor L<sub>2 </sub>and the resistor R<sub>2</sub>. For example, nodes N<sub>23 </sub>and N<sub>29 </sub>are electrically coupled with the node N<sub>5</sub>, and nodes N<sub>24 </sub>and N<sub>30 </sub>are electrically coupled with the node N<sub>6</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As noted, during the signal transition the current I<sub>T </sub>flowing through in the inductor L<sub>1 </sub>is increased. If the nodes N<sub>23 </sub>and N<sub>29 </sub>and N<sub>24 </sub>and N<sub>30 </sub>were not electrically coupled with the respective nodes N<sub>5 </sub>and N<sub>6</sub>, the current I<sub>T </sub>would have been equal to a current I<sub>1 </sub>flowing through the resistor R<sub>1</sub>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as the nodes N<sub>23 </sub>and N<sub>29</sub>, and N<sub>24 </sub>and N<sub>30 </sub>are electrically coupled with the respective nodes N<sub>5 </sub>and N<sub>6</sub>, the current I<sub>T </sub>is substantially equal to the sum of currents I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>4 </sub>and I<sub>5 </sub>flowing through the resistor R<sub>1 </sub>and the transistors M<sub>9 </sub>and M<sub>13 </sub>of the driver stage <b>110</b> and level shifters <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b, </i>respectively. In some embodiments, the currents I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>4 </sub>and I<sub>5 </sub>are substantially equal to each other. In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;equal&#x201d; here means that the currents I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>4 </sub>and I<sub>5 </sub>have the same frequency, phase and/or amplitude.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">During the signal steady state, the currents flowing through the level shifters <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b </i>are substantially equal to zero. The current I<sub>T </sub>flowing through in the inductor L<sub>1 </sub>is substantially equal to the current I<sub>1 </sub>that flows through the resistor R<sub>1</sub>. Because no substantive current is flowing through the level shifters <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b </i>during the signal steady state, the power consumed by the I/O circuit <b>100</b> is small.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is noted that the number of the level shifters <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b </i>described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is merely exemplary. The scope of this application is not limited thereto. In some embodiments, a single level shifter or more than two level shifters are applied to increase and/or induce the current I<sub>T</sub>. The number of the level shifters may be changed in response to the design of the inductors, the differences of current phase and/or frequency of the currents flowing in the respective level shifters, and/or other design of the I/O circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the level shifter <b>330</b><i>a </i>or <b>330</b><i>b </i>is replaced with the pre-driver stage <b>230</b><i>a </i>or <b>230</b><i>b</i>. In other embodiments, an additional driver stage is electrically coupled with the level shifters <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b </i>in a parallel fashion to increase and/or induce the current I<sub>T</sub>.</p>

A circuitry is electrically coupled with a node between the at least one inductor and the at least one loading.
