<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-0103201, filed on Oct. 21, 2008, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The inventive concept relates to a method of operating a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a method of operating a semiconductor device by which an operating mode is set by adjusting the timing of a voltage pulse or by adjusting a voltage level of the voltage pulse.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Single transistor (1-T) dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices, are a capacitor-less memory that have been recently used in a variety of applications. Also, 1-T DRAM devices may be fabricated by using a relatively simple fabrication process and have an improved sensing margin. 1-T DRAM is also sometimes referred to as &#x201c;Z-RAM,&#x201d; which is short for &#x201c;zero capacitor RAM.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1-T DRAM offers performance similar to the standard six-transistor SRAM (Static RAM) cell used in cache memory, but since it uses only a single transistor it offers much higher densities. It is also denser than conventional one-transistor, one-capacitor DRAM used for the majority of a modern computer's main memory.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">1-T DRAM relies on an effect known as the floating body effect, which was first encountered in CPU design based on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process introduced in the early 2000s. This effect causes capacitance to form between the transistor and the underlying insulating substrate, which was seen as a problem that needed to be solved in conventional designs. The same effect, however, allows a DRAM-like cell to be built using the transistor only, the floating body effect taking the place of the conventional capacitor. Consisting of only one part instead of two, 1-T DRAM offers twice the density of DRAM, and five times that of SRAM.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">1-T DRAM also uses small cell size leads, which causes 1-T DRAM to be faster than even SRAM, with SRAM normally much faster than DRAM. SRAM's large cell size means that any &#x201c;reasonable&#x201d; amount of SRAM cache takes up a large portion of the CPU die. The long traces needed to carry current into the cells have a capacitance of their own, and requires the driver circuitry to &#x201c;slow down&#x201d; in order to allow the charge to settle. Although 1-T DRAM's individual cells are not as fast as SRAM, the lack of the long lines allows a similar amount of cache to be run at roughly the same data rates by avoiding this delay while taking up less space.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Despite the utility of 1-T DRAM devices, production has posed unique challenges and methods of operating such semiconductor devices have been limited, particularly with respect to setting an operating mode.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventive concept provides a method of operating a semiconductor device by which an operating mode is set by adjusting the timing of a voltage pulse. The inventive concept also provides a method of operating a semiconductor device by which an operating mode is set by adjusting a voltage level of a voltage pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the inventive concept, there is provided a method of operating at least one semiconductor device comprising a drain region, a source region, a floating body region, and a gate region. The method includes, in an erase mode in which a state of data of the semiconductor device is changed into a first state, a drain voltage pulse applied to the drain region is transitioned to a standby state from an enable state and then, a gate voltage pulse applied to the gate region is transitioned to the standby state from the enable state. And in a write mode in which a state of data of the semiconductor device is changed into a second state, the gate voltage pulse is transitioned to the standby state from the enable state and then, the drain voltage pulse is transitioned to the standby state from the enable state.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The can further comprise, in the erase mode, transitioning the drain voltage pulse to the standby state from the enable state and then, transitioning the gate voltage pulse to the standby state from the enable state, wherein a transition time of the drain voltage pulse may be the same as a transition time of the gate voltage pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the erase mode and the write mode, a source voltage applied to the source region may be one of a source voltage pulse or a voltage that has a predetermined voltage level.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the erase mode and the write mode, a time in which the gate voltage pulse is transitioned to the enable state from the standby state, may be faster than, the same as or slower than a time in which the drain voltage pulse is transitioned to the enable state from the standby state.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An amplitude of the gate voltage pulse in the erase mode may be the same as an amplitude of the gate voltage pulse in the write mode, or an amplitude of the drain voltage pulse in the erase mode may be the same as an amplitude of the drain voltage pulse in the write mode.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method can include applying a source voltage to the source region in the form of a source voltage pulse or a source voltage having a predetermined level, and in the erase mode: an amplitude of the gate voltage pulse is different from an amplitude of the source voltage pulse, or an amplitude of the gate voltage pulse is different from the predetermined voltage level of the source voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the erase mode and the write mode, a time in which the gate voltage pulse is transitioned to the enable state from the standby state, can be faster than, the same as, or slower than a time in which the drain voltage pulse is transitioned to the enable state from the standby state.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the erase mode and the write mode, a duration time of the gate voltage pulse may be narrower than, the same as, or wider than a duration time of the drain voltage pulse.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings, from which the inventive concepts will be evident to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. are be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another, but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example, a first element can be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element can be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element, it can be directly on or connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements can be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including,&#x201d; when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like may be used to describe an element and/or feature's relationship to another element(s) and/or feature(s) as, for example, illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and/or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>

When the number of carriers stored in the body region <b>170</b> is large, the amount of current that flows through the drain region <b>150</b> from the source region <b>140</b> is large, and when the number of carriers stored in the body region <b>170</b> is small, the amount of current that flows through the drain region <b>150</b> from the source region <b>140</b> is small.</p>
