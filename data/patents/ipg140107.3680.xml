<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The application pertains to smoke detectors having multiple sensing regions in combination with a particle separator. More particularly, the application pertains to optical-type detectors having multiple scatter angles.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Smoke sensors using the optical scatter principal are increasingly becoming the most common type of fire sensor on the market. Optical sensors however are very sensitive to non-fire aerosols like water vapor (condensed steam and mist), dust and ash, spores, cooking aerosols, insects and spiders.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optical techniques are becoming common that attempt to differentiate between different types of smoke and non-smoke aerosols. Common techniques used in an optical scatter chamber are the use of different wavelength LEDS e.g. blue and near infra-red or different scatter angles e.g. 140 degrees and 70 degrees (or even a combination of both). In all these techniques a ratio is made between two different optical scatter paths in a common chamber. This ratio can then indicate the particle size of the aerosol in the chamber and therefore if the smoke is grey (larger particles) or black (smaller particles). That can be very difficult, is detecting non-fire aerosols, for example water vapor, as this can be generated at extremely high levels over a range of particle sizes very similar to the particle size of grey smoke. Therefore depending on the conditions under which the water vapor is generated, little or no difference can be detected in the optical ratio from that of grey smoke.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Note that this can also be true of other non-fire aerosols, so much so that manufactures usually resort to reducing false alarms by making the smoke sensor have a low sensitivity to grey smoke and by the use of spike detection (delaying detection if the aerosol profile changes too fast). It should be noted that repeated spike detection may also produce an excessive smoke detection delay. An alternative technique is to use a very fine filter material on the sensor and suck air thought it into the smoke chamber. Using such fine filters will require regular maintenance well before it starts to block the detection of larger smoke particles.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">While disclosed embodiments can take many different forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown in the drawings and will be described herein in detail with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles thereof as well as the best mode of practicing same, and is not intended to limit the application or claims to the specific embodiment illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present application relates to a ceiling mounted point fire detector that is designed, in one aspect, to be loop powered from an analogue, or digital, addressable fire alarm system. The detector includes an internal optical scatter chamber which samples the external environment via an output from a multi-stage cyclone particle separator. Air is returned to the external environment, via an exit point below which an open optical scatter chamber monitors the circulating air flow.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The multi-stage cyclone can be driven by a fan which is triggered-on after combustion products and/or aerosols are detected in the external environment. The cut diameter of the cyclone is set to remove almost all large (heavy) non-fire particles from the air flowing into the internal chamber, whilst smaller smoke aerosols are unaffected. This allows rapid and accurate smoke detection whilst being insensitive to massive quantities of non-fire aerosols.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">So that the detector could detect the early phase of a fire, the internal scatter angle, wavelength and sensitivity are identical to the external scatter angle, which senses the external environment circulating above the exit flow. The ratio of both scatter paths is taken when the cyclone is active, giving a unity ratio for all smoke types. Accurate high sensitivity detection can now be applied to the internal scatter chamber for very early smoke detection. For non-fire aerosols, for example water vapor, the external to internal optical chamber sensitivity ratio will be far more than 100, enabling its easy identification and rejection as a false alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a detector <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>12</b> which is releasibly attachable to a surface, such as a ceiling C by means of a ceiling plate <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The detector <b>10</b> can monitor ambient atmospheric conditions of an adjacent region R.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Detector <b>10</b> includes an internal, or closed, optical scattering chamber <b>14</b> and an external, or open optical scattering chamber <b>16</b>. Ambient air A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> is drawn into detector <b>10</b> via inflow ports in an air inlet ring <b>12</b><i>b </i>by the action of a particle separator <b>20</b>. Separator <b>20</b> can include a fan or other type of air moving unit, without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Separator <b>20</b> could be implemented as a multi-element cyclone-type particle separator. It will be understood that a variety of separators come/within the scope of the claims hereof. Exemplary separators have been disclosed in US Patent Application No 2009/0025453 published Jan. 29, 2009, entitled &#x201c;Apparatus and Method of Smoke Detection&#x201d;. The published '453 application is assigned to the assignee hereof and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Water or water vapor is separated from ambient particulate matter by separator <b>20</b> and the remaining particulate matter flows, for example A<b>3</b> into the internal optical scattering chamber <b>14</b>. Outflow of A<b>3</b> is from the chamber <b>14</b> through exit flow port <b>12</b><i>c </i>into the environment R.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">While in the chamber <b>14</b> the airborne particulate matter scatters light from transmitter Tx. Scattered light is detected at receiver Rx. Both transmitter Tx and receiver Rx are coupled to control circuits <b>24</b>. Circuits <b>24</b> can include analog/digital conversion circuitry as well as digital filter circuitry to implement the processing disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Circuitry <b>24</b> can provide wired or wireless communications capability to an associated fire alarm monitoring system, not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The external, or open, scattering chamber <b>16</b> includes first and second pairs of transmitter/receiver units Tx<b>2</b>/Rx<b>2</b> and Tx<b>3</b>/Rx<b>3</b>. The two pairs of transmitter/receiver units are also coupled to control circuits <b>24</b>. As those of skill will understand, two different scattering angles, one of which corresponds to the scattering angle of the chamber <b>14</b>, can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The detector <b>10</b> advantageously presents a very low profile when viewed from the region R. The ceiling plate <b>12</b><i>a </i>can be substantially flat with the housing <b>12</b> extending away from the region R into the ceiling C to promote a very non-intrusive appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The detector <b>10</b> monitors the ambient region R below that detector using two external near infra-red optical scatter angles. If relatively small levels of particulates move into this area, then a multi-stage cyclone, such as cyclone <b>20</b>, is energized to draw the particulates in the ambient air, such as A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, through the air intake ports in ring <b>12</b><i>b</i>, in the flat ceiling plate <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The multi-cyclone particle separator <b>20</b> removes almost all of any large non-fire aerosols that may be present, and then passes part of the sampled air, A<b>3</b>, into the internal optical scattering chamber <b>14</b> for smoke sensing.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cyclone separator <b>20</b> can also be activated if low levels of CO or heat are detected or combined levels of any of the three monitored phenomena which could be indicative of the early phase of a fire. The rate or &#x2018;duty cycle&#x2019; at which the multi-cyclone <b>20</b> will operate at, also can be increased with the levels of the monitored phenomena monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Air drawn through the air inlet or ports in ring <b>12</b><i>b</i>, is passed via a mesh into the first cyclone stage, which is formed, for example, in a region of rotating air above a centrifugal fan with an area of exposed fan blades. This stage is primarily designed to remove large quantities of water vapor without clogging-up and minimizing the amount of water vapor passing to the centrifugal fan and final cyclone stage. The air flow through the inlet mesh is forced to be almost parallel to the mesh wires in order to maximize coalescent particle growth before the air flow enters the inlet holes of the cyclone. Liquid water is separated out on the side walls and allowed to drain back through the cyclone inlet holes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The centrifugal fan drives the multi-cyclone <b>20</b> and actually forms the second stage of the particle separator. The fan is powered from a super-capacitor power supply, to average out the input current taken from the fire alarm loop. The fan speed and rotor blade radius determines the efficiency of this stage, with the first cyclone stage increasing the rotor speed due to the drop in air pressure. The outlet flow of the centrifugal fan is mostly returned to the external environment via an exit port <b>12</b><i>c</i>. However a small fraction of its output flow is fed into the final stage of the multi-cyclone <b>20</b>. The aerosol density of the small faction of air flow at this point is representative of the entire aerosol density due to the mixing effect of the fan.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The final cyclone stage uses a tangential input, axial output reverse lift cyclone that is designed for a very sharp cut diameter of above 1 micron. This is achieved by the forced air flow into the tangential input and by feeding the axial output back into the fan input to provide suction in a small diameter vortex finder pipe. An additional cork-screw lift section is also used in the cyclone; while the conical exit section is reduced in length to fit into the sensor, this exit section also recombines with the main exit of the centrifugal fan. The filtered air flow from the axial output of the final cyclone stage is fed into an evaporation chamber before passing through the internal optical scatter chamber <b>14</b> and returned to the output <b>12</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The main exit point <b>12</b><i>c </i>from the detector <b>10</b>, allows the air flow to be passed back into the external protected area R, setting up a &#x2018;donut&#x2019; shaped convection current, ensuring that fire products around and below the sensor can be sampled. If a real fire is present, then the sensed levels in the internal, or detection chamber <b>14</b> quickly, build up and the presence of a fire can be quickly and accurately detected.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After detecting a fire, the multi-cyclone <b>20</b> runs at a low &#x2018;duty-cycle&#x2019; to reduce power, whilst the levels in the detection chamber <b>14</b> can still be monitored to track any further build up of the fire products around the detector <b>10</b>. This process also ensures that the chamber <b>14</b> can still be purged with clear air after a fire. If however, the sensed levels indicate that a non-fire aerosol triggered the cyclone <b>20</b>, then it can be switched-off, until the monitored levels again indicate a possible fire. A constant re-triggering from a non-fire aerosol can also cause the cyclone <b>20</b> to enter the low &#x2018;duty cycle&#x2019; mode.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As the air flow in to the optical scatter chamber does not pass through a high filtration material filter, particles can not build-up on the filter and block it. Alternatively both large and small particles pass through the detector with the larger particles ejected at different point before recombining into a common exit point. As the multi-cyclone is event triggered, then the possibility of the detector being blocked by a build up of debris in a normal environment is effectively no more significant than a detector without a forced air flow and so requires no maintenance throughout its expected life.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One of the external optical scatter angles above the main exit point <b>12</b><i>c </i>has the same infra-red wavelength, sensitivity and scatter angle as the internal optical scatter angle in the chamber <b>14</b>. This external scatter angle senses the external environment circulating above the exit point <b>12</b><i>c </i>when the cyclone is active. The analogue to digital conversion (ADC) outputs from both scatter paths have their background off-sets (clean-air readings) removed and are then digitally filtered with an update rate of between 5S to 20S, after this integration time a window comparator tests the ratio of both scatter paths. As the ratio must be unity for all smokes types, the window comparators ratio limits can be set quite wide for example 0.5 to 2.0. If the ratio is within the comparators limits and the signal is high enough for accurate calculations (a noise gate function) then the background readings are removed, before a high gain is applied to the ADC readings coming from the internal scattering chamber <b>14</b>. A digital filter is then applied to this reading to before it is compared to a fire level, giving accurate and high sensitivity detection for very early smoke detection.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For non-fire aerosols, for example water vapor, the external to internal optical chamber sensitivity ratio will be far more than 100 i.e. well outside the window comparators limits, so the gain applied to the output of the internal scatter chamber will be only for normal smoke detection sensitivity. Alternatively the gain, could be switched to a relatively low sensitivity, however this is not necessary as the cyclone removes nearly all the water vapor and there will be little or no response from the internal chamber, hence no false alarm is possible at any level of water vapor known to occur in practice. As the optical scatter ratio easily identifies the aerosol as a false alarm source, it can also indicate this to the fire alarm panel if this condition lasts for an excessive amount of time. Note that in the above description an enclosed external optical scatter chamber could be used instead of an open optical scatter angle with equal performance benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A thermistor can also be positioned in the exit point <b>12</b><i>c</i>, just below the surface of the detector <b>10</b>, so that if a small change in the ambient air temperature is detected by the thermistor, then the centrifugal fan can be turned-on to sample the external air temperature and provide a fast heat detection response from the thermistor i.e. the buried thermistor can overcome the thermal inertia of the surrounding detector without having to protrude down from the ceiling in a protected molding feature.</p>
