<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present patent application claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-106887, filed on May 7, 2010 in the Japan Patent Office, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates to an image forming apparatus, and more specifically to an image forming apparatus including a recording head to eject liquid droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Image forming apparatuses are used as printers, facsimile machines, copiers, plotters, or multi-functional devices having two or more of the foregoing capabilities. As one type of image forming apparatus employing a liquid-ejection recording method, an inkjet recording apparatus is known that uses a recording head formed with a liquid ejection head (liquid-droplet ejection head) for ejecting droplets of ink. During image formation, the image forming apparatuses eject droplets of ink or other liquid from the recording head onto a recording medium to form a desired image.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such inkjet-type image forming apparatuses fall into two main types: a serial-type image forming apparatus that forms an image by ejecting droplets from the recording head while moving the recording head in a main scanning direction of the carriage, and a line-head-type image forming apparatus that forms an image by ejecting droplets from a linear-shaped recording head held stationary in the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The serial-type image forming apparatus may include, for example, a linear encoder to detect the movement of a carriage mounted with a recording head. The linear encoder includes an encoder scale disposed parallel to the main scanning direction of the carriage and an encoder sensor formed with an optical sensor mounted on the carriage. Further, a rotary encoder is provided in the same manner to control sheet feeding.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such an image forming apparatus employing a liquid ejection head, ink mist arises in ejecting liquid droplets for image formation and can obscure the scale marks, thus preventing precise positional control of the carriage and/or positional and speed control of sheet feeding.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To counteract the above-described effect, in one known approach a side face of the carriage is formed so as to guide airflow carrying ink mist toward an area in which an optical detection unit is not disposed. In another approach, for example, ink mist is suctioned into a hollow guide rod for guiding the carriage. Alternatively, the ink mist is suctioned using a suction unit or absorbed by an absorber.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the above-described approaches are not completely effective. Thus, for example, in a case in which at least one side face of a carriage is shaped to guide airflow, the ink mist is guided toward the front side of the carriage and consequently continuously stirred up, thus adhering to the encoder scale.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an aspect of this disclosure, there is provided an image forming apparatus including a carriage movable in a main scanning direction in the image forming apparatus; a recording head mounted on the carriage to eject droplets; a maintenance unit disposed outboard of a recording area in the main scanning direction of the carriage and including a first liquid receptacle to collect droplets not used for image formation; a first space provided between the recording area and the maintenance unit; and a first sloped member provided at a side of the first space close to the maintenance unit. The sloped member has a sloped portion inclined downwardly from an upper side toward a lateral side close to the recording area to guide droplet mist generated by ejection of droplets from the recording head to a lower part of the first space with movement of the carriage from a position facing the maintenance unit to a position facing the recording area.</p>

The term &#x201c;ink&#x201d; used herein is not limited to &#x201c;ink&#x201d; in a narrow sense and includes anything useable for image formation, such as a DNA sample, resist, pattern material, washing fluid, storing solution, and fixing solution. The term &#x201c;image&#x201d; used herein is not limited to a two-dimensional image and includes, for example, an image applied to a three dimensional object and a three dimensional object itself formed as a three-dimensionally molded image. The term &#x201c;sheet&#x201d; used herein is not limited to a sheet of paper and includes anything such as an OHP (overhead projector) sheet or a cloth sheet on which ink droplets are attached. In other words, the term &#x201c;sheet&#x201d; is used as a generic term including a recording medium, a recorded medium, or a recording sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the exemplary embodiments are described with technical limitations with reference to the attached drawings, such description is not intended to limit the scope of the invention and all of the components or elements described in the exemplary embodiments of this disclosure are not necessarily indispensable to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">First, an inkjet recording apparatus is described as an image forming apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view of a schematic configuration of the inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front view of the inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b> includes a main guide rod <b>1</b>, a sub guide member, left and right side plates <b>100</b>L and <b>100</b>R, a carriage <b>3</b>, a main scan motor <b>5</b>, a driving pulley <b>6</b>, a driven pulley <b>7</b>, and a timing belt <b>8</b>. The main guide rod <b>1</b> and the sub guide member extend between the side plates <b>100</b>L and <b>100</b>R to support the carriage <b>3</b>. The carriage <b>3</b> supported with the main guide rod <b>1</b> and the sub guide member is slidable in a main scanning direction indicated by a double arrow X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The carriage <b>4</b> is moved for scanning in the main scanning direction by the main scan motor <b>5</b> via the timing belt <b>8</b> extended between the driving pulley <b>6</b> and the driven pulley <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">On the carriage <b>3</b>, for example, recording heads <b>4</b><i>y</i>, <b>4</b><i>m</i>, <b>4</b><i>c</i>, and <b>4</b><i>k </i>(hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;recording heads <b>4</b>&#x201d; unless colors distinguished) are mounted to eject ink droplets of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K), respectively. The recording heads <b>4</b> are mounted on the carriage <b>3</b> so that a plurality of nozzle rows each including multiple nozzle orifices is arranged in a direction (sub-scan direction indicated by an arrow Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) perpendicular to the main scanning direction and ink droplets are ejected downward from the nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As a pressure generator to generate pressure for ejecting droplets, liquid ejection heads constituting the recording heads <b>4</b> may employ, for example, piezoelectric actuators such as piezoelectric elements, thermal actuators that generates film boiling of liquid (ink) using electro/thermal conversion elements such as heat-generation resistant to cause a phase change, shape-memory-alloy actuators to change a metal phase by a temperature change, or electrostatic actuators that generate pressure by electrostatic force.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b> also includes a conveyance belt <b>12</b> serving as a conveyance unit to convey a sheet <b>10</b> to a position opposite the recording heads <b>4</b> with the sheet <b>10</b> electrostatically attached thereon. The conveyance belt <b>12</b> is an endless belt extended between a conveyance roller <b>13</b> and a tension roller <b>14</b> so as to circulate in a belt traveling direction (sub-scan direction). The conveyance roller <b>13</b> and the tension roller <b>14</b> are supported between sub side plates <b>101</b>L and <b>101</b>R. A charge roller <b>15</b> charges (i.e., applies electric charges to) the surface of the conveyance belt <b>12</b> circulating in the belt traveling direction.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The conveyance roller <b>13</b> is rotated by a sub-scan motor <b>16</b> via a timing belt <b>17</b> and a timing pulley <b>18</b>. The rotation of the conveyance roller <b>13</b> causes the conveyance belt <b>12</b> to circulate in the sub-san direction indicated by the arrow Y illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At one end in the main scanning direction of the carriage <b>3</b>, a maintenance unit <b>20</b> is disposed near one lateral side of the conveyance belt <b>12</b> to maintain and recover nozzle conditions of the recording heads <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The maintenance unit <b>20</b> includes, for example, cap members <b>31</b>, a wiping member <b>32</b>, and a first liquid receptacle <b>33</b>. Each of the cap members <b>31</b> caps a nozzle face of the corresponding one of the recording heads <b>4</b>. The wiping member <b>32</b> wipes the nozzle faces of the recording heads <b>4</b>. The first liquid receptacle <b>33</b> receives droplets not used for image formation (e.g., droplets ejected for maintenance).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At the other end in the main scanning direction of the carriage <b>3</b>, a second liquid receptacle <b>21</b> is disposed near the other lateral side of the conveyance belt <b>12</b> to receive ink droplets not used for image formation (e.g., droplets ejected for maintenance).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b> includes a linear encoder (main scan encoder) to detect the movement of the carriage <b>3</b>. The linear encoder also includes an encoder scale <b>23</b> and a first encoder sensor <b>24</b>. The encoder scale <b>23</b> with a predetermined pattern extends between the side plates <b>100</b>L and <b>100</b>R in the main scanning direction of the carriage <b>3</b>. The first encoder sensor <b>24</b>, e.g., a transmissive photosensor is provided at the carriage <b>3</b> to read the pattern of the encoder scale <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b> further includes a rotary encoder (sub-scan encoder) to detect the moving distance and position of the conveyance belt <b>12</b>. The rotary encoder includes a code wheel <b>25</b> of high resolution and a second encoder sensor <b>26</b>. The code wheel <b>25</b> with a predetermined pattern is mounted on the shaft of the conveyance roller <b>13</b>. The second encoder sensor <b>26</b>, e.g., a transmissive photosensor detects the pattern of the code wheel <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b> having the above-described configuration, a sheet <b>10</b> fed from a sheet feed tray is attached onto the conveyance belt <b>12</b> charged by the charge roller <b>15</b> and conveyed in the sub-scan direction by the circulation of the conveyance belt <b>12</b>. While moving the carriage <b>3</b> in the main scan direction, the inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b> drives the recording heads <b>4</b> in response to image signals to eject ink droplets onto the sheet <b>10</b> on the conveyance belt <b>12</b> stopped. After recording a first band of an image, the sheet <b>10</b> is conveyed at a certain distance and a second band of the image is recorded on the sheet <b>10</b>. On receiving a recording end signal or a signal indicating that a rear end of the sheet <b>10</b> has reached a recording area of the recording heads <b>4</b>, the inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b> terminates the image recording and outputs the sheet <b>10</b> to an output tray.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, a configuration of guiding mist to a lower part of the image forming apparatus <b>1000</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A first space <b>200</b> is provided between the maintenance unit <b>20</b> and the recording area W of the recording heads <b>4</b> (the sub right-side plate <b>101</b>R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and a first sloped member <b>201</b> is provided at a side of the first space <b>200</b> close to the maintenance unit <b>20</b> or integrally formed with the maintenance unit <b>20</b>. Thus, the first space <b>200</b> is defined by the first sloped member <b>201</b> at a side close to the maintenance unit <b>20</b>, and the first sloped member <b>201</b> has a sloped portion <b>201</b>S inclined downwardly from an upper side (an upper opening <b>202</b> of the first space <b>200</b>) toward a lateral side close to the recording area W (the sub right-side plate <b>101</b>R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A second space <b>205</b> is provided between the second liquid receptacle <b>21</b> and the recording area W of the recording heads <b>4</b> (e.g., the sub left-side plate <b>101</b>L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and a second sloped member <b>206</b> is provided at a side of the second space <b>205</b> close to the second liquid receptacle <b>21</b> or integrally formed with the second liquid receptacle <b>21</b>. Thus, the second space <b>205</b> is defined by the second sloped member <b>206</b> at a side close to the second liquid receptacle <b>21</b>, and the second sloped member <b>206</b> has a sloped portion <b>206</b>S inclined downwardly from an upper side (an upper opening <b>207</b> of the second space <b>205</b>) toward a lateral side close to the recording area W (the sub left-side plate <b>101</b>L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With such a configuration, for example, on starting image recording or at a predetermined timing in image recording, the recording heads <b>4</b> eject ink droplets <b>400</b> toward the first liquid receptacle <b>33</b> of the maintenance unit <b>20</b> for maintenance. At that time, ink mist <b>401</b> is scattered as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. At this state, when the carriage <b>3</b> moves in a direction indicated by an arrow S in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the carriage <b>3</b> passes above the first space <b>200</b> and arrives at a position opposing the conveyance belt <b>12</b>. At that time, air is guided by the first sloped member <b>201</b> backward in the moving direction S of the carriage <b>3</b>, thus creating an airflow <b>300</b> toward a lower part of the first space <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The airflow <b>300</b> going toward the lower part of the first space <b>200</b> guides the ink mist <b>401</b> involved with the maintenance ejection toward the lower part of the first space <b>200</b>, thus minimizing the rising-up of the ink mist <b>401</b>. Accordingly, the amount of the ink mist attached to the encoder scale <b>23</b> decreases, thus reducing smear of the encoder scale <b>23</b>. Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the airflow <b>300</b> toward the lower part of the first space <b>200</b> is created for a while after the carriage <b>3</b> arrives at the position opposing the recording area W of the first space <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">By contrast, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in a case in which such a space defined by a sloped member is not provided between the maintenance unit <b>20</b> and the sub right-side plate <b>101</b>R, the pressure at the rear side of the carriage <b>3</b> relatively decreases, thus creating an airflow going toward the rear side of the carriage <b>3</b>. Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an airflow <b>301</b> goes up, thus causing ink mist involved with maintenance ejection to rise up. As a result, the ink mist attaches to the encoder scale <b>23</b>, thus causing smear of the encoder scale <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Hence, in the present exemplary embodiment, as described above, the first space is provided between the recording area and the maintenance unit. The first space is defined by the first sloped member at a side close to the maintenance unit, and the sloped portion of the first sloped member is inclined downwardly from a portion of a first upper opening close to the maintenance unit toward a side close to the recording area. Accordingly, when the carriage moves from a position close to the maintenance unit to a position close to the recording area, ink mist is guided toward a lower part of the first space. Such a configuration guides the mist toward a lower part of the image forming apparatus, thus minimizing the drift of ink mist in the air and the smear of the encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, the first space <b>200</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The angle &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the sloped portion <b>201</b>S of the first sloped member <b>201</b> is preferably in a range of 30&#xb0;&#x2266;a&#x2266;60&#xb0;. Each of the width &#x201c;m&#x201d; of the first space <b>200</b> in the main scan direction, the width &#x201c;n&#x201d; of the sloped portion <b>201</b>S of the first sloped member <b>201</b> in the main scan direction, the height &#x201c;h&#x201d; of the sloped portion <b>201</b>S of the first sloped member <b>201</b>, and the height &#x201c;k&#x201d; of the first space <b>200</b> excluding the height &#x201c;h&#x201d; of the sloped portion <b>201</b>S of the first sloped member <b>201</b> is preferably 5 mm or more. If the angle &#x201c;a&#x201d; is smaller than 30&#xb0;, less of the airflow may go downward. By contrast, if the angle &#x201c;a&#x201d; is greater than 60&#xb0;, the airflow may go downward and rise up again. If each of the widths &#x201c;m&#x201d; and &#x201c;n&#x201d; and the heights &#x201c;h&#x201d; and &#x201c;k&#x201d; is less than 5 mm, ink mist is not guided downward.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Table 1 shows results of evaluating airflow flowing into the first space <b>200</b> using the angle &#x201c;a&#x201d; and the widths &#x201c;m&#x201d; and &#x201c;n&#x201d; as parameters. The height &#x201c;h&#x201d; of the sloped portion <b>201</b>S of the first sloped member <b>201</b> is determined by the angle &#x201c;a&#x201d; and the width &#x201c;n&#x201d;, and the height &#x201c;k&#x201d; of the first space <b>200</b> excluding the sloped portion <b>201</b>S of the first sloped member <b>201</b> is determined by the height &#x201c;h&#x201d; of the sloped portion <b>201</b>S of the first sloped member <b>201</b> and the other configuration of the image forming apparatus. In table 1, &#x201c;A&#x201d; represents that airflow goes into the first space <b>200</b>, &#x201c;B&#x201d; represents that a portion of airflow goes into the first space <b>200</b> and the amount of airflow going into the first space <b>200</b> is equivalent to that obtained in a case in which the first space <b>200</b> has no sloped portion, and &#x201c;C&#x201d; represents that no airflow goes into the first space <b>200</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a front view of an inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b> according to the fourth exemplary embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a suction fan <b>212</b> is provided at a bottom portion of the first space <b>200</b> to generate airflow. With such a configuration, suctioning of the suction fan <b>212</b> (indicated by arrows SA in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) can effectively generate airflow going from an upper portion to a lower part in the first space <b>200</b>, thus guiding ink mist downward.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, a fifth exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a front view of an inkjet recording apparatus <b>1000</b> according to the fifth exemplary embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an absorber <b>210</b> is provided at a bottom portion of the first space <b>200</b> to absorb ink mist and a suction fan <b>212</b> is provided above the absorber <b>210</b> to generate airflow. With such a configuration, suctioning of the suction fan <b>212</b> can effectively generate airflow going from an upper portion to a lower part in the first space <b>200</b>, thus guiding ink mist downward. In addition, the absorber <b>210</b> can serve as a filter to absorb and retain the guided ink mist, thus further reducing the amount of ink mist scattered and the smear of the encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As described above, the smear of the encoder is reduced, thus reducing operation failures in the positional control of the carriage or the sheet feed control.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the above-described exemplary embodiments, the image forming apparatus is described as a printer. However, it is to be noted that the image forming apparatus is not limited to such a printer and may be, for example, a multifunctional device having two or more capabilities of a printer, a facsimile machine, and a copier. Further, the image forming apparatus may be an image forming apparatus using a recording liquid other than &#x201c;ink&#x201d; in strict meaning, fixing solution, or patterning material.</p>
