<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-0111222, filed on Nov. 10, 2008 with the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Example embodiments relate to a display apparatus in which light illuminated from a backlight unit is used along with external light as an image forming light.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the increased use of portable devices (e.g., mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), portable multimedia players (PMPs), and digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) devices) has come the increased demand for displays with lower power consumption and improved outdoor visibility. Research has been conducted in an attempt to attain a transflective liquid crystal display (LCD) which has a combined form of a reflective display device and a transmittive display device. In a transflective LCD, an image is formed using light from a backlight unit and/or external light. Thus, when the transflective LCD is used in a relatively bright environment (e.g., with sunlight), display visibility may be satisfactorily attained while reducing power consumption. However, liquid crystal cells in a transflective LCD are divided into two regions, a reflective region and a transmittive region. As a result of the incident light being divided by the two regions, there may be a decline in luminance. Furthermore, the manufacturing process for the transflective LCD may be more complex than conventional displays.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Example embodiments of the present application relate to a display apparatus that provides adequate luminance and outdoor visibility while having a relatively low power consumption. A display apparatus according to example embodiments may include a light source; an all-in-one type light guide plate including a light guide member and light emitting members, wherein the light guide member reflects light incident from the light source toward the light emitting members, and the light emitting members protrude from a first surface of the light guide member and emit light incident from the light guide member; a reflective plate on a second surface of the all-in-one type light guide plate, the second surface being on an opposing side of the light guide member from the first surface; and a display panel configured to modulate light emitted from the all-in-one type light guide plate to form an image.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The display panel may be a liquid crystal panel. Alternatively, the display panel may be a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) panel in which black dye is mixed with PDLC. The display panel may also be an electro-wetting display panel which modulates light using an electro-wetting material. The display panel may also be an electrochromic display panel which modulates light using an electrochromic element. The reflective plate may be a scattering type reflective plate, a directional reflective plate, or a mirror type reflective plate. The display apparatus may further include a scattering plate between the all-in-one type light guide plate and the display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each of the light emitting members may have a larger cross-section for a first portion where light is emitted than a cross-section for a second portion where light is incident from the light guide member. A distribution density of the light emitting members may increase with increasing distance of the light emitting members from the light source. A size of the light emitting members may also increase with increasing distance of the light emitting members from the light source. The display apparatus may further include an optical sensor configured to detect external light intensity; and a control unit configured to control brightness of the light source according to the external light intensity detected by the optical sensor.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; &#x201c;coupled to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;covering&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, connected to, coupled to, or covering the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the specification. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. The size, thickness, and/or positioning of the various layers and/or regions may have been exaggerated for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers, and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers, and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer, or section from another element, component, region, layer, or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer, or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer, or section without departing from the teachings of example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Spatially relative terms, e.g., &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Example embodiments are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of example embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments should not be construed as limited to the shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of example embodiments.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a display apparatus according to example embodiments. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the display apparatus <b>1000</b> includes a backlight unit and a display panel <b>200</b>. The backlight unit includes a light source <b>110</b>, an all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b>, and a reflective plate <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The display apparatus <b>1000</b> may use light from the backlight unit and external light as an image forming light. Accordingly, the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> includes a light guide member <b>132</b> and light emitting members <b>135</b>, wherein the light guide member <b>132</b> reflects light incident from the light source <b>110</b> inside and the light emitting members <b>135</b> protrude from one side of the light guide member <b>132</b> and emit light incident from the light guide member <b>132</b> to the outside. The light guide member <b>132</b> and the light emitting members <b>135</b> are combined to form all-in-one type light guide plate and an optical boundary does not exist between the light guide member <b>132</b> and the light emitting members <b>135</b>. The all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> may be manufactured by forming the light emitting members <b>135</b> in a relief shape on one side of the light guide member <b>132</b> so as to integrally form an all-in-one type light guide plate or by connecting the separately formed light guide member <b>132</b> and the light emitting members <b>135</b> without an optical boundary therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The cross-section of the upper portion (from which light is emitted) of each of the light emitting members <b>135</b> may be larger than the cross-section of the lower portion (on which light is incident from the light guide member <b>132</b>). The form and distribution of the light emitting members <b>135</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is not limited thereto and the light emitting members <b>135</b> may be any form that emits light to the outside, wherein the light is incident from the light source <b>110</b>, which is disposed at the side of the light guide member <b>132</b>. For example, in order to make luminance of light emitted from the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> as uniform and high as possible, the light emitting members <b>135</b> may have a denser distribution as the light emitting members <b>135</b> gradually get farther from the light source <b>110</b>. In other words, the number of the light emitting members <b>135</b> located farther from the light source <b>110</b> may be larger than the number of the light emitting members <b>135</b> located closer to the light source <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, the size of the light emitting members <b>135</b> may increase as the light emitting members <b>135</b> gradually get farther from the light source <b>110</b>. The cross-sections of the light emitting members <b>135</b> are not limited to the reversed trapezoid shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and may be in the form of other appropriate shapes. The form and distribution of the light emitting members <b>135</b> may be determined according to the type of light source <b>110</b>. For example, when a point source such as a light emitting diode (LED) is used as the light source <b>110</b>, the form of the upper surfaces of the light emitting members <b>135</b> may have a round shape, in order to obtain a round shape of angular distribution of emitted light. The all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> may be formed of a transparent and flexible material (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The light source <b>110</b> may be disposed on one side of the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b>. A point source (e.g., an LED) or a line source (e.g., Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamps (CCFLs)) may be used as the light source <b>110</b>. In addition, a plurality of point sources may be used or means for converting a point source into a line source may be used along with the point sources.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The reflective plate <b>120</b> may be disposed on the lower surface of the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> (e.g., the surface opposite to the surface with the light emitting members <b>135</b>). The reflective plate <b>120</b> may reflect external light incident through the light emitting members <b>135</b> toward the light emitting members <b>135</b>. Also, the reflective plate <b>120</b> may support light incident from the light source <b>110</b> being reflected in the light guide member <b>132</b>. When light from the light source <b>110</b> reaches the lower surface of the light guide member <b>132</b>, most of light has an incidence angle in which light is totally reflected. However, some light incident with an angle smaller than a critical angle of total reflection is also reflected in the light guide member <b>132</b> by the reflective plate <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The reflective plate <b>120</b> may be a scattering type reflective plate or a directional reflective plate. The scattering type reflective plate includes a scattering pattern formed thereon for scattering and reflecting incident light. The directional reflective plate includes a diffraction pattern formed thereon in which the diffraction efficiency of a specific direction is designed to be relatively high. As such, use of the scattering type reflective plate or the directional reflective plate may reduce the possibility that an image formed by the display panel <b>200</b> will be reflected by the reflective plate <b>120</b> and overlapped on a display surface of the display panel <b>200</b> compared to when the reflective plate <b>120</b> is formed of a mirror type reflective plate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The display panel <b>200</b> may modulate light emitted from the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> and form an image. The display panel <b>200</b> may be a liquid crystal panel. The display panel <b>200</b> includes first and second substrates <b>220</b> and <b>250</b> and a liquid crystal layer <b>230</b> interposed between the first substrate <b>220</b> and the second substrate <b>250</b>. The first and second substrates <b>220</b> and <b>250</b> are transparent and may be formed of glass. First and second polarizers <b>210</b> and <b>260</b> are respectively disposed on the outer surface of the first and second substrates <b>220</b> and <b>250</b>. The polarizing axis of the first and second polarizers <b>210</b> and <b>260</b> may be perpendicular to each other. A color filter <b>240</b> for forming colors is disposed on the inner surface of the second substrate <b>250</b>. Although not illustrated, pixel electrodes and thin film transistor (TFT) layers may be further disposed to control the liquid crystal layer <b>230</b> in correspondence to each of pixels.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the polarization of light L<sub>b </sub>incident from the light source <b>110</b> onto the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> and emitted from the light emitting members <b>135</b> is changed into first polarized light by the first polarizer <b>210</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an electric field is not applied to the liquid crystal layer <b>230</b>, and the polarization of light L<sub>b </sub>incident to the liquid crystal layer <b>230</b>, which passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>230</b>, is changed into second polarized light, which is perpendicular to the first polarized light. Next, light L<sub>b </sub>in the second polarized light state passes through the color filter <b>240</b> so as to have a corresponding color and passes through the second polarizer <b>260</b> through which second polarized light, which is perpendicular to the first polarized light, is transmitted, thereby generating a pixel-on state.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">External light L<sub>f </sub>incident from the front of the display panel <b>200</b> may also be an image forming light. External light L<sub>f </sub>passes through the second polarizer <b>260</b> and is changed into second polarized light. Then, second polarized light passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>230</b>, to which an electric field is not applied, and is changed into first polarized light, thereby passing through the first polarizer <b>210</b>, through which first polarized light is transmitted. Next, external light L<sub>f </sub>is incident to the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> through the light emitting members <b>135</b> and is reflected at the reflective plate <b>120</b>, thereby being emitted through the light emitting members <b>135</b>. The emitted light passes through the first polarizer <b>210</b>, the liquid crystal layer <b>230</b>, the color filter <b>240</b>, and the second polarizer <b>260</b>, thereby generating a pixel-on state representing the color corresponding to the color filter <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal layer <b>230</b> and liquid crystals are arranged therein along the direction of the electric field. Thus, polarization of light passing through the liquid crystal layer <b>230</b> is not changed. Light incident to the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> from the light source <b>110</b>, emitted through the light emitting members <b>135</b>, and incident to the display panel <b>200</b>, passes through the first polarizer <b>210</b> and is changed into first polarized light. Then, light changed into first polarized light passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>230</b> and is maintained as the first polarized light. Accordingly, the light does not pass through the second polarizer <b>260</b>, through which second polarized light is transmitted, thereby generating a pixel-off state. When external light L<sub>f </sub>passes through the second polarizer <b>260</b>, the external light L<sub>f </sub>is changed into second polarized light and passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>230</b>, while maintaining the second polarized light state. Thus, the light is absorbed in the first polarizer <b>210</b>, thereby generating a pixel-off state.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of another display apparatus according to example embodiments.

The backlight unit includes the light source <b>110</b>, the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b>, a reflective plate <b>140</b>, and a scattering plate <b>150</b>. The display apparatus <b>2000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is different from the display apparatus <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that the reflective plate <b>140</b> may be a mirror type reflective plate and the scattering plate <b>150</b> is interposed between the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> and the display panel <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, whereas the reflective plate <b>120</b> may be a scattering type reflective plate or a directional reflective plate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Because the mirror type reflective plate <b>140</b> and the scattering plate <b>150</b> are employed, images formed on the display panel <b>200</b> are reflected by the reflective plate <b>140</b> and thus the possibility that the overlapped image appears on the display surface of the display panel <b>200</b> may be reduced. A principle of forming an image in the display apparatus <b>2000</b> by using light from the backlight unit and external light is substantially the same as that of in the display apparatus <b>1000</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of another display apparatus according to example embodiments. The display apparatus <b>3000</b> may have a backlight unit (including the light source <b>110</b>, the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b>, and the reflective plate <b>120</b>) and a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) panel <b>300</b>. The display apparatus <b>3000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is different from the display apparatus <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that a PDLC panel <b>300</b> is employed in the display apparatus <b>3000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The PDLC panel <b>300</b> includes a PDLC layer <b>330</b> formed by mixing black dye with PDLCs, wherein the PDLC layer <b>330</b> is interposed between a first substrate <b>310</b> and a second substrate <b>350</b>. When an electric field is not applied to the PDLCs, the PDLCs scatter incident light due to a permittivity difference of polymers and liquid crystals. When an electric field is applied to the PDLCs, a permittivity difference between liquid crystals arranged along the electric field and polymers is reduced and the PDLCs become transparent, thereby having a characteristic of allowing light to pass through. In the PDLC layer <b>330</b> formed by mixing black dye with PDLC, when an electric field is not applied to the PDLC layer <b>330</b> and the PDLC scatters light, light is absorbed in the PDLC layer <b>330</b> by the black dye, thereby respectively generating a pixel-off state. On the other hand, when an electric field is applied to the PDLC layer <b>330</b>, light passes through the PDLC layer <b>330</b>, thereby generating a pixel-on state. Unlike a general liquid crystal panel, the polarization of incident light is not used. As a result, a polarizing plate is not needed. A color filter <b>340</b> for expressing a color may be disposed on the inner surface of the second substrate <b>350</b>. In addition, although not illustrated, pixel electrodes and TFT layers for controlling the PDLC layer <b>330</b> in correspondence to each pixel may also be employed.</p>

In this case, a permittivity difference between the liquid crystals and the polymers is reduced and thus, PDLCs become transparent so as to allow light to pass through. Light L<sub>b </sub>incident from the light source <b>110</b> onto the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> and emitted from the light emitting members <b>135</b> passes through the transparent PDLC layer <b>330</b> and passes through the color filter <b>340</b>, thereby generating a pixel-on state expressing the color corresponding to the color filter <b>340</b>.

As described above, light from the light source <b>110</b> is emitted to the display panel <b>200</b> by the all-in-one type light guide plate <b>130</b> and light incident from the front of the display panel <b>200</b> is reflected back toward the display panel <b>200</b>. The display panel <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be a liquid crystal panel as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, the PDCL panel, the electrochromic display panel, the electro-wetting display panel, the electrophoretic display panel, and the MEMS shutter as described in the above examples may also be used as the display panel <b>200</b>. The optical sensor is configured to detect the intensity of external light incident to the display panel <b>200</b>, and may be manufactured simultaneously with the display panel <b>200</b> or may be separately manufactured and assembled. The brightness of the light source <b>110</b> is controlled by the control unit according to the external light intensity detected by the optical sensor. When external light and light from the backlight unit are used together as image forming light, the brightness of the light source <b>110</b> may be controlled so as to maintain an appropriate luminance. Also, according to a surrounding environment, any one of the external light and the light from the backlight unit may be used so as to reduce power consumption.</p>
