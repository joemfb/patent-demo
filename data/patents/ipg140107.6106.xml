<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to computer command processing, and more specifically, to providing computer system users with intelligent command predictions.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some computer systems retain a buffered list of recently used commands. When a user desires to input a command from a command line input interface, the user may have an option of scrolling through the buffered list and selecting one of the recently used commands as the current command. Since some commands may be repeated frequently, such as change directory commands when navigating through a file system, scrolling through the buffered list to select a command may be faster than retyping the command. Additionally, some commands can include long strings of attributes or special flags that may be cumbersome for a user to remember and increases the likelihood of the user making a typographical error. More advanced command prediction logic may track a sequence of commands entered by the user and attempt to predict which command the user is most likely to desire next based on the user's previously entered commands.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An exemplary embodiment is a method for intelligent command prediction. The method includes determining a command prediction preference associated with a user from user profile data, and selecting one or more command history repositories responsive to the command prediction preference. The one or more command history repositories include command history data collected from a plurality of users and classification data associated with the plurality of users. The method also includes calculating command probabilities for commands in the command history data of the selected one or more command history repositories as a function of the classification data associated with the plurality of users in relation to the user. The method additionally includes presenting a next suggested command as a command from the command history data of the selected one or more command history repositories with a highest calculated command probability.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another exemplary embodiment is a system for intelligent command prediction. The system includes a data storage system with user profile data and one or more command history repositories. The one or more command history repositories include command history data collected from a plurality of users and classification data associated with the plurality of users. The system also includes intelligent command prediction logic configured to execute on one or more servers and communicate with the data storage system and one or more command interfaces. The intelligent command prediction logic is configured to determine a command prediction preference associated with a user from the user profile data, and select one or more of the one or more command history repositories responsive to the command prediction preference. The intelligent command prediction logic is also configured to calculate command probabilities for commands in the command history data of the selected one or more command history repositories as a function of the classification data associated with the plurality of users in relation to the user. The intelligent command prediction logic is additionally configured to present a next suggested command as a command from the command history data of the selected one or more command history repositories with a highest calculated command probability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A further exemplary embodiment is a computer program product for intelligent command prediction. The computer program product includes a storage medium readable by a processing circuit and storing instructions for execution by the processing circuit for implementing a method. The method includes determining a command prediction preference associated with a user from user profile data, and selecting one or more command history repositories responsive to the command prediction preference.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide intelligent command prediction to assist users in quickly selecting and issuing commands. To enhance command prediction accuracy, rather than relying exclusively on previous commands entered by a user, the intelligent command prediction logic collects and analyzes historical command data based on one or more of: a system grouping, user role, and time of command execution. Thus, the intelligent command prediction not only accounts for previously issued commands from the same user, but also factors in data from other users who are part of the same system grouping, who have the same role, and/or perform actions at a similar time. This larger data set can improve the accuracy of predictions since other users with similar attributes may perform similar sequences of activities. Configurable user profiles allow for user-specific feature customization, such as which type of data to include in command prediction calculations and the number of suggestions desired. User profiles may also support adjustable weightings to consider multiple factors and favor selected data sources more heavily over other data sources in determining probabilities of predicted commands.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Turning now to the drawings, it will be seen that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is a block diagram of a system <b>100</b> upon which intelligent command prediction is implemented in exemplary embodiments. The system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes servers <b>102</b> in communication with user systems <b>104</b> over a network <b>106</b>. In exemplary embodiments, the servers <b>102</b> are high-speed processing devices (e.g., a mainframe computer, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, or the like) including at least one processing circuit (e.g., a CPU) capable of reading and executing instructions, and handling numerous interaction requests from the user systems <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In exemplary embodiments, the user systems <b>104</b> comprise desktop, laptop, general-purpose computer devices, and/or networked devices with processing circuits and I/O interfaces, such as a keyboard and display device. The servers <b>102</b> and user systems <b>104</b> can include various computer hardware and software technology known in the art, such as one or more processing units or circuits, volatile and non-volatile memory including removable media, power supplies, network interfaces, support circuitry, operating systems, and the like. The servers <b>102</b> may also include one or more user interfaces <b>107</b> with user accessible I/O devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, and display. The one or more user interfaces <b>107</b> enable one or more local users to access the servers <b>102</b>, as an alternate or additional means of providing input and receiving intelligent command prediction output.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The network <b>106</b> may be any type of communications network known in the art. For example, the network <b>106</b> may be an intranet, extranet, or an internetwork, such as the Internet, or a combination thereof. The network <b>106</b> can include wireless, wired, and/or fiber optic links. Additional computer systems (not depicted) can also be accessed via the network <b>106</b> or other networks.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The data storage system <b>108</b> refers to any type of computer readable storage medium and may comprise one or more secondary storage elements, e.g., hard disk drive (HDD), tape, or a storage subsystem that is internal or external to the servers <b>102</b>. Types of data that may be stored in the data storage system <b>108</b> include, for example, various files and databases. It will be understood that the data storage system <b>108</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is provided for purposes of simplification and ease of explanation and is not to be construed as limiting in scope. To the contrary, there may be multiple data storage systems <b>108</b> utilized by the servers <b>102</b>, which can be distributed in various locations of the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The servers <b>102</b> can include multiple physical resources and logical resources to implement a variety of system groupings. The servers <b>102</b> can be clustered into groups, which may be distributed across the network <b>106</b>, with shared access to data storage system <b>108</b>. For example, system A grouping <b>110</b>, system B grouping <b>112</b>, and system C grouping <b>114</b> represent homogeneous system groupings that are configured to run one or more specific application per grouping on the servers <b>102</b>, such as database applications, web services, or application servers. In exemplary embodiments, the homogeneous system groupings are grouped according to similarly provided services, for instance, database services. Each of the system groupings may have command interfaces that enable users of the user systems <b>104</b> and/or user interfaces <b>107</b> to issue commands to the system groupings. For instance, command interface <b>116</b> allows users to issue commands to system A grouping <b>110</b>, command interface <b>118</b> enables users to issue commands to system B grouping <b>112</b>, and command interface <b>120</b> facilitates issuing of commands to system C grouping <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The servers <b>102</b> also execute intelligent command prediction (ICP) logic <b>122</b>. The ICP logic <b>122</b> communicates with the data storage system <b>108</b> and one or more of the command interfaces <b>116</b>-<b>120</b> to track commands entered by users and offer one or more suggestions as the next commands for the users. The ICP logic <b>122</b> can be located on any of the servers <b>102</b> or distributed between the servers <b>102</b>, including separate instances dynamically instantiated on a per user basis. Users may interface with the command interfaces <b>116</b>-<b>120</b> from user system <b>104</b> over network <b>106</b> and/or from user interfaces <b>107</b>. The ICP logic <b>122</b> can capture commands input via the command interfaces <b>116</b>-<b>120</b>. Data associated with users can be stored in user profile data <b>124</b> on data storage system <b>108</b>. The ICP logic <b>122</b> may write the captured commands to command history repositories <b>126</b> on data storage system <b>108</b> in records associated with the users. As the users issue commands, command histories in the command history repositories <b>126</b> are populated to increase the data set. The command histories in the command history repositories <b>126</b> can be configured as first-in-first-out buffers or circular queues to retain a maximum number of data values, discarding the oldest values to prevent excessive data collection.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The command history repositories <b>126</b> can be implemented as a single repository or a collection of repositories. For example, the command history repositories <b>126</b> may include a system grouping command history repository <b>128</b>, a role-based command history repository <b>130</b>, and a time-based command history repository <b>132</b>. In one embodiment, user identification information is a primary key for linking data between the command history repositories <b>126</b>. Alternatively, one or more index values can be used to cross-reference data between the command history repositories <b>126</b>. Further details about the user profile data <b>124</b> and the command history repositories <b>126</b> in relation to the ICP logic <b>122</b> are provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An example of a subset of user profile data <b>124</b> is provided in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the user profile data <b>124</b> can include user identification information, preferences, and a number of suggestions desired. The preferences may indicate command prediction preferences, such as whether the ICP logic <b>122</b> should calculate command probabilities using one or more of the system grouping command history repository <b>128</b>, role-based command history repository <b>130</b>, and time-based command history repository <b>132</b>. The user profile data <b>124</b> may also include weightings associated with the command prediction preferences, indicating that a greater weighting should be given to preferred classification data of the selected command history repositories. The number of suggestions desired indicates how many predicted commands should be presented to specific users.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a process <b>200</b> for intelligent command prediction will now be described in accordance with exemplary embodiments, and in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At block <b>202</b>, the ICP logic <b>122</b> determines a command prediction preference associated with a user from user profile data <b>124</b>. At block <b>204</b>, the ICP logic <b>122</b> selects one or more command history repositories <b>126</b> responsive to the command prediction preference. The one or more command history repositories <b>126</b> include command history data collected from a plurality of users and classification data associated with the plurality of users. One or more the command history repositories <b>126</b> from which the selection is performed can include the system grouping command history repository <b>128</b>, the role-based command history repository <b>130</b>, and the time-based command history repository <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At block <b>206</b>, the ICP logic <b>122</b> calculates command probabilities for commands in the command history data of the selected one or more command history repositories <b>126</b> as a function of the classification data associated with the plurality of users in relation to the user. The command probabilities may be calculated from a frequency of use of the commands as determined from the command history data of the selected one or more command history repositories <b>126</b> where the classification data associated with the plurality of users matches a classification associated with the user. Alternatively, the command probabilities can be calculated according to weightings associated with the command prediction preference, giving a greater weighting to preferred classification data of the selected one or more command history repositories <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additional time-based actions can be performed in determining command probabilities as a function of time. For example, the ICP logic <b>122</b> can sort commands in the time-based command history repository <b>132</b> as time groups by work shift, workdays, weekend days, and holidays, filtering the commands used in calculating the command probabilities to align with one of the time groups corresponding to a time that the user is presented with the next suggested command. Time based groupings can account for differences in typical actions performed during peak and non-peak hours, weekends, and holidays, such as various maintenance activities.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At block <b>208</b>, the ICP logic <b>122</b> presents a next suggested command as a command from the command history data of the selected one or more command history repositories <b>126</b> with a highest calculated command probability. The ICP logic <b>122</b> may present multiple options to the user by reading a number of suggestions desired associated with the user from the user profile data <b>124</b>, and presenting additional suggested commands in descending order from the highest calculated command probability until the number of suggestions desired have been presented to the user. The ICP logic <b>122</b> can also capture commands input by the plurality of users, and write the captured commands to the one or more command history repositories <b>126</b> in records associated with the plurality of users.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Technical effects include predicting one or more commands that a user may desire to execute next based on data collected from multiple users. Command histories are collected and classified to determine probabilities of a likely next command or sequence of commands. Accounting for features such as system grouping, user role, and time-based activities, similar profiles of activity patterns are developed from which predictions under similar conditions can be made with a higher degree of accuracy than limiting predictions to only past commands issued by the same user.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The diagrams depicted herein are just examples. There may be many variations to these diagrams or the steps (or operations) described therein without departing from the spirit of the invention.
