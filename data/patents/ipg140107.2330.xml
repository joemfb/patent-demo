<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a packaging material that includes an oxygen scavenger material dispersed in bands in a polymer sheet. In particular it is directed to such a polymer sheet utilized in forming packages.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Flexible packaging sheeting is known to be utilized to form bags and standup pouches and is broadly used in the medical, food packaging and food service industries. Conventional bags and pouches used in food packaging usually contain barrier resins and are cosmetically decorated. Materials for making these containers can be polyolefins, polystyrene, nylon, polyester, and biopolymers such as polylactic acid. The structure of these materials usually is multilayer and may include an oxygen barrier material such as polyethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), and nylon. The bags are designed to maintain freshness of the food or medicine in the bag. A common way to improve the freshness of a meat package is to put oxygen absorber in a sachet in the meat package (U.S. Publication No. 2011-0217430-Chau). It is desirable to avoid the use of sachets in many loose food products as they may become ingested or broken after the package is opened. It is known to put oxygen absorber on an adhesive label that is on the inside of a package.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While the techniques of utilizing an inner label for oxygen absorption or a sachet are reasonably effective they have the disadvantage that they are relatively high cost as each requires an extra step in forming a package and additionally another material formation process to make the label or sachet. There is need for a package that does not require the additional step of providing oxygen absorber into the package formed of polymer sheet, but also provides a package that has large areas of transparent polymer so that the end-user can see the material in the package.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is shown in U.S. Publication No. 2011/0217430-Chau that oxygen scavenger may be placed into a foam sheet for use in packaging meat.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,956-Hatakeyama discloses a multilayer structural material including an oxygen absorber that may be utilized in forming packaged goods.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Publication No. 2010/0255231-Chau discloses an oxygen scavenging film assumed for use in making bags or pouches.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,264-Kirksey discloses a method and apparatus for making extruded plastic polymer film with strips embedded therein of a second thermoplastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 5,687,863-Cullen and U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,161-Cullen et al. disclose a label containing oxygen scavenger which may be placed on the inside of a package.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a need for an oxygen absorbing package that may be formed utilizing known package-making apparatus and processes without extra steps for providing the oxygen absorption. There also is a need for an oxygen absorbing packaging sheet that will enable the making of a package having transparent viewing areas.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention relates to a packaging material which includes a continuous polymer sheet wherein said sheet includes at least one longitudinal band of oxygen absorber.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment of the invention a package utilizing a portion of the continuous polymer sheet with a band of oxygen absorber is formed.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effect of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention provides a package with oxygen absorbing areas and transparent areas that may be made from one sheet of film by ordinary packaging forming methods which involve folding a sheet to form a package and sealing the edges of the folded materials together.</p>

The invention provides a continuous strip of material containing longitudinal bands of oxygen absorber between and separated by transparent areas. The continuous strip may be utilized in conventional bag and pouch making machines to form a pouch or bag that has oxygen absorbent properties but still allows transparent areas for viewing of a product in the pouch or bag. Present processes to form oxygen absorbent pouches and bags require a separate step to place a sachet into the bag or a label onto the bag to provide oxygen absorbent properties. Previous materials with oxygen absorbers throughout the lateral width of a sheet could be formed into oxygen absorbent pouches and bags but the bags did not have transparent areas. The bags without transparent areas are not desirable for many foods where the customer likes to see the food. Therefore, the instant invention provides significant advantages in a formation technique that results in lower cost and a much improved product design. With the invention bags and pouches no consideration need to be given to sachets being ingested with the contents of the bag. Further, there is no concern about oxygen absorbent labels coming detached and mixing with the contents of the bag. Further, as above stated, labels and sachets are not necessary thereby resulting in significant cost savings. By varying the width of the bands of oxygen absorber in the package forming sheet the amount of oxygen absorption available may be matched to the particular product being packaged. This avoids waste of the oxygen absorber material thereby lowering cost. These and other advantages will be apparent from the detailed description and drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown an overhead view of a continuous banded film or sheet <b>12</b> that has bands of transparent areas <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b>. The sheet <b>12</b> also has bands of oxygen absorbing areas <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>. As utilized herein continuous sheet or continuous film generally refers to a sheet that has a length in a longitudinal direction greater than its width in the transverse direction. In some application, the sheet or film may be longer than 1000 feet in the longitudinal direction. A typical length of continuous sheets is between 5,000 and 10,000 feet for smaller packaging runs. Generally sheets of material for packaging have a preferred length of between about 5,000 and about 20,000 feet, for economical sheet formation, printing, and package formation with long runs. A continuous sheet or film is generally cut one or both of longitudinally and transversely to form packaging blanks, which are used to form individual packages. The invention is directed to both the continuous films and to individual blanks for making packages, as will be described in more detail below. When the term &#x201c;oxygen absorbing band&#x201d; is utilized in this application it is intended to mean the longitudinal stripes formed by the addition of oxygen absorber to a longitudinal portion of a continuous sheet. It may also be used to refer to a portion of the oxygen absorbing band cut from the continuous sheet. In package formation &#x201c;stripe&#x201d; may be used to identify a piece cut from the continuous band. Generally, the oxygen absorbing areas are not transparent but are gray and translucent having the ability to pass between 25 and 85% of visible light through the sheet. The areas between the oxygen absorbing bands are generally transparent having an ability to pass greater than 90% and preferably greater than 95% of the visible light applied to the transparent band.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a cross-section along line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a three layer structure including outer layers <b>27</b>, <b>31</b> and an inner layer <b>29</b>. In this embodiment the inner layer <b>29</b> has oxygen absorbing portions <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and transparent portions <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, to form the oxygen absorbing bands <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and the transparent bands <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of the sheet <b>12</b>. The outer layers <b>27</b>, <b>31</b> are applied to opposite faces of the inner layer <b>29</b> to form the three layer structure. The outer layers <b>27</b>, <b>31</b> preferably are transparent and printable, as will be described in more detail below. In one embodiment, the three layers <b>27</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>31</b> are coextruded, but in still other embodiments two or more of the layers could be laminated after formation. Other techniques for forming multi-layer structures will be appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art and are within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The three layer structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> generally would be formed into a sheet suitable for package formation by adhering the sheet <b>12</b> to a preformed oxygen barrier material such as a film that contains ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates such a packaging sheet <b>40</b> having an EVOH sheet <b>34</b> attached to the sheet <b>12</b>. The oxygen barrier layer may be attached to the sheet <b>12</b> utilizing a tie layer <b>36</b> which will allow secure attachment of the sheets of polyethylene and ethylene vinyl alcohol to each other. Generally, the layer containing the oxygen barrier material is shielded from the inside of the package by an oxygen permeable layer, such as layer <b>31</b>. Shielding the oxygen absorber layer from the package contents prevents the contamination of the oxygen absorbent material, such as iron, by material in the package and also contamination of food material in the package. The oxygen barrier sheet <b>34</b> may be attached during formation of the banded sheet such that it is coextensive with the continuous banded film <b>12</b> to form packaging sheet <b>40</b>. The oxygen barrier sheet it will be understood may be comprised of several layers of material that may provide properties such as strength or printability in addition to oxygen barrier properties.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is illustrated packaging film <b>50</b> which consists of the packaging film <b>40</b> with printing <b>52</b> over the areas <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the continuous packaging film that contain oxygen absorbent. The areas <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> are transparent and will, after package formation, allow the consumer to view the contents of the package. The areas of oxygen absorbent will be translucent and after printing the color and transparency of the film in the printed areas is not apparent to the observer. The printing does not need to only coincide with the areas over the oxygen absorber and may extend into the transparent areas as necessary to form a pleasing design for the package. The sheet <b>50</b> may, depending on its width, be cut into several pieces transversely and longitudinally, and then folded to form packages. The film also could be utilized as a cover for the open top of a tray containing food or medicine. It also could be used as a wrap for a pre-existing oxygen permeable package that did not have oxygen barrier properties. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the package <b>60</b> is formed of half of packaging sheet <b>50</b> that has been cut on line <b>54</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The package is wrapped and sealed on the backside in the known manner for bag formation, not shown, and then sealed at the top <b>62</b> and bottom <b>64</b> adhesively or by heat and pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a bag <b>70</b> that has transparent areas <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. The printing area <b>76</b> overlaps the oxygen barrier area <b>78</b> and also onto transparent areas <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, and <b>88</b>.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a bag <b>90</b> that is provided with oxygen absorbing bands <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>. The transparent areas <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> are transparent. The transparent areas <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> have been utilized for the seals <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Any suitable oxygen scavenger may be utilized in the invention. Typical oxygen scavengers are sulfur dioxide, chelates of salicylic acid or a salicylate salt. Other suitable oxygen scavenger materials are salts or chelates of metals such as zinc, copper, aluminum, and tin. Iron oxygen scavengers are preferred in many application because they are effective and low in cost.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A most preferred oxygen scavenger is reduced iron powder coated with activating and acidifying materials. It preferably has 1-25 &#x3bc;m mean particle size, more preferably 1-10 &#x3bc;m mean particle size and most preferably 2-5 &#x3bc;m mean particle size for rapid scavenging and good pore formation. The combination and relative fraction of activating and acidifying components coated onto the iron particles are selected according to the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6,899,822, U.A. Patent Application Nos. 2005/0205841 and 2007/0020456, incorporated herein by reference. The coating technique is preferably a dry coating as described in the references above. The current invention may use iron-based powders with a mean particle size of 1-25 &#x3bc;m, where iron particles are pre-coated with activating and oxidation reaction promoter particles to form a homogeneous powder. The sheets or articles produced with the finely dispersed oxygen scavenging particles advantageously possess high reactivity with oxygen. The oxygen scavenging particles disperse well throughout the bands where they are utilized. A preferred embodiment of the iron powder with activating and acidifying ingredients is the dry coated oxygen scavenging particles as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,951,419 hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The polymer containing the oxygen scavenger may be any suitable polymer that is permeable to oxygen and readily extruded. Suitable materials include polyolefin such as high density and low density polyethylene and polypropylene and modified forms thereof, polyester such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide such as nylon 6 and nylon 66, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, styrene-ethylene copolymers, polyester, polyurethane, and polyvinylindene chloride. A preferred material is low density polyethylene as this material is transparent, low in cost, extrudable at relatively low temperatures, and transmits oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Polymers utilized in the invention may also include biodegradable polymers such as polylactic acid and its copolymers. Other biodegradable polymers include polycaprolactone, thermoplastic starches, cellulose, and polysaccharides.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Packaging materials of the invention also preferably include an oxygen barrier layer. The polymer forming the oxygen barrier layer may be any material that will prevent the transmission of oxygen. Such materials include metallic layers of tin or aluminum and polyvinyl alcohol. A preferred material is ethyl vinyl alcohol (EVOH) as this material is readily available, relatively low in cost, extrudable at polyethylene temperatures, and has very good oxygen barrier properties.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The packaging films of the invention may be extruded as a continuous unitary packaging member with an oxygen barrier layer and layers with bands of oxygen absorbent. Alternatively a continuous oxygen absorber banded extruded sheet may be formed and then laminated with separately formed oxygen barrier layer containing sheet by the use of suitable tie layers to adhesively connect the sheets. The packaging may be printed by printing the barrier layer sheet prior to lamination. It is also possible to print the oxygen banded material after extrusion or laminating.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The continuous packaging sheets of the invention with longitudinal bands of oxygen absorber generally do not require any special packaging as they are self protecting due to the many layers thickness of the roll. The rolls generally have a length of greater than 1,000 feet and the many layers, containing oxygen barrier layers, wrapped on the roll provide protection from oxygen penetration. The rolls of the invention material may be handled as are the rolls of printed packaging material now utilized in the food and medical industry. Normally when the materials are first fed off a roll this leader material is not utilized as it is lost during setup. This top layer material would generally be the only packaging material that might be affected by oxygen in storage.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The following are illustrations of packaging sheets of the invention. In each of the sheets illustrated where the oxygen absorber is indicated the oxygen absorber is in bands separated by bands of transparent low density polyethylene that do not have oxygen absorber present. In all instances the polyethylene is low density polyethylene. The coated iron oxygen absorber is an oxygen scavenger package prepared by coating iron particulates, 4-5 &#x3bc;m mean particle size, with sodium bisulfate and sodium chloride to form a homogeneous coated composite powder having a composition by weight of 80% iron, 10% sodium bisulfate, and 10% sodium chloride.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0052">The printing of the packaging films of the invention preferably is carried out by unrolling the oxygen absorbent sheet and printing it by rotogravure or flexographic processes. This allows for printing bright colors and dark colors on the sheet, particularly where the band of oxygen absorber is present. It further would be possible that the oxygen barrier sheet could be printed prior to its being attached to the banded layer of oxygen absorber sheet. It is also possible that the printing of the sheet could be carried out as it is unwound prior to being slit both in the longitudinal and transverse direction to form the blanks from which bags are made or the packaging materials are utilized as coverings for containers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">The amount of iron in the bands of oxygen absorber may be any amount that provides the necessary result in a particular package. Typically the oxygen absorber portion of coated iron oxygen absorber is present in an amount of between 5 and 80% by weight of the polymer layer portion containing the oxygen absorber.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">The polymer bags of the invention may be utilized for any package that requires a reduced oxygen atmosphere in the bag. Typical of such materials are food materials such as coffee, fresh meat, beef jerky, pasta, baby food and other moist foods. The packages also may be used for medical products such as pills and replacement body parts which require protection from oxygen. The oxygen absorber is activated by water that comes from the materials packaged such as fresh meat or beef jerky.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">The phrase &#x201c;tie layer&#x201d; as used in the description of packaging materials of the invention refers to a thin layer utilized to join previously formed sheets in order to form them into laminate. It also refers to layers extruded between dissimilar polymers in an extrusion head in order to bind these polymers. Typical polymers or solvents utilized in tie layers for coextrusion of a polyethylene layer to an ethylene vinyl alcohol layer are maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene or polypropylene ethylene vinyl acetate and ethylene acrylic acid copolymers. Typical polymers utilized to join layers during coextrusion are commercial resins such as ADMER (Mitsui Chemical) maleic anhydride grafted resin, AMPLIFY (Dow Chemical) functionalized polyethylene and PLEXAR (LyondellBasell) maleic anhydride grafted polythylene. A preferred tie layer polymer for joining ethylene vinyl alcohol and polyethylene during coextrusion is maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene or polypropylene because they give strong bond between EVOH and polyethylene. Generally, the tie layer serves no function in the sheet except to join the layers.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">Extrusion heads for extruding the polymer sheets of the invention are known in the art. As is conventionally known, various feedblocks may be used in conjunction with extrusion heads to form desired co-extruded materials. In the present invention, a feedblock receives the different materials to be incorporated into a sheet of material and delivers that material to a die that forms the sheets. For instance it would be known that the bands containing oxygen absorber would need to be made with a resin of lower viscosity as the addition of the particulate iron oxygen absorber would raise the viscosity. It is also known in the art to extrude polymer sheets in widths from only a few centimeters up to more than two meters in width, depending upon the desired packaging. In some embodiments wide polymer sheets are extruded that will be slit both longitudinally and transversely to form blanks for use in forming packages.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">A feedblock is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. There, a feedblock <b>110</b> includes three openings <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> laterally spaced by spacers <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> and bounded above and below by a top <b>140</b> and a bottom <b>142</b>. In use, the oxygen absorber-containing composition is extruded through opening <b>114</b> and the transparent polymers are co-extruded through the openings <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> to form a sheet containing an oxygen-absorbing strip <b>130</b> located transversely between two transparent strips <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 7A</figref> are not to scale.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an alternative feedblock <b>110</b>, substantially identical to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, except it includes additional openings <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, and spacers <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>. An extrusion head employing this feedblock results in a film such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> having three transparent strips <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> and two oxygen-absorbing strips <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, which is similar to the film illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. As noted above, outer layers, such as those designated as reference numerals <b>27</b> and <b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2A</figref> may be co-extruded with the striped layer, or may be laminated after extrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">Although the inventor has used feedblocks such as those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, he has found that because of viscosity differences between the transparent polymers and the oxygen-absorbent material that openings having the same height &#x201c;h&#x201d; as those shown in those figures result in a film having a non-uniform thickness. Specifically, the illustrated feedblocks <b>110</b> result in thicker oxygen-absorbing strips than transparent areas. An observed cross-section of a film formed using a head <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As shown, the center of the oxygen-absorbing strip <b>130</b> is thicker in the middle, and narrows at the junction with each of the transparent strips <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, which in turn narrow further out to their edges. In one application, the film was as thick as 3.5 mil at the center and as narrow as 2 mil nearer the edges. This difference is extremely noticeable upon winding several thousand feet of the film on a roll.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">A preferred feedblock <b>210</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The feedblock <b>210</b> is substantially identical to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, except top <b>240</b> and bottom <b>242</b> are arcuate instead of planar. Accordingly, the height of central opening <b>214</b> varies along the transverse direction, i.e., between openings <b>212</b>, <b>216</b>. The respective heights of openings <b>212</b>, <b>216</b> also vary with width, being larger at the edges of the feedblock <b>210</b>. The arc of the top and bottom may be calculated to ensure a substantially uniform thickness across the film, based on the materials (and their viscosities) to be extruded. Thus, a different head is used for each combination of extruded materials.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">In another embodiment, the height of the openings, i.e., the distances between the top and bottom are adjustable. Such an adjustable feedblock <b>310</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. There, the top <b>340</b> and the bottom <b>342</b> are deformable upon application of a force along arrows F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>, respectively. As illustrated, both the top and bottom are fixed at lateral ends and deformed to contact spacers <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, creating an arcuate shape above and below the openings <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>. The spacers may be sized for the application, that is, such that sufficient force is provided to result in contact of the spacers by the top and bottom. Alternatively, the spacers may also be deformable under the forces F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>. In an application in which more openings are provided, it may be desirable to provide additional forces on any openings that will pass the oxygen-absorbing material therethrough. The forces may be applied using any known methodologies, although the force is preferably controllable by the user to fine-tune the size of the opening. In one example, set screws may be provided outside the extrusion head that are selectively turned to apply a desired force. Other arrangements will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">In an embodiment similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the deformable top and bottom may be fixed to the spacers, such that a force applied along arrows F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> will only create a curvature in the central opening <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">Although only oxygen absorber has been discussed as an additive to the bands, it is possible to utilize other additive with the iron particles, in the inner layer of the packaging sheet or other layers. Additives such as biocides and fungicides could be combined with the polymer of these or other layers. Brighteners could be added to the layers or to the printing layers. Colorants also could be used to give the transparent areas a color or tint to improve the look of the product in the bag or pouch.</p>

The coated iron is located in the middle layer of the band which is centered in the film and is approximately 4 inch wide. The net coated iron content in film can be approximated by multiplying the feed content by the ratio of the band width with respect to the full width of the film. The oxygen scavenging performance of the band film was tested by using a pouch test method. Sample films were heat laminated onto a high gas barrier clear PET substrate. The laminated film and the substrates were heat sealed to form a 7&#x2033;&#xd7;7&#x2033; pouch with the 4 inch band portion located in the middle of the pouch with approximately 1.5 inch clear window on each side of the band. The net coated iron content as determined by the ratio of the band width with respect to the pouch width was 6.86 and 10.29%. Ten grams of moisture regulator made of silica gel granules and water with a water activity of 0.85 was sealed in Tyvek bag and put in the pouch prior to the final seal of the pouch. The bag was injected with 300 cc of O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>mixture to achieve a starting oxygen level of approximately 4-4.5%. The oxygen absorption rate was measured using a MOCON PacCheck Model 450 Head Space Analyzer at various times at room temperature. The oxygen absorbed by the samples at these times is shown in Table-1. The data demonstrated that both the high and lower contents of the coated iron extruded in films in band form provide oxygen scavenging performance. The concentration of oxygen in the pouch decreased rapidly with time.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0067">This example demonstrated that the band film containing coated iron can be used to make printed food bags as a sealant film. An example can be that a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) printed polyethylene terephthalate barrier film multilayer substrate of 1.5 mil that is printed except that it contains a 4&#x2033;&#xd7;2&#x2033; not printed clear window is formed every 8 inches. The multilayer printed substrate has the structure: PET/print/adhesive/PET. The multilayer substrate is the laminated onto the oxygen scavenger containing film. Blanks for packaging each containing a window are cut from the laminated sheet and folded to make bags that have a clear window such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The bag is utilized for beef jerky packaging. After two weeks the bag is tested and found to have an oxygen level of less than 0.2% as compared to an initial oxygen level of 5% at the time of packaging.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">The bag of example 1 is compared with a conventional beef jerky package that has a label containing oxygen scavenger. The package material having the banded oxygen absorber in the continuous sheet was found to be as effective as the oxygen absorbing labels conventionally used on the inside of the package.</p>
