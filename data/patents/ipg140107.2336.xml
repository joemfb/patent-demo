<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to a portable synthetic grass turf assembly, and more particularly, to providing a modular synthetic grass turf assembly capable of being assembled, unassembled, transported, and stored.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A stadium is a desirable venue for multiple purposes such as football, baseball, soccer, as well as other social and civic events. The variety of activities presents a challenge to stadium personnel to convert the synthetic surface from among different configurations for a particular sport or event while providing the respective field quality expected. This is especially difficult when conversion of the sport field must be completed in a short period of time such as when the playing surface of a sporting event held during the day is to be converted to a different playing surface or social setting to be held later that evening.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Efforts well known in the industry have been made to develop a conversion system using natural grass trays. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of these trays may need to be utilized for a full field conversion between an artificial surface to a natural grass surface. These natural grass trays have proved to be very costly and difficult to use because they are especially made not only to hold the natural grass, but also to grow the grass thereon. Thus, the trays typically require appropriate drainage and moisture retention. Because the growing conditions of the natural turf are critical, the cost of maintaining the trays is high as they need to be tended to on a daily basis. Therefore, in winter, the trays usually are transported south to grow and be maintained, or are heated when used in northern climates.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known natural grass trays&#x2014;for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,595,021 and 5,187,894&#x2014;describe natural turf units for stadiums and other activity surfaces that are transportable between different locations, wherein a first location is for the performance of the desired activity, and the second location is for the storage, growth, and/or maintenance of the turf units.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Synthetic grass turf assemblies have also been used to provide sport surfaces and although their advantages are many, today's infilled synthetic grass turf assemblies are generally permanently installed in stadiums and are thus inflexible and/or incapable of accommodating a variety of playing surfaces or being readily transported or adapted for conversion&#x2014;either entirely or in part.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for a system and method of providing a playing surface including a convertible and transportable synthetic grass turf assembly having an infill layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed to a method and system for a synthetic turf assembly. In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a module unit for a portable synthetic grass turf assembly. The module unit includes a tile and a sheet backing positioned above the tile. A plurality of synthetic ribbons is attached to the sheet backing and extends upwardly there from. An infill layer of particulate material is disposed atop the sheet backing and among the synthetic ribbons to facilitate the substantially upward orientation of the synthetic ribbons. A barrier of synthetic ribbons is attached proximate the perimeter of the sheet backing, wherein the barrier assists in the retention of the particulate material on the module unit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of manufacturing a module unit for a modular synthetic grass turf assembly. The synthetic grass turf assembly is capable of being assembled, transported, unassembled, and stored. A tile/supporting structure is provided, wherein a sheet backing having a perimeter is positioned above the tile. A plurality of synthetic ribbons is attached to the sheet backing and extends upward there from. A barrier of synthetic ribbons is positioned proximate the perimeter and an infill layer of particular material is disposed atop the sheet backing and among the plurality of synthetic ribbons, wherein the barrier of synthetic ribbons facilitates retention of the particulate material on the module unit and enables positioning of adjacent tiles without it being readily recognizable where adjacent tiles are positioned after assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect of the present invention, the synthetic ribbons of the barrier include bristles/synthetic ribbons that are relatively stiffer than the plurality of synthetic ribbons used to emulate the natural grass and thus capable of standing substantially erect without reliance on the infill layer of particulate material. Such a stiffer configuration is preferably accomplished by using a plurality of synthetic ribbons bunched together in a row and held in position with the aid of a further stiffening member, such as stitching the synthetic ribbons together through any one of a desired stitching pattern. It is also contemplated that other means for maintaining the synthetic ribbons of the barrier together can be used, including, for example adhesive, heat fusion, melting, weaving, etc. Preferably, the barrier is bunched together close enough to form a hedge, fence, or curtain so that particulate material used as the infill, will not migrate through the barrier during use, or during removal and/or installation of the modular synthetic turf assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The base support surface on which the modular synthetic grass turf is to be installed may be prepared with a surface made of stabilized sand, crushed stone, asphalt, concrete, graded and compacted earth, other artificial surfaces, or any firm substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An advantage of a modular synthetic grass turf assembly of the present invention is the ease of converting surfaces to and from other applications, events, and/or sports and the convenience for field and roadside advertisements. The synthetic grass module units installed on the recycled plastic sheets or trays are easily handled by a forklift vehicle to which a metal plate has been mounted to its fork arms to actually lift the units.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is an object of the present invention to provide a modular synthetic grass turf assembly adapted for conversion of a sport surface to and/or from other applications, sports, or events.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is another object of the present invention to provide a modular synthetic grass turf assembly adapted to provide a transportable surface for temporary use in arenas, halls, gymnasiums, or other large areas that could be utilized for sports applications.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is another object of the present invention to provide a modular synthetic grass turf assembly adapted for use in permanent or temporary sites for roadside advertisements, logos, field lettering, field markings, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an easier and less costly method for converting a sports field for use with other applications or other sports.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">These and other aspects and attributes of the present invention will be discussed with reference to the following drawings and accompanying specification and claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail preferred embodiments of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to the embodiments illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to the drawings, and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a portion of a synthetic grass module unit <b>10</b> is illustrated. The module unit <b>10</b> includes a tile <b>12</b> preferably made from a continuous extruding process and cut into individual units. The tile <b>12</b> can be made of a rubberized laminated fabric or recycled plastic material that is strong enough to withstand the load expected during its intended use. Other types of materials for the tile <b>12</b> are likewise contemplated as would be readily understood to those having ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, although the term tile has been used herein, it will be recognized that such a term is intended to cover alternative structures for supporting a synthetic grass system <b>14</b>, while facilitating manipulation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The synthetic grass system <b>14</b> is placed above the tile <b>12</b> and includes a sheet backing <b>16</b> and a plurality of synthetic ribbons <b>18</b> extending upwardly from the sheet backing&#x2014;representing grass blades or fibers. The synthetic ribbons <b>18</b> are operatively attached to the sheet backing <b>16</b> using any mechanism know in the industry; namely, stitching, tufting, and gluing, to name but a few. An infill layer <b>20</b> of a particulate material, such as rubber granules, sand, and any combination thereof, is disbursed atop the sheet backing <b>16</b> and among the synthetic ribbons <b>18</b> to support the synthetic ribbons in a substantially upward orientation and to further improve the impact absorption capability of the module unit <b>10</b>. Such a similar synthetic turf system is utilized in known synthetic grass turf assemblies and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,527 for example&#x2014;which is incorporated herein by reference and is assigned to the Assignee of this application.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The sheet backing <b>16</b> of the synthetic grass system <b>14</b> can be permeable or impermeable to liquid and comprise a variety of configurations having, for example, one or more layers of material that include woven or non-woven material. If the module unit <b>10</b> is to be used outdoors, the tile <b>12</b> beneath the sheet backing <b>16</b> is preferably liquid permeable to allow for drainage. An example of such a tile <b>12</b> including a means for drainage is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> and includes a perimeter <b>22</b>, which may also include a border <b>24</b> that is capable of being operatively attached to&#x2014;or integral with, i.e., extending there from&#x2014;a main portion of the drainage tile.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, the drainage tiles <b>12</b> are generally square, but can be of various shapes and may include a bottom surface <b>30</b> and a plurality of legs <b>32</b> extending from the bottom surface. The legs <b>32</b> define channels <b>26</b> that provide for any necessary drainage away from the tile <b>12</b> in any direction&#x2014;the liquid generally flowing in a direction of least resistance away from the tile. Through-hole openings <b>28</b> vertically extend between the tile's <b>12</b> upper and lower surfaces and are provided to facilitate drainage perpendicular to the tile and the support base <b>46</b>&#x2014;which is generally substantially vertical&#x2014;and communicate with the substantially horizontal channels <b>26</b> to allow liquid to evacuate parallel to the support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If the tiles <b>12</b> include a means for drainage <b>28</b>, their placement above the support substrate <b>46</b> and preferably in direct contact with the sheet backing <b>16</b> of the synthetic grass system <b>14</b> enable water to pass through the sheet backing and the openings <b>28</b> to access the channels <b>26</b> underneath the tiles <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A means for securing <b>34</b>, e.g., stakes, can be used to anchor the tiles <b>12</b> to the supporting base substrate <b>46</b>; however the securing means is not necessarily required. The weight of the infill layer <b>20</b> of the synthetic grass system <b>14</b>&#x2014;and perhaps the weight of the tile <b>12</b> itself&#x2014;generally provides enough downwards force to maintain placement of the tiles <b>12</b>. Nonetheless, the securing means <b>34</b> can be used if it is necessary to further secure the tiles <b>12</b> in place on the supporting base substrate <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, means for connecting the adjacent tiles <b>12</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In particular, male <b>36</b> and female <b>38</b> connection members are disposed proximate the perimeter <b>24</b> of each tile for engagement with a mating connection member of an adjacent tile <b>12</b>. These connection members <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>&#x2014;preferably integrally formed and extending from the tile <b>12</b>&#x2014;permit the tiles to be easily interconnected by simply attaching opposing connection members of abutting tiles.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although the means for connecting can be disposed about the peripheral edges of the tile <b>12</b> of each module unit <b>10</b>, the units are preferably not connected to each other but are merely abutted together. Thus, much quicker removal of the abutted module units <b>10</b> is therefore possible because no interlocking connection members between adjacent tiles <b>12</b> need to be disengaged. This greatly simplifies the effort and time required to disassemble and remove the modular synthetic grass turf assembly, as may be required during conversion of a stadium field from one sporting surface to another. However, in certain applications for which interconnection between the modular units is required or preferred, the type of interconnection chosen is preferably easily disconnected, such that the removal of the modular units can nevertheless be simply and easily be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the module unit <b>10</b> includes a substantially upright gathering <b>40</b> of stiffer synthetic ribbons affixed about the edge of the sheet backing <b>16</b> and/or perimeter <b>22</b> of the tile <b>12</b>. The gathering <b>40</b>&#x2014;e.g., barrier, skirt, curtain&#x2014;of synthetic ribbons is preferably relatively much stiffer than the plurality of synthetic ribbons <b>18</b> utilized to emulate the natural grass playing surface. As such, each individual synthetic ribbon of the gathering <b>40</b> can be relatively stiffer&#x2014;e.g., a bristle&#x2014;than the synthetic ribbon <b>18</b> utilized to emulate the strands of natural grass; or, due to the barrier's <b>40</b> configuration of synthetic ribbons, the barrier itself functions as a whole as being cumulatively more stiffer. That is, in addition to the gathering <b>40</b> comprising closely spaced individually stiffer bristles to effectively prohibit passage of the infill particulate material <b>20</b> there between, alternative barrier embodiments may be configured by weaving synthetic ribbons together, bunching synthetic ribbons together, sewing or stitching synthetic ribbons together&#x2014;see FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>&#x2014;and/or adhering the synthetic ribbons together through an adhesive or thermal means&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Thus, the cumulative rigidity resulting from such configurations, e.g., weaving, stitching; may enable the barrier <b>40</b> to be configured of the same type of synthetic fibers used to emulate the strands of natural grass and simultaneously provide the bristle-like attributes desired.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The barrier <b>40</b> can extend from or be affixed to the sheet backing <b>16</b> about its edge; or alternatively, the barrier may be operatively attached to the tile <b>12</b> about its perimeter <b>22</b> and/or the border <b>24</b>&#x2014;which may or may not be removable. Barriers <b>40</b> of various heights can be attached to the associated border <b>24</b> and interchanged with the tiles <b>12</b> to provide adaptability to a variety of desired infill <b>20</b> depths associated with different field applications. In addition, the barrier <b>40</b> can have a varying height&#x2014;see FIG. <b>6</b>&#x2014;in which some portions of the barrier extend above the layer of infill material, and perhaps as high as the plurality of ribbons <b>18</b> used to emulate the strands of natural grass. Such a barrier <b>40</b> configuration can assist in concealing the interconnection of abutting modules <b>10</b>. In other embodiments of the barrier <b>40</b>, its height can have multiple peaks, e.g., saw-toothed, sinusoidal; having regular or varying inclining/declining slopes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferably, the depth of the infill material <b>20</b> of the synthetic turf assembly is less than or equal to the height(s) of the barrier <b>40</b>. Accordingly, when the module units <b>10</b> are disassembled and removed from the support base, most of the infill layer <b>20</b> remains held within the barrier <b>40</b> and atop the backing sheet <b>16</b>. The disassembled module units <b>10</b> can then be transported and/or stored as is, without having to completely remove all or any of the infill layer <b>20</b> of the synthetic grass system <b>14</b> before being relocated.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, a lip <b>42</b>&#x2014;preferably semi-rigid or flexible&#x2014;can extend from or be fastened proximate the perimeter <b>22</b> of the tile <b>12</b> or its border <b>24</b>. The lip <b>42</b> extends substantially upward to assist in maintaining the substantially upright orientation of the barrier <b>40</b>. Preferably, the height or length of the lip <b>42</b> is less than or equal to the height(s) of the barrier <b>40</b>. That is, the top of the lip <b>42</b> does not extend above the top of the barrier <b>40</b>. In one embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a means for attaching <b>48</b> the barrier <b>40</b> to the module unit <b>10</b> includes a lip <b>42</b> having a slot <b>44</b> wherein the barrier can be inserted therein. Insertion of the barrier <b>40</b> into the lip <b>42</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, steps <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>. The lip <b>42</b> cooperates with the barrier <b>40</b> to retain the infill <b>20</b> within the confines of the synthetic grass module unit <b>10</b>, such that the module unit can be displaced without first having to completely remove all of the infill there from.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The barrier <b>40</b> and lip <b>42</b> are preferably angled slightly outwardly from the tile <b>12</b> to which it is adhered, such that when the adjacent module units <b>10</b> abut, the barrier&#x2014;and/or lip&#x2014;will be slightly biased towards one another, and will thereby tend to remain in pressed engagement with each another. Such a barrier/lip configuration also enables multiple modules <b>10</b> to be stacked upon each other during storage as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Other means for attaching <b>48</b> the barrier <b>40</b> with the module unit <b>10</b> can also be used. Such means for attaching <b>48</b> include, and are not limited to: interference fit, friction fit, snap fit, hook and loop fabric; wherein protrusions, nodules, stitch-joints, or other geometries of the lip <b>42</b> and/or barrier <b>40</b> that cooperate to retain the barrier to the tile <b>12</b> or border <b>24</b>&#x2014;thus providing a releasable (if desired) attachment of the barrier with the lip, wherein barriers with different heights can be quickly and easily attached to the module unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref> depict another embodiment of the means for attaching <b>48</b> the barrier <b>40</b> with the module unit <b>10</b> wherein the lip <b>42</b> includes a protrusion <b>50</b>, preferably spear-shaped, extending from the lip and utilized to pierce the barrier and retain it to the lip. Preferably the spear-shaped protrusion <b>50</b> utilizes a barb to retain the barrier <b>40</b> once the spear-shaped protrusion has sufficiently penetrated the barrier. The lower edge of the barrier <b>40</b> can be placed within a subslot <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Another embodiment of the means for attaching <b>48</b> the barrier <b>40</b> to the module unit <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref>, wherein the lip <b>42</b> includes cooperating opposing walls <b>54</b> extending from the tile <b>12</b> or border <b>24</b>, one of which is hingedly connected to the tile or border. The lip <b>42</b> again may include a spear-shaped protrusion <b>50</b> extending from one of the opposing walls <b>54</b> that is utilized to pierce the barrier <b>40</b> upon closing of the lip and the coming together of the cooperating opposing walls. Once the barrier <b>40</b> is pierced, the spear-shaped protrusion <b>52</b> extends into a receiving slot <b>56</b> defined within the other of the opposing lip walls <b>54</b> and is retained thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The hingedly connected lip <b>42</b> can also include a cam-lock <b>58</b> preferably located proximate the hinge or pivot joint <b>60</b>. The cam-lock <b>58</b> includes a protrusion <b>62</b> that cooperates with the opposing lip wall <b>54</b> to pinch and retain the barrier <b>40</b> positioned there between upon closing of the hinged lip <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In yet another embodiment of the means for attaching the barrier <b>40</b> to the module unit <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the lip <b>42</b> and slot <b>44</b> include at least one protrusion <b>62</b>&#x2032; therein. Preferably, multiple protrusions <b>62</b>&#x2032; extend from the opposing side walls <b>54</b> within the slot <b>44</b> such that the barrier <b>40</b>&#x2014;once seated therein&#x2014;is operatively retained from removal. If desired, the barrier <b>40</b> can be removed from the lip <b>42</b> by overcoming the retention function of the protrusion(s) <b>62</b>&#x2032;, thus permitting another barrier <b>40</b>&#x2014;perhaps having a different height&#x2014;to be implemented and inserted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">During use, the module units <b>10</b> are preferably laid directly onto the base support surface substrate <b>46</b> of the stadium or facility to have the synthetic grass turf assembly thereon. If desired, through-hole openings <b>28</b> can be provided within the individual tiles <b>12</b> to permit drainage there through. The sheet backing <b>16</b> has the plurality of synthetic ribbons <b>18</b> extending upwardly there from and is laid atop the upper surface of each tile <b>12</b> and the infill layer <b>20</b> can then be dispersed among the synthetic ribbons <b>18</b> within the barrier <b>40</b>. Once the adjacent module units <b>10</b> are positioned in place on the base substrate <b>46</b>, a final layer of infill material is preferably added to cover over the areas of abutment between adjacent tiles <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is to be understood that although means for aligning the module units <b>10</b> are not necessarily needed with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, their use as known in the prior art is within the scope of the present invention. In addition, inasmuch as the use of the alignment structures is often limited to certain circumstances, such as outdoor stadiums; other circumstances exist&#x2014;such as halls and gymnasia having wood floors and other ground surfaces&#x2014;in which installation of the alignment tracks on the base substrate would damage the finish of base surface, e.g., wood or padded floors; and is therefore is not acceptable. As such, the use of alternative interlocking means without the need to mount tracks or other engagement members to the base substrate as known in the prior art is also envisioned to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additional embodiments of the present invention described herein may be contemplated by one of ordinary skill in the art and that the scope of the present invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed. While specific embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, numerous modifications come to mind without significantly departing from the spirit of the invention, and the scope of protection is only limited by the scope of the accompanying claims.</p>
