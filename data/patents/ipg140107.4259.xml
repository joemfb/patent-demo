<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-168809, filed Jul. 28, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor storage device capable of appropriate set and forming operations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, a resistance change memory device using variable resistive elements as storage elements has attracted attention as a possible successor to a flash memory. The resistance change memory device is, for example, a resistive RAM (ReRAM). The resistance change memory mentioned herein includes a resistance change memory in a narrow sense which is configured to store the resistance state of a recording layer made of a transition metal oxide in a non-volatile manner. For example, the resistance change memory includes a phase change RAM (PCRAM) memory or the like which includes a recording layer made of chalcogenide or the like and utilizes resistance information of the recording layer in a crystalline state (serving as a conductor) and a non-crystalline state (serving as an insulator).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The resistance change memory stores data therein by turning variable resistive elements into a low resistance state by a set operation and into a high resistance state by a reset operation. In a resistance change memory immediately after being manufactured, the variable resistive elements have very high resistance values, which are not easily changed. Hence, a forming operation is executed by applying a high voltage to the variable resistive elements. The forming operation can make the resistance values of the variable resistive elements changeable between the high resistance state and the low resistance state. As a result, the variable resistive elements become ready to operate as memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, resistance values of a conventional resistance change memory vary largely among multiple variable resistive elements after the set operation or the forming operation. Having a large variation, the variable resistive elements have difficulty in various subsequent operations (for example, see Japanese Patent Application Publication (Kokai) No. 2008-227267).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A semiconductor memory device according to an aspect includes: a memory cell array including a plurality of first lines, a plurality of second lines crossing the first lines, and memory cells arranged at intersections between the first lines and the second lines and each including a variable resistive element; and a control circuit which controls resistance values of the variable resistive elements in such a way that a cell voltage is applied to the memory cell arranged at an intersection between a selected one of the plurality of first lines and a selected one of the plurality of second lines by applying a first voltage to the selected first line and by applying a second voltage to the selected second line, wherein the control circuit applies a voltage gradually raised or lowered from a first initial voltage as the first voltage to the selected first line, and applies a pulsing voltage as the second voltage to the selected second line, and the second voltage includes a voltage pulse which is raised from a second initial voltage which the memory cell is a non-selected state to a raised voltage which the memory cell is a selected state, is kept at the raised voltage to thereby cause a cell current to flow into the memory cell, and is lowered to the second initial voltage when the cell current that increases while the voltage of the memory cell is rising with a change in the first voltage reaches a compliance current.</p>

The word lines WL and the bit lines BL are preferably made of a material which is heat resistant and has a low resistance value. For example, W, WSi, NiSi, CoSi or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each memory cell MC is formed of a serial circuit including a variable resistive element VR and a non-ohmic element NO.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The variable resistive element VR varies a resistance value through a current, heat, chemical energy or the like when a voltage is applied. The variable resistive element VR is located between electrodes EL<b>1</b> and EL<b>2</b> each serving as a barrier metal and bonding layer. The electrodes EL<b>1</b> and EL<b>2</b> are formed of Pt, Au, Ag, TiAlN, SrRuO, Ru, RuN, Ir, Co, Ti, TiN, TaN, LaNiO, Al, PtIrOx, PtRhOx, Rh/TaAlN or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The variable resistive element VR is formed by any one of a PCRAM, a CBRAM, and a ReRAM. The PCRAM, like chalcogenide or the like, varies the resistance value by phase transition between a crystalline state and a non-crystalline state. The CBRAM varies the resistance value by forming a conducting bridge between electrodes due to metal cation deposition, or by destroying the conducting bridge due to ionization of a deposited metal. The ReRAM varies the resistance value by applying a voltage or a current. In addition, the ReRAM is roughly categorized into two: one in which the resistance is changed depending on the presence of charges trapped by a charge trap existing in an interface of an electrode; and the other in which the resistance is changed depending on the presence of a conduction path caused by oxygen deficiency or the like.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Next, a description is given of set operations according to the first embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a word line WL<b>1</b> is selected, and the set operations are performed on memory cells MC(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and MC(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) which are commonly connected to the word line WL<b>1</b>. The voltage REG_VSSROW changing in a sloping manner in cycles is applied to the word line WL<b>1</b>. In contrast, voltages VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) which are independent from each other are applied to bit lines BL<b>1</b> and BL<b>2</b> in accordance with the characteristics of the memory cells MC(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and MC(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>), respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a current flowing from the bit line BL<b>1</b> to the word line WL<b>1</b> via the memory cell MC(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) is denoted by a current Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>), and a current flowing from the bit line BL<b>2</b> to the word line WL<b>1</b> via the memory cell MC(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) is denoted by a current Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>). In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, voltages applied to variable resistive elements VR(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and VR(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) of the memory cells MC(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and MC(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) are denoted by voltages Vset(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and Vset(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>), respectively. The voltage Vset(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) is equivalent to VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) &#x2212;REG_VSSROW&#x2212;Vf. Also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, concerning the rate at which a resistance value changes with an applied voltage, a rate in the memory cell MC(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) is higher than that in the memory cell MC(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>). Note that the set operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is executed by the memory cell array core portion (control circuit) <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the voltage REG_VSSROW of the word line WL<b>1</b> and the voltages VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) of the bit lines BL<b>1</b> and BL<b>2</b> are raised to their maximum values at a time t<b>11</b>. Subsequently, the voltage REG_VSSROW is lowered gradually in a sloping manner. In contrast, the voltages VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) of the bit lines BL<b>1</b> and BL<b>2</b> keep the voltages applied at the time of rising edge. Thus, the voltages VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) applied to the variable resistive elements VR(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and VR(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) are gradually raised, and the cell currents Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) applied to and flowing in the memory cells MC(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and MC(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) are also gradually raised.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">At a time t<b>12</b>, the cell current Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) flowing in the memory cell MC (<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) reaches the compliance current Icomp. Thus, the detector <b>185</b> detects reaching the compliance current Icomp, and the voltage of the bit line BL<b>1</b> is lowered to a Vss level. The lowering of the voltage of the bit line BL<b>1</b> to the Vss level once is intended to prevent a disturbance. Thereby, the voltage VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) applied to the variable resistive element VR(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) is set at 0 V. However, since the cell current Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) flowing in the memory cell MC(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) has not reached the compliance current Icomp, the voltage VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) is continued to be applied. Every time the cell current Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) reaches the compliance current Icomp, the compliance current Icomp is raised. The compliance current Icomp is raised by, for example, sequentially incrementing a compliance current initial value Icompini by a value &#x394;Icomp. Alternatively, the compliance current Icomp may be raised by multiplying the current value of the compliance current Icomp by a constant value.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition to a case (the time t<b>12</b>) where the detector <b>185</b> detects that the cell current Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) reaches the compliance current Icomp, in a case where (a time t<b>16</b>) the detector <b>185</b> detects that the voltage of the word line WL<b>1</b> is lowered to a lower limit value (voltage Vss), the voltage VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) of the bit line BL<b>1</b> is lowered to the voltage Vss. The voltage of the bit line BL<b>1</b> is lowered to the voltage Vss, and then is raised so as to be the voltage V&#x3b1; higher than the word line WL<b>1</b> (times t<b>13</b> and t<b>21</b>). Thereby, the voltage VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) is again raised gradually from zero. The reason why the voltage VSET(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) is again raised from zero is that when the current Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) exceeds the compliance current Icomp, a resistance value exceeding a resistance value for the compliance current Icomp is unknown. If the applied voltage is not changed to the original one and continued to be given pulses of the same voltage, a resistance value thereof is changed drastically. As a result, a write error occurs in the memory cell MC, and the characteristic of the memory cell MC is changed. Note that the voltage of the bit line BL<b>2</b> is independently controlled under the same condition as for the voltage of the bit line BL<b>1</b> at times t<b>11</b> to t<b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">When determined as being lowered to the voltage Vss (the time t<b>16</b>), the voltage of the word line WL<b>1</b> is again raised to the maximum value of the voltage REG_VSSROW at the time t<b>21</b>. Subsequently, the voltage is gradually lowered in the sloping manner until a time t<b>26</b>. Note that the voltages of the bit lines BL<b>1</b> and BL<b>2</b> are controlled in a period from the time t<b>21</b> to t<b>26</b> in the same manner as in a period from the time t<b>11</b> to t<b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">When both the compliance currents Icomp flowing in the bit lines BL<b>1</b> and BL<b>2</b> exceed an upper limit Icompmax (for example, Icompini+4&#xd7;&#x394;Icomp), a series of set operations as shown from t<b>11</b> to t<b>26</b> described above is terminated (a time t<b>31</b>). Then, a verification operation is executed. In the verification operation, a verification voltage Vvf is applied to the variable resistive elements VR of the memory cells MC(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and MC(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) and then the detector <b>185</b> detects whether or not the cell currents Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) and Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) flowing therein exceed a reference value.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">[Effects]</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A method in which a pulsing voltage applied to a bit line BL is raised every pulse application with a voltage VSSROW of a word line WL maintained constant does not guarantee that only one pulse causes a cell current Icell to reach a compliance current Icomp. In this respect, in the first embodiment, the voltage of the word line WL<b>1</b> is lowered in the sloping manner while the voltage of the bit line BL<b>1</b> is maintained constant, and thereby the set voltage Vset(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) is gradually raised until the cell current Icell(<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) reaches the compliance current Icomp from the initial value thereof. Thereby, in the first embodiment, the pulse VSET applied to the bit line BL one time causes the cell current to reach the compliance current Icomp without fail, and the set operation can be speeded up.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition, in the first embodiment, the pulses VSET to the multiple bit lines BL can be generated within a cycle in which the voltage of the word line WL<b>1</b> is lowered in the sloping manner, and thus speeding up due to this can be expected. Furthermore, the multiple memory cells MC connected to a single word line WL can be individually controlled, and thus the set or forming operation can be collectively performed on the multiple memory cells MC.</p>
