<p id="p-0003" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Belgian patent application No. 2008/0376, filed Jul. 7, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">With a machine for the vertical and/or horizontal cleaning of clinkers, cobblestones, natural stone, tiles, brick, external plaster, etc. inter alia, scrubbing, sweeping and/or polishing machines are meant. These can be driven by electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic or similar means.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Surfaces which are provided with grooves, joints, unevennesses and/or pores are, inter alia, clinkers, cobblestones, natural stone, tiles, brick, external plaster, road pavement (VPA=very porous asphalt and VPAC=very porous asphalt concrete), and/or metal and/or wood.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Concerning the cleaning of several surfaces which are separated by grooves, joints, unevennesses and/or pores, it is known to use high-pressure cleaning or cleaning with chemical products. Therewith, said surfaces are hosed down by means of a water jet, sandblast and/or water-sand jet under high pressure (from 120 bar). In the case of chemical cleaning, chemical products are applied to said surfaces. The chemical products act on the dirt which is present. After a soak-in period, any dirt which is present and the chemical products are sprayed away.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">However, there are several drawbacks associated with high-pressure and chemical cleaning, i.e.
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0006">the grooves, joints, unevennesses and/or pores between the surfaces are not deep-cleaned;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0007">the several surfaces which are separated from one another by means of grooves, joints, unevennesses and/or pores are often damaged by the high-pressure force of the water and/or the sand;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0008">large amounts of water are required;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0009">in some cases, a large amount of cleaning products have to be used;</li>

<p id="p-0008" num="0017">This problem has already been solved by BE 1 017 134, which discloses a brush for a scrubbing, sweeping and/or polishing machine for machine-cleaning of several surfaces which are separated from one another by means of grooves and/or joints, wherein this scrubbing, sweeping and polishing machine is provided with one or several brushes which comprise at least one set of polishing hairs for cleaning and/or polishing the surfaces, and at least one set of joint hairs for cleaning the grooves and/or the joints between the surfaces, wherein the polishing hairs have a length which is shorter than the length of the joint hairs, and which discloses a machine which is provided with one or several of such brushes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0018">A drawback of this brush is that the joint hairs wear and become as short as the polishing hairs of the brush, as a result of which it is no longer possible to clean grooves, joints, unevennesses and/or pores using this brush. A drawback of the wear of the joint hairs is the fact that the brush no longer moves in the vertical direction, as a result of which surfaces are cleaned less efficiently. A further drawback of such a brush is the fact that different brushes are required for different surfaces and/or different kinds of soiling in order to achieve efficient cleaning. For the efficient cleaning of cobblestones, for example, the brush needs to contain more steel hairs than are required for the efficient cleaning of natural stone. Thus, these two different surfaces require two different brushes.</p>

            <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0031">since it is possible to attach modular brush parts with one type of implanted second hairs on a base plate with implanted first hairs. The material of the implanted second hairs on the modular brush part can vary and for example consist of plastic or metal.

Furthermore, this modular brush (<b>10</b>) comprises one or several modular brush parts (<b>5</b>) (as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>) which are provided to be releasably attached to said base plate (<b>4</b>) by means of one or several bolt or screw connections, and which are provided with one or several sets of second hairs (<b>2</b>) which are implanted in a modular base (<b>7</b>), with these second hairs (<b>2</b>) being provided for cleaning the grooves, joints, unevennesses and/or pores between said surfaces which are separated from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0099">These sets of first and second hairs (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) therewith form a cleaning surface, with the second hairs (<b>2</b>) at this cleaning surface protruding with respect to the first hairs (<b>1</b>) in order thus to be able to clean grooves, joints, unevennesses and/or pores.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0100">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 14</figref>, said base plate (<b>4</b>) preferably comprises two or several sets of first hairs (<b>1</b>) which are implanted directly into the base plate (<b>4</b>), with a zone (<b>8</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>) being present between two sets of first hairs (<b>1</b>) which is free from said first hairs (<b>1</b>) and which is intended for the attachment of said brush parts (<b>5</b>) into which said second hairs (<b>2</b>) are implanted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0101">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 14</figref>, the zones with first hairs (<b>1</b>) preferably have a shape which is complementary to the shape of the zones with second hairs (<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0102">In the preferred embodiments of a modular brush (<b>10</b>) according to the invention as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref> and <b>9</b> to <b>12</b>, in the assembled state of the brush (<b>10</b>) 4 modular brush parts (<b>5</b>) are provided which are arranged in pairs in a line (fictitious lines A and B). In the preferred embodiments of a modular brush (<b>10</b>) according to the invention as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>, these two lines (A, B) are at a right angle to one another [in other words, these two lines (A, B) are at an angle of approximately 90&#xb0; or these two lines (A, B) are perpendicular to one another], while with the preferred embodiments as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 12</figref>, these two lines (A, B) are at a different angle to one another than a right angle or a zero angle.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0103">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, the modular brush parts (<b>5</b>) may be L-shaped, or in other words these may have an end with a brush part which is at right angles to the remainder of the modular brush part (<b>5</b>). The zones with first hairs (<b>1</b>) which are implanted directly into the base plate (<b>4</b>) preferably have a shape which is complementary to this L shape. However, the modular brush parts (<b>5</b>) can also have an elongate shape, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0104">With regard to the abovementioned, it should be noted that it is also possible to provide more or fewer modular brush parts (<b>5</b>), that the modular brush parts (<b>5</b>) and/or the zones with first hairs (<b>1</b>) may have a different shape and that the first and second hairs (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) may also be arranged in a different suitable configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0105">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 5A</figref>, intermediate pieces (<b>6</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref>, <b>19</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>) may be mounted between the base plate (<b>4</b>) and said modular base (<b>7</b>) of a brush part (<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0106">These intermediate pieces (<b>6</b>) are particularly advantageous when the second hairs (<b>2</b>) of one or several brush parts are worn to such a degree that they no longer protrude with respect to the cleaning surface. In this way, it is not necessary to replace the entire brush part, but by inserting such an intermediate piece (<b>6</b>) between the modular base (<b>7</b>) and the base plate (<b>4</b>), these second hairs (<b>2</b>) can again protrude sufficiently with respect to the cleaning surface.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0107">In addition, these intermediate pieces (<b>6</b>) are also particularly advantageous when the length by which the second hairs (<b>2</b>) at the cleaning surface protrude with respect to the first hairs (<b>1</b>) has to be different in the case of two or several of the brush parts (<b>5</b>) (as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>), in order to be able to clean certain types of surface more effectively. Thus, such a configuration is for example very advantageous in order to efficiently remove rubber from a surface to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0108">These intermediate pieces (<b>6</b>) therewith have the same shape as the modular brush parts (<b>5</b>).</p>
