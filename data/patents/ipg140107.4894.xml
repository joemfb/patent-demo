<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An optical line terminal (OLT), a remote node (RN) unit, and an optical transmission method and a system thereof are provided. The method includes following steps. Power splitting is performed respectively on a part or all of M optical signals which have different wavelengths and are generated by M light sources, thus forming a first group of optical signals including first split optical signals and a second group of optical signals including second split optical signals. Both the first group of optical signals and the second group of optical signals have N different wavelengths. Cross routing is performed on the first group of optical signals and the second group of optical signals to form N carrier groups of signals that need to be provided to N optical network units (ONUs). Therefore, problems in the prior art such as a great number of light sources, high costs, and low reception quality, low power efficiency or high costs of the light sources are solved, so that the number of light sources in the network is reduced, transmission quality of signals is improved, and system costs are reduced.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of network communications technology, particularly to an optical line terminal (OLT), a remote node (RN) unit, and an optical transmission method and a system thereof, and more particularly to an OLT, an RN unit, and an optical transmission method and a system thereof capable of reducing the number of light sources in an optical network in a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, a common feature of optical access technologies is that optical signals between an optical line terminal (OLT) and an optical network unit (ONU) are distributed through an optical splitter, and upstream and downstream carriers separately adopting different wavelengths are transmitted for data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An optical network system in the prior art has large optical attenuation, and a conventional passive optical network (PON) technology is limited on aspects such as the transmission distance and the split ratio. Each ONU obtain a limited upstream bandwidth, so that the demand for high-bandwidth services such as high resolution digital service is hard to be satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the situation of the optical network system in the prior art, problems of the PON technology can be solved by introducing a wavelength division multiplex (WDM) technology in the access network. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each ONU is assigned with two different wavelengths for transmitting upstream and downstream carriers each. An OLT is placed in a central office (CO) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The OLT employs a multi-wavelength light source. The data transmitted to an ONU<b>1</b>, an ONU<b>2</b>, . . . , and an ONUn in a downstream direction is sent after being modulated on optical carriers having wavelengths &#x3bb;<b>1</b>, &#x3bb;<b>2</b>, . . . , &#x3bb;n respectively. Signals are distributed through a passive remote node (RN) to destination ONUs so as to implement the downstream transmission. During the upstream transmission, a channel competition problem among the ONUs is solved by means of wavelength-division multiplexing access (WDMA). Each ONU uses a specific wavelength to carry upstream data. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, n ONUs carry upstream data on optical carriers having wavelengths &#x3bb;<b>1</b>*, &#x3bb;<b>2</b>*, . . . , and &#x3bb;n* respectively, and timing and network synchronization are unnecessary. The upstream signals are uploaded through a wavelength grating router (WGR) to a receiving end of the OLT, for example, uploaded to the receiving end of the OLT through an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. But, compared with other broadband access modes, the WDM-PON in the prior art has a very high initial investment and high costs because a lot of light sources need to be used in the system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for a system having N ONUs, and each ONU uses upstream and downstream carrier signals having different wavelengths, the WDM-PON system 2N light sources. For some WDM systems, each ONU needs two upstream carriers to obtain high upstream modulation signal power. For a system having N ONUs, each ONU occupies three optical carriers, that is, one downstream carrier signal having a wavelength and two upstream carrier signals having different wavelengths are used, so the system uses 3N light sources. To reduce the number of light sources in the PON system, the following two modes are mainly used in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Mode 1: Re-modulation is used at the ONU.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For a system having N ONUs, each ONU uses the same wavelength for transmitting upstream and downstream signals, and N light sources are used in the system, so that the total number of light sources can be reduced to half of the number in the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Specifically, the ONU divides downstream optical signals carrying downstream data from the OLT into two parts. One part of the downstream optical signals is used for detecting and recovering downstream data. The other part downstream optical signals is used for sending the upstream data, and the upstream data is re-modulated into this part of downstream light and then sent back to the OLT. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the upstream and downstream data of each ONU are carried at the same wavelength. No light source is disposed at the ONU and the light sources are only disposed at the OLT.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although the number of light sources can be reduced in mode 1, for the re-modulation mode at the ONU, the downstream data carried at downstream light influences modulation of upstream data, thus influencing reception quality of upstream data at the OLT in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Mode 2: The mode is based on broadband light source (BLS) spectrum splitting.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Two high power BLSs are configured at the OLT. The BLS spectrum splitting method is used to provide downstream optical carriers and upstream optical carriers for the OLT and the ONUs respectively. For the BLSs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a second BLS is configured to provide wavelength-locked light sources for the OLT, and a first BLS is configured to provide wavelength-locked light sources for the ONUs. After performing spectrum splitting by the demultiplexer (DEMUX) on broad spectrum light beam emitted by the BLSs, a series of narrow spectrum light beams are obtained. The narrow spectrum light beams are injected in a series of receiving/sending portions of the OLTs or ONUs placed inside the CO to generate injection locked light sources, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the spectrum splitting mode, a broad spectrum light beam is split into a plurality of narrow spectrum light beams. Because spectrum gaps exist between the narrow spectrum light beams, power efficiency of the light source is low. In addition, the high power BLS devices are still immature with high costs.</p>

In each technical solution, the generated light sources are used to split optical signals generated by one or a group of light sources into two same paths of optical signals or two groups of optical signals having overlapping wavelengths. Power splitting is performed on one path of mixed optical signals to form two same paths of optical signals. The two paths or two groups of optical signals are used as carriers for different ONUs. Through subsequent cross routing performed on the mixed optical signals formed by two groups of optical signals, the light having the same wavelength and generated by the same light source is used as carriers for different ONUs. In the prior art, a system with N ONUs needs 2N or 3N light sources. Through verification, in each embodiment of the present invention, only about N light sources need to be configured. Therefore, the number of light sources used on the network can be reduced effectively to reduce system costs. Also, the present invention can be implemented with mature and simple devices. The wavelength division multiplexing can be implemented with an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) in the prior art. The modulation can be implemented with a mature Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) or an electro-absorption modulator (EAM). Compared with the second technical solution in the prior art, the present invention can reduce the number of light sources with lower costs. Also, because the upstream and downstream carriers have different wavelengths, transmission quality of signals is greatly improved compared with the first technical solution in the prior art.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart of a first embodiment of an optical transmission method capable of reducing the number of light sources according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the optical transmission method according to this embodiment includes the following steps.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In step <b>10</b>, power splitting is performed on optical signals generated by a light source to form two paths of optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>20</b>, the two paths of optical signals having the same wavelength are used as carriers for different optical network units (ONUs).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Specifically, power splitting is performed on optical signals emitted by the same light source to form two paths of optical signals having the same wavelength, which are used as upstream carriers and downstream carriers for the different ONUs. For example, the power splitting is performed on a light having a wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, which is generated by a light source, to generate two paths of optical signals each having the wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>. One path of optical signals having the wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>1 </sub>is used as upstream carriers for a certain ONU. The other path of optical signals having the wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>1 </sub>is used as downstream carriers for another different ONU. It is different in the prior art that optical signals having a wavelength generated by one light source can only be used once as downstream carriers or upstream carriers for an ONU. In this embodiment, optical signals having a wavelength generated by the same light source are used repetitively, and the light emitted by the same light source is divided into two parts, which are used as carriers for two different ONUs. Therefore, for the two different ONUS, only one light source is used to generate two optical carrier signals, thus reducing the number of light sources effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart of a second embodiment of an optical transmission method capable of reducing the number of light sources according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the optical transmission method according to this embodiment includes the following steps.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In step <b>100</b>, a group of optical signals having different wavelengths are generated by light sources. A part or all of the generated group of optical signals are separately performed power splitting, to generate two groups of optical signals having one or more same wavelengths therebetween. The generated two groups of optical signals include a first group of optical signals including first split optical signals and a second group of optical signals including second split optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In step <b>200</b>, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is performed on each of the two groups of optical signals to form two paths of mixed optical signals including the two groups of optical signals, i.e. the first group of optical signals and the second group of optical signals, and the two paths of mixed optical signals are transmitted separately through independent optical media.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In step <b>300</b>, cross routing is performed on the two paths of mixed optical signals to construct carrier groups of signals having different wavelengths. The carrier groups of signals having different wavelengths are used as carriers for different ONUs.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this embodiment and the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the light generated by light sources is used repetitively. But, in this embodiment, the group of light sources has different wavelengths, and the method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is performed on one or more light sources in the group of light sources, that is, signals generated by the same light source are performed power splitting to form two paths having the same wavelength therebetween. Thus, one group of optical signals can be separated into two groups of optical signals. In the two groups of optical signals, one or more optical signals have the same wavelength. After the separation into two groups of optical signals, wavelength division multiplexing is separately performed on the two groups of optical signals, so as to form two paths of mixed optical signals. Subsequently, cross routing is performed on the two paths of mixed optical signals. Therefore, two paths of optical signals having the same wavelength generated by one or more light sources in the group of light sources are used as carriers for different ONUs. For ease of understanding of this embodiment, the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> or <b>13</b> can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">This embodiment is still based on a mode of using wavelengths repetitively. Through the method in this embodiment, for a WDM system with N ONUs, at least only N light sources need to be configured. For example, N light sources are configured and emit consecutive light having wavelengths being &#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3bb;<sub>2</sub>, . . . , and &#x3bb;<sub>N</sub>. The light having N wavelengths is used repetitively. The light having N wavelengths is divided into two groups each having N different wavelengths. The first group of optical signals &#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3bb;<sub>2</sub>, . . . , and &#x3bb;<sub>N </sub>is used as downstream carriers for carrying downstream data, and each downstream carrier corresponds to one ONU. The second group of optical signals &#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3bb;<sub>2</sub>, . . . , and &#x3bb;<sub>N </sub>is used as upstream carriers for carrying upstream data, and each upstream carrier corresponds to one ONU. Subsequently, cross routing is performed on two groups of optical signals after wavelength division multiplexing, so that the upstream carriers and downstream carriers output to each ONU are different. For example, the &#x3bb;<sub>1 </sub>of the first group of optical signals and the &#x3bb;<sub>2 </sub>of the second group of optical signals are used as downstream and upstream carriers for an ONU<b>1</b> respectively. The &#x3bb;<sub>2 </sub>of the first group of optical signals and the &#x3bb;<sub>3 </sub>of the second group of optical signals are used as downstream and upstream carriers for an ONU<b>2</b> respectively. In this manner, the &#x3bb;<sub>N </sub>of the first group of optical signals and the &#x3bb;<sub>1 </sub>of the second group of optical signals are used as downstream and upstream carriers for an ONUN respectively. Therefore, light having the same wavelength generated by the same light source is used as upstream and downstream data carriers for different ONUs. The group of N light sources are used to generate carriers of upstream and downstream data for N different ONUs. As shown in the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the generated two groups of optical signals are totally the same and N light sources are required in total. In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the two groups of optical signals are not completely the same. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, N+1 light sources need to be used to generate two groups of optical signals each having N wavelengths. The optical signals that have different wavelengths and are generated by the front N light sources are taken as a front group. The optical signals that have different wavelengths and are generated by the tail N light sources are taken as a second group.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As can be seen from the examples, in a WDM system with N ONUs, by adopting this embodiment, when the number of the ONUs is large, that is, the N has a large value, only about N light sources are used. Compared with a conventional WDM passive optical network (PON) system, the number of the light sources is reduced to about half. The number of light sources used in the network can be decreased, so as to reduce costs effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The present invention can be implemented with a mature and simple device. Compared with the second technical solution in the prior art, the present invention can reduce the number of light sources at low costs. Also, as the wavelengths of the upstream and downstream carriers are different, transmission quality of signals is greatly increased compared with the first technical solution in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart of a third embodiment of an optical transmission method capable of reducing the number of light sources according to the present invention. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> has the same functions as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, the process of the wavelength division multiplexing is further specified. The two groups of optical signals are used as upstream carriers and downstream carriers respectively and the downstream data is modulated to the downstream carriers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, this embodiment includes the following steps.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In step <b>100</b>, a light source is used to generate a group of optical signals having different wavelengths. A part or all of the generated group of optical signals each are performed power splitting, such that two groups of optical signals having one or more same wavelengths therebetween are generated. The generated two groups of optical signals are a first group of optical signals including first split optical signals and a second group of optical signals including second split optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In step <b>110</b>, the first group of optical signals in the two groups of optical signals is used as downstream carriers. The downstream data is modulated to the first group of optical signals. The second group of optical signals in the two groups of optical signals is used as upstream carriers for carrying the upstream data.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step <b>200</b>, wavelength division multiplexing is performed on each of the two groups of optical signals, so as to form two paths of mixed optical signals including the first group of optical signals and the second group of optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In step <b>310</b>, cross routing is performed on the two paths of mixed optical signals, so as to form a plurality of carrier groups of signals. Each carrier group of signals include two optical signals having different wavelengths. The two optical signals having different wavelengths of each carrier group of signals belong to the two paths of mixed optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step <b>320</b>, the two optical signals having different wavelengths in each carrier group of signals are separately used as an upstream carrier and a downstream carrier for the same ONU.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this embodiment, the two groups of optical signals are separately used as upstream carriers and downstream carriers and the downstream data is modulated in one group of optical signals. The different ONUs receive their different carrier groups of signals. Each ONU modulates the upstream data on the upstream carrier in its carrier group of signals and sends upstream the upstream data through a reversible path of reception. The process of performing wavelength division multiplexing on the two groups of optical signals can be obtained with reference to embodiments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In this embodiment, cross routing is performed on the two groups of optical signals. As illustrated in the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the &#x3bb;<sub>1 </sub>of the first group of optical signals and the &#x3bb;<sub>2 </sub>of the second group of optical signals in the two groups of optical signals are used as downstream and upstream carriers for an ONU<b>1</b> respectively. The &#x3bb;<sub>2 </sub>of the first group of optical signals and the &#x3bb;<sub>3 </sub>of the second group of optical signals are used as downstream and upstream carriers for an ONU<b>2</b> respectively. In this manner, the &#x3bb;<sub>N </sub>of the first group of optical signals and the &#x3bb;<sub>1 </sub>of the second group of optical signals are used as downstream and upstream carriers for an ONUN respectively. At this time, each carrier group of signals may consist of two optical wave signals having their two wavelengths adjacent. Of course, other modes such as cross routing or crossing combination can also be used. For example, the &#x3bb;<sub>1 </sub>of the first group of optical signals and the &#x3bb;<sub>3 </sub>of the second group of optical signals are used as the downstream and upstream carriers for the ONU<b>1</b> respectively. The &#x3bb;<sub>2 </sub>of the first group of optical signals and the &#x3bb;<sub>4 </sub>of the second group of optical signals are used as the downstream and upstream carriers for the ONU<b>2</b> respectively. In this manner, the &#x3bb;<sub>N </sub>of the first group of optical signals and the &#x3bb;<sub>2 </sub>of the second group of optical signals are used as the downstream and upstream carriers for the ONUN respectively. At this time, each carrier group of signals consists of two optical wave signals having their two wavelengths separated by one wavelength therebetween. Persons of ordinary skill in the art should understand that multiple ways can be employed to implement the cross routing, as long as the two optical wave signals forming a group belong to two separate groups of optical signals and have different wavelengths, so as to satisfy the demand for different wavelengths when each crossing combination signal is used as upstream and downstream carriers for the same ONU.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the embodiments, two groups of optical signals having one or more same wavelengths are generated by using a group of optical signals having different wavelengths, which are generated by a plurality of light sources. The detailed process can be as follows. N light sources are provided for generating optical signals having different wavelengths.

One path of split optical signal is used as a downstream carrier for carrying downstream data. The other path of split optical signal is used as an upstream carrier for carrying upstream data. N optical signals as downstream carriers, which are obtained by performing power splitting on the optical signals generated by the N light sources, are grouped into a first group of optical signals.
