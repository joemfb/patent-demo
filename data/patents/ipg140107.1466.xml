<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to the field of limestone and/or sand leveling equipment, more specifically, a leveling and smoothing tool for use with screen limestone or sand.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Spreading out sand or crushed limestone is a common task performed prior to laying brick pavers or like building materials when constructing a walkway, a garage driveway, or other surface. Building a brick paver surface requires some effort in laying the proper sub-surfaces in order to support the brick pavers thereon. Commonly, a compacted sub surface is formed in order to support the weight of the brick pavers. Usually a layer of crushed limestone is placed down and compacted before laying a thin layer of sand thereon. The crushed limestone and sand layers usually are sandwiched between the compacted sub surface and the brick pavers in order to even a layer of sand or crushed limestone it is desirable to ensure that the entire layer is smooth and even, which can be tricky. This is especially tricky when the crushed limestone is going to be subsequently compacted down via a tamper or mechanical compactor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed is a tool and method of use that ensures that the layer of sand or limestone being placed is both smooth and even. The device of the present application seeks to address this need by providing a telescoping tool that can be adapted for use and rolled across two generally parallel pieces of timber, and whereby the rolling of said tool shall generate a smooth and even surface of sand or crushed limestone.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">B. Discussion of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As will be discussed immediately below, no prior art discloses a leveling and smoothing tool for use with sand or crushed limestone that includes a first and second telescoping members that each include rollers at distal ends for use in rolling the tool across pieces of timber; wherein the first and second telescoping members each include a blade member there under, which engages across a top surface of the material being smoothed and evened via the tool; wherein the first and second telescoping members extend and retract with respect to one another in order to adjust an overall length formed between distal ends whereby the rollers roll across the pieces of timber.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The Lindley Patent (U.S. Patent No. 2009/0226257) discloses a screed rail system for placing uncured concrete that includes a pair of rails positioned to lie spaced-apart and parallel to one another and a screed plate supported between the rails to move along the rails to form a final grade level of uncured concrete in a work area. However, the screed system is for use in placing uncured concrete, and is not a telescoping tool that rolls along generally parallel pieces of timber in order to smooth and even crushed limestone or sand for use with laying brick pavers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The Burton et al. Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 6,053,659) discloses an inlaid brick walkway leveler consisting of a handle affixed to a rakehead with the handle being supported by a pair of equivalent mediolateral struts. However, the leveler is articulated via an attached handle, and is not a tool that rolls atop of generally parallel pieces of timber.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The Mills et al. Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 6,412,185) discloses a tile laying gauge and leveling assembly for preparing a recipient surface for the laying of tiles and for properly positioning the tiles on the recipient surface that includes a plurality of elongated side members and a leveling assembly. However, the leveling assembly is not a telescoping tool that rolls atop of two parallel pieces of wood in order to level and smooth out crushed limestone or sand prior to placement of brick pavers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The Asplin Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 5,979,879) discloses a method of repairing sidewalks that are damaged due to settling or changes in the elevation of the earth upon which they are built. Again, the method does not involve the use of a telescoping tool that rolls atop of parallel pieces of timber, and that smooths and evens out sand or crushed limestone.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The Steele Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 7,254,920) discloses a device for setting and leveling tile. However, the device is used to ensure a level placement of a ceramic tile, and not for smoothing and leveling a subsurface for placement of brick pavers.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The Santiago Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 5,249,365) discloses a telescoping level apparatus. Again, the apparatus does not roll atop of two generally parallel pieces of timber in order to smooth and level a layer of sand or crushed limestone prior to installation of brick pavers.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">While the above-described devices fulfill their respective and particular objects and requirements, they do not describe a leveling and smoothing tool for use with sand or crushed limestone that includes a first and second telescoping members that each include rollers at distal ends for use in rolling the tool across pieces of timber; wherein the first and second telescoping members each include a blade member there under, which engages across a top surface of the material being smoothed and evened via the tool; wherein the first and second telescoping members extend and retract with respect to one another in order to adjust an overall length formed between distal ends whereby the rollers roll across the pieces of timber. In this regard, the screen limestone leveling and smoothing tool departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The screen limestone leveling and smoothing tool includes a first and second telescoping members that each include rollers at distal ends for use in rolling the tool across pieces of generally parallel timber in order to even and smooth out a layer of crushed limestone or sand. The screen limestone leveling and smoothing tool includes blade members under each of the first and second telescoping members, which engages across a top surface of the crushed limestone or sand, and which are offset from one another in order to enable the telescoping members to adjust an overall length formed thereon. The blade members are pushed across the top surface of the crushed limestone or sand, and smooth and even the top surface.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An object of the invention is to provide a tool that is used to smooth out and level a layer of sand or crushed limestone with constructing a brick paver surface.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another object of the invention is to provide a tool that includes rollers at distal ends, which roll atop of two generally parallel pieces of timber in order to smooth and level a section of said or crushed limestone.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another object of the invention is to include a tool that is made of telescoping members, which telescope with respect to one another in order to adjust an overall length thereby increasing the flexibility of use of the tool with respective shape and size of the layer to be smoothed and evened.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another object of the invention is to provide a blade member that descends from underneath each of the telescoping members, and which engages the top surface of the material being smoothed and evened upon rolling the tool across the pieces of timber.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another object of the invention is to provide rollers mounted to distal members that are each rigidly affixed to a respective telescoping member whereby the blade member is at a lowered elevation with respect to the rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An even further object of the invention is to offset the blade members with one another thereby enabling the telescoping members to telescope with respect to one another without interference of the blade members engaging one another.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">These together with additional objects, features and advantages of the screen limestone leveling and smoothing tool will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of presently preferred, but nonetheless illustrative, embodiments of the screen limestone leveling and smoothing tool when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this respect, before explaining the current embodiments of the screen limestone leveling and smoothing tool in detail, it is to be understood that the screen limestone leveling and smoothing tool is not limited in its applications to the details of construction and arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the concept of this disclosure may be readily utilized as a basis for the design of other structures, methods, and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the screen limestone leveling and smoothing tool.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is therefore important that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent construction insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the screen limestone leveling and smoothing tool. It is also to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for purposes of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>

The first telescoping member <b>101</b> and the second telescoping member <b>102</b> each have a rectangularly-shaped cross section (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and the first telescoping member <b>101</b> has a larger cross-sectional shape when compared to the second telescoping member <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first telescoping member <b>101</b> and the second telescoping member <b>102</b> each have a telescoping length <b>103</b> such that both the first telescoping member <b>101</b> and the second telescoping member <b>102</b> may be equal in length with respect to one another. The invention <b>100</b> forms an overall tool length <b>104</b> that is comprised of the length formed of the first telescoping member <b>101</b> and an exposed portion of the second telescoping member <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first telescoping member <b>101</b> is further defined with a top surface <b>105</b> that includes a plurality of equally spaced holes <b>106</b> there across. The second telescoping member <b>102</b> includes a spring-loaded button <b>107</b> that is biased upwardly through a second top surface <b>108</b>, and which aligns with one of the holes <b>106</b> in order to lock the invention <b>100</b> at varying overall tool lengths <b>104</b>. The use of spring-loaded buttons <b>107</b> and holes <b>106</b> are well known in the art, and provide a simple means of adjusting a length formed between two components that may be telescopically engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first telescoping member <b>101</b> is further defined with a first bottom surface <b>109</b> whereby the second telescoping member <b>102</b> has a second bottom surface <b>110</b>. Both the first telescoping member <b>101</b> and the second telescoping member <b>102</b> include a blade member defined as a first blade member <b>111</b> and second blade member <b>112</b>, respectively. The blade members <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are made of a thin piece of flexible material (rubber), and are used to smooth out and even a top surface <b>130</b> of material. Moreover, the blade members <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> may be made of the same material as the first and second telescoping members <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, respectively. It shall be noted that the term material is being loosely defined as any subsurface material that needs to be flattened, and may be crushed limestone or sand. The sand and crushed limestone are commonly used materials when forming a subsurface that is compacted and even prior to laying brick pavers in forming a paver surface.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The blade members <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are offset with respect to one another in order to enable the second telescoping member <b>102</b> to extend and retract with respect to the first telescoping member <b>101</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). The blade members <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> descend downwardly from the first bottom surface <b>109</b> and second bottom surface <b>110</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first telescoping member <b>101</b> and the second telescoping member <b>102</b> each include a distal member <b>113</b> that include rollers <b>114</b> thereon. Moreover, the distal members <b>113</b> are each further defined with an inner side surface <b>115</b> and an outer side surface <b>116</b>. The inner side surface <b>115</b> of the distal member <b>113</b> engages in rigid affixture to the respective first or second telescoping member <b>101</b>/<b>102</b>. That being said, the outer side surface <b>116</b> of the distal member <b>113</b> is from which the rollers <b>114</b> extend. The rollers <b>114</b> are used to engage and roll along a top surface <b>143</b> of pieces of timber <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As previously mentioned, the timber <b>140</b> involves two generally parallel pieces of timber <b>140</b>, and may be in the form of a 2 by 4 or other common size piece of lumber. The timber <b>140</b> is placed atop of the top surface <b>130</b> prior to use with the invention <b>100</b>. The pieces of timber <b>140</b> shall be separated at a timber distance <b>141</b>, which is equal to or larger than the overall tool length <b>104</b>. The rollers <b>114</b> essentially rotate about themselves on the outer side surface <b>116</b> of the distal member <b>113</b>, and when placed onto the pieces of timber <b>140</b> enable the invention <b>100</b> to be rolled along a timber length <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With respect to the above description, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationship for the various components of the invention <b>100</b>, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function, and the manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It shall be noted that those skilled in the art will readily recognize numerous adaptations and modifications which can be made to the various embodiments of the present invention which will result in an improved invention, yet all of which will fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the following claims. Accordingly, the invention is to be limited only by the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
