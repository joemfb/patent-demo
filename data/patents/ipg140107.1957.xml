<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to semiconductors, and more particularly to piping systems associated with wafer processing machines or tools.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modern semiconductor electronic device packages such as integrated circuit (IC) chips are typically formed by building multiple layers of materials and components on a semiconductor substrate. A single wafer will contain a plurality of individual ICs or dies, which are later separated following fabrication by a cutting process referred to in the art as singulation or dicing. The semiconductor devices incorporate numerous electrically active components which are formed in multiple layers of an electrically insulating or dielectric material. Metal conductors or interconnects are formed in the dielectric material by various additive patterning and deposition processes (e.g. damascene and dual damascene) to electrically couple active components together in the different layers and/or within a single layer. Modern semiconductor fabrication, accordingly, entails a repetitive sequence of numerous process steps including material deposition (conductive metals and non-conductive materials), photolithographic patterning of circuits in the deposited material, and selective material removal such as etching and ashing to gradually build the semiconductor device structures.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some of the foregoing semiconductor fabrication processes are performed in commercially-available vacuum processing tools or machines. These semiconductor processing machines include a heated vacuum process chamber that holds one or more wafers and a vacuum source fluidly connected to chamber. These semiconductor fabrication tools generally further include a gas supply system for introducing reactant process gases to the chamber that may be used for conventional etching/ashing processes which remove semiconductor materials from the wafer or vapor deposition processes (e.g. CVD, PVD, etc.) which add layers of thin films or materials to the wafer. The vacuum source reduces the pressure in the process chamber and exhausts or draws gases from the chamber to establish flow from the chamber to the vacuum sources. The vacuum source for the process chamber is typically provided by a vacuum pump that is fluidly connected to the process chamber via vacuum exhaust piping and valving.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of one known conventional vacuum processing machine or system <b>10</b> and vacuum piping arrangement. Processing system <b>10</b> includes a vacuum process chamber <b>11</b>, gas supply system <b>13</b>, vacuum pump <b>14</b>, vacuum pumping piping <b>15</b> from process chamber <b>11</b> to vacuum pump <b>14</b>, and single combination pressure control and isolation valve <b>14</b>. Process chamber <b>11</b> holds one or more wafers W supported by base <b>12</b>. The vacuum pumping piping <b>15</b> shown has four inlets <b>19</b> which are coupled to pumping ports in vacuum process chamber <b>11</b> located proximate to each wafer W. The desired vacuum pressure in process chamber <b>11</b> is maintained by measuring the actual chamber pressure P via a pressure gauge or sensor <b>17</b> and sending a corresponding digital or analog pressure signal to a pressure controller <b>18</b>. The pressure controller <b>18</b> compares the actual chamber pressure P to a predetermined desired chamber setpoint pressure Ps. If the variance between actual and setpoint pressures exceed a predetermined threshold limit, the controller <b>18</b> sends a signal to throttle the pressure control-isolation valve <b>14</b> until the actual chamber pressure P is brought back into the desired pressure range.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The foregoing conventional vacuum processing systems, however, are prone to a number of problems. The asymmetric vacuum pumping piping <b>15</b> arrangement and multiple piping branches may result in unbalanced vacuum pressures in each branch and/or piping inlets <b>19</b> and corresponding portions of the process chamber <b>11</b>. This in turn may lead to an uneven gas flow pattern through the process chamber causing non-uniform material removal or deposition either on a single wafer or wafer-to-wafer leading to higher than normal die reject rates. Although these effects may be less pronounced when processing 300 mm or smaller wafers, the flow and pressure imbalance becomes a more significant problem for processing the larger next generation 450 mm size wafers. Furthermore, the multiple branches and complex configuration of the vacuum pumping piping <b>15</b> increases flow resistance resulting in lower pumping efficiency and higher operating costs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem with the foregoing known vacuum processing systems <b>10</b> is the accumulation or buildup of solid process byproducts (e.g. powders, residues, particles, etc.) in the vacuum pumping piping <b>15</b> that carry over from the semiconductor material removal or deposition processes performed in vacuum chamber <b>11</b>. The particulate byproduct buildup reduces the effective internal diameter of the vacuum piping, raises back pressure on the vacuum chamber <b>11</b>, and decreases gas flow leading to higher byproduct accumulation rates in the piping. The decreased internal piping diameter increases flow resistance and decreases pumping efficiency as well. In addition, the particulate byproduct accumulations further exacerbate the pressure balance problems and uneven gas flow in the process chamber mentioned above that leads to non-uniform wafer material removal and deposition. Frequent periodic maintenance and downtime of the vacuum process machine is required to disassemble the vacuum pumping piping <b>15</b> and remove particulate byproduct buildups.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Existing piping arrangements having numerous horizontal piping sections such as the vacuum pumping piping <b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are particularly susceptible to increased buildup of semiconductor fabrication process particulate byproducts. The horizontal sections of existing pumping piping arrangements act as ledges or traps for particulate matter to accumulate, and is particularly pronounced near the piping inlets <b>19</b> beneath the pumping ports on process chamber <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The flow eddies and stagnant flow regions caused by the many piping bends, particularly 90 degree elbows, also create low flow regions where particulate byproduct buildup tends to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another problem with the foregoing known vacuum processing systems <b>10</b> is inability to compensate for the uneven gas flow due to vacuum pressure imbalances in the vacuum pumping piping <b>15</b> resulting from the asymmetrical piping arrangement and particulate byproduct buildup in the piping. Only a single pressure measurement of the process chamber actual pressure P is recorded giving the controller and/or process operating personnel no information on whether one of the piping branches may have partial blockages due to particulate byproduct buildup causing the uneven gas flow. Furthermore, because only a single combined pressure control-isolation valve <b>14</b> is provided, the controller or operator has no real ability to balance the gas flow and pressures from side to side in the piping branches to compensate for excessive buildup occurring in one of the branches. Therefore, the entire processing machine must be shut down for maintenance to clean out the particulate buildup.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An improved vacuum processing machine piping arrangement and pressure monitoring and control system is therefore desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another embodiment, a vacuum system for semiconductor fabrication includes a vacuum chamber for performing a semiconductor fabrication process, a vacuum source, and a piping system fluidly connecting the vacuum chamber to the vacuum source. Preferably, the piping system is configured without a horizontal flow path section of piping. In one embodiment, the piping system includes a first piping branch and a second piping branch in which the first and second piping branches having a symmetrical configuration with respect to the vacuum source. The first and second piping branches preferably have substantially the same configuration in some embodiments. In some embodiments, each piping branch includes a bifurcated fitting that is fluidly connected to the vacuum chamber. In preferred embodiments of the piping system, the first and second piping branches each include a throttle valve that is independently controllable and operable to adjust the pressure and gas flow in each branch.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another embodiment, a vacuum control system for a semiconductor fabrication machine includes a vacuum chamber for performing a semiconductor fabrication process which includes a chamber pressure sensor operable to measure pressure within the chamber and transmit a signal indicative of the measured chamber pressure and a vacuum source, such as a vacuum pump in some embodiments. The system further preferably includes a first piping branch fluidly connected to the vacuum chamber that includes a first throttle valve. The first piping branch includes a first pressure sensor operable to measure pressure within the first piping branch and transmit a signal indicative of the measured first branch pressure. A second piping branch fluidly connecting the vacuum chamber is provided that includes a second throttle valve. The second piping branch includes a second pressure sensor operable to measure pressure within the second piping branch and transmit a signal indicative of the measured second branch pressure. In preferred embodiments, the first and second piping branches converge and are fluidly connected to the vacuum source.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, a system controller is provided that receives pressure signals from the foregoing chamber pressure sensor, first piping branch pressure sensor, and second piping branch pressure sensor. The controller is preprogrammed with and operative to executes control logic configured to: compare the measured pressure from the first and second piping branch pressure sensors; and throttle the first or second throttle valves to balance the pressure in each piping branch. In other embodiments, the control logic is further configured to sense the operating position of the first and second throttle valves, compare the positions of the first and second valve to a control limit, and stop the fabrication machine if the positions of the first or second control valve exceed the control limit. The positions of valves relate to the degree of openness of the variable flow orifices that are preferably provided in each of the first and second throttle valves. In some embodiments, the control logic is further configured to compare the chamber pressure to the first branch pressure and second branch pressure, and stop the fabrication machine if the first or second branch pressure is not equal to the chamber pressure.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partially exploded perspective view of one embodiment of a semiconductor vacuum processing machine <b>20</b> and vacuum piping arrangement according to the present invention. Vacuum processing system <b>20</b> includes a conventional vacuum process chamber <b>21</b> that is configured to hold one or more wafers W staged and supported by base <b>12</b> for processing.

Vacuum chamber <b>21</b> and vacuum pump <b>24</b> may be any suitable commercially available machines that will be readily recognizable to those skilled in the art and may selected to meet the particular requirements of semiconductor fabrication processes to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, vacuum pumping piping <b>25</b> is intended to reduce or eliminate the problems associated with prior asymmetric and complicated piping system arrangements as described and shown herein in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, including but not limited to process chamber particulate byproduct or powder buildup, pressure and gas flow imbalance, and lower pumping efficiency as previously described herein. In one preferred embodiment, vacuum pumping piping <b>25</b> is advantageously configured to provide a simple, symmetrical piping arrangement that preferably also eliminates or minimizes horizontal flow piping sections and reduced flow zones that tend to accumulate the particulate or solid byproducts carrying over from the semiconductor fabrication processes performed in vacuum process chamber <b>21</b>. This improved symmetrical and simple piping arrangement further advantageously minimizes gas flow and pressure imbalances between different piping branches and improves pumping efficiency, making the system more amenable to processing the next generation 450 mm size wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, vacuum pumping piping <b>25</b> in one embodiment may include Piping Branch A and Piping Branch B. Preferably, Piping Branches A and B are substantially symmetrical in configuration and size from piping inlets <b>29</b>A and <b>29</b>B coupled to pumping ports <b>26</b> on process chamber <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to the inlet of isolation valve VI proximate to the point where the bifurcated piping converges into a single pipe or line. It will be appreciated that some slight variations in size and configuration may be required in some embodiments to adapt each Piping Branch to physical differences and obstructions resulting from actual installation of the piping. Piping Branch A includes piping inlets <b>29</b>A, a first specially configured bifurcated fitting such as Y-shaped fitting <b>30</b>, throttle valve VA, and piping section <b>27</b>A. In one embodiment, Piping Branch B preferably is similarly configured to Piping Branch A and includes piping inlets <b>29</b>B, a Y-shaped fitting <b>30</b>, throttle valve VB, and piping section <b>27</b>B. Preferably, Piping Branches A and B advantageously do not include any substantially horizontal sections that may act as ledges for accumulating particulate byproduct buildup as found in prior vacuum pumping piping designs.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, Y-shaped fittings <b>30</b> is preferably closely coupled to vacuum chamber <b>21</b>. Throttle valves VA and VB are preferably closely coupled to Y-shaped fittings <b>30</b>. These short distances are intended to minimize or eliminate some piping to reduce the potential sites for solid byproduct particles or powder carried from the vacuum chamber <b>21</b> to condense and accumulate.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Piping sections <b>27</b>A and <b>27</b>B terminate and converge at a second bifurcated fitting such as Y-shaped fitting <b>28</b>. Y-shaped fitting <b>28</b> may be a standard commercially available piping fitting or a special fabricated mitered fitting configured to match the specific size, angles, and requirements for the intended installation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An isolation valve VI is disposed downstream of Y-shaped fitting <b>28</b> and upstream of vacuum pump <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Isolation valve VI may include an automatic valve operator responsive to a signal from system controller <b>40</b> to close and open the valve or may be strictly a manually operated valve. Isolation valve Vi is used for maintenance or emergency shutdown procedures to isolate vacuum pump <b>24</b> from process chamber <b>21</b>. Isolation valve VI may be mounted to the inlet of vacuum pump <b>24</b> or may be fluidly connected to vacuum pump <b>24</b> via a section of piping.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view of specially configured Y-shaped fitting <b>30</b> shown positioned in Piping Branch A and attached to vacuum chamber <b>21</b>. Y-shaped fitting <b>30</b> has a bifurcated inlet arrangement including two inlet sections <b>31</b> each defining a respective piping inlet <b>29</b>A for coupling to pumping ports <b>26</b> on vacuum chamber <b>21</b>, an enlarged mixed flow main portion <b>33</b>, and a single combined outlet section <b>32</b>. In one embodiment, outlet section <b>32</b> of fitting <b>30</b> may attached directly to throttle valve VA or to a short section of piping or spool piece that attaches to valve VA. A similar specially configured Y-shaped fitting <b>30</b> is also provided for Piping Branch B in preferred embodiments. Inlet sections <b>31</b> and outlet section <b>32</b> may have any suitable end preparation known in the art to match pumping ports <b>26</b> and valve VA or piping disposed between valve VA and outlet section <b>32</b>. The type of end preparation used will be dictated by the corresponding end preparation used for pumping ports <b>26</b> and valve VA or other piping at the outlet from fitting <b>30</b>. Preferably, Y-shaped fitting <b>30</b> does not include any horizontal flow path portions to prevent accumulation of particulate byproduct buildup carrying over from vacuum chamber <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It will be appreciated that in some embodiments contemplated, Y-shaped fitting <b>30</b> may be a conventional commercially-available Y-fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Throttle valves VA and VB may be any commercially available valve suitable for use in a vacuum piping system flow and pressure throttling application. Throttle valves VA and VB, regardless of the type or style of valve selected, include a variable flow orifices of a suitable type to regulate the flow through the valve and operating pressures in each respective Piping Branch. Preferably, valves VA and VB in one embodiment include electric valve operators with appropriate electronics that allow flow through the valves and outlet pressures therefrom to be adjusted automatically via electric control signals output from a microprocessor-based system controller <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as further described herein. Valves VA and VB may include other conventional appurtenances and auxiliary equipment commonly supplied for such valve applications including limit switches, open/closed position indicators, etc. In some embodiments, throttle valves VA and VB may have pneumatic actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Isolation valve VI may be any commercially available valve suitable for use in a vacuum piping system flow and flow isolation application. Valve VI may be manually operated valve in some embodiments, or alternatively may be electrically or pneumatically operated and capable of remote actuation similar to throttle valves VA and VB via electric control signals output from system controller <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A control system according to the present invention will now be described for monitoring and controlling the operation of the vacuum pumping piping <b>25</b> system. The control system includes a system controller <b>40</b> which will now be described in additional detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">System controller <b>40</b> is preferably a microprocessor-based controller in some embodiments that is operable to receive and generate data and control signals. In one embodiment, system controller <b>40</b> preferably is operative to sense and receives discrete pressure signals generated and transmitted from pressure sensors <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>, and <b>52</b> which measure actual pressures Pa, Pb, and P respectively. Pressure sensors <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are preferably each respectively located upstream of throttle valves VA and VB, and more preferably at or near the outlet from specially configured Y-shaped fitting <b>30</b> as shown to measure the combined pressure of Piping Branch A or B. Pressure sensor <b>50</b> is connected to and measures actual pressure P within vacuum chamber <b>21</b>. Sensors <b>50</b>-<b>52</b> may be any suitable commercially available pressure sensing or monitoring devices that are operable to measure pressure, and then generate and transmit data signals via data communication links <b>42</b> to system controller <b>40</b> that are indicative of the instantaneous actual measured pressures at each sensor mounting location.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in some embodiments, system controller <b>40</b> is further electrically linked to the valve operators associated with throttle valves VA and VB via communication links <b>42</b>. Controller <b>40</b> therefore is operable to generate and transmit control signals to throttle valves VA and VB via communication links <b>42</b> for adjusting/throttling the position of the variable flow orifice in the valves to regulate pressure and flow through each Piping Branch A and B. System controller <b>40</b> may further be electrically linked to isolation valve VI to open/close the valve via control signals similar to throttle valves VA and VB. In other embodiments, isolation valve VI may be a manually-operated valve. In yet other possible embodiments, isolation valve VI may be a throttle valve similar to valves VA, VB in lieu of an on/off type isolation valve. This latter option may be provided where it is desirable to throttle and adjust the entire flow in vacuum pumping piping <b>25</b> and vacuum pressure within chamber <b>21</b> with a single valve in addition to the capability to adjust pressures in each of the Piping Branches A and B via throttle valves VA and VB.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">System controller <b>40</b> may be any type of commercially available processor, central processing unit (CPU), microprocessor, microcontroller, or similar computer-like device that incorporates the required control circuitry. Controller <b>40</b> preferably includes or is connected to accessible computer-readable storage medium including any suitable type or combination of conventional computer memory such as without limitation read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), flash memory, optical storage devices such as a hard disk drive, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, system controller <b>40</b> preferably is programmed with and executes operating instructions or control logic configured to monitor and control the vacuum pumping piping <b>25</b> system. System operating pressures Pa, Pb, and P form input signals to the control logic allowing the operation of vacuum pumping piping <b>25</b> system to be monitored and controlled. The control logic and various system input baseline operating parameters and control limits or setpoints may be pre-programmed into controller <b>40</b> and stored on the computer-readable storage medium. The control logic may be executed by controller <b>40</b> in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof. System controller <b>40</b> may further preferably includes a conventional user interface <b>41</b> such as a video display device (VDD) and control keys allowing operating personnel to program, operate, and interface with the controller.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Data communication links <b>42</b> may include without limitation wired, wireless, &#x201c;on-board&#x201d; (circuit board) conductors, and combinations thereof in some preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">One preferred method of operating the vacuum pumping piping <b>25</b> system will now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows one example of control logic that may be pre-programmed into and implemented by system controller <b>40</b> for controlling operation of the vacuum pumping piping <b>25</b> system. Control logic routine or process <b>100</b> begins in step <b>102</b> in which the desired setpoint pressure Ps of vacuum chamber <b>21</b> is preprogrammed into a system controller <b>40</b>. In next step <b>104</b>, system controller <b>40</b> automatically throttles or adjusts valves VA and VB individually until the actual pressure P in vacuum chamber <b>21</b> substantially matches the preselected setpoint pressure Ps. Pressure sensor <b>50</b> measures the instantaneous actual pressure P within vacuum chamber <b>21</b> and transmits a data signals indicative of this measured pressure back to system controller <b>40</b>. System controller <b>40</b> then reads and uses this pressure data to throttle valves VA and VB until the actual measured chamber pressure P substantially matches the desired setpoint pressure Ps.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, control logic process <b>100</b> continues in step <b>106</b> wherein a test is performed comparing the foreline or upstream pressures Pa and Pb ahead of their respective throttle valves VA and VB. In this step, system controller <b>40</b> automatically senses and reads pressures Pa and Pb in Piping Branches A and B. Ideally, the pressures Pa and Pb within each Piping Branch A and B are equal or substantially close within a preprogrammed pressure differential limit previously input into system controller <b>40</b> to provide uniform gas flow in each Piping Branch. If a &#x201c;NO&#x201d; response is returned indicating that pressure Pa does not match pressure Pb within the prescribed limit, step <b>108</b> is implemented in which system controller <b>40</b> adjusts the position of the variable flow orifice in each throttle valve VA, VB, or in both until the pressure differential between pressures Pa and Pb are back within the control limit. Preferably, the throttle valves have electronic position indicators for the variable flow orifice which indicate the degree to which the orifice is either closed or opened. These position indicators are therefore operative to sense the orifice position and generate a signal which is transmitted to system controller <b>40</b> indicative of the identified position. Once a &#x201c;YES&#x201d; response is returned in step <b>106</b>, control passes to step <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step <b>110</b>, a system check or test is performed to verify that the degree of openness of the variable flow orifices in each throttle valve VA and VB are less than a preprogrammed valve position control limit previously input into system controller <b>40</b>. Accordingly, the valve operators and their associated electronic circuitry for valves VA and VB preferably include position indicators that are operable to detect each valve's position (meaning the degree of openness of the valve orifice), and then generate a signal indicative of the same which is transmitted to system controller <b>40</b> via data communication link <b>42</b>. In other embodiments, separate electronic valve position indicators and circuitry may be provided for the same purpose. If a &#x201c;YES&#x201d; response is returned, control passes to step <b>114</b>. Alternatively, if a &#x201c;NO&#x201d; is returned, asymmetric pumping and flow is occurring which may possibly indicate a leak in the vacuum piping system or particulate byproduct blockages/buildup in one of the Piping Branches A or B upstream of throttle valves VA and VB. Step <b>112</b> is therefore performed in which system controller <b>40</b> generates a signal to stop the vacuum processing system <b>20</b> machine to allow for inspection, repair, and/or maintenance of the vacuum processing system <b>20</b> and/or vacuum pumping piping <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, assuming a &#x201c;YES&#x201d; response is returned in step <b>110</b>, control then passes to step <b>114</b> in which an additional system check or test is performed. In step <b>114</b>, system controller <b>40</b> reads and compares the instantaneous actual pressures Pa, Pb, and P to determine if they are the substantially the same within a preprogrammed control limit. The pressure information is transmitted to system controller <b>40</b> by pressure sensors <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>, and <b>52</b> as described herein over data communication links <b>42</b>. System controller <b>40</b> may apply appropriate preprogrammed correction factors to the measured pressures to compensate for the fact that the pressure P measured within vacuum chamber <b>21</b> may be slightly different than pressures Pa and Pb measured in Piping Branches A and B due to some pressure drop occurring through the piping to the point of measurement. If the pressures Pa, Pb, and P (optionally corrected as needed) are substantially the same (i.e. a &#x201c;YES&#x201d; is returned) being within the preprogrammed control limit, control passes to step <b>118</b> in which operation of the vacuum processing system <b>20</b> continues.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Alternatively, if in step <b>114</b> pressures Pa, Pb, and P are not the same (i.e. a &#x201c;NO&#x201d; is returned) with the control limit, an abnormal operating condition is occurring which may be indicative of a leak in the vacuum piping system, vacuum chamber <b>21</b>, particulate byproduct blockages/buildup in the piping, or another reasons. Accordingly, step <b>118</b> is implemented by system controller <b>40</b> in which the vacuum processing system <b>20</b> is shut down to allow for inspection and repair or maintenance as required.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">System controller <b>40</b> repeats the foregoing control logic process <b>200</b> steps to monitor and protect vacuum processing system <b>20</b> and the quality of the wafers W produced therein. In some embodiments, control logic process <b>200</b> may run continuously. In other embodiments, control logic process <b>200</b> may be implemented periodically on a recurring basis.</p>
