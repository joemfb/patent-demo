<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image sensor, and particularly to a package process of a backside illumination image sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Image sensor has a function of transforming the received optical signals into the electrical signals, and is widely used in various digital image electronic products. A conventional image sensor includes a semiconductor substrate and a sensing component disposed on the semiconductor substrate. Furthermore, the sensing component is covered by a plurality of metallic circuit layers disposed over the semiconductor substrate. The light entering the conventional image sensor must penetrate the metallic circuit layers before arriving at the sensing component. Thus, the light sensitive ability of the sensing component is limited. Recently, in order to improve the light sensitive ability of the image sensor, a backside illumination image sensor is being researched. The backside illumination image sensor includes a sensing component disposed on the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate. A front surface of the semiconductor substrate is only used for disposing a plurality of metallic circuit layers thereon. Because the sensing component of the backside illumination image sensor is not covered by the metallic circuit layers, the sensing component can sense more light. Thus, the light sensitive ability of the image sensor can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A current package process of the backside illumination image sensor includes the steps of: adhering the semiconductor substrate to a carrier, disposing the sensing component on the semiconductor substrate, forming the metallic circuit layers on the carrier, and so on. Generally, after the semiconductor substrate is adhered to the carrier, the following steps are performed. Thus, the metallic layers formed on the carrier are electrically connected to the semiconductor substrate. First, a plurality of holes corresponding to a plurality of pads on the semiconductor substrate are formed. Then, a metallization process is applied to the holes to form the conductive holes and metallic circuit layers. However, the pads on the semiconductor substrate are invisible after the semiconductor substrate is adhered to the carrier. Thus, it is difficulty to align of the drilling positions of the holes and the pads. As a result, the current package process of the backside illumination image sensor has a low the package efficiency. Furthermore, the inexact alignment of the drilling positions of the holes and the pads will affect the package quality the backside illumination image sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, what is needed is a package process of a backside illumination image sensor to overcome the above disadvantages.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a package process of a backside illumination image sensor to reducing the alignment difficulty in the package process, thereby increasing the package efficiency and improving the package quality.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the above-mentioned advantages, an embodiment of the present invention provides a package process of a backside illumination image sensor. In the package process, a wafer including a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface is provided. The first surface has a plurality of pads disposed thereon. A first carrier is processed to form a plurality of blind vias therein. The first carrier includes a front surface and a rear surface opposite to the front surface. The blind vias define a plurality of openings on the front surface. The front surface of the first carrier is adhered to the first surface of the wafer so that the blind vias face to the pads correspondingly. A spacing layer is formed on the second surface of the wafer. The spacing layer includes at least an open region to expose the second surface therefrom. A plurality of sensing components are disposed in the at least an open region. A second carrier is adhered on the spacing layer. A carrier thinning process is performed so that the blind vias become the through holes penetrating the thinned first carrier to expose the pads therefrom. An insulating layer is formed on the first carrier to cover the rear surface and the sidewalls of the through holes. An electrically conductive layer is formed on the insulating layer and filled in the though holes so that the electrically conductive layer is electrically connected to the pads.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment of the present invention, the step of processing the first carrier includes providing the first carrier, forming an oxide layer on the front surface of the first carrier, and removing a portion of the oxide layer and forming the blind vias in the first carrier. In one embodiment of the present invention, the step of removing the portion of the oxide layer and forming the blind vias in the first carrier includes an etching process or a drilling process. In one embodiment of the present invention, the first carrier is a silicon substrate, and the oxide layer is a silicon oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of the present invention, the step of disposing the sensing components includes disposing a photodiode on the second surface of the wafer, forming a color filter over the photodiode, and disposing a micro lens over the color filter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment of the present invention, the second carrier is a transparent substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment of the present invention, before the spacing layer is formed, the package process of the backside illumination image sensor further includes a wafer thinning process. The wafer thinning process includes grinding the second surface of the wafer to form a grinding surface and etching the grinding surface of the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment of the present invention, the insulating layer is a silicon oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment of the present invention, the step of forming the insulating layer includes forming an insulating material on the rear surface of the first carrier to cover the rear surface, the pads and the sidewalls of the through holes, and etching the insulating material to remove the portions of the insulating material on the pads. In one embodiment provided by the present invention, the insulating material is formed by using a chemical vapor deposition method.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment of the present invention, the spacing layer is a patterned adhesive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment of the present invention, the step of adhering the front surface of the first carrier to the first surface of the wafer is performed in a vacuum condition.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To achieve the above-mentioned advantages, an embodiment of the present invention provides a package process of a backside illumination image sensor. In the package process, a wafer including a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface is provided. The first surface has a plurality of pads disposed thereon.

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the package process of the backside illumination image sensor of the present invention, before the wafer is adhered to the first carrier, a plurality of blind vias or a plurality of through holes have been formed. Thus, when the wafer is adhered to the first carrier, only the alignment of the blind vias or the through holes and the pads is needed to be considered. In other words, during forming the through holes, it is not necessary to consider the alignment of the drilling positions of the through holes and the invisible pads. Thus, the alignment difficulty in the package process can be reduced, thereby achieving the exact alignment of the through hole and the pads. As a result, the package efficiency can be increased and the package quality can be improved.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, first, a wafer <b>100</b>, for example, a semiconductor wafer, is provided. The wafer <b>100</b> includes a first surface <b>102</b> and a second surface <b>104</b> opposite to the first surface <b>102</b>. The first surface <b>102</b> has a plurality of pads <b>106</b> disposed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, next, a first carrier <b>110</b> is processed to form a plurality of blind vias <b>112</b> therein. In detail, the first carrier <b>110</b> is provided. The first carrier <b>110</b> includes a front surface <b>114</b> and a rear surface <b>116</b> opposite to the front surface <b>114</b>. An oxide layer <b>118</b> is formed on the front surface <b>114</b> of the first carrier <b>110</b>. Then, the portions of the oxide layer <b>118</b> are removed and the blind vias <b>112</b> are formed by using an etching process. In other words, the portions of the oxide layer <b>118</b> are etched to be removed and the corresponding portions of the first carrier <b>110</b> are etched from the front surface <b>114</b> to form the blind vias <b>112</b>. The blind vias <b>112</b> do not penetrate the front surface <b>114</b> and the rear surface <b>116</b>. The blind vias <b>112</b> define a plurality of openings <b>119</b> on the front surface <b>114</b>. In another embodiment, the step of removing the portions of the oxide layer <b>118</b> and forming the blind vias <b>112</b> can employ a drilling process, for example, a laser drilling process. In the present embodiment, the first carrier <b>110</b> is, but not limited to, a silicon substrate, and the oxide layer <b>118</b> is, but not limited to, a silicon oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the front surface <b>114</b> of the first carrier <b>110</b> is adhered to the first surface <b>102</b> of the wafer <b>100</b> so that the blind vias <b>112</b> face to the pads <b>106</b> correspondingly. That is, the openings <b>119</b> on the front surface <b>114</b> of the blind vias <b>112</b> face to the pads <b>106</b> correspondingly. In other words, the pads <b>106</b> are exposed in the blind vias <b>112</b>. The oxide layer <b>118</b> is located between the first surface <b>102</b> and the front surface <b>114</b>. The oxide layer <b>118</b> can be configured for insulating the pads <b>106</b>. In another embodiment, the first carrier <b>110</b> can be adhered to the wafer <b>100</b> with other insulating adhesive materials. It is noted that it is necessary to remove the insulating adhesive materials on the pads <b>106</b>. In the present embodiment, the front surface <b>114</b> of the first carrier <b>110</b> is adhered to the first surface <b>102</b> of the wafer <b>100</b> in a vacuum condition, thereby avoiding air in the blind vias <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">After the front surface <b>114</b> of the first carrier <b>110</b> is adhered to the first surface <b>102</b> of the wafer <b>100</b>, a wafer thinning process can be performed selectively. Thus, the wafer <b>100</b> can have a suitable thickness. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, in the wafer thinning process, at first, the second surface <b>104</b> of the wafer <b>100</b> is ground to form a ground surface (not shown). The method for grinding the wafer <b>100</b> can be, for example, a milling method, a grinding method or a polishing method. Subsequently, the ground surface of the wafer <b>100</b> is etched, thereby obtaining a thinned wafer <b>100</b>&#x2032;. The thinned wafer <b>100</b>&#x2032; includes the first surface <b>102</b> and the second surface <b>104</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, next, a spacing layer <b>120</b> is formed on the second surface <b>104</b>&#x2032; of the wafer <b>100</b>&#x2032;. The spacing layer <b>120</b> is configured for forming a distance between the first carrier <b>110</b> and the second carrier <b>140</b>. The spacing layer <b>120</b> includes at least an open region <b>122</b>. The second surface <b>104</b>&#x2032; of the wafer <b>100</b>&#x2032; is exposed from the at least an open region <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, next, a plurality of sensing components <b>130</b> are disposed on the wafer <b>100</b>&#x2032; exposed from the at least an open region <b>122</b>. The step of disposing the sensing components <b>130</b> is determined by difference of the sensing components <b>130</b>. In the present embodiment, a sensing component <b>130</b> includes a photodiode <b>132</b>, a color filter <b>134</b> and a micro lens <b>136</b>. Thus, firstly, a photodiode <b>132</b> is disposed on the second surface <b>104</b>&#x2032; of the wafer <b>100</b>&#x2032; and embedded in the wafer <b>100</b>&#x2032;. Secondly, a color filter <b>134</b> is formed over the photodiode <b>132</b>. Thirdly, a micro lens <b>136</b> is disposed over the color filter <b>134</b>. Afterwards, a second carrier <b>140</b> is located over and adhered on the spacing layer <b>120</b>. The second carrier <b>140</b> is a transparent substrate, for example, a glass substrate. In the present embodiment, the spacing layer <b>120</b> is a patterned adhesive layer. Thus, the second carrier <b>140</b> can be, but not limited to, directly adhered to the wafer <b>100</b>&#x2032; through the spacing layer <b>120</b>. It is noted that the spacing layer <b>120</b> can also be other suitable structures.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, next, a carrier thinning process is applied to the rear surface <b>116</b> of the first carrier <b>110</b>. Thus, the first carrier <b>110</b> can have a suitable thickness, thereby forming a thinned first carrier <b>110</b>&#x2032; having a rear surface <b>116</b>&#x2032;. Furthermore, after the carrier thinning process, the blind vias <b>112</b> of the first carrier <b>110</b> become through holes <b>112</b>&#x2032; penetrating the thinned first carrier <b>110</b>&#x2032;. In other words, the through holes <b>112</b>&#x2032; penetrating the front surface <b>114</b> and the rear surface <b>116</b>&#x2032;, and the pads <b>106</b> are exposed from the through holes <b>112</b>&#x2032;. In the present embodiment, the method for thinning the first carrier <b>110</b> can be, for example, an etching method, a milling method, a grinding method or a polishing method.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, next, an insulating layer <b>150</b> is formed on the first carrier <b>110</b>&#x2032; to cover the rear surface <b>116</b>&#x2032; and the sidewalls of the through holes <b>112</b>&#x2032;. In the present embodiment, firstly, an insulating material is deposited on the first carrier <b>110</b>&#x2032; to cover the rear surface <b>116</b>&#x2032;, the pads <b>106</b> and the sidewalls of the through holes <b>112</b>&#x2032;. The insulating material is, for example, a silicon oxide. Secondly, the insulating material is etched to remove the portions of the insulating material on the pads <b>106</b>, thereby forming the insulating layer <b>150</b>. In the present embodiment, the insulating material is deposited, but not limited to, by using a chemical vapor deposition method.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>, next, an electrically conductive layer <b>160</b> is formed on the insulating layer <b>150</b> and filled in the though holes <b>112</b>&#x2032; so that the electrically conductive layer <b>160</b> is electrically connected to the pads <b>106</b>. The electrically conductive layer <b>160</b> is formed by either an electroplating method or a depositing method and is not described here.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic, cross-sectional view of a wafer adhering to a first carrier in a package process of a backside illumination image sensor in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. The package process of the backside illumination image sensor in the second embodiment is similar to the package process of the backside illumination image sensor in the first embodiment except the step of processing the first carrier. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in detail, in the present embodiment, a first carrier <b>110</b><i>a </i>is processed to form a plurality of through holes <b>112</b><i>a </i>therein. The first carrier <b>110</b><i>a </i>includes a front surface <b>114</b> and a rear surface <b>116</b> opposite to the front surface <b>114</b>. The through holes <b>112</b><i>a </i>penetrate the front surface <b>114</b> and the rear surface <b>116</b> of the first carrier <b>110</b><i>a</i>. Then, the front surface <b>114</b> of the first carrier <b>110</b><i>a </i>is adhered to the first surface <b>102</b> of the wafer <b>100</b> so that the through holes <b>112</b><i>a </i>face to the pads <b>106</b> correspondingly. Thus, the pads <b>106</b> are exposed from the through holes <b>112</b><i>a </i>correspondingly. Because the through holes <b>112</b><i>a </i>have been formed in the first carrier <b>110</b><i>a</i>, in the present embodiment, it is not necessary to apply a carrier thinning process to the first carrier <b>110</b><i>a </i>having a suitable thickness. It is noted that, a carrier thinning process can be selectively applied to the first carrier <b>110</b><i>a </i>having a thick thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In summary, the present invention has at least the following advantages. Before the wafer is adhered to the first carrier, a plurality of blind vias or a plurality of through holes have been formed. Thus, when the wafer is adhered to the first carrier, only the alignment of the blind vias or the through holes and the pads is needed to be considered. In other words, during forming the through holes, it is not necessary to consider the alignment of the drilling positions of the through holes and the invisible pads. Thus, the alignment difficulty in the package process can be reduced, thereby achieving the exact alignment of the through hole and the pads. As a result, the package efficiency can be increased and the package quality can be improved.</p>
