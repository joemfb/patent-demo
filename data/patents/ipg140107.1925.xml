<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention is directed to air cleaner assemblies incorporated into forced air HVAC systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Air cleaner assemblies for forced air heating, cooling and ventilation (HVAC) systems have been used for decades. Such air filtration devices and structures vary widely from simple panel filters to two substantially different types of air cleaners: electronic air cleaners and extended surface pleated mechanical media filters. Extended surface filters can be supplied in a collapsible configuration or in a cartridge configuration. Within the broad class of media filters, there is a wide range of filter media and structures. At one end of the conventional range of media filters are the relatively low-efficiency fiberglass or spun glass panel filters. These filters use a weave or felt of glass fibers to trap airborne particulates and the like. Typically, such fiberglass mat filters have an American Society of Heating Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Engineers (ASHRAE) average Arrestance of 50-60%, per Standard 52.1. Such filters are typically one or two inches thick. Pleated media filters are a step up from basic fiberglass mat filters. Such pleated media filters are typically thin synthetic or glass fiber sheets and typically have ASHRAE MERV ratings from 6-16, per Standard 52.2.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">HVAC systems can use in-duct air cleaners. Such in-duct air cleaners include a frame or filter housing that connects to the inflow and/or outflow portions of the duct work and an opening that allows a filter to be inserted and removed from the air cleaner. Typically, the in-duct air cleaner is designed for a specific type and size of filter. The in-duct air cleaner typically includes a door or other panel that closes the opening of the filter housing through which the filter is inserted and removed from the in-duct air cleaner.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Collapsible extended surface pleated mechanical media (ESPM) filters occupy substantially less space in their collapsed state, compared to equivalent cartridge configurations. Thus, they are easier to store and ship, and consequently have lower storage and shipping costs. However, collapsible ESPM filters are substantially less user-friendly than equivalent cartridge-style filters, which can be easily inserted into and removed from the filter housing with only minimal user interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In contrast, collapsible ESPM filters can require substantial assembly by the end user before they are ready to be installed into the filter housing. For example, one such air cleaner design manufactured and sold by Research Products Corporation includes an inner housing, pleat spacers, an outer housing and a door. The ESPM filters for this air cleaner are sold in a collapsed state. Before the collapsible ESPM filter can be installed, it must be opened up and assembled into the inner housing. The pleat spacers are then installed into the inner housing and inserted into the opened ESPM filter to hold open the pleats. This adds significantly to the installation time and difficulty. The inner housing, ESPM filter and pleat spacers assembly is then installed into the outer housing. The outer housing and door have seals that provide a seal around the inner housing. This design has redundant sealing surfaces and many parts to install and is time consuming and labor intensive to install.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other collapsible ESPM filters are effectively collapsible cartridge filters, in that they include components that, when assembled, act like the cartridge housing of a cartridge-style filter. Companies having such products include Honeywell, with its Pop-Up filter products and Carrier, with its EZ-Flex filter products. The Honeywell Pop-Up product comprises multiple molded plastic parts that are hinged and suspended on elastic cords that &#x201c;Pop&#x201d; into position to form a cartridge. The filter of the Carrier EZ-Flex product opens up like an accordion. Front and back panels snap on the opened filter to form a cartridge. Both of these designs have front and back panels forming a seal on the ends of the pleats. When these filters are installed into a housing, additional seals are required between the front and back panels and the front and back walls of the housing. These seals represent additional parts and design complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This invention provides an in-duct air cleaner having an easy-to-install collapsible extended surface pleated media filter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This invention separately provides an in-duct air cleaner having a housing, where the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter effectively self-seals against the front and rear walls of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This invention separately provides an in-duct air cleaner housing having support members for a collapsible extended surface pleated media filter.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This invention separately provides an in-duct air cleaner having an enclosing structure, where the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter has end members that form an effective seal against the top and bottom walls of the enclosing structure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This invention separately provides an in-duct air cleaner having support members for a collapsible extended surface pleated media filter.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In various exemplary embodiments of air cleaners according to this invention, an air cleaner comprises an enclosing structure having an air inlet surface, an air outlet surface, and at least one filter-opening surface. In various exemplary embodiments, the enclosing structure of the air cleaner includes support members or the like provided adjacent to, but spaced a given distance from, the top and bottom walls of the enclosing structure. A collapsible extended surface pleated media filter has a pair of end members and a mechanical media filter that extends between the end members and is pleated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The end members have an inner surface that the pleated mechanical media filter is attached to, and outer surface facing away from the pleated mechanical media filter. The end members have a given thickness and a given length that are appropriate for the particular enclosing structure the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter is to be used with. In various exemplary embodiments, the thickness of the end members is based on the distance of the support surfaces from the top and bottom walls of the enclosing structure. In various exemplary embodiments, the end members have a seal structure provided on the outer surface that interacts with the top or bottom wall of the enclosing structure to provide an effective seal against air flowing around, rather than through, the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In various exemplary embodiments, the mesh members have a width that is at most equal to the length of the end members. In various exemplary embodiments, the pleated mechanical media filter has a width that is greater than the length of the end members and/or width of the mesh members. In such exemplary embodiments, the pleated mechanical media filter typically extends beyond both ends of the mesh and/or end members. In various other exemplary embodiments, a plurality of the flexible material strips extend between the end members, with at least one flexible material strip located near, but spaced from, one or both of the side edges of the pleated mechanical media filter. In such exemplary embodiments, the pleated mechanical media filter extends beyond those flexible material strips and/or the ends of the end members.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To install a collapsible extended surface pleated media filter into the enclosing structure, the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter, if it is in a collapsed state, is expanded to an open state, typically by pulling apart the end members. The opened collapsible extended surface pleated media filter is then inserted into the enclosing structure by inserting the end members of the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter into the spaces between the support members and the top or bottom walls of the enclosing structure. In various exemplary embodiments, the length of the end members is substantially equal to the depth of the enclosing structure between side surfaces of the enclosing structure, while the width of the pleated mechanical media filter is greater than the depth of the enclosing structure and the lengths of the end members and/or flexible support members. As a result, a first portion of the width of the pleated mechanical media filter that extends beyond the ends of the end members adjacent to a back surface of the enclosing structure interacts with the back surface. Typically, that first portion of the pleated mechanical media filter provides an effective seal between the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter and the back surface against air flowing around, rather than through, the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Likewise, when a door or the like of the air cleaner is installed into a filter opening in the enclosing structure, the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter is held in the enclosing structure such that a second portion of the width of the pleated mechanical media filter that extends beyond the ends of the end members adjacent to the door interacts with the door. Typically, that second portion of the pleated mechanical media filter provides an effective seal between the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter and the door against air flowing around, rather than through, the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter. Accordingly, the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter fits into the enclosing structure such that air passing through the air inlet surface, substantially and entirely passes through the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter, and then passes out through the air outlet surface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In various exemplary embodiments, the width of the pleated mechanical media filter may be approximately equal to or slightly shorter than the depth of the enclosing structure, such that the pleated mechanical media filter just contacts, or is even spaced a small distance away from, one or both of the side surfaces of the enclosing structure. In still other exemplary embodiments, the first and second ends of the pleated mechanical media filter interact differently with the side surfaces of the enclosing structure. That is, one of the first and second ends extends substantially beyond the end of the end members, such that that first or second end of the pleated mechanical media filter is pressed against the adjacent side surface of the enclosing structure. At the same time, the other of the first and second ends just contacts or is spaced a sufficiently small distance from that other adjacent side surface. In both cases, the interaction of the ends of the pleated mechanical media filter with the side surfaces of the enclosing structure creates an effective seal such that the airflow through the enclosing structure substantially passes through the pleated mechanical media filter rather than passing between the pleated mechanical media filter and the side surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In various exemplary embodiments of methods for using the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter according to this invention, a used filter extending between the support members is removed from the support structure and discarded. A new collapsible extended surface pleated media filter is removed from its packaging and expanded by pulling apart the end members. The end members are then inserted through a filter opening of the enclosing structure and into the spaces between the support members and the top and bottom walls, such that the end members form an effective seal with the top and bottom walls of the enclosing structure against air flowing around, rather than through, the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter. The collapsible extended surface pleated media filter is pushed into the enclosing structure such that a first portion of the pleated mechanical media filter is substantially adjacent to or contacts the back side surface of the enclosing structure to create an effective seal against air flowing around, rather than through, the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter. A door is then attached to the enclosing structure, such that a second portion of the pleated mechanical media filter is substantially adjacent to or contacts the door to create an effective seal against air flowing around, rather than through, the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various exemplary embodiments, the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter optionally includes one or more flexible support members or the like on or in the pleated mechanical media filter. The flexible support members act to assist in keeping the pleats of the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter open. The flexible support members can be metal or formed of any other appropriate material. In various exemplary embodiments, the flexible support members are mesh members. In various other exemplary embodiments, the flexible support members are long, relatively narrow strips of flexible material. The flexible support members can be placed adjacent to one or both of the outer surfaces of the pleated mechanical media filter, and/or can be embedded within the pleated mechanical media filter.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In various exemplary embodiments, the mesh members have a width that is generally equal to the length of the end members. In various exemplary embodiments, the pleated mechanical media filter has a width that is greater than the length of the end members and/or width of the mesh members. In such exemplary embodiments, the pleated mechanical media filter typically extends beyond both ends of the mesh members and/or end members. In various other exemplary embodiments, a plurality of the flexible material strips extend between the end members, with at least one flexible material strip located near, but spaced from, one or both of the side edges of the pleated mechanical media filter. In such exemplary embodiments, the pleated mechanical media filter extends beyond those flexible material strips and/or the ends of the end members.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of in-duct air cleaners and collapsible extended surface pleated media filters according to this invention are described relative to a collapsible extended surface pleated media filter having end structures and flexible support members (if provided) having the same general length, with the wider pleated mechanical filter media extending beyond the ends of the end structures and beyond any flexible support members provided on or relative to the pleated mechanical filter media. It should be appreciated that the length of the end structures and the width of the flexible support members need not be the same. It should be appreciated that, in such exemplary embodiments, the pleated mechanical filter media may extend beyond only one of the end structures and/or any provided flexible support member(s).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The following detailed description discusses exemplary embodiments where the enclosing structure is a frame having a top wall, bottom wall, rear wall and an opening for inserting the filter. The in-duct air cleaners and collapsible extended surface pleated media filters according to this invention do not require this, or any, specific enclosing structure. For example, the enclosing structure could be a segment of ductwork with at least one filter-opening surface through which a collapsible extended surface pleated media filter can be installed. Alternatively, the enclosing structure can be a separate housing or frame or the like. It should be appreciated that the enclosing structure can be any structure that can be installed in the path of the airflow or any other structure capable of directing airflow largely through the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter, and that is capable of maintaining the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter in position relative to the airflow. The following detailed description assumes the opening is one vertically-oriented surface, and defines the &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and &#x201c;rear&#x201d; walls accordingly. It should be appreciated that the opening could instead be provided on a horizontally-oriented surface, with the various walls rotated accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an isometric exploded view of a first exemplary embodiment of an in-duct air cleaner <b>10</b> according to this invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the air cleaner <b>10</b> comprises a frame <b>100</b>, as an enclosing structure, and a first exemplary collapsible extended surface pleated media filter <b>200</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the frame <b>100</b> has a top wall <b>110</b>, a bottom wall <b>120</b> and a rear wall <b>130</b>. In place of the other walls, the frame <b>100</b> defines an air inlet surface <b>140</b>, an air outlet surface <b>150</b>, and a filter-opening surface <b>160</b>. A door <b>170</b> is attachable to the frame <b>100</b> to close the filter-opening surface <b>160</b>.

The pleat spacer member(s) <b>240</b> can also act as flexible support members in place of or in addition to the flexible support members <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should be appreciated that, in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, a single end member or structure <b>210</b> is attached to each end of the pleated mechanical media filter <b>220</b>.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, the interaction between the support members <b>105</b> and the adjacent edges of the end members or structures <b>210</b> creates a flow path around the first exemplary collapsible extended surface pleated media filter <b>200</b> that has a flow resistance that is higher than the flow resistance through the pleated mechanical media filter <b>220</b>, at least initially. Typically, the support members <b>105</b> will extend substantially the entire distance between the filter-opening surface <b>160</b> and the rear wall <b>130</b>, although the support members <b>105</b> need not do so. In various other exemplary embodiments, the desired or determined distance D<sub>s </sub>and the thickness T<sub>e </sub>of the end members or structures <b>210</b> are selected so that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the first exemplary collapsible extended surface pleated media filter <b>200</b> is inserted into the frame <b>100</b>, an effective seal is formed between the end members or structures <b>210</b> of the collapsible extended surface pleated media filter <b>200</b> and the top and bottom walls <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> of the frame <b>100</b>.</p>

Such a support structure could include one or more support beams located between two or more surfaces of the enclosing structure, to provide support for the pleated mechanical media filter.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It should also be appreciated that, if one or more flexible support members are implemented as one or more mesh members, only one mesh member may be used, and that mesh member may be placed adjacent to one side of the pleated mechanical filter media or embedded within the pleated mechanical filter media. It should further be appreciated that the pleated mechanical filter media may extend beyond only one end of the end members/structures and/or the flexible support member(s). It should also be appreciated that the pleated mechanical filter media can have any desired thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It should be appreciated that any known or later-developed technique can be used to embed one or more flexible support members in the pleated mechanical filter media. For example, the flexible support member can be embedded by forming the pleated mechanical filter media using two layers of filter material, with the flexible support member located between the two layers. It should also be appreciated that the flexible support members are optional, and may be omitted entirely. Thus, it should be appreciated that the particular set of end members/structures, flexible support members and pleated mechanical filter media described in the preceding exemplary embodiments are illustrative only.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Similarly, it should be appreciated that the flexible support members, if implemented, can be formed of any known or later-developed material that has the desired stiffness, including metals, whether single element metals or alloys, synthetic fibers, natural fibers or the like. It should be appreciated that the flexible support members can be provided on one or both sides of the pleated mechanical media filter, and/or can be embedded within the pleated mechanical media filter.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">While this invention has been described in conjunction with the exemplary embodiments outlined above, various alternatives, modifications, variations, improvements and/or substantial equivalents, whether known or that are or may be presently foreseen, may become apparent to those having at least ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments of the invention, as set forth above, are intended to be illustrative, not limiting. Various changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Therefore, the invention is intended to embrace all known or earlier developed alternatives, modifications, variations, improvements and/or substantial equivalents.</p>
