<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a networking environment <b>100</b> in accordance with some embodiments. The networking environment <b>100</b> may include a mobile subscriber station (MSS) <b>104</b>, an access services network (ASN) <b>108</b>; a core service network (CSN) <b>112</b>; and a wide area network (WAN) <b>116</b> communicatively coupled with one another as shown by bidirectional arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The ASN <b>108</b> may provide broadband wireless radio access to mobile subscriber stations, such as MSS <b>104</b>. The ASN <b>108</b> may include one or more base stations (referred to as evolved nodeBs (eNBs) in LTE) and one or more gateways. The gateways may aggregate subscriber and control traffic from the base stations and communicate with the CSN <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The CSN <b>112</b> may provide various Internet protocol (IP) connectivity functions to interconnect the ASN <b>108</b> with the WAN <b>116</b>, e.g., Internet. The CSN <b>112</b> may have an authentication component, e.g., an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server <b>120</b>, to implement one or more AAA protocols related to provision of networking services to subscribers and/or devices. The AAA server <b>120</b> may be referred to as home AAA (H-AAA) server <b>120</b> to indicate that it is located in a home network of the MSS <b>104</b>. The CSN <b>112</b> may also include a VoIP server <b>124</b> (referred to as WiMAX VoIP Service (WVS) server in WiMAX) that may control registration of subscribers and/or devices for VoIP services as well as various call initiation, maintenance and termination operations as discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The MSS <b>104</b>, the AAA server <b>120</b>, and the VoIP server <b>124</b> may include VoIP modules <b>128</b>, <b>132</b>, and <b>136</b>, respectively, to perform respective VoIP operations. The VoIP operations may include generation, distribution, and use of VoIP session identifiers as will be described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a call flow <b>200</b> between components of the networking environment <b>100</b> that illustrates the generation and distribution of VoIP session identifiers in accordance with various embodiments. The call flow <b>200</b> may implement at least some aspects of a session initiation protocol (SIP) to control a voice-services session.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The call flow <b>200</b> may begin after the MSS <b>104</b> has established IP connectivity with the CSN <b>112</b> and obtained an IP address of the VoIP server <b>124</b>. At <b>204</b>, the VoIP module <b>128</b> of the MS <b>104</b> may register with the VoIP module <b>136</b> of the VoIP server <b>124</b> by sending a SIP registration message, e.g., SIP REGISTER message to a VoIP module <b>136</b> of the VoIP server <b>124</b>. The SIP REGISTER message may include a header having an expires-time value, but omitting authentication parameters for registering a voice-services session.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The expires-time value, which may be a non-zero time in seconds, is a time that the MSS <b>104</b> is providing for a registration of the voice-services session to remain active. If a voice-services session is not re-registered within that time, the voice-services session may be terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Unless otherwise indicated, VoIP-related operations attributed to the MS <b>104</b>, AAA server <b>120</b>, and/or VoIP server <b>124</b> may be performed by VoIP modules <b>128</b>, <b>132</b>, and/or <b>136</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At <b>208</b>, the VoIP server <b>124</b> may send an AAA Access Request message to the H-AAA Server <b>120</b>, based on receipt of the SIP REGISTER message. The AAA Access Request message sent at <b>208</b> may be an initial authentication request of a voice-services session for the MSS <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When receiving the AAA Access Request message with the initial authentication request of the voice-services session, the H-AAA server <b>120</b> may check whether the MSS <b>104</b> exists as a mobile subscriber. If the MSS <b>104</b> exists as a mobile subscriber, the H-AAA Server <b>120</b> may generate a related voice-services security context for the MSS <b>104</b> and reply with an AAA Access Challenge message, at <b>212</b>, that includes the voice-services security context. The voice-services security context may include authentication parameters that are to be used by the MSS <b>104</b> for registering a voice-services session.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At <b>216</b>, the VoIP server may send a SIP unauthorized message, e.g., SIP <b>401</b> (Unauthorized) message, to the MSS <b>104</b>. The SIP <b>401</b> (Unauthorized) message may provide the MSS <b>104</b> with security information, e.g., the voice-services security context, from the AAA Access Challenge message.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">After receiving the SIP <b>401</b> (Unauthorized) message, the MSS <b>104</b> may, at <b>220</b>, send a SIP REGISTER message to the VoIP server <b>124</b> to register a voice-services session. The SIP REGISTER message may include the voice-services security context and the expires-time value, i.e., the same values as carried in the SIP REGISTER message sent at <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Upon receiving the SIP REGISTER message, sent at <b>220</b>, the VoIP server <b>124</b> may retrieve the authentication parameters from the voice-services security context within a header of the SIP REGISTER message. The VoIP server <b>124</b> may then send, at <b>228</b>, an AAA Access Request message to the H-AAA server <b>120</b>. The AAA Access Request message may include the authentication parameters and the expires-time value retrieved from the SIP REGISTER message sent at <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When receiving the AAA Access Request, sent at <b>228</b>, the H-AAA server <b>120</b> may retrieve the authentication parameters and the expires-time value and attempt to authenticate the voice-services session for the MSS <b>104</b>. If the authentication is successful, the H-AAA server <b>120</b> may, at <b>232</b>, generate a number of VoIP session identifiers (VSIDs) according to a profile and credit associated with the MSS <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The VSIDs may indicate an enabled status (e.g., enabled or not enabled) for each of a number of different call types. For example, the VSIDs may indicate an enabled status, for the MSS <b>104</b>, for an emergency call type, a free call out type, a free call in type, a non-free call out type, and/or a non-free call in type. In some embodiments, the VSIDs may indicate an enabled status for each of the different call types. For example, VSIDs may include a bit that corresponds to each of the different call types. The call types that correspond to set bits may be enabled for the MSS <b>104</b>, while the call types that correspond to the non-set bits may be disabled for the MSS <b>104</b>, or vice versa. In other embodiments, additional/alternative mechanisms of indicating enabled status for the different call types may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The H-AAA server <b>120</b> may reply to the VoIP server <b>124</b> with an AAA Access Accept message at <b>236</b>.
