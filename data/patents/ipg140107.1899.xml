<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to ophthalmic lens systems and associated methods, and more specifically to binocular ophthalmic lens systems and methods in which the aberrations or other optical properties of the two lenses of a lens system are different in at least one respect.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accommodation of the eye is a process in which the axial location and/or optical power of the natural lens changes in response to ciliary muscle action, thereby allowing the eye to focus on objects over a range of distances. The ability for the eye to provide accommodation generally diminishes with age, becoming particularly apparent between the ages of 40 and 50. In addition, accommodative ability may be lost altogether when the natural lens is removed an replace by an intraocular lens, for example, due to the presence of cataracts. In this case, the loss of accommodation is because the vast majority of intraocular lenses that replace the natural lens have a fixed optical power and are unable to move in response to ciliary muscle action.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Multifocal contact lenses and intraocular lenses have been used to at least partially restore a subject's ability to focus on objects at more than one distance. Typically, such lenses provide two optical powers or foci simultaneously&#x2014;the lower optical power providing the ability to focus on object at distances greater than a few meters, while the higher optical power provides the ability to focus on objects that are within a meter of the subject.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One way of providing a multifocal lens is to add a multifocal diffractive pattern to a refractive lens. The diffractive pattern may be configured so that approximately half the light from an object is focused by the refractive power of the lens (e.g., for providing distant vision), while the other half is focused by the combination of the refractive power of the lens and a +1 diffraction order of the diffractive pattern (e.g., for providing near or intermediate vision). An added benefit to this approach is that the +1 diffraction order has a chromatic aberration that is opposite in sign to that produced by the refractive power of the ophthalmic lens and the cornea of the eye. By proper selection of the diffractive power, the total chromatic aberration of the ophthalmic lens/eye system can be significantly reduced, resulting in improved visual acuity for near or intermediate vision. However, one drawback to traditional multifocal diffractive lenses is that the chromatic aberration for the distance power of the lens is not affected, since there is no diffractive power in this focus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need to provide multifocal ophthalmic lens systems that provide chromatic aberration reduction for both distant vision and near or intermediate vision.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to ophthalmic lens systems and related methods comprising lenses for providing binocular vision, wherein a pair of lenses for a left and right eye of a human or animal subject have aberrations that are different from one another in at least one respect. For example, the pair of the ophthalmic lenses may each be a multifocal or bifocal lens, wherein each has a lower optical power (longer focal length) and a higher optical power (shorter focal length). For the first lens, an aberration of the cornea of the first eye is reduced or modified to provide improved vision for the lower optical power of the lens (e.g., for providing enhanced distant vision). For the second lens, the same or similar aberration of the cornea of the second eye is reduced or modified to provide improved visual quality for the higher optical power of the lens (e.g., for providing enhanced intermediate or near vision). More specifically, a pair or set of diffractive multifocal ophthalmic lenses may be selected or configured such that the first lens reduces or otherwise favorably changes chromatic aberrations associated with the lower optical power of the lens and/or one eye (distant vision), while the second lens reduces or otherwise favorably changes chromatic aberrations associated with the higher optical power of the lens (near or intermediate vision). Thus, the combination of lenses provides binocular vision in which chromatic aberrations are corrected or reduced both for distant vision and for near and/or intermediate vision.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the present invention discussed below are generally directed to intraocular lenses; however, embodiments of the present invention extend to other types of lenses or lens systems, for example, contact lenses, corneal implants, corneal refractive procedures such as LASIK or PRK, and the like. In some embodiments, two or more different types of ophthalmic lenses may be included in a lens system for improving or enhance vision at different distances for different eyes. For example, one eye of a subject may contain an intraocular lens that reduces an aberration for distant vision, while the other eye contains a contact lens or receives a corneal procedure that reduces an aberration for intermediate or near vision.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term &#x201c;near vision&#x201d; means vision provided by an ophthalmic lens when placed within an eye of a subject, wherein a best optical performance or visual acuity occurs for objects located within a range of 25 cm to 40 cm from the subject, or at a distance at which the subject would generally place printed material for the purpose of reading. The distance range of 25 cm to 40 cm corresponds to a spectacle add power of 4 Diopters to 2.5 Diopters, respectively. As used herein, the term &#x201c;intermediate vision&#x201d; means vision provided by an ophthalmic lens when placed within the eye, wherein a best optical performance or visual acuity occurs for objects located within a range of 40 cm (a spectacle add power of 2.5 Diopters) to 2 meters (a spectacle add power of 0.5 Diopters) from the subject. As used herein, the term &#x201c;distant vision&#x201d; means vision provided by an ophthalmic lens when placed within the eye, wherein a best optical performance or visual acuity occurs for objects located at a distance of 6 meters or greater from the subject. As used herein, an intraocular lens add power is equal to a corresponding spectacle add power multiplied by 0.8.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;positive diffraction order&#x201d; means a diffraction order of a diffractive pattern, diffractive grating, or phase plate that is higher than a zeroth diffraction order of the diffractive pattern and has a positive optical power. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;zeroth diffraction order&#x201d; refers to light that is not diffracted by a diffractive pattern and thus has zero or substantially zero diffractive optical power. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;+1 diffraction order&#x201d; means the lowest positive diffraction order above the zeroth diffraction order that has a positive diffractive power. As used herein, other higher positive diffraction orders (e.g., &#x201c;+2 diffraction order&#x201d;, &#x201c;+3 diffraction order&#x201d;, etc.) have progressively higher positive diffractive power of the diffractive grating compared to the +1 diffraction order. As used herein, negative diffraction orders (e.g., &#x201c;&#x2212;1 diffraction order&#x201d;, &#x201c;&#x2212;2 diffraction order&#x201d;, etc.) are diffraction orders having progressively more negative diffractive power. As used herein, the phrases &#x201c;primary diffraction order&#x201d;, &#x201c;first diffraction order, &#x201c;secondary diffraction order&#x201d;, &#x201c;second diffraction order&#x201d;, and the like, refer to diffraction orders of a subject diffractive grating irrespective of which particular diffraction order they may correspond to. For example, a primary diffraction order or first diffraction order may correspond to a zeroth diffraction order, while a secondary diffraction order or second diffraction order may correspond to a +1 diffraction order. Alternatively, a primary or first diffraction order may correspond to a +1 diffraction order and a secondary or second diffraction order may correspond to a +2 diffraction order.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;lens shape&#x201d; means the overall figure of an optic, optical element, or lens that provides a base refractive power, and which is typically suitable for providing distant vision when used on or in an eye. The lens shape comprises an anterior surface shape or curvature of an anterior surface of the optic and a posterior surface shape or curvature of a posterior surface of the optic. The surface shape or curvature may be spherical or have an aspheric shape, for example to reduce or modify an aberration of the lens itself or of a typical or particular cornea or eye. One or more refractive or diffractive patterns or profiles may be imposed on, or added to, the lens shape to provide more complex optical characteristics, such as to provide multifocal or bifocal performance.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;optical power&#x201d; means the ability of an optic, optical element, or lens to cause light to converge or diverge from a focus (either real or virtual). The optical power may be a refractive power, a diffractive power, or some combination or addition of refractive and diffractive power. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;diffractive power&#x201d; means optical power of an optic, optical element, or lens attributable to a diffractive pattern or profile, for example, attributable to a diffractive pattern or profile that is imposed on or added to a base shape of an optic. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;refractive power&#x201d; means optical power of an optic, optical element, or lens attributable to a profile or shape of one of the surfaces of the optic. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; means plus or minus 0.25 Diopters when used in reference to an optical power (e.g., a refractive power, diffractive power, or combination thereof) or a difference in optical powers (e.g., an add power). As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;about equal&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately equal&#x201d; means within plus or minus 0.25 Diopters when used in reference to a comparison between two optical powers of differences in optical powers.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, the term &#x201c;light&#x201d; means electromagnetic radiation within the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;optical element&#x201d; includes any element that may be used to form an image from an object or to direct collimated light or light from a point source to a focal point, either real or virtual. The optical element may function based on refraction, reflection, and/or diffraction of light incident on the optical element.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;longitudinal chromatic aberration&#x201d; (LCA) means the range of distances along the optical axis of a diffractive and/or refractive lens, optic, or optical element over which collimated light from a broadband light source focuses for a given wavelength range. The LCA may be an absolute LCA expressed as an absolute range of distances (e.g., in millimeters, microns, or Diopters) or may be a ratio or percent of the range of distances compared to a nominal, average, or other representative focal length or power of the optical element. Unless otherwise indicated, the LCA is based on a wavelength range from 450 nanometers to 650 nanometers and, when expressed as a ratio or percentage, the representative focal length or power is that of the optical element at a wavelength of 550 nm. As used herein, a LCA is positive when the focal length (1/power) of the optical element increases with increasing wavelength over at least a portion of visible waveband of electromagnetic radiation. As used herein, a LCA is zero when the focal length or power of the optical element is the same at two or more distinct wavelengths of light that are separated by at least 50 nanometers. As used herein, an optical element is &#x201c;achromatic&#x201d; or is an &#x201c;achromat&#x201d; if it has a LCA that is zero. As used herein, &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; or &#x201c;about&#x201d; means within &#xb1;0.05 when used in reference to an amount of a relative longitudinal aberration (e.g., an amount of relative LCA or relative longitudinal spherical aberration).</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, advantages and operation of lens system <b>300</b> will be discussed. In the illustrated embodiment, first IOL <b>110</b> is disposed in the left eye of a subject, while second IOL <b>210</b> is disposed in the right eye of the same subject. It will be appreciated that IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> could alternatively be configured so that first IOL <b>110</b> is disposed in the right eye of the subject, while second IOL <b>210</b> is disposed in the left eye of the same subject. The IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be disposed within the capsular bag of a pseudophakic eye, or at a location outside the capsular, for example, between the capsular bag and the iris. Alternatively, one or both IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be phakic IOL and used in combination with the natural lens of the eye(s) to provide vision.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A collimated or nearly collimated wavefront from a distant object illuminates first and second eyes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. For example, a collimated or nearly collimated source may be provided by a point source at a distance 6 meters or more from the eye, or an automobile headlight at a distance of greater than 100 meters from the eye. Rays <b>118</b> from the collimated wavefront enter eye <b>100</b> and are split by first diffractive pattern <b>115</b> between first lower diffractive power P1.d.low and first higher diffractive power P1.d.high to form a first focus <b>120</b> and second focus <b>122</b>, respectively. IOL <b>110</b> is configured to provide distant vision by forming first focus <b>120</b> at or near retina <b>104</b> along optical axis OA<b>1</b> when collimated rays <b>118</b> enter eye <b>100</b>. By contrast, second focus <b>122</b> is located along OA<b>1</b> anterior to retina <b>104</b>, IOL <b>110</b> generally being configured so that second focus <b>122</b> provides near vision and/or intermediate vision (e.g., by configuring first higher optical power P1.high to be greater than first lower diffractive power P1.d.low by at least 1 Diopter or 2 Diopters, generally by at least 3 Diopters or 4 Diopters).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Rays <b>118</b>, from which first focus <b>120</b> is formed, are spread along optical axis OA<b>1</b>, the extent being shown by the dashed lines at the top of the figure. This spread of light may result in a reduction of visual acuity or the modulation transfer function (MTF) of eye <b>100</b> for objects and light sources located at relatively distant locations from eyes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. In the current embodiment, this spread along optical axis OA<b>1</b> is due to dispersion of light in a broadband or white light source by a longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) of the refractive portion of lens <b>110</b> and cornea <b>102</b>, whereby light at different wavelengths is focused to different locations along optical axis OA<b>1</b>. In general, the spread of light along optical axis OA<b>1</b> may also be caused by other optical effects such as spherical aberrations, astigmatism, or coma.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In contrast to first focus <b>120</b>, second focus <b>122</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to converge or focus to a single point or substantially a single point. In the current embodiment, the relatively sharp focus of second focus <b>122</b> is provided by configuring first diffractive pattern <b>115</b> to have a negative LCA that reduces, compensates, or eliminates a positive LCA of the refractive power of lens <b>110</b> and/or a positive LCA of cornea <b>110</b> or eye <b>100</b>. It will be understood that illustration of second focus <b>122</b> as a point is an idealization, and that in a real eye diffraction effects and some residual LCA or other longitudinal aberrations would typically still exist. However, the point representation of second focus <b>122</b> serves to illustrate that LCA for second focus <b>122</b> is much less that LCA for first focus <b>120</b> in this case. In the illustrated embodiment, lens <b>110</b> has a LCA for the second diffraction order that is negative and a LCA for the first diffraction order that is positive. Alternatively, lens <b>110</b> may have a LCA that is negative for both the first and second diffraction orders.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the collimated wavefront shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is replaced by a diverging wavefront that directs diverging rays <b>124</b> toward eye <b>100</b>. The diverging wavefront may be produced by a point source or a spatially extended source that is located relatively close to eyes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, for example, at a distance of 250 millimeters away from eyes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> a distance of 1 or 2 meters away from eyes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. In this case, second focus <b>122</b> is located at or near retina <b>104</b> along optical axis OA<b>1</b>, while first focus <b>120</b> is located posteriorly of retina <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">By way of summary, for distant objects or light sources (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>; distant vision), IOL <b>110</b> produces a first focus <b>120</b> that is located on or near retina <b>104</b> and an image that is at least somewhat blurred due to relatively large LCA. By contrast, for relatively close objects or light sources (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>; near or intermediate vision), IOL <b>110</b> moves second focus <b>122</b> on or near retina <b>104</b>, which provides a relatively sharp image that has a relatively small amount or no LCA. In this manner, first lens <b>110</b> provides distant vision that has chromatic aberrations that are the same or similar to those of a typical IOL without a diffractive pattern, while providing near and/or intermediate vision that has little or no LCA, resulting in improved or relatively high visual acuity and/or MTF performance (e.g., compared to a conventional refractive lens configured to provide the near and/or intermediate vision).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the functioning of IOL <b>210</b> in eye <b>200</b> will now be discussed. Rays <b>218</b>, which are from the same source as the collimated wavefront entering eye <b>100</b>, enter eye <b>200</b> and are split by second diffractive pattern <b>215</b> between first lower diffractive power P2.d.low and first higher diffractive power P2.d.high to form a first focus <b>220</b> and second focus <b>222</b>, respectively. IOL <b>210</b> is configured to provide distant vision by forming first focus <b>220</b> on or near retina <b>204</b> along optical axis OA<b>2</b> when collimated rays <b>218</b> enter eye <b>200</b>. By contrast, second focus <b>222</b> is located along OA<b>2</b> anterior to retina <b>104</b>, whereby IOL <b>210</b> is configured so that second focus <b>222</b> provides near vision and/or intermediate vision, as discussed above in regard to second focus <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In contrast to IOL <b>110</b>, both diffraction orders in the illustrated embodiment of second diffractive pattern <b>215</b> are advantageously positive, so that both the second lower diffractive power P2.d.low and the second higher diffractive power P2.d.high have non-zero values that are both positive. One benefit of both the second lower diffractive power P2.d.low and the second higher diffractive power P2.d.high being positive is that each of the two diffraction orders of second diffractive pattern <b>215</b> produces a negative LCA that reduces or compensate for a positive LCA of IOL <b>210</b> and/or cornea <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be appreciated that the second base refractive power P2.r is less than either first lower optical power P1.low or first higher optical power P1.high, since the first lower optical power P2.low is equal to the second base refractive power P2.r plus the positive diffractive power of the second lower diffractive power P2.d.low, while the first higher optical power P2.high is equal to the second base refractive power P2.r plus the positive diffractive power of second higher diffractive power P2.d.high. Thus, the second base refractive power P2.r does not produce either near vision optical power, intermediate vision optical power, or distant vision optical power. Rather, distant vision optical power is produced by the addition of the second lower diffractive power P2.d.low to the second base refractive power P2.r to provide distant vision, while near or intermediate vision optical power is produced by the addition of the second higher diffractive power P2.d.high to the second base refractive power P2.r to provide near or intermediate vision.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Other advantages of this configuration of IOL <b>210</b> and diffractive pattern <b>215</b> are illustrated with reference to the lower portions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. In contrast to focus <b>120</b> of IOL <b>110</b>, incoming rays <b>224</b> form a first focus <b>220</b> that converges or focuses to a single point or substantially a single point. The relatively sharp focus of first focus <b>220</b> is provided by configuring diffractive pattern <b>210</b> to have a negative LCA that reduces or eliminates a positive LCA of the refractive power of lens <b>210</b> and/or a positive LCA of the cornea <b>202</b> or eye <b>200</b>. Again, it will be understood that illustration of first focus <b>220</b> as a point is an idealization and that in a real eye at some residual LCA or other longitudinal aberrations would typically still exist. Thus, in contrast to first IOL <b>110</b>, second IOL <b>210</b> provides distant vision that has reduced or no LCA and that has improved or relatively high visual acuity and/or MTF performance.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, incoming rays <b>224</b>, which form second focus <b>222</b>, are spread along optical axis OA<b>2</b>, the extent being shown by the dashed lines at the bottom of the figure. This spread may be similar to that of first focus <b>120</b> of first IOL <b>110</b>. As will be seen, the spread of light in second focus <b>222</b> may result in a reduction of visual acuity or the MTF of second eye <b>200</b> for objects and light sources located at relatively near locations from eyes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. In the current embodiment, this spread of light by IOL <b>210</b> along optical axis OA<b>2</b> is due to an overcorrection of the longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) of the refractive portion of lens <b>210</b> and/or cornea <b>202</b>. In general, the spread of light along optical axis OA<b>2</b> may additionally or alternatively be due to other optical effects such as spherical aberrations, astigmatism, or coma.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the collimated wavefront shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is replaced by a diverging wavefront that directs diverging rays <b>224</b> toward eye <b>200</b>. Rays <b>224</b> are produced by the same source or object providing rays <b>124</b> to eye <b>100</b>. In this case, second focus <b>222</b> is located at retina <b>204</b> along optical axis OA<b>2</b>, while first focus <b>220</b> is located posteriorly of retina <b>204</b>. In contrast to focus <b>122</b> of first IOL <b>110</b>, the overcorrection by diffractive pattern <b>215</b> of the negative LCA of IOL <b>210</b> and/or cornea <b>202</b> spreads the light of incoming rays <b>224</b> along optical axis OA<b>2</b>, at least somewhat reducing visual acuity and/or MTF performance.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">By way of summary, for distant objects or light sources (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>; distant vision), IOL <b>210</b> produces a first focus <b>220</b> of eye <b>200</b> that provides a relatively sharp image that has a relatively small amount or no LCA. In this manner, second lens <b>210</b> provides distant vision that has improved visual acuity and/or MTF performance. However, for relatively close objects or light sources (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>; near or intermediate vision), IOL <b>210</b> produces a second focus <b>222</b> that is located on retina <b>204</b> and an image that is at least somewhat blurred due to relatively large LCA.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, the performance of IOL <b>210</b> is advantageously configured to complement the performance of IOL <b>120</b>. That is, IOL <b>210</b> produces a relatively sharp focus <b>220</b> on retina <b>204</b> of second eye <b>200</b> for collimated light or relatively distant objects or light sources. This results in distant vision for second eye <b>200</b> that has a relatively high visual acuity and/or MTF performance. This complements the performance of IOL <b>110</b>, which produces a relatively blurred focus <b>120</b> on retina <b>104</b> of first eye <b>100</b> for collimated light or relatively distant objects or light sources. This results in distant vision for first eye <b>100</b> that has a visual acuity and/or MTF performance that is somewhat lower than that for second eye <b>200</b>. Therefore, the combination of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> provides distant vision to a subject in which one eye has high visual acuity and/or MTF performance in one eye and somewhat lower visual acuity and/or MTF performance in the other eye.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In similar fashion, the performance of IOL <b>110</b> may be configured to complement the performance of IOL <b>220</b> for near or intermediate vision. That is, IOL <b>110</b> produces a relatively sharp focus <b>122</b> on retina <b>104</b> of first eye <b>100</b> for objects or light sources that are located relatively close to a subject. This results in near and/or intermediate vision for first eye <b>100</b> that has a relatively high visual acuity and/or MTF performance. This complements the performance of IOL <b>210</b>, which produces a relatively blurred focus <b>222</b> on retina <b>204</b> of second eye <b>200</b> for objects or light sources that are located relatively close to the subject. This results in near and/or intermediate vision for second eye <b>200</b> that has a visual acuity and/or MTF performance that is somewhat lower than that for first eye <b>100</b>. Therefore, the combination of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> provides near and/or intermediate vision to a subject in which one eye has high visual acuity and/or MTF performance in one eye and somewhat lower visual acuity and/or MTF performance in the other eye.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, the combination of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> provides images having reduced or no chromatic aberrations for both distant vision (eye <b>200</b>) and for near and/or intermediate vision (eye <b>100</b>), along with an associated increase in optical performance for both eyes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, for example, in terms of higher visual acuity and/or MTF performance.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In general, each IOL <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be configured with differing amount of other absolute or relative longitudinal aberrations that impact the aberrations of an incident wavefront (e.g., from the cornea of an eye) for one or more foci of each IOL. For example, the amount of a monochromatic aberration such as astigmatism or spherical aberration may be different for each IOL <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>. One or both IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be configured to provide a predetermined balance between LCA and one or more monochromatic aberrations by using aspheric shapes on one or both IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Exemplary structures of diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> for providing the above performance of the combined IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> will now be discussed. Diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> are generally multifocal diffractive patterns producing two or more foci in the visible waveband when used in combination with refractive components of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> and/or eye <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. Various methods of providing ophthalmic lenses with such diffractive patterns are known within the art including, but not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,641,934; 4,881,804; 4,995,715; 5,144,483; 5,229,797; 7,455,404; all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, diffractive pattern <b>115</b> of first IOL <b>110</b> comprises a plurality of echelettes <b>108</b> that are configured provide a first or primary diffraction order that is a zeroth diffraction order and a second or secondary diffraction order that is a +1 diffraction order. By contrast, diffractive pattern <b>215</b> of second IOL <b>220</b> comprises a plurality of echelettes <b>208</b> that are configured provide a first diffraction order that is a +1 diffraction order and a second diffraction order that is a +2 diffraction order. In certain embodiments, the +1 diffraction orders of each diffractive pattern <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> may be selected to reduce or compensate for chromatic dispersion or LCA produced by the materials and geometry of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> and/or eye (e.g., cornea). In such embodiments, the +1 diffraction orders each produce a negative LCA that is opposite in sign to a positive LCA of the refractive elements of the eye and/or IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>. The magnitude of the negative LCA of diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> may be controlled by appropriate selection of lens material and/or amount of diffractive power in the second and first diffraction orders of the diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b>, respectively (e.g., by selection of echelette spacing or area). In some embodiments, the lens material and/or amount of diffractive power of diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> are selected to be the same for both diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b>. Additionally, diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> may be selected to have the same amount of relative or absolute LCA. Alternatively, the lens material and/or amount of diffractive power of the diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> is different for each diffractive pattern <b>115</b>, <b>215</b>, for example, to provide a different amount of relative or absolute LCA for each diffractive pattern <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> and/or a different amount of chromatic aberration reduction for each IOL <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> and/or eye <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When first diffractive pattern <b>115</b> has first diffraction order that is a zeroth diffraction order and second diffractive pattern <b>215</b> has first diffraction order that is a +1 diffraction order, the first diffraction order of first diffractive pattern <b>115</b> has no or zero diffractive power and therefore does not affect the positive LCA of IOL <b>110</b> or eye <b>100</b>. Thus, the lower total power P1.low a total LCA that is positive. Meanwhile, the second diffraction order of second diffractive pattern <b>215</b> has diffractive power is greater than that of the first diffraction order of second diffractive pattern <b>215</b>. As a result, the second diffraction order of second diffractive pattern <b>215</b> has an LCA that is even more negative than the negative LCA of the first diffraction order. Thus, the negative LCA of the second diffraction order for IOL <b>210</b> may either further reduce the positive LCA of IOL <b>210</b> and/or eye <b>200</b>, if the negative LCA of the first diffraction order is relatively low.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Alternatively, the negative LCA of the second diffraction order for IOL <b>210</b> may be configured to overcompensate the positive LCA of IOL <b>210</b> and/or eye <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, the diffractive pattern <b>215</b> is configured so that the first diffraction order slightly under compensates for the positive LCA of IOL <b>210</b> and/or eye <b>200</b>, while the second diffraction order slightly overcompensates for the positive LCA of IOL <b>210</b> and/or eye <b>200</b>. The amount of overcompensation may be equal, or about equal, to the amount of under compensation. Alternatively, the amount of overcompensation and the amount of under compensation may be different, for example, the amount of over compensation of one IOL and/or eye differing less than 10 percent, less than 20 percent, or less than 50 percent from the amount of under compensation of the other IOL and/or eye.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, first diffractive pattern <b>115</b> has first diffraction order that is a +1 diffraction order and a second diffraction order that is a +2 diffraction order, while second diffractive pattern <b>215</b> has first diffraction order that is a +2 diffraction order and a second diffraction order that is a +3 diffraction order. In some embodiments, at least one of diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> may be a monofocal diffractive pattern, be configured as a high MOD diffractive pattern, comprise echelettes having varying step sizes, or have other diffractive configurations known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">While formation of diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> may be provided by forming echelettes onto a surface of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, other methods of realization are anticipated. For example, either or both diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> may be formed of a material having a refractive index and/or optical density that changing with radial distance from the lens optical axis. Such patterns may be produced holographically and/or by techniques such a UV curing a lens material in a manner that varies the exposure of UV with radius.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The amount of LCA of each IOL <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, or each diffraction order or focus <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, may be selected to provide a predetermined balance of image quality between the different eyes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and the different foci or images produced in each eye <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. For example, one or both IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be achromatic for one of the foci thereof, or may provide an achromatic system that includes eye <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> when IOL <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> is disposed within eye <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, at least one of the IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> has a negative LCA for one of its foci that changes a positive of the combination of the IOL and the eye or cornea. For example, at least one of IOLs <b>10</b>, <b>210</b> may have a predetermined LCA that is greater than a positive LCA of the cornea, whereby the positive LCA of a cornea or eye is at least partially reduced. The amount of correction or change provided by each IOL <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be the same or about the same. Alternatively, the correction or change may be different for each IOL <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> so that a desired balance between the foci <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>222</b> may be achieved. For example, first IOL <b>110</b> may have a LCA that reduces and under corrects for a positive LCA the cornea, while second IOL <b>210</b> has a LCA that overcorrects for a positive LCA of eye <b>200</b>. In other embodiments, the higher diffraction order of first diffractive pattern <b>115</b> may have a LCA that reduces a LCA of first lens shape <b>112</b> only and/or the lower diffraction order of second diffractive pattern <b>215</b> may have a LCA that reduces a LCA of second lens shape <b>212</b> only.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be configured so that the absolute or relative LCA is the same, or about the same, for the first diffraction order of IOL <b>210</b> (corresponding to P2.low) and the second diffraction order of IOL <b>110</b> (corresponding to P1.high). Additionally or alternatively, IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be configured so that focuses <b>120</b> and <b>222</b> have the same amount, or about the same amount, of absolute or relative LCA. For example, absolute or relative LCA may be within 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% of one another between the two IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, or between the two eyes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> when IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> are implanted.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In other embodiments, IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> have different amounts of absolute or relative LCA. For example, IOL <b>110</b> may be configured so that P1.high and/or focus <b>122</b> have an absolute or relative LCA that is zero, or about zero (e.g., a relative LCA that is less than 5%, less than 2%, or less than 1%). By contrast, IOL <b>210</b> may be configured in such embodiments so that P2.low and P2.high, and/or focus <b>220</b> and focus <b>222</b>, both have some LCA. For example, both P2.low and P2.high, and/or focus <b>220</b> and focus <b>222</b>, may have the same amount, or about the same amount (e.g., within 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%), of absolute or relative LCA. Such a balance of LCA for the two foci of IOL <b>210</b> may allow both to have some LCA, but less than if one of the focuses were configured to minimize LCA.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be configured as custom lenses for the eyes of a particular subject. Alternatively, the design of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, sets of such lens pairs, may be based on one or more eye models that take into account physical and optical characteristics for a given population, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,609,793 or 7,377,640, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. For example, a model cornea may be based on the Navarro eye model, as disclosed in &#x201c;Accommodation-dependent model of the human eye with aspherics&#x201d;, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A, Vol. 2, No. 8, pp. 1273-1281, which is herein incorporated in its entirety. In some embodiments, the cornea may be characterized by Equations (1) above, where the pupil has a 5 millimeter diameter, the model cornea has a radius of curvature of 7.553 millimeters and a conic constant of &#x2212;0.1034, and the eye has a refractive index 1.3375, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,609,793.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In certain embodiments, a mathematical representation of one or both IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> is included in or added to an eye model, a LCA of the model eye associated with first higher diffractive power P1.d.high is approximately zero, while a LCA of the model eye associated with first higher diffractive power P1.d.high is positive. In one embodiment, the model eye includes a model cornea having a 6 millimeter diameter and an anterior surface shape characterized by a conoid of rotation with a radius of 7.575 millimeters and a conic constant of &#x2212;0.14135. The model lens <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> has an anterior surface apex located 3.6 millimeters in a posterior direction from an apex of the model cornea. The model eye has an image plane located 26.42 millimeters in a posterior direction from the anterior surface apex and a refractive index of 1.3375 and a refractive index of 1.0 for the media anterior to model cornea.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In certain embodiments, the difference between the first and second diffraction orders of one or both IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> represents an add power for each IOL or eye. The add power may be at least 1 Diopter or 2 Diopters (e.g., to provide intermediate vision) or at least 3 Diopters or 4 Diopters (e.g., to provide near vision). The add power may be the same for both IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>. Alternatively, the add power of IOL <b>110</b> may be different than the add power for IOL <b>210</b>, for example, differing by at least 0.5 Diopters, at least 1 Diopter, or at least 2 Diopters.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Diffractive patterns <b>115</b>, <b>215</b> of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be configured so that the two diffraction orders of each IOL is the same or about the same (e.g., within 2% or 5%). Alternatively, one or both IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may have a different split between the two diffraction orders, for example, a 30%:70% split between the two diffraction orders of the IOL. For example, IOL <b>110</b> and/or IOL <b>210</b> may be configured so that more energy is in the focus or diffraction order that has the lower LCA (e.g., focus <b>122</b> and focus <b>220</b> in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). The diffraction efficiencies of the two diffraction orders of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be the same for both IOLs. Alternatively, IOL <b>210</b> may have a different efficiency split between its two diffraction orders than the split for the IOL <b>110</b>. The various diffraction efficiencies discussed in this paragraph may be for a broadband or white light source. Alternatively, the diffraction efficiencies may be for a more narrow frequency bandwidth (e.g., for green light) or at a single wavelength (e.g., at 550 nanometers).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be manufactured using molding and/or machining techniques known in the art. IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may generally be constructed of any of the various types of material known in the art. For example, IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be a foldable lens made of at least one of the materials commonly used for resiliently deformable or foldable optics, such as silicone polymeric materials, acrylic polymeric materials, hydrogel-forming polymeric materials (e.g., polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate, polyphosphazenes, polyurethanes, and mixtures thereof), or the like. Other advanced formulations of silicone, acrylic, or mixtures thereof are also anticipated. The lens material may be selected to have a relatively high refractive index, and thus provide a relatively thin optic, for example, having a center thickness in the range of about 150 microns to about 1000 microns, depending on the material and the optical power of the lens. At least portions of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, for example one or more haptics or fixation members thereof, may be constructed of a more rigid material including such polymeric materials as polypropylene, polymethylmethacrylate PMMA, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyimides, polyacrylates, 2-hydroxymethylmethacrylate, poly (vinylidene fluoride), polytetrafluoroethylene and the like; and metals such as stainless steel, platinum, titanium, tantalum, shape-memory alloys, e.g., nitinol, and the like. In some embodiments, the optic and haptic portions of IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> are each integrally formed of a single common material.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Once IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> are manufactured, they are preferably packaged in a sterile environment. IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be custom fabricated for a particular subject upon receipt of an order from a hospital, clinic, doctor's office, or other facility or individual. Upon receipt of an order, IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> are fabricated and shipped the manufacturer either separately or as a pair. In some embodiments, one or more backup lenses may also be shipped. In some embodiments, IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> are produced in a variety of optical powers for storage under appropriate conditions. In addition, lenses having different values of other parameters may be manufactured and store. For example, lenses having different amounts of cylinder power, spherical aberration, LCA, and/or the like may be manufactured. One or both IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be selected from a catalog or listing of stock lenses that cover standard spherical powers, cylinder powers, add powers, shape factors, monochromatic aberrations (e.g., spherical aberration), amounts of LCA, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be configured by a manufacturer, supplier, or distributor in the form of a kit or set of IOLs that may be ordered and/or shipped together for use in the two eyes of a subject. The lenses may packaged, stored, and/or shipped together in separate compartments of a single container for shipment. Alternatively, IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> are ordered as a set and shipped separately and/or at different times appropriate for scheduled surgery dates for each eye <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. For example, a practitioner may order and/or receive one of the IOLs <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> for implantation in one of the eyes of a subject, then later order and/or receive the other IOLs <b>210</b>, <b>110</b> for implantation in the other eye of the subject. Alternatively, the two IOLs are specified and/or ordered at the same time, but shipped and delivered separately as needed for implantation into each eye of the subject.</p>
