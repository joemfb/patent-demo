<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to an integrated circuit packaging system, and more particularly to a system having a grid-array.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Increased miniaturization of components, greater packaging density of integrated circuits (&#x201c;ICs&#x201d;), higher performance, and lower cost are ongoing goals of the computer industry. Semiconductor packaging structures continue to advance toward miniaturization, to increase the density of the components that are packaged therein while decreasing the sizes of the products that are made therefrom. This is in response to continually increasing demands on information and communication products for ever-reduced sizes, thicknesses, and costs, along with ever-increasing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">These increasing requirements for miniaturization are particularly noteworthy, for example, in portable information and communication devices such as cellular phones, hands-free cellular phone headsets, personal data assistants (&#x201c;PDA's&#x201d;), camcorders, notebook computers, and so forth. All of these devices continue to be made smaller and thinner to improve their portability. Accordingly, IC packages that are incorporated into these devices are required to be made smaller and thinner. The packaging configurations that house and protect IC require them to be made smaller and thinner as well.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, a need still remains for an integrated circuit packaging system with lead-frame grid-array mechanism providing low cost manufacturing, improved yields, reduction of integrated circuit packaging dimensions, and flexible stacking and integration configurations. In view of the ever-increasing need to save costs and improve efficiencies, it is more and more critical that answers be found to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a method of manufacture of an integrated circuit packaging system including: providing a lead-frame having an inner portion and a bottom cover directly on a bottom surface of the inner portion; forming an insulation cover directly on the lead-frame with the insulation cover having a connection opening; connecting an integrated circuit die to the lead-frame through the connection opening with the integrated circuit die over the insulation cover; forming a top encapsulation directly on the insulation cover; forming a routing layer having a conductive land directly on the bottom cover by shaping the lead-frame; and forming a bottom encapsulation directly on the conductive land with the bottom cover exposed from the bottom encapsulation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides an integrated circuit packaging system including: a routing layer having a conductive land directly on a bottom cover, with the routing layer formed by shaping a lead-frame; an insulation cover having a connection opening directly on the routing layer; an integrated circuit die connected to the routing layer through the connection opening and over the insulation cover; a top encapsulation directly on the insulation cover; and a bottom encapsulation directly on the conductive land with the bottom cover exposed from the bottom encapsulation.</p>

It is to be understood that other embodiments would be evident based on the present disclosure, and that system, process, or mechanical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the following description, numerous specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In order to avoid obscuring the present invention, some well-known circuits, system configurations, and process steps are not disclosed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Likewise, the drawings showing embodiments of the system are semi-diagrammatic and not to scale and, particularly, some of the dimensions are for the clarity of presentation and are shown greatly exaggerated in the drawing FIGs. The depictions in the FIGs. are arbitrary for the most part. Generally, the invention can be operated in any orientation. In addition, where multiple embodiments are disclosed and described having some features in common, for clarity and ease of illustration, description, and comprehension thereof, similar and like features one to another will ordinarily be described with like reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For expository purposes, the term &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a plane parallel to the plane of an active surface of the integrated circuit, regardless of its orientation. The term &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal as just defined. Terms, such as &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;side&#x201d; (as in &#x201c;sidewall&#x201d;), &#x201c;higher&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;over&#x201d;, and &#x201c;under&#x201d;, are defined with respect to the horizontal plane.

The external interconnect <b>128</b> can be formed directly on the bottom surface of the bottom cover <b>108</b> and horizontally between portions of the bottom encapsulation <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, therein is shown a flow chart of a method <b>1200</b> for manufacture of an integrated circuit packaging system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in a further embodiment of the present invention. The method <b>1200</b> includes: providing a lead-frame having an inner portion and a bottom cover directly on a bottom surface of the inner portion in a block <b>1202</b>; forming an insulation cover directly on the lead-frame with the insulation cover having a connection opening in a block <b>1204</b>; connecting an integrated circuit die to the lead-frame through the connection opening with the integrated circuit die over the insulation cover in a block <b>1206</b>; forming a top encapsulation directly on the insulation cover in a block <b>1208</b>; forming a routing layer having a conductive land directly on the bottom cover by shaping the lead-frame in a block <b>1210</b>; and forming a bottom encapsulation directly on the conductive land with the bottom cover exposed from the bottom encapsulation in a block <b>1212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Yet other important aspects of the embodiments include that it valuably supports and services the historical trend of reducing costs, simplifying systems, and increasing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">These and other valuable aspects of the embodiments consequently further the state of the technology to at least the next level.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Thus, it has been discovered that the integrated circuit packaging system of the present invention furnishes important and heretofore unknown and unavailable solutions, capabilities, and functional aspects for improving reliability in systems. The resulting processes and configurations are straightforward, cost-effective, uncomplicated, highly versatile, and effective, can be implemented by adapting known technologies, and are thus readily suited for efficiently and economically manufacturing integrated circuit packaging system.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">While the invention has been described in conjunction with a specific best mode, it is to be understood that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the aforegoing description.
