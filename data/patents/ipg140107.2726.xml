Both applications to which priority is claimed are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to compositions and methods for increasing bone strength in humans, particularly in a pediatric population, as well as to methods for improving the bone status in humans.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">All publications mentioned throughout this application are fully incorporated herein by reference, including all references cited therein.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">Bone Strength</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) is a crude expression of bone mineral concentration for a given area. It is limited to measuring one property of the bone only, Bone Mineral Density (BMD), also known as Bone Mass. DEXA does not take into account properties such as bone size or bone architecture. BMD is also influenced by body mass and growth.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Bone strength reflects several varied bone properties and provides a more complete picture of the bone's fragility, as compared to bone density.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Speed of Sound (SOS) is the most appropriate technology to measure bone strength. The propagation of sound waves in bone [Speed of Sound (SOS)] is determined by a number of factors including: mineral density, cortical thickness, elasticity and micro-architecture; thus, possibly providing a more complete picture of bone strength than by measurements of bone density alone.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Bone architecture is defined by the pattern of trabeculae and associated structures. Bone structure is also defined by what is known as &#x201c;Wolff's law&#x201d;, which determines that: &#x201c;Every change in the form and function of a bone, or in its function alone, is followed by certain definite changes in its internal architecture and secondary alterations in its external conformation&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">General</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Osteoporosis is defined by health care professionals today as &#x201c;a pediatric disease with geriatric consequences&#x201d;. This position has led to a strong focus on the development of healthy bones during infancy, childhood and adolescence, and is expected to contribute to a decrease in the incidence of osteoporosis among tomorrow's adults.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Researchers agree that an individual who does not reach optimal peak bone strength during childhood and adolescence may develop osteoporosis later in life, even if he does not suffer from accelerated bone loss. With many children at risk for less-than-optimal bone development because of limited physical activity, poor nutrition, or other risk factors, the measurement of bone in infancy and childhood is invaluable for ensuring that children develop optimal peak bone strength by adulthood. Special populations at risk for poor bone development include children born prematurely, obese children, and others, who can especially benefit from early assessment of bone development.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A large collection of clinical evidence shows that children's lifestyles can impact in their bone development and affect their skeletal health for years to come. Both lifestyle and nutrition have a significant impact on bone during skeletal development and growth. By the end of adolescence, an adult has accumulated most of the bone that will bring him to maximal peak bone strength. This peak determines the starting point for the decline of bone strength in late adulthood. Along with subsequent bone loss, it will determine a person's risk for osteoporosis later in life.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The impact of all of these lifestyle factors on bone health emphasizes the importance of positive factors improving bone strength or status during these crucial years of infancy and childhood. There is a growing trend among health professionals to urge children and adolescents to adopt an overall healthy lifestyle to help bone reach its maximal strength peak.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Preterm Infants</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Despite a steady decline in live birth rates in the United States over the past two decades, the incidence of preterm births (infants born at less than 37 weeks of gestation) is increasing. Metabolic bone disease is a relatively common event in preterm infants because the major period of bone mineral accretion ordinarily occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy, and it is difficult to reproduce in the extra-uterine environment.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Pre-term infants, or premature infants, are classified according to their weight as AGA (appropriate for gestational age) or SGA (small for gestational age). In addition, infants are also classified as LBW (low birth weight, born with less than 2.5 kg), VLBW (very low birth weight, born with less than 1.5 kg), or extreme VLBW (born with less than 1 kg).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Premature infants, especially small (for date) premature infants, are susceptible to metabolic bone disease of prematurity (NIBDP). The degree of osteopenia is inversely related to weight and gestational age. There are data showing that fractures are detected in 10-20% of newborns with a birth weight of less than 1,500 g and gestational age less than 34 weeks. Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants have an increased risk of osteopenia because of limited accretion of bone mass in utero and a greater need for bone nutrients. The prevalence of osteopenia is estimated to be 50% in infants born at extreme low birth (ELBW) with a high fracture rate. Severe morbidity during the neonatal period, development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic treatment with diuretics and steroids, prolonged immobility and the need for total parenteral nutrition increase the risk of impaired bone health. This emphasizes the essentiality and crucial importance of a high quality and bone strength improving formula.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The rising incidence of preterm births, coupled with their improved survival as a result of highly evolving technologies, has placed an increased need to develop more innovative and cost-effective treatment modalities for preterm infants during the neonatal period and in later life. Pre-term babies do not achieve the bone strength normally accreted during the third trimester of pregnancy, and are often born with low bone strength. Preterm infants, infants born to diabetic mothers, and infants exposed to corticosteroids are considered at risk for compromised bone health.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Most therapeutic efforts to prevent osteopenia of premature infants have focused on nutritional changes in the content of calcium and vitamin D. However, despite the use of mineral-enriched special formulas, these efforts have been only partially successful in improving preterm infants bone mineralization. Again, this may reflect the fact that efforts have focused on quantitative, rather than qualitative changes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although prevention of osteopenia is the ultimate goal, identifying infants with existing bone deficiencies would facilitate early interventions such as dietary modifications, exercise programs, or medications.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Bone strength follow up enables tracking of neonate bone. On basis of the results of such tracking, pediatricians/dietitians may recommend quality formulas or other foods for underdeveloped infants/toddlers/children in order to achieve or maintain stronger bones.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Children</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Most of the skeletal strength is accrued by the age of 18 years, making bone growth during childhood and adolescence a critical process. Moreover, failure to achieve peak bone strength during this critical period cannot be compensated for later in life. This results in an increased risk of osteopenia and fractures in the future. Pediatricians are in a critical position to affect bone development and prevent behaviors and habits that may lead in the long term to fracture risk and osteoporosis in their patients.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Bone strength and bone development are affected by some important factors that are also important for maintaining bone health. Calcium is one of the main mineral components of bone, supplying density and stiffness to the skeleton, and it is therefore an important factor in maintaining bone health. Recommendations suggest that children and adolescents should increase their calcium intake considerably above present average levels, to ensure adequate development of bone. The diet of many presumably healthy children contains inadequate amounts of dairy products, green vegetables, and other calcium-rich foods. Regular physical activity is another significant factor in bone development. Studies have shown that regular exercise helps strengthen bones. Exercise causes muscles to contract against bone, exerting force on the bone, and strengthening it. Current recommendations include moderate physical activity on most days of the week.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Various other factors are also known to be associated with a negative effect on bone status and the eventual development of osteoporosis. Among these factors are repeated dieting which leads to anorexia nervosa, smoking, alcohol consumption, and intake of carbonated soft drinks. Over-exercising that leads to amenorrhea, a frequent problem of some professional athletes, can also lower bone strength.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, children born pre-term or at a low birth weight have low bone strength values for at least six years after birth, indicating an increased risk for weak bones well after infancy. This is probably a result of the high prevalence of Osteopenia of Prematurity in premature infants.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Prior art publications suggested special compositions and methods for increasing bone density and peak bone mass. For example WO05/036978, incorporated herein by reference, discloses an enzymatically prepared fat base composition comprising specific vegetable-derived triglycerides, its preparation and various uses in the field of infant formulas, for preventing calcium and energy losses. US Patent Application No. 2004/0062820 discloses a method for increasing bone mineralization employing a fat blend that is low in palmitic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, as described above, in order to provide for the development of healthy bones and skeleton, it is important to ensure sufficient bone strength, not only adequate calcium absorption, bone density and bone mass. Bone density, peak bone mass and/or bone mineralization are not always in accord with bone strength, and changing any or all of the first (i.e., bone density, peak bone mass and/or bone mineralization) does not necessarily result in a corresponding change of the latter (bone strength). This notion has been supported by various authors, including Majumdar [Majumdar S. (2003) <i>Curr. Osteoporos. Rep. </i>1(3):105-9], Turner [Turner C. H. (2002) <i>Osteoporos. Int. </i>13(2): 97-104], and Gilsanz [Gilsanz V. (1998) <i>Eur. J. Radiol. </i>26(2):177-82]</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Amongst the studies reporting the absence of correlation between bone density and bone mineralization and bone strength, it may be cited for example the study by Takeda and colleagues [Takeda et al. (2004) <i>J. Amer. Coll. Nutr. </i>23(6):712S-714S] who described the relationship between bone strength and bone mineral concentration in obese rats and concluded that variation in elemental concentrations was not correlated with bone strength. Riggs and colleagues showed that in post-menopausal women, fluoride treatment increased bone mass and concomitantly increased skeletal fragility, particularly of non-vertebral bones [Riggs et al. (1990) <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>322(12):802-9]. Divittorio et al. reached a similar conclusion [Divittorio et al. (2006) <i>Pharmacotherapy </i>26(1):104-14]. In contrast, raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, significantly improved vertebral bone strength independent of bone mineral density [Allen et al. (2006) <i>Bone </i>39:1130-1135].</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Increase in bone strength reflects lower liability to fractures and other mechanical bone defects.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide compositions and methods for increasing and maintaining bone strength in newborns, infants, toddlers, children and adolescents.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In search for a composition for increasing bone strength and/or improving bone status and/or improving bone architecture in newborns, infants, toddlers, children, adolescents or adults, the present inventors have found that an edible composition of matter comprising a suitable fat source, particularly a triglyceride composition that is rich in palmitic acid residues, can achieve these required objects.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As understood herein, bone status refers to bone health, and it is dependent on the age and gender of the subject, but generally includes bone mineral content, bone mineral density, structural stiffness, bone microarchitecture, elasticity, cortical thickness, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Thus the composition of the invention (InFat, in the form of concentrate base or blend) is particularly useful in maintaining and/or increasing bone strength in humans suffering or prone to reduced bone strength.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Bone strength is usually defined as the amount of loading force required to cause the material to fail under a certain loading condition [Turner &#x26; Burr (1993) <i>Bone </i>14:595-608; Currey &#x26; Butler (1975) <i>J Bone Joint Surg Am </i>57:810-814]. A further definition of bone strength, as presented by Petit and colleagues, refers to strength as &#x201c;the load necessary to cause material yield&#x201d; [Petit et al. (2005) <i>J Musculoskelet Neuronal Interact </i>5(3):213-224]. This further definition takes into consideration the parameters evaluated in a test of bone material strength, when done with a small rod-shaped piece of bone that is gradually pulled on its ends causing it to stretch in length. Up to a certain point, the bone can sustain stress (force) without much strain (deformation). Thus, the bone may be stretched to a certain point and elastically return to its original length. This property is also defined as the elastic modulus (or Young's modulus), and it is also referred to as &#x201c;material stiffness&#x201d;. Beyond such point, damage occurs and the material begins to yield, so that when released it does not return completely to its original length. Ultimately, the material fails to yield, and at that point, fracture occurs [Petit (2005) id ibid.].</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Other bone strength parameters, particularly those obtained through measurements using ultrasound bone sonometer, particularly quantitative ultrasound, using axial transmission technology, are mineral density, elasticity, cortical thickness, and microstructure.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Biomechanical properties of vertebral body specimens may be analyzed in materials testing machines, which provide load and deformation values. These are usually only done in animal models, since it is necessary to collect the specimen (the bone) in order to perform the analysis. Load-deformation curves provide parameters for calculating strain at ultimate load, ultimate load, ultimate stiffness, and energy absorption at ultimate load. These parameters reflect the strength of the vertebral body.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Bone mass density is a measure of bone density. Bone density is the amount of bone tissue in a certain volume of bone. It can be measured using quantitative computed tomogram.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The inventors have shown, particularly with the results presented in Example 4, that a modified diet comprising an InFat blend described in the invention, induced increased bone strength in treated rats as compared to rats fed with a control diet.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, it was surprisingly found by the inventors that animals fed with a diet rich in palmitic acid at the sn-2 position showed increased bone strength, as measured through axial transmission technology.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, the composition of the invention is also particularly suitable for treatment of premature infants, especially small premature infants, that are susceptible to bone diseases and defects, for example metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP); infants with very low birth weight (VLBW), particularly those with increased risk of osteopenia; infants born at extreme low birth weight (ELBW) with a high fracture rate; neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia; neonates under chronic treatment with diuretics and steroids or exposed to steroids; infants born to diabetic mothers; and others. Subjects affected by any of these conditions are at risk of impaired bone strength.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Osteopenia is a decrease in bone mineral density that can be a precursor condition to osteoporosis. A diagnosis of osteopenia reflects bone mineral density (BMD) which is lower than normal peak BMD but not low enough to be classified as osteoporosis.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Thus, the present invention has as a goal to provide a method of increasing bone strength and/or increasing bone resistance to bending and/or improving bone architecture and/or maintaining bone status in a human, comprising administering to said human a composition comprising a fat source which is rich in palmitic acid, wherein said fat source is a triglyceride fat source in which the level of palmitic acid moieties at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone is at least 30% (w/w) of total palmitic acid, and the total palmitic acid content is 15-55% of the total fatty acids.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a particular embodiment of the invention the fat source comprises triglycerides with 15-55% C16:0 fatty acids of the total fatty acids.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Thus, the palmitic acid content of said fat source may be 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54% or 55% of the total fatty acids.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The essential features of the concentrate fat base composition are: (i) at least 30%, preferably 33%, more preferably 40% of the total palmitic acid residues at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone; (ii) at least 50%, preferably 70% of the fatty acid moieties at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of the glycerol backbone being unsaturated; (iii) at least 35%, preferably at least 40%, of said unsaturated fatty acid moieties at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions being oleic acid moieties; and (iv) at least 4%, preferably at least 6%, of said unsaturated fatty acid moieties at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions being linoleic acid moieties.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">More specifically, the fat source comprises 0-20% C12:0 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 5-15%; 0-15% C14:0 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 2-10%; 15-55% C16:0 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, of which over 30% are esterified at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone; 1-7% C18:0 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 2-5%; 25-75% C18:1 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 28-45%; 2-40% C18:2 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 5-20%; 0-8% C18:3 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 1-3%; other fatty acids are each present in levels of less than 8% of the total fatty acids, preferably less than 5%.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Specific fat sources are described in WO05/036987. These include fat concentrates (fat bases), fat blends, infant formulas comprising the concentrates/blends and other foods and food articles.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Of particular interest are fat sources which are based on synthetic oil (which can be produced both chemically and, preferably, enzymatically) which mimics the triglyceride composition of human breast milk fat. This oil has, preferably, a high level of palmitic acid at the sn-2 position of the triglycerides, and a high level of unsaturated fatty acids at sn-1 and sn-3 positions. This ingredient is also referred to herein as InFat&#x2122; (Enzymotec Ltd., Migdal HaEmeq, Israel), and it is defined in Table 1A.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">More specifically, the fat source used by the present invention may be a concentrate, particularly an enzymatically prepared fat base composition comprising a mixture of vegetable-derived triglycerides, with a total palmitic acid residues content of at most 38% of the total fatty acid residues; and with at least 60% of the fatty acid moieties at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone being palmitic acid residues.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">InFat is an advanced fat-base ingredient for the production of fat preparations used in infant nutrition and in infant formulas. It is an exclusive fat base, designed and manufactured with a specific triglyceride composition and structure, which has now been found to be efficient in increasing bone strength, particularly in infant populations prone to problems in bone development, as well as other such populations.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one preferred embodiment, said fat source comprises triglycerides with 0-20% C12:0 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 5-15%; 0-15% C14:0 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 2-10%; 15-55% C16:0 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, of which over 30% are esterified at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone; 1-7% C18:0 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 2-5%; 25-75% C18:1 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 28-45%; 2-40% C18:2 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 5-20%; 0-8% C18:3 fatty acids of the total fatty acids, preferably 1-3%; other fatty acids are each present in levels of less than 8% of the total fatty acids, preferably less than 5%.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Infant Formula Based on InFat</heading>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">An infant formula comprising InFat and additional oils and fats that mimic the human breast milk fat composition is prepared as follows: a selected formulation (e.g. one of those of Table 1A) is blended/mixed with a suitable vegetable oil, or a mixture of vegetable oils. The resulting lipid mixture is the lipid ingredient, which is mixed together with the other components (proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins and others) which result in the infant formula. The slurry is passed through a pressure homogenizer to get a stable emulsion. Homogenized product is then dried in a spray drier to obtain the final product. Other additives may be added to the dry powder to obtain final formulation, for example prebiotics and/or probiotics (like LGG, BB12, GOS/FOS).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The fat fraction produced by the blending of InFat with other oils and fats as described above is further blended with other nutrients such as proteins, minerals, vitamins and carbohydrates to yield a food product supplying the infant with the major nutrients also found in human milk. The nutrients and fats are homogenized using pressure homogenization and spray dried to yield a homogenous powder. The powder is further re-dispersed in water (approximately 9 g powder per 60 ml water) to yield a ready-to-feed formula. The fat content of the ready feed is approximately 3.5 g per 100 ml which corresponds to the fat content of human breast milk, which is in the range of 30-40 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">An exemplary fatty acid composition of a blend of InFat A (30%) with other oils and fats used to create an infant formula is presented in Table 2 and the details of ingredients and properties of the formula are defined in Table 3 below.</p>

Bone Strength Analysis
</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">A series of tests were performed to characterize the biomechanical properties of vertebral bodies in weanling rats.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The biomechanical characterization encompassed sensitive functional measurements of the mechanical competency of trabecular bone by uniaxial compression of the 5<sup>th </sup>lumbar vertebral body. All tests were performed with a universal testing machine (Zwick 1456, Ulm Germany) and custom fixtures specifically constructed for the study application. Bone stiffness was calculated from the linear portion of the load and displacement curve load-deformation curve of the tested bone.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Bone strength measurements were performed using Omnipath&#xae;, Sunlight Omnisense's axial transmission technology, also known as A-QUS (axial quantitative ultrasound).</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Bone Strength Measurements:</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Structural stiffness was significantly higher in the diet A group (high palmitic acid at sn-2 position diet) compared to diet B group (high palmitic acid at sn-1 and sn-3 position diet) (p=0.004) and significantly higher compared to diet C group (low palmitic oil diet) (p=0.038) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Normalization of stiffness to body mass and vertebrae height yielded significant differences as well between diet A and diet B or diet C (p=0.007, 0.031, respectively) in structural stiffness (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), which provided bone resistance to breaking. The elastic modulus, the ultimate stiffness per mm2, reflects the capability of the bone tissue to withstand bending.</p>

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The efficacy of InFat blend 7 (InFat 7) is investigated by a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month duration trial in term Chinese infants. The study demonstrates the effect of formula having high proportion of palmitate at the sn-2 position (the invention, InFat&#x2122; 7 from the InFat blends listed on Table 1B), compared to standard vegetable oil based formula, on bone strength outcomes in Chinese term infants.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The purpose of this study is to assess the bones strength in infants by measuring the speed of sound (SOS) of an ultrasound wave along the bone. The Speed of Sound (SOS) measurements are being done by quantitative ultrasound technology, Sunlight Omnisense&#xae; 7000P (Omnisense 7000P), a product of SunLight company (Sunlight Medical Inc., Somerset, N.J.). Omnisense 7000P is an ultrasound-based diagnostic device developed especially to assess bone strength in the pediatric population. Clinical studies have shown that the device is capable of detecting changes in bone strength that result from excess body weight and calcium consumption levels Sunlight has developed a number of reference databases for bone assessment of the pediatric population, based on gender and ethnic origin. The currently available databases are male and female databases which includes the Chinese population as well. Sunlight Medical's new pediatric Chinese reference database, collected in urban areas in China, has enhanced the applicability of Sunlight Omnisense&#xae; 7000P for pediatric Chinese populations worldwide.</p>

<p id="p-0136" num="0137">Eligible preterm infants born at gestational age of between 32-36 weeks are randomized to one of two groups: treatment group (formula A) or control (formula B). Both groups receive the formula for 3 months and their bone strength is measured at baseline and during the study after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.</p>

<p id="p-0137" num="0138">SOS measurements of midshaft tibia are taken using Sunlight Premiere&#xae; QUS.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0139">Bone SOS measured using quantitative ultrasound technology in preterm infants fed with formula A (the invention InFat 8 formula) are expected to be significantly higher than SOS measured in infants fed with formula B (control formula) following 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks fed. Bone SOS measurements of infants fed with formula A are likely to be increased with time in more significant pace compared to infants fed with formula B.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0140">The expected results will likely indicate that the addition of palmitic acid in sn-2 position to infant formula results in significantly higher whole body bone strength compare to formula B.</p>

<claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001">
<claim-text>1. A method of increasing bone strength in a human who is at risk of impaired bone strength, comprising administering to said human who is at risk of impaired bone strength a sufficient amount of a composition,
<claim-text>wherein the composition comprises a fat source,</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein said fat source comprises a triglyceride fat source,</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the triglyceride fat source has a total fatty acid moiety composition comprised of about 15-55% palmitic acid moieties out of the total fatty acids,</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the level of the total fatty acid palmitic acid moieties at a sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone is at least 30% (w/w) of the total fatty acid palmitic acid moieties, and</claim-text>
<claim-text>when the sufficient amount of the composition is administered to the human, the bone speed of sound measured using quantitative ultrasound technology is higher in the human to whom the composition was administered than in a human to whom a placebo was administered, wherein said human is a premature infants, an obese infant, and an infant born to diabetic mother, and an infant exposed to corticosteroids.</claim-text>
