<heading id="h-0002" level="1">REFERENCE TO SEQUENCE LISTING SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The sequence listing of the present application is submitted electronically via EFS-Web as an ASCII formatted sequence listing with a file name &#x201c;23031USPCT-SEQTXT-07SEPT2011.txt&#x201d;, creation date of Sep. 7, 2011 and a size of 1 KB. This sequence listing submitted via EFS-Web is part of the specification and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The majority of &#x201c;controlled-release&#x201d; drug delivery systems known in the prior art (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,145,410 to Sears which describes drug release from capsules which are enzymatically labile) are incapable of releasing drugs at intervals and concentrations which are in direct proportion to the amount of a molecular indicator (e.g., a metabolite) present in the human body. The delivery or release of drug in these prior art systems is thus not literally &#x201c;controlled,&#x201d; but simply a slow release which is independent of external or internal factors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">The treatment of diabetes mellitus with injectable insulin is a well-known and studied example where uncontrolled, slow release of insulin is undesirable. In fact, it is apparent that the simple replacement of the hormone is not sufficient to prevent the pathological sequelae associated with this disease. The development of these sequelae is believed to reflect an inability to provide exogenous insulin proportional to varying blood glucose concentrations experienced by the patient. To solve this problem several biological and bioengineering approaches to develop a more physiological insulin delivery system have been suggested (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 4,348,387 to Brownlee et al.; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,830,506, 5,902,603, and 6,410,053 to Taylor et al. and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004-0202719 to Zion et al.).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">In certain embodiments of the Zion system, multivalent glucose-binding molecules (e.g., lectins) are combined with a glycosylated polymer-insulin conjugate. The glycosylated polymer contains multiple saccharide binding groups and forms an insoluble cross-linked material in the presence of the glucose-binding molecule. The material releases the glycosylated polymer-insulin conjugate in response to increases in glucose concentration. In general, these systems have so far relied on high molecular weight carbohydrate structures that are based on natural carbohydrates such as dextran and glycogen. As discussed below, while these high molecular weight natural carbohydrates are useful, they present certain difficulties and there is therefore a need in the art for alternative conjugates with novel properties and functionalities.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0012">The present disclosure also provides methods of preparing conjugates of formulae (I), (II) and (III). For example, a terminal-group functionality, such as the acetal functionality as provided in formula (I), may be converted, through methods known to those skilled in the art, into an aldehyde functionality to provide a conjugate of formula (II). In certain embodiments, such a conjugate, so converted, can then be covalently conjugated to a drug (W) to form a terminally functionalized polymer-drug conjugate of formula (III). In certain embodiments, these terminally functionalized polymer-drug conjugates have greater retention of in vivo bioactivity versus more randomly functionalized polymer-drug conjugates (i.e., wherein the drug is randomly located at various positions along the polymer chain). The use of conjugates that include a detectable label (W) instead of a drug, e.g., in chemical sensors is also described.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">In one aspect, conjugates can be used to produce cross-linked materials that are capable of controllably releasing the conjugates in response to a target molecule (e.g., glucose). These materials are prepared by combining the conjugates with multivalent cross-linking agents that non-covalently bind the affinity ligands of the conjugates and thereby cross-link the conjugates to form the cross-linked material. The non-covalent bonds between the multivalent cross-linking agents and the affinity ligands are competitively dissociated in the presence of excess amounts of the target molecule.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0040">Agglutinated&#x2014;When two or more cells are &#x201c;agglutinated&#x201d; by a cross-linking agent as described herein, they are each physically associated with the cross-linking agent in a cell-agent-cell complex. Typically, agglutination only occurs once the cross-linking agent concentration reaches a threshold concentration. This concentration is referred to as the minimum agglutination concentration (MAC). The MAC for a given cross-linking agent is commonly measured using a spectrophotometric plate reader that can quantify changes in solution absorbance.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0041">Aptamer&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;aptamer&#x201d; refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide that binds specifically to a target molecule. In general, an aptamer is said to &#x201c;bind specifically&#x201d; to its target molecule if it associates at a detectable level with the target molecule and does not associate detectably with unrelated molecular entities (e.g., molecules which share no common structural features with the target molecule) under similar conditions. Specific association between a target molecule and an aptamer will typically be dependent upon the presence of a particular structural feature of the target molecule such as an epitope recognized by the aptamer. Generally, if an aptamer is specific for epitope A, the presence of a molecule containing epitope A or the presence of free unlabeled epitope A in a reaction containing both free labeled epitope A and the aptamer thereto, will reduce the amount of labeled epitope A that binds to the aptamer. In general, it is to be understood that specificity need not be absolute. Indeed, it is well known in the art that aptamers may cross-react with other epitopes in addition to the target epitope. Such cross-reactivity may be acceptable depending upon the application for which the aptamer is to be used. Thus the degree of specificity of an aptamer will depend on the context in which it is being used. It is also to be understood that specificity may be evaluated in the context of additional factors such as the affinity of the aptamer for the target molecule versus the affinity of the aptamer for non-target molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0042">Associated&#x2014;As used herein, two entities are physically &#x201c;associated&#x201d; with one another when they are bound by direct non-covalent interactions. Desirable non-covalent interactions include those of the type which occur between an immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific, for example, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic interactions, etc. The strength, or affinity of the physical association can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the interaction, wherein a smaller K<sub>d </sub>represents a greater affinity. For example, the association properties of a selected cross-linking agent and target molecule can be quantified using methods well known in the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0065">This application refers to a number of documents including patent and non-patent documents. The entirety of each of these documents is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0066">Whether used to deliver insulin or other drugs, the glycosylated polymer conjugates used in existing Zion conjugates present certain difficulties. Indeed, as a result of the high molecular weight (MW) of the glycosylated polymers, the conjugates have a much higher MW than the native drug. The conjugate is therefore absorbed into the systemic circulation more slowly. In addition, once in the circulation, the intrinsic bioactivity of the conjugate may be reduced and the rate of elimination may be slower. In US 2007/0099820 to Lancaster et al., we described one solution to this problem which involved attaching the drug to a polymer which is enzymatically degraded at the site of administration. While these enzymatically degradable conjugates behaved more like unconjugated insulin once released from the Zion system, we have found that they can suffer from two main disadvantages, namely: an inherent difficulty in manufacturing large quantities of pharmaceutical grade material and unwanted degradation due to enzyme activity in certain species even in the absence of target molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0067">For example, the exemplary glycogen-based conjugates of Lancaster were derived from animal and plant sources with broad and variable MW distributions and residual foreign protein content that required removal prior to insulin conjugation. Each separate lot and type of glycogen had to be subjected to MW fractionation to center and reduce the polydispersity of the distribution leading to substantially increased production costs and corresponding yield losses. Furthermore, each glycogen chain was modified with a variable number of sugar affinity ligands leading to not only a distribution of chain lengths but also a distribution of affinity ligands across those different chain lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0068">As described in the Examples, we also discovered rather unexpectedly that different animal species can possess unique levels of conjugate-degrading enzyme activity. In the case of rats, for example, the amylase activity was enough to render free glycogen conjugates bioactive but low enough to cause only marginal degradation of cross-linked conjugate. In pigs, however, the activity was high enough to cause rapid in vivo degradation of cross-linked conjugates thereby leading to large amounts of insulin release even in the absence of glucose. These results meant that the degradability of conjugates would likely need to be designed specifically for each animal species in order to balance conjugate bioactivity with unwanted degradation of cross-linked conjugates. From a pharmaceutical development perspective, regulatory agencies usually require safety data on the same formulation in two animal species prior to initiating human clinical trials. However, due to species differences in enzyme degradability the pharmacokinetics would likely differ in each of the two species.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0069">There is therefore a need in the art for conjugates that can function within a Zion system without being susceptible to enzymatic degradation. Ideally such conjugates would also be synthetic, well-characterized molecular entities that do not suffer from the production challenges encountered with polymeric natural products. We hypothesized that suitable non-biodegradable conjugates would need to be of low molecular weight in order to exhibit similar pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties to the unconjugated drug. However, we were also aware that previous studies with the Zion system (US 2004/0202719 and &#x201c;Glucose-responsive materials for self-regulated insulin delivery&#x201d;, Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, 2004) had shown that the ability of conjugates to self-assemble into insoluble cross-linked materials is eliminated as the molecular weight of conjugates is decreased. In order to overcome this problem we developed new families of higher affinity ligands than previously used for these types of applications. In parallel, we developed low molecular weight frameworks to which we chemically attached these ligands in a multivalent fashion with a range of linker arm lengths and chemistries. Unexpectedly, we have found that certain high affinity ligands when conjugated to appropriate frameworks that are low enough in molecular weight to preserve conjugate bioactivity are also capable of forming insoluble cross-linked materials when combined with suitable multivalent cross-linking agents. As discussed in more detail below, we have also shown that the resulting materials can be designed to release conjugates in the presence of varying concentrations of target molecule.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Conjugates</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0070">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides conjugates that include two or more separate affinity ligands covalently bound to a polymeric framework. In general, the affinity ligands are capable of competing with a target molecule for binding with a multivalent cross-linking agent. In certain embodiments, the conjugates have low polydispersity, e.g., less than 1.5, or less than 1.25. Depending on the end application, the conjugates may also include a drug and/or a detectable label. As discussed in more detail below, the affinity ligands, drug, and/or detectable label are covalently attached to the conjugate framework. In certain embodiments the conjugate framework (i.e., without including the affinity ligands, drug or detectable label) has a molecular weight of less than 10,000 Da, e.g., in the range of about 100 to about 10,000 Da. In certain embodiments, the conjugate framework has a molecular weight in the range of about 300 to about 5,000 Da. In certain embodiments, the conjugate framework has a molecular weight in the range of about 500 to about 2,500 Da. In certain embodiments, the conjugate framework has a molecular weight in the range of about 1,000 to 2,000 Da. In certain embodiments, the conjugate framework has a molecular weight in the range of about 200 to 1,000 Da. In certain embodiments, the conjugate framework has a molecular weight in the range of about 300 to 800 Da.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0107">The term &#x201c;cation&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an atom or group of atoms carrying a positive charge. The cation is paired with one or more anionic (e.g., carboxylate, C(&#x2550;O)O<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) groups to form a salt. Exemplary cations include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium and N<sup>+</sup>(C<sub>1-4</sub>alkyl)<sub>4 </sub>cationic species. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal cations include sodium cation, lithium cation, potassium cation, calcium cation, magnesium cation, and the like. Other cations include nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, lower alkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.

<p id="p-0110" num="0108">In general, the two or more affinity ligands within the conjugate are capable of competing with a target molecule for binding with a multivalent cross-linking agent (as described below). In certain embodiments, the relative affinity of the conjugate and target molecule for the cross-linking agent is in the range of 1:1 to 100:1 (where a relative affinity of 100:1 means that, in an equilibrium mixture of conjugate, target molecule and cross-linking agent (in pH 7 HEPES buffered saline at 37 C), the cross-linking agent will bind about equal molar amounts of conjugate and target molecule if the concentration of target molecule is 100&#xd7; the concentration of conjugate). In certain embodiments, the relative affinity is in the range of 1:1 to 50:1, 1:1 to 10:1, 1:1 to 5:1 or 1:1 to 2:1. The two or more separate affinity ligands may have the same or different chemical structures. For example, the two or more separate affinity ligands may have the same chemical structure as the target molecule (e.g., glucose) or may be a chemically related species of the target molecule. For example, when the target molecule is glucose the affinity ligands may include a saccharide. Thus, in certain embodiments, the affinity ligands are capable of competing with glucose for binding to a multivalent glucose binding molecule (e.g., without limitation Con A, mannan-binding lectin or MBL, etc.).</p>

<p id="p-0141" num="0146">In various embodiments, a conjugate may include an insulin molecule. By &#x201c;an insulin molecule&#x201d; we intend to encompass both wild-type and modified forms of insulin as long as they are bioactive (i.e., capable of causing a detectable reduction in glucose when administered in vivo). Wild-type insulin includes insulin from any species whether in purified, synthetic or recombinant form (e.g., human insulin, porcine insulin, bovine insulin, rabbit insulin, sheep insulin, etc.). A number of these are available commercially, e.g., from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.). A variety of modified forms of insulin are known in the art (e.g. see Crotty and Reynolds, <i>Pediatr. Emerg. Care. </i>23:903-905, 2007 and Gerich, <i>Am. J. Med. </i>113:308-16, 2002 and references cited therein). Modified forms of insulin may be chemically modified (e.g., by addition of a chemical moiety such as a PEG group or a fatty acyl chain as described below) and/or mutated (i.e., by addition, deletion or substitution of one or more amino acids). In general, a bioactive mutant form of insulin will typically differ from wild-type insulin by 1-10 (e.g., from 1-5 or 1-2) amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions. The wild-type sequence of human insulin (A-chain and B-chain) is shown below and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0150">In various embodiments, an insulin molecule of the present disclosure is mutated at the B28 and/or B29 positions of the B-peptide sequence. For example, insulin lispro (HUMALOG&#xae;) is a rapid acting insulin mutant in which the penultimate lysine and proline residues on the C-terminal end of the B-peptide have been reversed (Lys<sup>B28</sup>Pro<sup>B29</sup>-human insulin). This modification blocks the formation of insulin multimers. Insulin aspart (NOVOLOG&#xae;) is another rapid acting insulin mutant in which proline at position B28 has been substituted with aspartic acid (Asp<sup>B28</sup>-human insulin). This mutant also prevents the formation of multimers. In some embodiments, mutation at positions B28 and/or B29 is accompanied by one or more mutations elsewhere in the insulin polypeptide. For example, insulin glulisine (APIDRA&#xae;) is yet another rapid acting insulin mutant in which aspartic acid at position B3 has been replaced by a lysine residue and lysine at position B29 has been replaced with a glutamic acid residue (Lys<sup>B3</sup>Glu<sup>B29</sup>-human insulin).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0151">In various embodiments, an insulin molecule of the present disclosure has an isoelectric point that is shifted relative to human insulin. In some embodiments, the shift in isoelectric point is achieved by adding one or more arginine residues to the N-terminus of the insulin A-peptide and/or the C-terminus of the insulin B-peptide. Examples of such insulin polypeptides include Arg<sup>A0</sup>-human insulin, Arg<sup>B31</sup>Arg<sup>B32</sup>-human insulin, Gly<sup>A21</sup>Arg<sup>B31</sup>Arg<sup>B32</sup>-human insulin, Arg<sup>A0</sup>Arg<sup>B31</sup>Arg<sup>B32</sup>-human insulin, and Arg<sup>A0</sup>Gly<sup>A21</sup>Arg<sup>B31</sup>Arg<sup>B32</sup>-human insulin. By way of further example, insulin glargine (LANTUS&#xae;) is an exemplary long acting insulin mutant in which Asp<sup>A21 </sup>has been replaced by glycine, and two arginine residues have been added to the C-terminus of the B-peptide. The effect of these changes is to shift the isoelectric point, producing a solution that is completely soluble at pH 4. Thus, in some embodiments, an insulin molecule of the present disclosure comprises an A-peptide sequence wherein A21 is Gly and B-peptide sequence wherein B31 is Arg-Arg. It is to be understood that the present disclosure encompasses all single and multiple combinations of these mutations and any other mutations that are described herein (e.g., Gly<sup>A21</sup>-human insulin, Gly<sup>A21</sup>Arg<sup>B31</sup>-human insulin, Arg<sup>B31</sup>Arg<sup>B32</sup>-human insulin, Arg<sup>B31</sup>-human insulin).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0152">In various embodiments, an insulin molecule of the present disclosure is truncated. For example, in certain embodiments, a B-peptide sequence of an insulin polypeptide of the present disclosure is missing B1, B2, B3, B26, B27, B28, B29 and/or B30. In certain embodiments, combinations of residues are missing from the B-peptide sequence of an insulin polypeptide of the present disclosure. For example, the B-peptide sequence may be missing residues B(1-2), B(1-3), B(29-30), B(28-30), B(27-30) and/or B(26-30). In some embodiments, these deletions and/or truncations apply to any of the aforementioned insulin molecules (e.g., without limitation to produce des(B30)-insulin lispro, des(B30)-insulin aspart, des(B30)-insulin glulisine, des(B30)-insulin glargine, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0153">In some embodiments, an insulin molecule contains additional amino acid residues on the N- or C-terminus of the A or B-peptide sequences. In some embodiments, one or more amino acid residues are located at positions A0, A21, B0 and/or B31. In some embodiments, one or more amino acid residues are located at position A0. In some embodiments, one or more amino acid residues are located at position A21. In some embodiments, one or more amino acid residues are located at position B0. In some embodiments, one or more amino acid residues are located at position B31. In certain embodiments, an insulin molecule does not include any additional amino acid residues at positions A0, A21, B0 or B31.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0154">In certain embodiments, an insulin molecule of the present disclosure is mutated such that one or more amidated amino acids are replaced with acidic forms. For example, asparagine may be replaced with aspartic acid or glutamic acid. Likewise, glutamine may be replaced with aspartic acid or glutamic acid. In particular, Asn<sup>A18</sup>, Asn<sup>A21</sup>, or Asn<sup>B3</sup>, or any combination of those residues, may be replaced by aspartic acid or glutamic acid. Gln<sup>A15 </sup>or Gln<sup>B4</sup>, or both, may be replaced by aspartic acid or glutamic acid. In certain embodiments, an insulin molecule has aspartic acid at position A21 or aspartic acid at position B3, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0155">One skilled in the art will recognize that it is possible to mutate yet other amino acids in the insulin molecule while retaining biological activity. For example, without limitation, the following modifications are also widely accepted in the art: replacement of the histidine residue of position B10 with aspartic acid (His<sup>B10</sup>&#x2192;Asp<sup>B10</sup>); replacement of the phenylalanine residue at position B1 with aspartic acid (Phe<sup>B1</sup>&#x2192;Asp<sup>B1</sup>); replacement of the threonine residue at position B30 with alanine (Thr<sup>B30</sup>&#x2192;Ala<sup>B30</sup>); replacement of the tyrosine residue at position B26 with alanine (Tyr<sup>B26</sup>&#x2192;Ala<sup>B26</sup>); and replacement of the serine residue at position B9 with aspartic acid (Ser<sup>B9</sup>&#x2192;Asp<sup>B9</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0156">In various embodiments, an insulin molecule of the present disclosure has a protracted profile of action. Thus, in certain embodiments, an insulin molecule of the present disclosure may be acylated with a fatty acid. That is, an amide bond is formed between an amino group on the insulin molecule and the carboxylic acid group of the fatty acid. The amino group may be the alpha-amino group of an N-terminal amino acid of the insulin molecule, or may be the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue of the insulin molecule. An insulin molecule of the present disclosure may be acylated at one or more of the three amino groups that are present in wild-type insulin or may be acylated on lysine residue that has been introduced into the wild-type sequence. In certain embodiments, an insulin molecule may be acylated at position B1. In certain embodiments, an insulin molecule may be acylated at position B29. In certain embodiments, the fatty acid is selected from myristic acid (C14), pentadecylic acid (C15), palmitic acid (C16), heptadecylic acid (C17) and stearic acid (C18). For example, insulin detemir (LEVEMIR&#xae;) is a long acting insulin mutant in which Thr<sup>B30 </sup>has been deleted, and a C14 fatty acid chain (myristic acid) has been attached to Lys<sup>B29</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0157">In some embodiments, the N-terminus of the A-peptide, the N-terminus of the B-peptide, the epsilon-amino group of Lys at position B29 or any other available amino group in an insulin molecule of the present disclosure is covalently linked to a fatty acid moiety of general formula:</p>

<p id="p-0191" num="0196">In various embodiments, an insulin molecule of the present disclosure includes the three wild-type disulfide bridges (i.e., one between position 7 of the A-chain and position 7 of the B-chain, a second between position 20 of the A-chain and position 19 of the B-chain, and a third between positions 6 and 11 of the A-chain).</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0197">Methods for conjugating drugs including insulin molecules are described below. In certain embodiments, an insulin molecule is conjugated to the conjugate framework via the A1 amino acid residue. In certain embodiments the A1 amino acid residue is glycine. It is to be understood however, that the present disclosure is not limited to N-terminal conjugation and that in certain embodiments an insulin molecule may be conjugated via a non-terminal A-chain amino acid residue. In particular, the present disclosure encompasses conjugation via the epsilon-amine group of a lysine residue present at any position in the A-chain (wild-type or introduced by site-directed mutagenesis). It will be appreciated that different conjugation positions on the A-chain may lead to different reductions in insulin activity. In certain embodiments, an insulin molecule is conjugated to the conjugate framework via the B1 amino acid residue. In certain embodiments the B1 amino acid residue is phenylalanine. It is to be understood however, that the present disclosure is not limited to N-terminal conjugation and that in certain embodiments an insulin molecule may be conjugated via a non-terminal B-chain amino acid residue. In particular, the present disclosure encompasses conjugation via the epsilon-amine group of a lysine residue present at any position in the B-chain (wild-type or introduced by site-directed mutagenesis). For example, in certain embodiments an insulin molecule may be conjugated via the B29 lysine residue. In the case of insulin glulisine, conjugation to the conjugate framework via the B3 lysine residue may be employed. It will be appreciated that different conjugation positions on the B-chain may lead to different reductions in insulin activity.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0198">In various embodiments, a conjugate may include an insulin sensitizer (i.e., a drug which potentiates the action of insulin). Drugs which potentiate the effects of insulin include biguanides (e.g., metformin) and glitazones. The first glitazone drug was troglitazone which turned out to have severe side effects. Second generation glitazones include pioglitazone and rosiglitazone which are better tolerated although rosiglitazone has been associated with adverse cardiovascular events in certain trials.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0199">In various embodiments, a conjugate may include an insulin secretagogue (i.e., a drug which stimulates insulin secretion by beta cells of the pancreas). For example, in various embodiments, a conjugate may include a sulfonylurea. Sulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion by beta cells of the pancreas by sensitizing them to the action of glucose. Sulfonylureas can, moreover, inhibit glucagon secretion and sensitize target tissues to the action of insulin. First generation sulfonylureas include tolbutamide, chlorpropamide and carbutamide. Second generation sulfonylureas which are active at lower doses include glipizide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, glibornuride and glimepiride. In various embodiments, a conjugate may include a meglitinide. Suitable meglitinides include nateglinide, mitiglinide and repaglinide. Their hypoglycemic action is faster and shorter than that of sulfonylureas. Other insulin secretagogues include glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and GLP-1 analogs (i.e., a peptide with GLP-1 like bioactivity that differs from GLP-1 by 1-10 amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions and/or by a chemical modification). GLP-1 reduces food intake by inhibiting gastric emptying, increasing satiety through central actions and by suppressing glucagon release. GLP-1 lowers plasma glucose levels by increasing pancreas islet cell proliferation and increases insulin production following food consumption. GLP-1 may be chemically modified, e.g., by lipid conjugation as in liraglutide to extend its in vivo half-life. Yet other insulin secretagogues include exendin-4 and exendin-4 analogs (i.e., a peptide with exendin-4 like bioactivity that differs from exendin-4 by 1-10 amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions and/or by a chemical modification). Exendin-4, found in the venom of the Gila Monster, exhibits GLP-1 like bioactivity. It has a much longer half-life than GLP-1 and, unlike GLP-1, it can be truncated by 8 amino acid residues at its N-terminus without losing bioactivity. The N-terminal region of GLP-1 and exendin-4 are almost identical, a significant difference being the second amino acid residue, alanine in GLP-1 and glycine in exendin-4, which gives exendin-4 its resistance to in vivo digestion. Exendin-4 also has an extra 9 amino acid residues at its C-terminus as compared to GLP-1. Mann et al. <i>Biochem. Soc. Trans. </i>35:713-716, 2007 and Runge et al., <i>Biochemistry </i>46:5830-5840, 2007 describe a variety of GLP-1 and exendin-4 analogs which may be used in a conjugate of the present disclosure. The short half-life of GLP-1 results from enzymatic digestion by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). In certain embodiments, the effects of endogenous GLP-1 may be enhanced by administration of a DPP-IV inhibitor (e.g., vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin or alogliptin).</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0200">In various embodiments, a conjugate may include amylin or an amylin analog (i.e., a peptide with amylin like bioactivity that differs from amylin by 1-10 amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions and/or by a chemical modification). Amylin plays an important role in glucose regulation (e.g., see Edelman and Weyer, <i>Diabetes Technol. Ther. </i>4:175-189, 2002). Amylin is a neuroendocrine hormone that is co-secreted with insulin by the beta cells of the pancreas in response to food intake. While insulin works to regulate glucose disappearance from the bloodstream, amylin works to help regulate glucose appearance in the bloodstream from the stomach and liver. Pramlintide acetate (SYMLIN&#xae;) is an exemplary amylin analog. Since native human amylin is amyloidogenic, the strategy for designing pramlintide involved substituting certain residues with those from rat amylin, which is not amyloidogenic. In particular, proline residues are known to be structure-breaking residues, so these were directly grafted from the rat sequence into the human sequence. Glu-10 was also substituted with an asparagine.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0201">In various embodiments, a pre-conjugated drug may contain one or more reactive moieties (e.g., carboxyl or reactive ester, amine, hydroxyl, aldehyde, sulfhydryl, maleimidyl, alkynyl, azido, etc. moieties). As discussed below, these reactive moieties may, in certain embodiments, facilitate the conjugation process. Specific examples include peptidic drugs bearing alpha-terminal amine and/or epsilon-amine lysine groups. It will be appreciated that any of these reactive moieties may be artificially added to a known drug if not already present. For example, in the case of peptidic drugs a suitable amino acid (e.g., a lysine) may be added or substituted into the amino acid sequence. In addition, as discussed in more detail below, it will be appreciated that the conjugation process may be controlled by selectively blocking certain reactive moieties prior to conjugation.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0202">As discussed above, the present disclosure is not limited to any particular combination of drug and target molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0203">In various embodiments, a material of the present disclosure may be exploited to manipulate a natural feedback mechanism. For example, there are many natural feedback mechanisms (including most hormonal control mechanisms) in which the level of two endogenous substances are interrelated (e.g., glucose and insulin where the level of insulin increases as the level of glucose increases and the level of glucose decreases as the level of insulin increases). In such embodiments one of the endogenous substances can become the target molecule (e.g., glucose) while the other becomes the drug (e.g., insulin). Alternatively, in various embodiments, the drug can be a molecule that (a) has the same function as the other endogenous substance (e.g., reduces glucose levels), (b) stimulates the production of the other endogenous substance and/or (c) potentiates the effect(s) of the other endogenous substance. For example, when glucose is the target molecule one could use an insulin secretagogue or an insulin sensitizer instead of insulin as the drug.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0204">Other non-limiting examples of artificial feedback systems, include, a material which releases glucagon conjugates in response to high levels of insulin, a material which releases anticoagulant conjugates (e.g., coumarines such as warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon and phenindione, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors such as argatroban, lepirudin, bivalirudin, and dabigatran, etc.) in response to thrombosis indicators; a material which releases lactate-lowering drug conjugates (e.g., dichloroacetate) in response to increased lactate levels; etc.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0205">In various embodiments, a material can be designed to release conjugates which include a drug with a function that is not directly related to the target molecule. Without limitation, a material which responds to a target molecule which increases in concentration after a meal (e.g., glucose) may be used to provide long-term, mealtime dosing of a drug. Any drug which needs to be dosed periodically and/or with food would benefit from such a delivery system. As is well known in the art, many traditional drugs need to be administered with food or at mealtimes. For example, drugs which inhibit the absorption of fats (e.g., orlistat) are advantageously present during mealtime. Similarly, drugs which lower lipid levels, e.g., lovastatin, attorvastatin, or simvastatin, or triglyceride levels, e.g., gemfibrozil, may also be advantageously released at mealtimes.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0206">vii. W (Detectable Label)</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0207">As noted above, in various embodiments, W is a detectable label. For example, a detectable label may be included in order to detect the location of conjugates within an organism, tissue or cell; when the conjugates are used in a sensor; etc. It is to be understood that a conjugate can comprise any detectable label known in the art. A conjugate can comprise more than one copy of the same label and/or can comprise more than one type of label. In general, the label(s) used will depend on the end application and the method used for detection.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0208">The detectable label may be directly detectable or indirectly detectable, e.g., through combined action with one or more additional members of a signal producing system. Examples of directly detectable labels include radioactive, paramagnetic, fluorescent, light scattering, absorptive and colorimetric labels. Fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, &#x3b3;-phthalaldehyde, fluorescamine, etc. are all exemplary fluorescent labels. Chemiluminescent labels, i.e., labels that are capable of converting a secondary substrate to a chromogenic product are examples of indirectly detectable labels. For example, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, delta-V-steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenate, &#x3b1;-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, asparaginase, glucose oxidase, &#x3b2;-galactosidase, ribonuclease, urease, catalase, glucoamylase, acetylcholinesterase, luciferin, luciferase, aequorin and the like are all exemplary protein based chemiluminescent labels. Luminol, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium salt, oxalate ester, etc. are exemplary non-protein based chemiluminescent labels. Another non-limiting and commonly used example of an indirectly detectable label is an affinity ligand, i.e., a label with strong affinity for a secondary binding partner (e.g., an antibody or aptamer) which may itself be directly or indirectly detectable.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0209">In general, a detectable label may be visualized or detected in a variety of ways, with the particular manner of detection being chosen based on the particular detectable label, where representative detection means include, e.g., scintillation counting, autoradiography, measurement of paramagnetism, fluorescence measurement, light absorption measurement, measurement of light scattering and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0210">In various embodiments, a pre-conjugated label may contain one or more reactive moieties (e.g., carboxyl or reactive ester, amine, hydroxyl, aldehyde, sulfhydryl, maleimidyl, alkynyl, azido, etc. moieties). As discussed below, these reactive moieties may, in certain embodiments, facilitate the conjugation process. Specific examples include peptidic labels bearing alpha-terminal amine and/or epsilon-amine lysine groups. It will be appreciated that any of these reactive moieties may be artificially added to a known label if not already present. For example, in the case of peptidic labels a suitable amino acid (e.g., a lysine) may be added or substituted into the amino acid sequence. In addition, as discussed in more detail below, it will be appreciated that the conjugation process may be controlled by selectively blocking certain reactive moieties prior to conjugation.</p>

<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Multivalent Cross-Linking Agents</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0446">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides cross-linked materials that have been prepared by combining an inventive conjugate with a multivalent cross-linking agent. The following sections describe exemplary cross-linking agents that can be used for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0447">As discussed in more detail below and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the cross-linked material <b>10</b> is capable of controllably releasing the conjugates <b>20</b> in response to a target molecule (e.g., glucose). The materials are prepared by combining the conjugates <b>20</b> with multivalent cross-linking agents <b>30</b> that non-covalently bind the affinity ligands <b>40</b> of the conjugates <b>20</b> and thereby cross-link the conjugates <b>20</b> to form the cross-linked material <b>10</b>. The non-covalent bonds between the multivalent cross-linking agents <b>30</b> and the affinity ligands <b>40</b> are competitively dissociated in the presence of excess amounts of the target molecule (e.g., glucose).</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">1. Polypeptide Cross-Linking Agents</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0448">In various embodiments, the multivalent cross-linking agents may include a polypeptide. As discussed in more detail below, suitable multivalent polypeptides exist in nature (e.g., various lectins) but can also be constructed by linking multiple monovalent binding proteins, e.g., monovalent lectins, peptide aptamers, antibodies, cell membrane receptors, etc. Still other multivalent polypeptides may be constructed by chemically linking binding fragments of these proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0449">A variety of mono- and multivalent ligand-binding proteins are available commercially (e.g., from Sigma-Aldrich), including a number of lectins, folate-binding protein, thyroxine-binding globulin, lactoferrin, etc. DeWolf and Best provide a review of ligand-binding proteins including biotin-binding proteins, lipid-binding proteins/transporters of hydrophobic molecules, bacterial periplasmic binding proteins, lectins, serum albumins, immunoglobulins, inactivated enzymes, odorant-binding proteins, immunosuppressant-binding proteins, and phosphate- and sulfate-binding proteins (see De Wolfe and Best, <i>Pharm. Rev. </i>52: 207-236, 2000 and references cited therein). The cell membrane receptors for a variety of hormones have also been described in the art. In certain embodiments, mono- or multivalent binding proteins can be synthesized by rational computational design followed by site directed mutagenesis of existing ligand-binding proteins as described in Looger et al., <i>Nature </i>423:185-190, 2003. Exemplary protein fragments include truncated MBP (Eda et al., <i>Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., </i>62:1326-1331, 1998), truncated conglutinin (Eda et al., <i>Biochem. J. </i>316:43, 1996), truncated SP-D (Eda et al., <i>Biochem. J. </i>323:393, 1997), and the glucose/galactose binding protein of <i>E. Coli </i>(Salins et al., <i>Analytical Biochemistry </i>294:19-26, 2001).</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0450">a. Lectins</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0451">In certain embodiments, mono- or multivalent lectins may be included in a multivalent cross-linking agent. As discussed in more detail below, in certain embodiments, it may be advantageous to chemically modify the lectins. Lectins are particularly suitable for use in materials which are designed to respond to a saccharide target molecule (e.g., glucose). Lectins have been isolated from a variety of natural sources including seeds, roots, bark, fungi, bacteria, seaweed, sponges, mollusks, fish eggs, body fluids of invertebrates and lower vertebrates, and mammalian cell membranes (e.g., see <i>The Lectins: Properties, Functions, and Applications in Biology and Medicine</i>, Edited by Liener et al., Academic Press, 1986). A number of lectins have also been produced recombinantly (e.g., see Streicher and Sharon, <i>Methods Enzymol. </i>363:47-77, 2003 and US 2006/0247154). As noted above, lectins bind saccharides and polysaccharides with a high degree of specificity. For example, some lectins will bind only to mannose or glucose residues, while others only recognize galactose residues. Some lectins require that the particular residue be in a terminal position, while others bind to residues within a polysaccharide chain. Some lectins require specific anomeric structures and yet others recognize specific sugar sequences. The structures and properties of lectins have been extensively described in the literature. For recent reviews see <i>Lectins</i>, Edited by Sharon and L is, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003<i>; Handbook of Animal Lectins: Properties and Biomedical Applications</i>, Edited by Kilpatrick, Wiley, 2000; and <i>Handbook of Plant Lectins: Properties and Biomedical Applications</i>, Edited by Van Damme et al., Wiley, 1998. Exemplary lectins include calnexin, calreticulin, CD22, CD33, galectin (galactose-binding lectin), myelin-associated glycoprotein, N-acetylglucosamine receptor, selectin, sialoadhesin, aggrecan, asialoglycoprotein receptor, CD94, collectin (mannose-binding lectin), mannose receptor, versican, abrin, ricin, concanavalin A, phytohaemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen. In various embodiments, human analogs of plant lectins may be used. These include, without limitation, human mannan binding protein (MBP, also called mannan binding lectin, Sheriff et al., <i>Structural Biology, </i>1:789-794 (1994); Dumestre-Perard et al., <i>Molecular Immunology, </i>39:465-473 (2002)), human pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A, Allen, et al., <i>Infection and Immunity, </i>67:4563-4569 (1999)), human pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D, Persson et al., <i>The Journal of Biological Chemistry, </i>265:5755-5760 (1990)), CL-43 (a human serum protein), and conglutinin.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0452">b. Peptide Aptamers</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0453">In certain embodiments monovalent peptide aptamers may be included in a multivalent cross-linking agent. As is well known in the art, peptide aptamers consist of a variable ligand-binding peptide loop fused within a protein scaffold (e.g., see Hoppe-Seyler and Butz, <i>J. Mol. Med. </i>78:426-430, 2000 and Crawford et al., <i>Briefings in Functional Genomics and Proteomics </i>2:72-79, 2003). The variable loop typically includes between about 10 and 20 amino acids. A variety of scaffold proteins may be used. In general, the site of insertion is chosen such that the peptide loop disrupts a region of the scaffold that would otherwise mediate some wild-type function, e.g., the bacterial protein thioredoxin-A in which the variable loop is inserted within the reducing active site (a -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys- loop in the wild-type protein). Peptide aptamers with suitable affinity for the target molecule can be prepared and selected using any known method. For example, yeast two-hybrid libraries, yeast expression libraries, bacterial expression libraries and/or retroviral libraries for expression in mammalian cells may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0454">In various embodiments, peptide aptamers may be selected by affinity chromatography. According to such embodiments, peptide aptamers in a library are exposed to the target molecule and those that do not bind the target are removed. The bound peptide aptamers are then eluted and cloned for subsequent rounds of selection. A new library is then generated from one or more of these peptide aptamers (e.g., the peptide aptamer with the highest affinity for the target molecule in the first round of selection) and the stringency of the elution conditions is increased or modified to identify peptide aptamers with the desired binding affinity and/or specificity. In various embodiments, the selection process may involve steps in which the stringency of the elution conditions are gradually increased in order to select peptide aptamers with high affinity for the target molecule. In various embodiments, the selection process may involve steps in which the elution conditions are modified (e.g., by using a different affinity column) in order to select peptide aptamers with desired specificity for the target molecule. In various embodiments the selection process may generate a collection of sublibraries (or &#x201c;pools&#x201d;) each of which comprises peptide aptamers with similar affinities and/or specificities for the target molecule. In various embodiments the selection process may generate a single peptide aptamer sequence (or &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d;). It will be appreciated that any of these peptide aptamer sequences may be cloned for future recombinant expression.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0455">c. Generating Multivalent Cross-Linking Agents</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0456">Multivalent cross-linking agents can be generated by covalently or non-covalently linking two or more monovalent binding proteins into a single construct. Typically, two or more proteins (which may have the same or different sequences) may be linked directly to one another (e.g., via a coupling agent) or indirectly through a framework. In various embodiments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 or more proteins may be combined into a single construct. In various embodiments the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 or more proteins may have the same sequence. It will be appreciated that either one of these approaches may require the proteins to be chemically modified (e.g., to include pendant reactive groups) prior to coupling. It will also be appreciated that the multivalent cross-linking agents of the present disclosure are not limited to a particular coupling reaction or framework (e.g., they can be prepared using frameworks that include polymeric and/or non-polymeric structures). It will further be appreciated that the frameworks may be linear, branched, hyperbranched and/or a combination of these.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0457">In various embodiments the monovalent binding proteins are covalently linked to each other or a framework. In such embodiments, the proteins can be directly linked (i.e., with no intervening chemical groups) or indirectly linked through a spacer (e.g., a coupling agent or covalent chain that provides some physical separation between the proteins or between the proteins and framework). It is to be understood that proteins may be covalently linked to each other or a framework through any number of chemical linkages, including but not limited to amide, ester, ether, isourea, and imine bonds.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0458">In various embodiments, two or more monovalent binding proteins can be non-covalently linked to each other or to a framework. In certain embodiments, the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the non-covalent linkage in human serum is less than 1 pmol/L. For example, proteins may be non-covalently linked to each other or a framework via a non-covalent ligand-receptor pair as is well known in the art (e.g., without limitation a biotin-avidin based pair). In such an embodiment, one member of the ligand receptor-pair is covalently linked to one protein while the other member of the pair is covalently linked to the other protein or framework. When the proteins (or proteins and framework) are combined, the strong non-covalent interaction between the ligand and its receptor causes the proteins to become non-covalently linked to each other (or the framework). Typical ligand/receptor pairs include protein/co-factor and enzyme/substrate pairs. Besides the commonly used biotin/avidin pair, these include without limitation, biotin/streptavidin, digoxigenin/anti-digoxigenin, FK506/FK506-binding protein (FKBP), rapamycin/FKBP, cyclophilin/cyclosporin and glutathione/glutathione transferase pairs. Other suitable ligand/receptor pairs would be recognized by those skilled in the art, e.g., monoclonal antibodies paired with a epitope tag such as, without limitation, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), c-myc, FLAG&#xae; and further those described in Kessler pp. 105-152 of <i>Advances in Mutagenesis </i>Ed. by Kessler, Springer-Verlag, 1990<i>; Affinity Chromatography: Methods and Protocols </i>(<i>Methods in Molecular Biology</i>) Ed. by Pascal Baillon, Humana Press, 2000; and <i>Immobilized Affinity Ligand Techniques </i>by Hermanson et al., <i>Academic Press, </i>1992.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">2. Polynucleotide Cross-Linking Agents</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0459">In various embodiments, the multivalent cross-linking agents may include a polynucleotide aptamer. The polynucleotide aptamers bind the target molecule and are multivalent (i.e., capable of binding more than one target molecule). In general, monovalent aptamers will first be generated based on their binding properties for the target molecule. As is well known in the art, aptamers to a variety of target molecules can be generated through a process of in vitro selection. See Ellington and Szostak (1990) Nature 346:818; Tuerk and Gold (1990) Science 249:505; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,981. See also the glucose binding polynucleotide aptamers that are described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/162,092 filed on Mar. 20, 2009 and corresponding PCT application filed on Jan. 27, 2010, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0460">Typically, the process begins with the synthesis of a library consisting of randomly generated polynucleotide sequences of fixed length flanked by constant 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends that serve as primers. In certain embodiments (e.g., when optimizing an aptamer) one might start with a sequence which is known to bind the target molecule and generate a library which includes a collection of polynucleotides which exhibit a limited range of changes from the starting sequence (e.g., a random set of single mutations). The sequences in the library are then exposed to the target molecule and those that do not bind the target are removed (e.g., by affinity chromatography). The bound sequences are then eluted and amplified (e.g., by cloning and subsequent transcription or by PCR) to prepare for subsequent rounds of selection in which the stringency of the elution conditions is increased or modified to identify sequences with the desired binding affinity and/or specificity. Jarosch et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>34:86, 2006 have described methods that allow the process to be performed without the constant primer regions.</p>

In various embodiments the selection process may generate a single aptamer sequence (or &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d;). In various embodiments the aptamers are DNA based. In various embodiments the aptamers are RNA based. In various embodiments the aptamers are mixed RNA/DNA aptamers.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0464">Multivalent aptamers can be generated by covalently or non-covalently linking two or more of these monovalent aptamers into a single construct. Typically, two or more aptamers (which may have the same or different sequences) may be bound directly to one another (e.g., via a coupling agent) or indirectly through an independent framework. In various embodiments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 aptamers may be combined into a single construct. In various embodiments the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 aptamers may have the same sequence. It will be appreciated that either one of these approaches may require the aptamers to be chemically modified (e.g., to include pendant reactive groups) prior to coupling.

<p id="p-0460" num="0465">In various embodiments the aptamers are covalently bound to each other or a framework.

<p id="h-0020" num="0000">3. Chemical Modification of Cross-Linking Agents</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0467">In general, it is to be understood that any of the aforementioned multivalent cross-linking agents may be chemically modified, e.g., in order to mitigate undesirable properties.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0468">i. Non-Specific Modifications</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0469">In US 2007/0110811 we described the benefits of pegylating lectins in order to reduce their in vivo mitogenicity. Thus, in certain embodiments, a multivalent cross-linking agent may be covalently modified with one or more compounds. Without limitation this might involve reaction with an activated pegylation (PEG) agent (e.g., without limitation N-hydroxysuccinimide activated PEG, succinimidyl ester of PEG propionic acid, succinimidyl ester of PEG butanoic acid, succinimidyl ester of PEG alpha-methylbutanoate, etc.), another water soluble but non-PEG-containing polymer such as poly(vinyl alcohol), a reagent that can be easily coupled to lysines, e.g., through the use of carbodiimide reagents, a perfluorinated compound, etc. The skilled artisan will readily recognize other suitable compounds, e.g., by referring to the comprehensive review that can be found in <i>Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification </i>by Lundblad, CRC Press, 3<sup>rd </sup>Edition, 2004.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0470">In general, the compound(s) may be attached to a multivalent cross-linking agent (e.g., a mitogenic lectin) via any of a number of attachment methods known to those skilled in the art (e.g., via amine, carboxyl, hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups). The potential covalent linkages are similarly diverse (e.g., including amide bonds, carbamate bonds, ester bonds, thioether bonds, ether bonds, disulfide bonds, etc.). For example, PEGs are conveniently attached through amino or carboxyl groups. Amino acid residues with free amino groups include lysine residues and N-terminal amino acid residues. Amino acid residues with free carboxyl groups include aspartic acid residues, glutamic acid residues and C-terminal amino acid residues. Sulfhydryl groups found in cysteine residues may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the PEGs (or other compounds). In preferred embodiments PEGs are covalently attached to an amino group, especially the free amino group found in lysine residues.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0471">Numerous methods for directly attaching PEGs to proteins are described in Delgado et al., <i>Crit. Rev. Thera. Drug Carrier Sys. </i>9:249-304, 1992; Francis et al., <i>Intern. J. of Hematol. </i>68:1-18, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 4,002,531; U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,052; WO 95/06058; and WO 98/32466. One such method uses tresylated monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG), which is produced by reacting MPEG with tresylchloride (ClSO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>). Tresylated MPEG reacts with exposed amine groups on lectins. A skilled person will recognize that the invention is not limited to any specific pegylation agent (or compound) and will be able to identify other suitable compounds that are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0472">In certain embodiments PEGs (or other compounds) may be attached to a multivalent cross-linking agent via an intervening linker. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,460, discloses urethane linkers for connecting PEG to proteins. PEGs can be attached to a protein via a linker by reaction with compounds such as MPEG-succinimidylsuccinate, MPEG activated with 1,1&#x2032;-carbonyldiimidazole, MPEG-2,4,5-trichloropenylcarbonate, MPEG-p-nitrophenolcarbonate, and various MPEG-succinate derivatives. A number additional PEG derivatives and reaction chemistries for attaching PEG to proteins are described in WO 98/32466 and other patents, e.g., those that are assigned to Shearwater of Huntsville, Ala.; Nektar Therapeutics of San Carlos, Calif.; and/or Enzon Pharmaceuticals of Bridgewater, N.J. Catalogs can be obtained from these commercial PEG suppliers that describe a range of suitable PEG compounds and chemistries (e.g., see the Nektar Advanced PEGylation CATALOG 2004).</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0473">In various embodiments, N-terminal alpha-amine and/or epsilon-amino lysine groups of polypeptide based cross-linking agents may be succinylated and/or acetylated to change the charge distribution as well as any tertiary and quaternary effects associated with such changes. For example, polypeptides may be succinylated by reaction in a saturated sodium acetate buffer with an excess of succinic anhydride. Acetylation may be performed using the same procedure but with acetic anhydride as the modifying agent. For example, when the protein is concanavalin A, both acetylation and succinylation not only increase the density of negative charge within the polypeptide but also forces it to assemble as dimers instead of tetramers at physiological pH (e.g., see Agrawal et al., <i>Biochemistry. </i>7:4211-4218, 1968 and Gunther et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci</i>. (<i>USA</i>) 70:1012-1016, 1973). In addition, the in vivo safety profile of these resulting materials is greatly improved as a result.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0474">ii. Binding-Site Modifications</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0475">In certain embodiments, it may be advantageous to use an alternative and more specific method for modifying the multivalent cross-linking agents. In particular, we have found that certain low molecular weight conjugates of the present disclosure do not form insoluble drug delivery systems when combined with highly pegylated lectins made using high molecular weight PEG reagents (&#x3e;5 kDa). This poses a challenge since we have previously found that lower molecular weight PEGs (&#x3c;5 kDa) are much less effective in reducing lectin mitogenicity. Without wishing to be limited to any particular theory, it may be that the larger PEG groups are capable of sterically preventing binding and network formation with smaller low-valency conjugates, but not larger high-valency conjugates. In view of this, we devised an alternative non-PEG based solution for improving the safety profile of lectin-based cross-linking agents. We achieved this by specifically targeting and modifying the sugar binding site of lectins. For example, by reacting a mannose ligand directly into the concanavalin A binding site and purifying the unreacted material by high affinity ligand chromatography, we have been able to synthesize cross-linking agents with safety profiles that rival those of the best pegylated lectins. Without wishing to be limited to any particular theory, the functional concept appears to be that cell surfaces have a defined sugar affinity, valency, and ligand density, whereas the conjugates can have all of these properties adjusted by design. Thus, while incorporation of mannose into the lectin binding site completely abolishes the cross-linking agents ability to bind and thereby agglutinate or stimulate cells, incorporation of a higher density of higher affinity ligands on the conjugates still allows gel formation. In certain embodiments, incorporation of a small degree of pegylation with low MW, discrete PEG chains may be used to stabilize the multivalent lectins in solution under a variety of extreme storage conditions, yielding manufacturable, safe, functional cross-linking agents which complement the newly engineered conjugates.</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0476">In general, binding-site modified lectins will include at least one covalently linked affinity ligand which is capable of associating with one of the lectin binding sites. In various embodiments, the modified lectins may include just one covalently linked affinity ligand. In various embodiments, the lectins may include one covalently linked affinity ligand per binding site. Typically a multivalent lectin will include 2 or 4 binding sites (e.g., a dimer or tetramer of a monovalent lectin) but the present disclosure also encompasses lectins with 3, 5 or more binding sites. The present disclosure also encompasses lectins with more than one covalently linked affinity ligand per binding site. The present disclosure further encompasses materials which include a mixture of lectins that include different numbers of covalently linked affinity ligands and/or that include unmodified lectins.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0477">Any affinity ligand can be used for this purpose as long as it can associate with a binding site of the lectin once covalently linked to the lectin. Typically an affinity ligand will include a recognition element which interacts with the lectin binding site and a reactive linker which enables the affinity ligand to become covalently attached to the lectin once the recognition element is bound within the binding site.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0478">Recognition Element</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0479">Any recognition element that can compete for binding with the lectin's cognate ligand (e.g., glucose or mannose in the case of Con A) could be used in an affinity ligand of the present disclosure. In various embodiments, the recognition element includes a saccharide. In certain embodiments the saccharide is a natural saccharide (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, arabinose, ribose, xylose, etc.). In certain embodiments the saccharide is a modified saccharide (e.g., 2&#x2032;-fluororibose, 2&#x2032;-deoxyribose, hexose, etc.). In certain embodiments the recognition element is glucose, sucrose, maltose, mannose, derivatives of these (e.g., glucosamine, mannosamine, methylglucose, methylmannose, ethylglucose, ethylmannose, etc.) and/or higher order combinations of these (e.g., a bimannose, a linear and/or branched trimannose, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0480">Other exemplary saccharides will be recognized by those skilled in the art. In particular, it is to be understood that depending on the application any one of the saccharides that are described above in the context of the conjugate affinity ligands may be used (e.g., any one of the saccharides of formula IVa or IVb). In certain embodiments, the recognition element includes a monosaccharide. In certain embodiments, the recognition element includes a disaccharide. In certain embodiments, the recognition element includes a trisaccharide. In some embodiments, the recognition element includes a saccharide and one or more amine groups. In some embodiments, the recognition element is aminoethylglucose (AEG). In some embodiments, the recognition element is aminoethylmannose (AEM). In some embodiments, the recognition element is aminoethylbimannose (AEBM). In some embodiments, the recognition element is aminoethyltrimannose (AETM). In some embodiments, the recognition element is &#x3b2;-aminoethyl-N-acetylglucosamine (AEGA). In some embodiments, the recognition element is aminoethylfucose (AEF). In other embodiments, the recognition element is <smallcaps>D</smallcaps>-glucosamine (GA).</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0481">In various embodiments, the recognition element includes a polysaccharide, glycopeptide or glycolipid. In certain embodiments, the recognition element includes from 2-10 saccharide moieties, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 moieties. The terminal and/or internal residues of the polysaccharide, glycopeptide or glycolipid may be selected based on the saccharide specificity of the lectin in question (e.g., see Goldstein et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Acta </i>317:500-504, 1973 and L is et al., <i>Ann. Rev. Biochem. </i>55:35-67, 1986).</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0482">In various embodiments, the recognition element for a particular lectin/glucose combination may be selected empirically. According to such embodiments one or more recognition elements are screened based on their relative binding affinities for the lectin as compared to the target molecule glucose. In certain embodiments a library of saccharides and/or polysaccharides are screened in this manner. A suitable recognition element will exhibit a detectable level of competition with glucose but will not compete so strongly that it prevents all binding between the lectin and glucose. In certain embodiments, different recognition elements may be screened by testing the effect of different affinity ligands on relevant lectin properties (e.g., based on their ability to inhibit agglutination and/or their material set points as discussed in more detail below). In certain embodiments, the recognition element will be selected in view of the conjugate that the modified lectin is to be combined with (e.g., so that the conjugate is able to displace the recognition element from the binding site and thereby form a cross-linked material).</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0483">Reactive Linker</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0484">Affinity ligands may be covalently linked to a lectin in any manner. Most methods will involve allowing the recognition element of the ligand to associate with the lectin binding site and then causing the reactive linker to react with the lectin. In certain embodiments, the reactive linker may be attached to the recognition element at a position that does not substantially interfere with the binding properties of the recognition element. For example, when the recognition element is a saccharide or polysaccharide the linker may be attached to the C1, C2 or C6 position of a terminal saccharide. In certain embodiments, the linker may be attached to the C1 position. The C1 position is also referred to as the anomeric carbon and may be connected to the linker in the alpha or beta conformation. In certain embodiments, the linker is attached to the C1 position as the alpha anomer.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0485">In certain embodiments, photoactivatable linkers may be used. For example, Beppu et al., <i>J. Biochem. </i>78:1013-1019, 1975, described a method in which an arylazido linker was activated using ultraviolet light to form a covalent bond between concanavalin A and a sugar derivative within the binding site. Similar results were recorded by Fraser et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci</i>. (<i>USA</i>) 73:790-794, 1976 using succinylated concanavalin A. A similar procedure has also been employed using ricin and a photoactivatable derivative of galactose as described by Houston, <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>258:7208-7212, 1983. Photoactivatable derivatives of complex glycopeptide ligands having a higher affinity for lectins than saccharides and disaccharides have also been described by Baenziger et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>257:4421-4425, 1982. These derivatives were made by covalently linking a photoactivatable group to the peptide portion of the glycopeptide ligand.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0486">In general, any photoactivatable linker may be used such as an aryl, purine, pyrimidine, or alkyl azide, a diazo or diazirine group, a benzophenone, or a nitrobenzene. A more comprehensive list of potentially useful photoactivatable linkers may be found in Fleming, <i>Tetrahedron </i>51:12479-12520, 1995 as well as Brunner, <i>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </i>62:483-514, 1993 and Wong, S. S. <i>Chemistry of Protein Conjugation and Cross</i>-<i>Linking</i>, (1993), CRC Press, New York, pp. 168-194.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0487">In various embodiments, the photoactivatable linker may include a diazirine group. Photoactivation of diazirine groups with ultraviolet (UV) light creates reactive carbene intermediates that can form covalent bonds through addition reactions with any amino acid side chain or peptide backbone within range of the linker. Long wavelength UV-light (about 320-370 nm, preferably about 345 nm) is typically used to activate diazirines (e.g., see Suchanek et al., <i>Nat. Methods </i>2:261-268, 2005).</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0488">In various embodiments, the photoactivatable linker may include an aryl azide group. When aryl azide groups are exposed to UV-light they form nitrene groups that can initiate addition reactions with double bonds, insertion into C&#x2014;H and N&#x2014;H sites, or subsequent ring expansion to react as a nucleophile with primary amines. The latter reaction path predominates when primary amines are present in the sample. Without limitation, long wavelength UV-light (about 320-370 nm, preferably about 366 nm) is thought to be most efficient for substituted aryl azides (e.g., with hydroxy or nitro groups) while shorter wavelengths are thought to be most efficient for unsubstituted aryl azides. Suitable UV-light sources are available commercially, e.g., from Pierce, Rockford, Ill.</p>

<p id="p-0510" num="0515">In certain embodiments, non-photoactivatable linkers may be used. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,239,062 and 5,395,924 describe linkers that can be activated by changes in pH or temperature. Exemplary reactive linkers which are discussed include those which can be introduced into an affinity ligand using reagents such as cyanuric chloride (Kay et al., <i>Nature </i>216:514-515, 1967) or dichloro-S-triazines such as 2-amino-4,6-dichloro-S-triazine (Kay et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>198:276-285, 1970) and 2,4-dichloro-6-methoxy-S-triazine (Lang et al., <i>J. Chem. Soc. Perkin </i>1:2189-2194, 1977). Reactive linkers with NHS-esters or aldehydes that would react primarily with terminal amines such as those found on lysines could also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0511" num="0516">In various embodiments, the reactive linker for a particular lectin/target molecule combination may be selected empirically. According to such embodiments several affinity ligands with the same recognition element and different linkers (e.g., linkers of different lengths, linkers with different reactive groups, linkers with different hydrophobicity, etc.) are screened based on their effect on relevant lectin properties (e.g., based on their ability to inhibit agglutination and/or their material set points as discussed in more detail below).</p>
<p id="p-0512" num="0517">ii. Extent of Modification</p>
<p id="p-0513" num="0518">In general, the number of compounds that are attached to each multivalent cross-linking agent (i.e., the degree of substitution) will vary based on the nature of the cross-linking agent, the nature of the compound(s), the number of reaction sites available and the reaction conditions. For example, the subunits of concanavalin A each include twelve lysine residues. As a result, if concanavalin A is pegylated with a compound that reacts with lysine residues, then each subunit could be covalently linked to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 of these compounds. Conversely, each subunit of concanavalin A includes just one glucose binding site. Thus, if concanavalin A is reacted with a compound that reacts at the binding site, then each subunit will be covalently linked to just one such compound. Methods for determining the degree of substitution are discussed in Delgado et al., <i>Crit. Rev. Thera. Drug Carrier Sys. </i>9:249-304, 1992.</p>
<p id="p-0514" num="0519">In preferred embodiments, the chemical modification of a multivalent cross-linking agent may be optimized using a plurality of compounds and a plurality of reaction conditions (e.g., that vary the reagent concentrations, pH, temperature, etc.). Preferred compounds and reaction conditions are such that desirable properties (e.g., binding affinity) are not substantially impaired while undesirable properties (e.g., mitogenicity) are reduced as compared to an unmodified cross-linking agent. For example, an automated robotic handling device may be used to prepare a range of modified compositions with different compounds and different reaction conditions. Using routine orthogonal experimentation a skilled person can then screen the properties of the treated compositions. In certain embodiments further rounds of orthogonal optimization are performed around the preferred conditions to further refine the preferred compounds and reaction conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0515" num="0520">In one embodiment, optimal reaction conditions are identified by separating treated compositions by electrophoresis, preferably by denaturing SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. In various embodiments, compositions which include uniformly modified cross-linking agents are preferred. These preferred compositions will have weaker bands at the molecular weight of the unmodified cross-linking agent as measured by SDS-PAGE.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">4. Purification of Cross-Linking Agents</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0521">In various embodiments, multivalent cross-linking agents (whether they have been chemically modified or not) can be further processed in order to improve their properties. Thus, in certain embodiments, compositions comprising multivalent cross-linking agents can be purified in order to remove protein fragments, unmodified components, etc. In general, these separations can be achieved on the basis of physical properties (e.g., electrical charge; molecular weight; and/or size) and/or chemical properties (e.g., binding affinity for a target molecule). In certain embodiments optimal removal may be achieved by combining two or more methods that rely on these differential properties. In one embodiment, these separations are performed under denaturing conditions. For example, unmodified or partially modified cross-linking agents can be removed on the basis of their net charge by ion-exchange chromatography. Gel-filtration chromatography may be used to discriminate between differentially modified cross-linking agents on the basis of size. Affinity chromatography is another method that may be used to remove unmodified or partially modified cross-linking agents. This approach takes advantage of the differential binding affinity of modified, partially modified and unmodified cross-linking agents for a specific target molecule.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">5. Characterization of Cross-Linking Agents</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0522">In various embodiments, multivalent cross-linking agents (whether they have been chemically modified or not) can be screened or further tested in order to confirm or characterize their properties. Representative assays include: affinity assays, agglutination assays, T-cell mitogenicity assays, T-cell viability assays, antigenicity assays, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0523">Affinity assays may involve passing the multivalent cross-linking agent over an affinity column (e.g., a resin with the target molecule) and determining the elution conditions required to remove the cross-linking agent from the column. Equilibrium dialysis can also be used as is known in the art. Set point assays in which the cross-linking agent is combined with one or more conjugates of the present disclosure and then contacted with varying concentrations of the target molecule may also be used. Preferably the binding affinity of a chemically modified cross-linking agents is at least 75% that of the unmodified cross-linking agent. More preferably the binding affinity is at least 85% and yet more preferably at least 95% that of the unmodified cross-linking agent.</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="0524">In certain embodiments, an agglutination assay may be used to determine the minimum agglutinating concentration (MAC) of a multivalent cross-linking agent. For example, in certain embodiments the MAC may be determined using rabbit erythrocytes as described in US 2007/0110811. We have found that higher MAC values correlate strongly with reduced mitogenicity in the case of chemically modified lectins. In certain embodiments a modified cross-linking agent may have a MAC that is higher than the unmodified cross-linking agent. Preferably the MAC is 25 times that of the unmodified cross-linking agent. More preferably the MAC is 50 times and yet more preferably more than 100 times that of the unmodified cross-linking agent. In certain embodiments, the modified cross-linking agent exhibits a MAC with a 2% v/v suspension of formaldehyde-stabilized rabbit erythrocytes that is greater than 4 ug/ml. Preferably the MAC is greater than 6 ug/ml, more preferably greater than 10 ug/ml, even more preferably greater than 25 ug/ml.</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="0525">Mitogenicity assays will typically involve contacting the compositions of interest with a T-cell culture (e.g., PBMC cells) for a period of time and then measuring the level of T-cell proliferation. Various methods for measuring cell proliferation are known. In one embodiment the cell density may be measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. In another embodiment an indirect measure can obtained by detecting the reduction of MTT at 570 nm (e.g., see Ohno et al., <i>J. Immunol. Methods </i>145:199-203, 1991). In preferred embodiments, the level of cell proliferation is determined using a tritiated thymidine uptake assay. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other suitable methods may be used and that the invention is in no way limited to a specific proliferation assay. In certain embodiments, the T-cell mitogenicity of a modified cross-linking agent is less than 50% the T-cell mitogenicity of the unmodified cross-linking agent. The reduction in T-cell mitogenicity may be assessed by performing a comparative thymidine uptake assay across a range cross-linking agent concentrations, e.g., 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ug/ml. In preferred embodiments, the thymidine uptake assay is performed with samples that include approximately 500,000 PBMCs. The mitogenicity of the test composition (e.g., a modified composition) is then expressed as the % maximal unmodified mitogenicity. The % maximal unmodified mitogenicity is obtained by dividing the maximal CPM (counts per minute) value for the test composition over all measured concentrations by the maximal CPM value of the unmodified composition over all measured concentrations. Preferably, the test composition with reduced mitogenicity induces a level of T-cell proliferation that is at least 50% lower than the unmodified composition. More preferably, the level is at least 75% lower, even more preferably at least 90%, 95% or 99% lower.</p>
<p id="p-0521" num="0526">T-cell viability can be measured using a similar experiment by adding Trypan Blue to the T-cell culture and counting a representative sample of the cells (noting those that either take up the trypan or still exclude the trypan, i.e., those that become blue vs. those that do not). The % viability is then calculated by dividing the number of cells that exclude the trypan (alive, &#x201c;not blue&#x201d;) by the total number of cells counted (dead, &#x201c;blue,&#x201d; plus live, &#x201c;not blue&#x201d;). Those skilled in the art will recognize that other suitable methods may be used and that the invention is in no way limited to a specific viability assay. In certain embodiments, a modified cross-linking agent exhibits a percentage cell viability at 100 ug/ml that is greater than 10% when assayed using PBMCs at a concentration of 500,000 cells/ml. Preferably the percentage cell viability is greater than 25%, more preferably greater than 50%, even more preferably greater than 90%.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Cross-Linked Materials</p>
<p id="p-0522" num="0527">When conjugates and cross-linking agents are combined in the absence of the target molecule, a non-covalently cross-linked material is formed. In various embodiments, the material may be prepared in aqueous solution through self-assembly by mixing solutions of the cross-linking agent and conjugate. In various embodiments, particles of the material may be prepared by reverse emulsion. As described in more detail in US 2004/0202719, this can be achieved by adding the aforementioned aqueous solution to a mixture of a hydrophobic liquid and a surfactant and agitating the mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0523" num="0528">Once formed, the cross-linked material can be used for a variety of applications. When the material is placed in the presence of free target molecules these compete for the interactions between the cross-linking agents and the conjugates. Above a certain concentration of free target molecule, the level of competition becomes such that the material begins to degrade by releasing conjugates from the surface. In various embodiments, the extent and/or rate of release increases as the concentration of target molecule increases. As a result, conjugates are released from the material in a manner which is directly tied to the local concentration of the target molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0529">In general, the release properties of the material will depend on the nature of the cross-linking agents, conjugates, target molecule and conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, etc.). If the affinity of the cross-linking agents for the conjugates is much greater than for the target molecule then the material will only release conjugates at high concentrations of target molecule. As the relative affinity of the cross-linking agents for the conjugates is decreased, release of conjugates from the material will occur at lower target molecule concentrations. The release properties of the material can also be adjusted by varying the relative amounts of cross-linking agent to conjugate. Higher ratios of cross-linking agent to conjugate will lead to materials that release conjugates at higher target molecule concentrations. Lower ratios of cross-linking agent to conjugate will lead to materials that release conjugates at lower target molecule concentrations. It will be appreciated that, depending on the application, these variables will enable one to produce materials which respond to a wide variety of target molecule concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0530">In various embodiments, the cross-linked material is insoluble when placed in pH 7 HEPES buffered saline at 37 C (25 mM HEPES containing 150 mM NaCl and no target molecule). In various embodiments, the cross-linked material remains substantially insoluble when target molecule is added to the buffer up to a threshold concentration called the set point. Above the set point, the cross-linked material exhibits an increase in the extent and rate of release of conjugates. It will be appreciated that this transition may occur sharply or may occur gradually over a range of concentrations around the set point. In general, the desired set point and transition will depend on the nature of the target molecule and the intended application for the material. In particular, when the material is designed to respond to an increase in the level of a particular target molecule, the desired set point may be determined based on the normal physiological range of concentrations of the target molecule. It is to be understood that the amount of target molecule present in a patient may fluctuate based on internal and/or external factors. For example, in certain embodiments, the amount of target molecule may fluctuate naturally over time, e.g., in response to changes in hormonal cycles or metabolic pathways (lactate increasing during an endurance event, etc.). In certain embodiments, the fluctuations may result from an external event, e.g., an increase in glucose following a meal. In various embodiments, external factors may be used to artificially trigger the release of conjugates from a material of the present disclosure. For example, if release of conjugate is sensitive to an increase in glucose one could artificially release conjugates for a short period of time by ingesting a high-glucose drink.</p>
<p id="p-0526" num="0531">In various embodiments, the target molecule is glucose. The normal physiological range of glucose concentrations in humans is 60 to 200 mg/dL. Glucose concentrations below 60 mg/dL are considered hypoglycemic. Glucose concentrations above 200 mg/dL are considered hyperglycemic. In various embodiments, a material of the present disclosure may remain substantially insoluble when placed in pH 7 HEPES buffered saline containing 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 mg/dL glucose at 37 C for six hours using USP dissolution test method II at 50 rpm. In various embodiments, less than 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% of the material dissolves when placed in pH 7 HEPES buffered saline with 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 mg/dL glucose at 37 C for six hours using USP dissolution test method II at 50 rpm. In various embodiments, at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% of a material of the present disclosure dissolves when it is placed in pH 7 HEPES buffered saline with 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 or 400 mg/dL glucose at 37 C for six hours using USP dissolution test method II at 50 rpm.</p>

<p id="p-0529" num="0534">It will be appreciated that the desired set point for these and other target molecules can be readily determined for a variety of different applications. It will also be appreciated that the set point may need to be adjusted for certain patients (e.g., based on patient gender, patients with abnormally low or high levels of a target molecule, etc.) or applications (e.g., a drug delivery system designed to release on a more frequent basis may require a lower threshold concentration than a system designed to release less frequently).</p>
<p id="p-0530" num="0535">It will be appreciated that a material having a desired set point may be generated via routine experimentation using the materials and methods described herein. For example, the same cross-linking agent and conjugate can be combined to produce a series of materials with a gradually increasing ratio of cross-linking agent to conjugate (w/w). These materials will cover a spectrum of set points. Once a lead material with a suitable set point has been identified the process can be repeated with a finer resolution to yield an optimized material. Alternatively (or additionally) the same conjugate can be combined with a plurality of different cross-linking agents that have gradually increasing affinities for the conjugate. This will yield a plurality of materials with a spectrum of set points that can be further refined (e.g., by varying the w/w ratio of cross-linking agent to conjugate). Alternatively one could initiate the process by combining the same cross-linking agent with a plurality of different conjugates. In various embodiments, the conjugates may have varying affinities for the cross-linking agent (e.g., as a result of including different affinity ligands). In various embodiments, the conjugates may include the same affinity ligands but have different molecular weights (e.g., as a result of different conjugate frameworks).</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">Uses</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0536">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides methods of using the materials. In general, the materials can be used to controllably release conjugates in response to a target molecule. As discussed below, the material can be brought into contact with the target molecule in vitro or in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="0537">In various embodiments, a material may be used as a component of an in vitro or in vivo chemical sensor. This aspect is described below in the context of glucose sensors; however, it will be appreciated from the foregoing that other chemical sensors may be prepared by simply using a different target molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="0538">For example, in various embodiments, a material of the present disclosure may be used in glucose sensors that are based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET is based on the fact that when two different fluorophores are brought closely together this allows for energy transfer between the two fluorophores, resulting in a decrease in the fluorescence of one or both of the fluorophores, which is called fluorescence quenching (Ballerstadt et al., <i>Anal. Chim. Acta </i>345:203-212, 1997). In the absence of glucose, a mixture of a fluorescently labeled cross-linking agent and a fluorescently labeled conjugate will form an insoluble cross-linked material and the neighboring fluorophores will undergo FRET. In the presence of glucose, the average distance between the fluorescently labeled cross-linking agent and the fluorescently labeled conjugate will increase causing the level of FRET to decrease and thereby leading to an increase in the individual fluorescence signals. The level of fluorescence can thereby be directly correlated with the level of glucose.</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="0539">In other exemplary embodiments, materials of the present disclosure may be used in viscosity-based glucose sensors (e.g., see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,267,002; 6,477,891; and 6,938,463). Conjugates and cross-linking agents are again combined to form a cross-linked material. Addition of glucose to the material now causes a concentration dependent reduction in viscosity which can be measured (e.g., as a function of shear rate using a microviscometer set up in a cone-and-plate geometry). The viscosity of the sample can thereby be directly correlated with the level of glucose. It will be appreciated that these two exemplary glucose sensors do not require any drug to be present within the conjugates. It will also be appreciated that a viscosity-based sensor does not require a detectable label to be present within the conjugates.</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="0540">In various embodiments, a material may be used to controllably deliver a drug to a patient. The invention encompasses treating a disease or condition by administering a material of the present disclosure. Although the materials can be used to treat any patient (e.g., dogs, cats, cows, horses, sheep, pigs, mice, etc.), they are most preferably used in the treatment of humans. A material can be administered to a patient by any route. In general the most appropriate route of administration will depend upon a variety of factors including the nature of the disease or condition being treated, the nature of the drug, the nature of the target molecule, the condition of the patient, etc. In general, the present disclosure encompasses administration by oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, intraventricular, transdermal, rectal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, topical (as by powders, ointments, or drops), buccal, or as an oral or nasal spray or aerosol. General considerations in the formulation and manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions for these different routes may be found, for example, in <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, </i>19<sup>th </sup>ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1995.</p>
<p id="p-0536" num="0541">In various embodiments, the material may be administered subcutaneously, e.g., by injection. The material can be dissolved in a carrier for ease of delivery. For example, the carrier can be an aqueous solution including, but not limited to, sterile water, saline or buffered saline. In general, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug in the form of a conjugate will be administered. By a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; of a drug is meant a sufficient amount of the drug to treat the disease or condition at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, which involves a balancing of the efficacy and toxicity of the drug. In general, therapeutic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard pharmacological procedures in cell cultures or with experimental animals, e.g., by calculating the ED<sub>50 </sub>(the dose that is therapeutically effective in 50% of the treated subjects) and the LD<sub>50 </sub>(the dose that is lethal to 50% of treated subjects). The ED<sub>50</sub>/LD<sub>50 </sub>represents the therapeutic index of the drug. Although in general drugs having a large therapeutic index are preferred, as is well known in the art, a smaller therapeutic index may be acceptable in the case of a serious disease or condition, particularly in the absence of alternative therapeutic options. Ultimate selection of an appropriate range of doses for administration to humans is determined in the course of clinical trials.</p>
<p id="p-0537" num="0542">In various embodiments, the drug is insulin and the average daily dose of insulin is in the range of 10 to 200 U, e.g., 25 to 100 U (where 1 Unit of insulin is &#x2dc;0.04 mg). In certain embodiments, an amount of material with these insulin doses is administered on a daily basis. In certain embodiments, an amount of material with 5 to 10 times these insulin doses is administered on a weekly basis. In certain embodiments, an amount of material with 10 to 20 times these insulin doses is administered on a bi-weekly basis. In certain embodiments, an amount of material with 20 to 40 times these insulin doses is administered on a monthly basis. Those skilled in the art will be recognize that this same approach may be extrapolated to other approved drugs with known dose ranges, e.g., any of the approved insulin sensitizers and insulin secretagogues described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0543">It will be understood that the total daily usage of a drug for any given patient will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective amount for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disease or condition being treated; the activity of the specific drug employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration and rate of excretion of the specific drug employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific drug employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. In various embodiments, a material of the present disclosure may be administered on more than one occasion. For example, the present disclosure specifically encompasses methods in which a material is administered by subcutaneous injection to a patient on a continuous schedule (e.g., once a day, once every two days, once a week, once every two weeks, once a month, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0544">In certain embodiments, a material of the present disclosure may be used to treat hyperglycemia in a patient (e.g., a mammalian patient). In certain embodiments, the patient is diabetic. However, the present methods are not limited to treating diabetic patients. For example, in certain embodiments, a material may be used to treat hyperglycemia in a patient with an infection associated with impaired glycemic control. In certain embodiments, a material may be used to treat diabetes.</p>
<p id="p-0540" num="0545">In various embodiments, a material of the present disclosure may be administered to a patient who is receiving at least one additional therapy. In various embodiments, the at least one additional therapy is intended to treat the same disease or disorder as the administered material. In various embodiments, the at least one additional therapy is intended to treat a side-effect of the primary drug. The two or more therapies may be administered within the same, overlapping or non-overlapping timeframes as long as there is a period when the patient is receiving a benefit from both therapies. The two or more therapies may be administered on the same or different schedules as long as there is a period when the patient is receiving a benefit from both therapies. The two or more therapies may be administered within the same or different formulations as long as there is a period when the patient is receiving a benefit from both therapies. In certain embodiments, a single material of the present disclosure may include more than one drug for treating the same disease or disorder. In certain embodiments, two or more separate materials of the present disclosure may be administered (as a mixture or separately) that include different drugs for treating the same disease or disorder. In certain embodiments, an unconjugated secondary drug may be included in a material of the present disclosure (i.e., a drug which is simply mixed with the components of the material and not covalently bound to the cross-linked material). For example, in certain embodiments, any of these approaches may be used to administer more than one anti-diabetic drug to a subject. Certain exemplary embodiments of this approach are described in more detail below in the context of insulin-related therapies; however, it will be appreciated from the foregoing that other therapies will benefit from such combination approaches.</p>
<p id="p-0541" num="0546">Insulin sensitizers (e.g., biguanides such as metformin, glitazones) act by increasing a patient's response to a given amount of insulin. A patient receiving an insulin sensitizer will therefore require a lower dose of an insulin-based material of the present disclosure than an otherwise identical patient would. Thus, in certain embodiments, a material comprising insulin conjugates may be administered to a patient who is also being treated with an insulin sensitizer. In various embodiments, the material of the present disclosure may be administered at up to 75% of the normal dose required in the absence of the insulin sensitizer. In various embodiments, up to 50, 40, 30 or 20% of the normal dose may be administered.</p>
<p id="p-0542" num="0547">Insulin resistance is a disorder in which normal amounts of insulin are inadequate to produce a normal insulin response. For example, insulin-resistant patients may require high doses of insulin in order to overcome their resistance and provide a sufficient glucose-lowering effect. In these cases, insulin doses that would normally induce hypoglycemia in less resistant patients fail to even exert a glucose-lowering effect in highly resistant patients. Similarly, the materials of the present disclosure are only effective for this subclass of patients when they release high levels of insulin-conjugates in a suitable timeframe. In certain embodiments, the treatment of this subclass of patients may be facilitated by combining the two approaches. Thus in certain embodiments, a traditional insulin-based therapy is used to provide a baseline level of insulin and a material of the present invention is administered to provide a controlled supplement of insulin when needed by the patient. Thus, in certain embodiments, a material comprising insulin conjugates may be administered to a patient who is also being treated with insulin. In various embodiments, the insulin may be administered at up to 75% of the normal dose required in the absence of the material of the present disclosure. In various embodiments, up to 50, 40, 30 or 20% of the normal dose may be administered. It will be appreciated that this combination approach may also be used with insulin resistant patients who are receiving an insulin secretagogue (e.g., a sulfonylurea, GLP-1, exendin-4, etc.) and/or an insulin sensitizer (e.g., a biguanide such as metformin, a glitazone).</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Kits</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="0548">A significant manufacturing advantage of the low molecular weight conjugates described herein was only realized after developing and testing cross-linked materials that had been prepared from these conjugates and affinity ligand modified lectins. Due to the low molecular weight of both the conjugates and affinity ligand modified lectins, the materials were found to form into a dispersion of particles rather than a single large volume gel network. This is significant because while cross-linked materials prepared with high molecular weight polymers and pegylated lectins flow easily through a narrow gauge needle once loaded and pressure is applied with the syringe plunger they cannot be pulled into a syringe with a narrow gauge needle. This means that the finished product needs to be pre-loaded into individual syringes, a complicated, costly process that does not readily lend itself to large scale production. The dispersions, on the other hand, can be manufactured in large quantities and loaded under aseptic conditions into conventional multi-use drug vials. In addition, given the large increase in drug mass loading per conjugate and the ratio at which the conjugate and affinity ligand modified lectins form optimal networks, the effective drug loading is about an order of magnitude higher in these materials versus materials prepared with high molecular weight conjugates. For example, the high mass loadings of insulin allow us to prepare dispersions containing up to 100 U/ml of insulin equivalents, the standard concentration used in all commercial insulin formulations. The dispersions are easily resuspended by gentle rolling just like other insulin products. Also like those commercial formulations, the new dispersions may be easily pulled up through a 28 G needle to the appropriate dose volume and injected just like water without any significant pressure required. Incorporation of m-cresol as the bacteriostatic agent (used in all currently marketed insulin products) does not change the performance or safety profile and allows multiple daily usage for prolonged periods without any detectable microbial contamination. In various embodiments, the present disclosure therefore provides kits which include one or more vials with dispersion of cross-linked material.</p>
<p id="p-0544" num="0549">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides libraries of conjugates and/or cross-linking agents. These libraries may be particularly useful for generating materials with a desired set point. In various embodiments, a library may include a plurality of conjugates which produce different set points with the same cross-linking agent. In various embodiments, a library may further include one or more cross-linking agents which form cross-linked materials with conjugates in the library. When the library includes more than one such conjugates, the different conjugates may have different molecular weights, a different number of affinity ligands per conjugate molecule and/or different affinity ligands. In various embodiments, a library may include one or more of the conjugates that include more than one type of affinity ligand.</p>

<heading id="h-0027" level="1">I. Methods of Making Exemplary Conjugates</heading>
<p id="p-0545" num="0550">This first set of examples describes various methods for making exemplary conjugates. It is to be understood that these methods can be modified to produce other conjugates that fall within the scope of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0028" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0029" level="1">Synthesis Via Atom-Transfer Radical Polymerization</heading>
<p id="p-0546" num="0551"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a scheme for preparing conjugates via atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), also known as &#x201c;living&#x201d; free radical polymerization. As a living radical polymerization, it allows the reaction to be carried out in a controlled way, and can be used to obtain polymers with low polydispersity.</p>
<p id="p-0547" num="0552">In this case the polymerization initiator was synthesized separately and contained the acetal moiety. The initiator was used create polymer chains, each bearing a terminal acetal functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="0553">a. Synthesis of the Initiator (1)</p>
<p id="p-0549" num="0554">To a dichloromethane solution (30 ml) of 1-amino-3,3&#x2032;-diethoxypropane (1 ml), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (4 mg), triethylamine (1.1 ml), and bromoisobutyryl bromide (0.824 ml) was added dropwise 0&#xb0; C. The solution was stirred at that temperature for 15 min and was subsequently allowed to warm up to room temperature. It was then stirred for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane, and the organic layer was washed with acidified water, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, brine, and water, dried with magnesium sulfate. The solution was filtered and dichloromethane was removed via rotory evaporation to give a pale yellow oil. Proton NMR of the oil showed that the oil was very pure, and could be used for polymerization or, if preferred, purified further by silica chromatography.</p>
<p id="p-0550" num="0555">b. Synthesis of Ligand for a TRP Polymerization of t-Butyl Acrylate.</p>
<p id="p-0551" num="0556">5.4 g of 2-pyridine carboxaldehyde was added to 40 ml of diethyl ether, and the reaction mixture was cooled to 0&#xb0; C. under nitrogen. 5.0 ml of octylamine was added dropwise over 10 minutes to the stirring carboxaldehyde-ether mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 hours at 0&#xb0; C., after which time the ice bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature for an additional two hours. At this time 4.0 g of magnesium sulfate was added and stirred during the final two hours. The mixture was filtered to remove insolubles, and the resulting solution was placed in a rotary evaporator to remove the diethyl ether, giving a dark orange oil. This oil was distilled at 120&#xb0; C. under vacuum to give a clear yellow oil. This oil was found to be pure by <sup>1</sup>H NMR. This ligand was used in the subsequent ATRP synthesis.</p>

<p id="p-0553" num="0558">c. A TRP Polymerization of t-butyl acrylate to Give Acetal Terminally Functionalized poly(t-butyl acrylate) (3)</p>
<p id="p-0554" num="0559">2.5 ml of inhibitor-free t-butyl acrylate, 1.67 ml of inhibitor-free toluene, and 1.37 mmol of either N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2033;,N&#x2033;-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) or ATRP Ligand were added to a 100 ml Schlenk-type flask. These were degassed through three freeze/pump/thaw cycles after which time 198 mg of copper(I) bromide was added and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Next 331 ul of ATRP initiator (1) was added to the solution, and the solution was stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then the solution was placed into an oil bath at either 40 C, 60 C, or 90 C and heated for either 4 hours or overnight (14 hours) depending on the desired resulting degree of polymerization. The resulting polymer solution was filtered through a column of neutral alumina, and the toluene was removed by rotary evaporation to give a viscous polymer that was used in subsequent steps.</p>
<p id="p-0555" num="0560">d. Hydrolysis of t-butyl acrylate to Provide Polymer (4)</p>
<p id="p-0556" num="0561">The resulting viscous polymer was dissolved in 15 ml of dichloromethane and 12 ml of trifluoroacetic acid, and the mixture was stirred overnight to hydrolyze the t-butyl groups of the poly(t-butyl acrylate) to give a poly(acrylic acid) polymer. The next day, a gum like substance had precipitated in the flask&#x2014;the liquid/solid mixture was placed in a rotary evaporator to remove all of the solvents to yield the gummy solid acetal terminally functionalized-poly(acrylic acid). This solid was taken up in 40 ml of deionized water and bring the pH of the solution up to 8.0 by using 50% sodium hydroxide. The polymer was precipitated by adding 4 parts acetone to 1 part polymer solution. The resulting suspension was mixed vigorously and centrifuge at 4500&#xd7;g for 5 minutes. The first precipitation gave an oil, not a solid, and care was needed for decanting the acetone. The resulting oil was washed twice more with acetone to obtain a gummy solid and mechanical stirring. Remove trace acetone by washing/precipitating the polymer twice with diethyl ether. After the final decantation of diethyl ether, vacuum was used to remove residual solvent from the polymer to obtain a dry powder.</p>
<p id="p-0557" num="0562">e. Conversion of Terminal Acetal to Aldehyde</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="0563">During the hydrolysis step, it was found that the acetal spontaneously converted to the aldehyde functionality. This material could be used in the aldehyde form, or if desired, the aldehyde functionality could be converted back into the acetal functionality through methods known to those skilled in the art (e.g., suspending polymer in methanol or ethanol solution with an acid catalyst, heating at 40&#xb0; C. overnight). Often it was found to be desirable to keep the aldehyde functionality protected as the acetal during subsequent chemical transformations.</p>
<p id="p-0559" num="0564">f. Modification of Polymer with Saccharide to Provide Polymer (5)</p>

Under rapid stirring 76 ml of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide and 3.977 mg of insulin was added to a reaction flask such that the concentration of insulin will be 52.33 mg/ml. 3.978 ml of anhydrous triethylamine was immediately added. After waiting for the insulin solution to dissolve completely 1.591 ml of a 1.0M 2-(methanosulfonyl)ethyl succinimidyl carbonate solution in tetrahydrofuran solution was added to the reaction mixture. After 60 minutes of stirring at room temperature, 3.977 ml of a 1:20 dilution of ethanolamine in dimethylsulfoxide was added to quench the reaction. The protein product was recovered by adding the reaction mixture to 1600 ml of acetone, and precipitating the insulin by addition of a hydrochloric acid solution, and filtration to recover the solid precipitate. The precipitate was washed with acetone and the final powder was subjected to reverse phase chromatography to purify the desired MSC-Gly-A 1, MSC-Lys-B29-insulin isomer from the undesirable isomers. The desired product identify was confirmed through liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and Edman sequencing.</p>

<p id="p-0587" num="0592">This example describes the synthesis of an insulin-glycogen conjugate according to U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20070099820. Briefly, 1 gm of commercially available, unpurified oyster glycogen (Type II, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) is dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Solid CNBr is added to the resulting solution at a CNBr to glycogen mass ratio of 0.68 and the pH maintained constant at 10.7+/&#x2212;0.2 using 3N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution.

Insulin is then added to the solution at an insulin to glycogen mass ratio of 0.60 and the pH adjusted to 9.15 using solid sodium bicarbonate. The solution is stirred overnight, ultrafiltered exhaustively against deionized water using a 50 kDa MWCO polyethersulfone disc membrane filter (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.), and lyophilized.

As shown below, the insulin-dextran conjugates synthesized according to U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040202719 act relatively slowly after subcutaneous injection, because the high MW of the conjugate polymer significantly hinders the absorption rate into systemic circulation. Insulin-dextran was synthesized using a modified cyanogen bromide (CNBr) coupling reaction. Briefly, 500 mg of dextran (MW=70K, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water. 56 mg of solid CNBr was added to the resulting solution and the pH was maintained at 10.7&#xb1;0.2 using 5 N NaOH solution. After stirring for 15 min, another 56 mg of solid CNBr was added and the pH was maintained at 10.7&#xb1;0.2 while stirring for 45 minutes. 300 mg of recombinant human insulin (RHI) was then added to the solution, and the pH was adjusted to 9.15 using solid sodium bicarbonate. The solution was stirred overnight, ultrafiltered exhaustively against DI water using a 10K MWCO polyethersulfone disc membrane filter (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.), and lyophilized. The resulting powder was then purified from unconjugated insulin by high performance liquid chromatography (Waters, Milford, Mass.) using a 1 M acetic acid mobile phase over a Superdex&#x2122; 75 packed column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.).

After the electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in a solution of deionized water:methanol:glacial acetic acid in a volume ratio of 60:30:10 for 30 minutes, followed by two washes in deionized water. Finally, the gels were stained with 1&#xd7; Bio-Safe Coomassie Blue stain (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) for 60 minutes. The final gels were imaged with a light table and digital camera to record the stained gel. The stained protein bands were assayed for their molecular weights by comparing against the molecular weight and native Con A control samples. Proteolytic cleavage of the modified lectin samples during exposure to UV light would result in molecular weight bands that appear to be lower MW and distinctly different than those present in the native Con A control.</p>
<p id="p-0603" num="0608">b. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) Mass Spectroscopy</p>
<p id="p-0604" num="0609">Those skilled in the art will recognize that MALDI is a well known technique to characterize protein molecular weights. MALDI can be used to characterize the modified lectin subunit MW after conjugation to affinity ligand and subsequent affinity column purification to calculate the extent to which the modified lectin has been covalently linked with affinity ligand.</p>
<p id="p-0605" num="0610">Modified lectin samples at 2 mg/ml were added to BioSpin 30 columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) that had been previously equilibrated with deionized water. The BioSpin columns were centrifuged for 4 minutes at 1000&#xd7;g, and the resulting eluent contained modified lectin samples that had been substantially desalted. The samples were frozen on dry ice and shipped for MALDI analysis using a sinnapic acid matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0606" num="0611">c. Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC)</p>
<p id="p-0607" num="0612">AUC is a technique used to determine the native molecular weight of protein samples as they exist in solution. Since some lectins include quaternary structures (e.g., Con A) it is recommended to uncover the molecular mass of the modified lectins under non denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE, MALDI).</p>
<p id="p-0608" num="0613">Modified lectin samples and control native Con A (Type VI, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) samples were dissolved at concentrations of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 mg/ml in S28 buffer containing 12.5 mM &#x3b1;-D-mannose, and these were placed into the AUC cells of a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Biophysical Instrumentation Facility, MIT, Cambridge, Mass.) and successively spun at speeds of 10 k, 20 k, 30 k, or 40 k rpm and allowed to equilibrate for multiple hours at each speed. Each cell was scanned at a wavelength of 280 nm, and Winmatch software (Cambridge, Mass.) was used to determine the equilibration times of the AUC cells. The obtained AUC data for each sample was fit using a non-linear least squares analysis using WinNonLin v1.06 (UConn, Rockville, Conn.) to obtain the molecular weight of the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0609" num="0614">d. Isothermal Calorimetry</p>
<p id="p-0610" num="0615">Titration calorimetry was performed at 25 C in a Micro-Cal VP-ITC microcalorimeter (Biophysical Instrumentation Facility, MIT, Cambridge, Mass.), using a 1.4 ml (nominal) titration cell. Typical modified lectin concentrations were in the range of 4-6 mg/ml in PBS buffer (10 mM NaPO<sub>4 </sub>pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Samples were titrated with 10 mM methyl-&#x3b1;-D-mannopyranoside in the same buffer, using one 2 &#x3bc;l increment initially to clear the syringe, followed by 9 injections of 4 &#x3bc;l, increasing to 8 &#x3bc;l for the 11th to 30th addition, at intervals of 240 sec. Normally, the latter additions showed only background heat of dilution (i.e., total saturation). Data (eliminating the first data point, and any others that were obviously bad) were fit to the single site model using Origins software supplied with the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0611" num="0616">e. MAC Assay</p>
<p id="p-0612" num="0617">Various photoaffinity-labeled lectins such as those synthesized in Examples 12 and 14 and purified according to Example 15 were compared based on their ability to agglutinate cells possessing affinity ligands to which the unmodified lectin is capable of binding. The minimum agglutinating concentrations (MAC) of each composition was determined in V-well microtitre plates using a 2% v/v suspension of formaldehyde-stabilized rabbit erythrocytes according to the procedure of Crowley et al., <i>Methods. Enzymol. </i>83:368-373, 1982. Formaldehyde-treated rabbit erythrocytes, prepared by published procedures (Nowak et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>393:115-123, 1975), from rabbit blood obtained from University of Michigan Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, were available from previous studies. The MAC was defined as the lectin protein concentration (exclusive of attached chemical compounds) in the highest dilution showing visible agglutination.</p>
<p id="p-0613" num="0618">Briefly, an aqueous solution of a lectin composition was added to the wells of a 96-well plate using dilutions so that the lectin concentration spanned from about 0.1 to 1000 ug/ml. An aliquot of the formaldehyde-treated Rabbit erythrocytes was then pipetted into each well. At low lectin concentrations, there was insufficient lectin to form a network of crosslinked cells and the cells dropped to the bottom of the V-well forming what looks like a dark pin-point circle at the bottom of the plate when viewed from above. However, once the lectin concentration reached the minimum agglutination concentration (MAC), the lectin molecules began crosslinking the saccharide receptors on the erythrocyte surfaces, resulting in a network that cannot settle to the bottom of the V-well forming what looks like a large, opaque, diffuse circle when viewed from above. The lowest concentration that produces the large diffuse circle is the MAC value for a particular formulation.</p>

<heading id="h-0064" level="1">Mitogenicity Assay</heading>
<p id="p-0616" num="0621">This example describes an assay that may be used to characterize and thereby compare the T-cell mitogenicity of different modified lectin compositions. Modifications and alternatives to this typical assay will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), rather than highly purified T-cells, are used for this assay since T-cell activation by lectins generally requires the presence of non-T-cell populations collectively termed accessory cells (e.g., monocytes, dendritic cells). In a typical assay, PBMCs are isolated from the whole blood of three healthy human donors and plated out separately at about 100,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate. Triplicate serial dilutions of different lectin compositions (e.g., native and treated) starting at 1000 (or 100) ug/ml concentration are then added to the wells. The plates are incubated for three days at 37 C, at which time 0.8 uCi of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine is added to each well for an additional 18 hours. The degree of mitogenicity is then measured by <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine uptake by the proliferating PBMCs. In some cases, the mitogenicity of a novel lectin composition (e.g., a treated composition) is expressed as the % maximal native mitogenicity. The % maximal native mitogenicity is obtained by dividing the maximal CPM (counts per minute) value for the modified lectin composition over all measured concentrations by the maximal CPM value of the native lectin composition over all measured compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0617" num="0622">In previous studies we have found a strong correlation between the MAC value and % Con A maximal mitogenicity, i.e., a significant increase in MAC value leads to a significant decrease in mitogenic effect. Therefore, MAC value is used in the present disclosure as a surrogate for determining potential reductions in mitogenicity for a given chemical modification.</p>

<heading id="h-0067" level="1">Cross-Linked Materials Prepared from Modified Con A</heading>
<p id="p-0619" num="0624">An aqueous solution of the chemically modified Concanavalin A of Example 14 is added to an aqueous solution of the insulin conjugate of Example 1. At the proper ratio of both components, an insoluble cross-linked material is formed between the insulin conjugate and lectin. This cross-linked material could be formed over several lectin:polymer mass ratios, but often maximum formation will occur between 1:2 through 8:1 lectin:conjugate mass ratios. The cross-linked material dissolves when the concentration of glucose is increased. Addition of an aqueous buffer not containing a high concentration of a glucose causes no discernible dissolution of the cross-linked material.</p>

Prior to formulation injection, blood glucose values are measured via tail vein bleeding using a Precision Xtra glucometer (Abbott Laboratories, Alameda, Calif.) and approximately 100 ul of serum is obtained via tail vein bleeding to assay for background insulin levels. Food is removed from the rat cages during the duration of the study. Serum and blood glucose values are obtained at 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min post-injection. At 120 min after the injection, an intraperitoneal injection of a 38% w/v glucose solution is injected to provide a 4 g/kg dose after which serum and blood glucose values are obtained at 135 min, 150 min, 180 min, 210 min, 240 min, and 300 min. Serum insulin concentrations are subsequently measured with a commercially available ELISA kit (Human Insulin ELISA, Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden) using a standard curve generated from the pure insulin conjugate solution.</p>

<heading id="h-0071" level="1">Effect of Different Animal Sera on Glucose-Responsive Dissolution of Insulin-Glycogen Cross-Linked Materials and Correlation to Amylase Activity</heading>
<p id="p-0621" num="0626">This example describes the in vitro dissolution in various animal sera as a function of glucose concentration for glucose-responsive formulations synthesized using an insulin-glycogen based conjugate. The insulin-glycogen conjugate was synthesized according to the following procedure. First, 62.5 ml of a 10 mg/ml recombinant human insulin solution (RHI) in pH 8.2, 25 mM HEPES buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mass.) was adjusted to pH 9.0 and cooled on ice to produce the RHI stock solution. Separately, 0.312 ml of triethylamine (TEA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mass.) was dissolved in 3 ml of DI water to produce the TEA stock solution. Separately, 0.300 g of cyanodimethylamino pyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was dissolved in 1.2 ml of DMSO to produce the CDAP Stock solution. Separately, 100 mg of mannosamine-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was dissolved in 1.5 ml of a 100 mM pH 9 HEPES saline buffered saline solution and pH adjusted to 9.0 to produce the mannosamine stock solution. Separately, 2.0 g of oyster Type IX glycogen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was dissolved in 40 ml of a 100 mM pH 9 HEPES saline buffered saline solution after which the solution was clarified by filtration and cooled on an ice bath. Next, 1 ml of the CDAP stock solution was added to the glycogen solution and mixed for one minute after which 1 ml of the TEA solution was added and the pH of the resulting solution adjusted to 9.0. After an additional 1 minute of stirring, 62 ml of the RHI solution were added and the resulting solution stirred for five minutes followed by addition of 1.065 ml of the mannosamine solution. The solution was stirred overnight at room temperature, ultrafiltered exhaustively against deionized water using a 50 kDa MWCO polyethersulfone disc membrane filter (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.), and lyophilized. The resulting powder was then purified 3&#xd7; from unconjugated insulin by gel filtration HPLC (Waters, Milford, Mass.) using a 1 M acetic acid mobile phase over a Superdex&#x2122; 30 HiLoad 16/60 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) packed column. The insulin glycogen fraction was then lyophilized to obtain the conjugate as a pure white powder.</p>
<p id="p-0622" num="0627">Twenty-four glucose-responsive formulations were prepared using acetylated Con A (ACA) as the multivalent crosslinking agent in the following manner. 200 ul of a 25 mg/ml insulin-glycogen conjugate solution in pH 7.0 HEPES buffered saline was mixed with 200 ul of a 25 mg/ml chemically-modified, acetylated Con A (ACA) solution in pH 7.0 HEPES buffered saline and allowed to stand for 20 minutes. Next, each formulation was centrifuged and washed 5&#xd7; at room temperature with 400 ul of pH 7.0 HEPES buffered saline. After the last wash and centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the remaining insoluble material dispersed in 50 ul of 1&#xd7;PBS.</p>
<p id="p-0623" num="0628">The 24&#xd7;50 ul dispersions were added to a 96-well plate along with 50 ul of serum from a particular animal species containing a specific amount of glucose according to the following format:</p>

<p id="p-0625" num="0630">At the start of the experiment each well appeared white and opaque (as measured by a decrease in light transmission or increase in absorbance at 450 nm, A450). The 96-well plate was then incubated for 6 hours at 37 C after which the A450 value for each well was measured again. The % of the formulation remaining was calculated by dividing the A450 (final) by the A450 (initial) and multiplying by 100. If all the material had dissolved, the A450 value was close to zero indicating almost 0% remaining. Alternatively, if no material had dissolved, the A450 was close to the initial value indicating almost 100% remaining.</p>
<p id="p-0626" num="0631">The results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> show that the cross-linked materials constructed from insulin-glycogen conjugates dissolve in an ideal glucose responsive manner over the six hour study when incubated in buffered saline. However, the materials dissolve completely regardless of the glucose concentration when incubated in pig serum. Rat serum maintains some glucose responsiveness but dissolves significantly over six hours even in the absence of glucose. Over 20% of the material incubated in human serum still dissolves in the absence of glucose.</p>
<p id="p-0627" num="0632">These differences were correlated to each species' intrinsic amylase and glucosidase digestion activity by first developing a microplate assay that takes advantage of the production of a colorimetric signal from oligosaccharides connected through linear &#x3b1;-1,4 glycosidic bonds like glycogen. To investigate amylase activity, 4-Nitrophenyl &#x3b1;-D-penta-(1&#x2192;4)-glucopyranoside (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was used, and 4-Nitrophenyl &#x3b1;-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was used to investigate glucosidase activity. For each assay, serum from a particular species was diluted by increasing amounts with 1&#xd7;PBS and a known concentration of colorimetric reporter was spiked into the solution after which the absorbance signal at 405 nm (A405) was measured as a function of time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>illustrate the A405 production due to enzyme activity in each of the different species of serum tested for amylase and glucosidase activity, respectively. Here we see that at a 1:8 dilution of serum in PBS, porcine serum exhibits approximately 17&#xd7; the digestion activity of rat serum. Furthermore, there appears to be almost no activity whatsoever in the human serum tested under these conditions. Therefore, the differences in the material dissolution profiles in each species' serum appear to be directly correlated with the ability for that species' serum to digest the underlying glycogen conjugate. Taken together, these results provided the impetus for designing bioactive conjugates such as the ones described in this disclosure to circumvent the glycogen-digestion limitation but still form glucose-responsive materials.</p>
