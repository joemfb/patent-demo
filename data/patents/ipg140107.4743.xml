<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This is directed to a cable structure for use with an electronic device. The cable structure can include one or more conductors around which a sheath is provided. To prevent the cable structure from tangling, the cable structure can include a core placed between the conductors and the sheath, where a stiffness of the core can be varied along different segments of the cable structure to facilitate or hinder bending of the cable structure in different areas. The size and distribution of the stiffer portions can be selected to prevent the cable from forming loops. The resistance of the core to bending can be varied using different approaches including, for example, by varying the materials used in the core, varying a cross-section of portions of the core, or combinations of these.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of previously filed U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/259,617, filed Nov. 9, 2009, entitled &#x201c;ANTI-TANGLE CABLE FOR USE WITH AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE,&#x201d; the entirety of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A cable can be used to provide analog or digital signals between electronic components. For example, a cable can be used to connect a device to an audio output component used to provide audio from the device to a user. When not in use, a user can store the cable, for example in a pocket, bag, drawer, or other location. If the cable is not carefully stored and left alone, however, the cable can be subject to tangling. For example, the cable can rub against itself and tangle or even create knots. When the user later wishes to use the cable, the user may first be required to untangle the cable. If the cable is very tangled, or has a tightened knot, the user's experience using the cable may be adversely affected.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This is directed to a cable structure having incorporated features for preventing tangling for use with an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A cable structure can include one or more conductors providing a path for transferring signals. To protect the conductors, an outer sheath can be placed around the conductors and can provide an external surface for the cable. In some cases, the cable structure can include a core placed between the conductors and the sheath to center the conductors within the cable structure, to ensure a desired diameter for the cable structure, or to provide stiffness to the cable structure. The stiffness provided by the core can reduce or control tangling of the cable by controlling how the cable structure bends.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Different sections of the cable structure can include different mechanical properties that define a manner in which the section of the cable structure can bend. For example, different sections can be constructed from different materials. As another example, the core can have different shapes that favor bending in particular directions, or prevent bending in other directions in different sections. The different sections can be distributed in the cable using different approaches including, for example, by alternating sections having different properties.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A user can consume content provided by an electronic device using several approaches. In some embodiments, an external component can be coupled to the device so that signals corresponding to content to output can be provided to an interface for outputting the content. For example, a headset having a non-cable component (e.g., headphones) for converting digital audio signals to analog sound waves detectable by a user's ears can be coupled to a device. The headset can include a cable structure providing a path between different non-cable components of the headset (e.g., between an audio plug and headphones). The headset can include features that control bending of the cable structure to prevent tangling. For example, the cable structure can include several sections having different mechanical properties defining bending capabilities of the cable structure.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows an illustrative headset <b>10</b> having cable structure <b>20</b> that seamlessly integrates with non-cable components <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. Cable structure <b>20</b> has three legs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b> joined together at bifurcation region <b>30</b>. Leg <b>22</b> may be referred to herein as base leg <b>22</b> or main leg <b>22</b>, and includes the portion of cable structure <b>20</b> existing between non-cable component <b>40</b> and bifurcation region <b>30</b>. In particular, main leg <b>22</b> includes interface region <b>31</b>, taper region <b>32</b>, and non-interface region <b>33</b>. Leg <b>24</b> may be referred to herein as left leg <b>24</b>, and includes the portion of cable structure <b>20</b> existing between non-cable component <b>42</b> and bifurcation region <b>30</b>. Leg <b>26</b> may be referred to herein as right leg <b>26</b>, and includes the portion of cable structure <b>20</b> existing between non-cable component <b>44</b> and bifurcation region <b>30</b>. Both left and right legs <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> include respective interface regions <b>34</b> and <b>37</b>, taper regions <b>35</b> and <b>38</b>, and non-interface regions <b>36</b> and <b>39</b>. The non-cable components can include, for example, a jack or a headphone (e.g., non-cable component <b>40</b> is a jack, and non-cable components <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are headphones).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The non-interface region of the legs has a predetermined diameter and length. The diameter of main leg <b>22</b> may be larger than or the same as the diameters of left and right legs <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. For example, leg <b>22</b> may contain conductors for both left and right legs <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> and may therefore require a greater diameter to accommodate all conductors. In some embodiments, it is desirable to manufacture the non-interface regions to have the smallest diameter possible, for aesthetic reasons. As a result, the diameter of the non-interface regions can be smaller than the diameter of any non-cable component (e.g., jack or headphone) physically connected to the interface region. Since it is desirable for cable structure <b>20</b> to seamlessly integrate with the non-cable components, the legs may vary in diameter from the non-interface region to the interface region.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The taper region can handle the transition from the interface region to the non-interface region. The transition in the taper region can take any suitable shape that exhibits a fluid or smooth transition from the interface region to the non-interface regions. For example, the shape of the taper region can be similar to that of a cone or a neck of a wine bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The interface region has a predetermined diameter and length. The diameter of the interface region is substantially the same as the diameter of the non-cable component it is physically connected to, to provide an aesthetically pleasing seamless integration. Because the non-cable component typically has a diameter greater than the diameter of the non-interface region, the diameter of the interface region is larger than that of the non-interface regions. Consequently, in some embodiments, the taper region decreases in size from the interface region to the non-interface region.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The combination of the interface and taper regions can provide strain relief for those regions of headset <b>10</b>. Strain relief may be realized because the interface and taper regions have larger dimensions than the non-interface region and thus are more robust. These larger dimensions may also ensure that non-cable portions are securely connected to cable structure <b>20</b>. Moreover, the extra girth better enables the interface and taper regions to withstand bend stresses.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The interconnection of the three legs at bifurcation region <b>30</b> can vary depending on how the cable structure <b>20</b> is manufactured. In one approach, cable structure <b>20</b> can be a single-segment unibody cable structure. In this approach all three legs are manufactured jointly as a single-segment and no additional processing is required to electrically couple the conductors contained therein. That is, none of the legs are spliced to interconnect conductors at the bifurcation region. Some single-segment unibody cable structures may have a top half and a bottom half, which are molded together and extend throughout the entire unibody cable structure. For example, such single-segment unibody cable structures can be manufactured using injection molding and compression molding manufacturing processes. Thus, although a mold-derived single-segment unibody cable structure has two components (i.e., the top and bottom halves), it is considered a single-segment unibody cable structure. Other single-segment unibody cable structures may exhibit a contiguous ring of material that extends throughout the entire unibody cable structure. For example, such a single-segment cable structure can be manufactured using an extrusion process.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another approach, cable structure <b>20</b> can be a multi-segment unibody cable structure. A multi-segment unibody cable structure may have the same appearance of the single-segment unibody cable structure, but the legs are manufactured as discrete components. The legs and any conductors contained therein are interconnected at bifurcation region <b>30</b>. The legs can be manufactured using many of the same processes used to manufacture the single-segment unibody cable structure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cosmetics of bifurcation region <b>30</b> can be any suitable shape. In one embodiment, bifurcation region <b>30</b> can be an overmold structure that encapsulates a portion of each leg <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b>. The overmold structure can be visually and tactically distinct from the legs. The overmold structure can be applied to the single or multi-segment unibody cable structure. In another embodiment, bifurcation region <b>30</b> can be a two-shot injection molded splitter having the same dimensions as the legs being joined together. Thus, when the legs are joined together with the splitter mold, cable structure <b>20</b> maintains its unibody aesthetics. That is, a multi-segment cable structure has the look and feel of single-segment cable structure even though it has at three discretely manufacture legs joined together at bifurcation region <b>30</b>. Many different splitter configurations can be used, and the use of some splitters may be based on the manufacturing process used to create the segment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Cable structure <b>20</b> can include any suitable component extending through the legs for providing electrical or mechanical functionality. In one implementation, one or more electrical conductors can extend from base leg <b>22</b> to one or both of left leg <b>24</b> and right leg <b>26</b> to provide a path for electrical signals through cable structure <b>20</b>. For example, audio signals can be transferred from non-cable component <b>40</b> to non-cable components <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> via the conductors. Headset <b>10</b> can include any suitable number of conductors such as, for example, six electrical conductors in base leg <b>22</b> that split such that two of the six conductors are routed to left leg <b>24</b> and four of the six conductors are routed to right leg <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, another non-cable component can be incorporated into either left leg <b>24</b> or right leg <b>26</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, non-cable component <b>46</b> is integrated within leg <b>26</b>, and not at an end of a leg like non-cable components <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. For example, non-cable component <b>46</b> can be a communications box that includes a microphone and a user interface. Non-cable component <b>46</b> can be electrically coupled to non-cable component <b>40</b>, for example, to transfer signals between non-cable component <b>46</b> and one or more of non-cable components <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Non-cable component <b>46</b> can be incorporated in non-interface region <b>39</b> of leg <b>26</b>. In some cases, non-cable component <b>46</b> can have a larger size or girth than leg <b>26</b>, which can cause a discontinuity at an interface between non-interface region <b>39</b> and non-cable component <b>46</b>. To ensure that the cable maintains a seamless unibody appearance, non-interface region <b>39</b> can be replaced by first non-interface region <b>50</b>, first taper region <b>51</b>, first interface region <b>52</b>, non-cable component <b>46</b>, second interface region <b>53</b>, second taper region <b>54</b>, and second non-interface region <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Similar to the taper regions described above in connection with the cable structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, taper regions <b>51</b> and <b>54</b> can handle the transition from non-cable component <b>46</b> to the non-interface region. The transition in the taper region can take any suitable shape that exhibits a fluid or smooth transition from the interface region to the non-interface regions. For example, the shape of the taper region can be similar to that of a cone or a neck of a wine bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Similar to the interface regions described above in connection with the cable structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, interface regions <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> can have a predetermined diameter and length. The diameter of the interface region is substantially the same as the diameter of non-cable component <b>46</b> to provide an aesthetically pleasing seamless integration. In addition, and as described above, the combination of the interface and taper regions can provide strain relief for those regions of headset <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some cases, a cable structure such as cable structure <b>20</b> can include one or more components for preventing tangling of the cable. For example, a cable structure can include a rod constructed from a superelastic material (e.g., Nitinol) extending through the length of the cable structure. The rod can prevent or reduce bending of the cable structure to prevent tangling.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Cable structure <b>20</b> can be constructed using many different manufacturing processes. The processes discussed herein include those that can be used to manufacture the single-segment unibody cable structure or legs for the multi-segment unibody cable structure. In particular, these processes include injection molding, compression molding, and extrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each leg of the cable structure can be constructed from at least one conductor surrounded by an outer shell. In some cases, a core can be placed between the conductors and the shell. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustrative view of a portion of a cable structure in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view of the portion of the cable structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Cable structure <b>200</b> can include shell <b>210</b> placed over core <b>212</b>, which can enclose conductors (not shown). In some cases, core <b>212</b> can be incorporated as part of shell <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The conductors used in each cable structure can be constructed from any suitable conductive material. For example, the conductors can be constructed from a metal (e.g., copper or gold), a conductive composite material (e.g., a composite with integrated silicon), a conductive solution (e.g., an ionic solution constrained within a tube extending through a leg), or combinations of these. In one implementation, each conductor can include one or more drawn wires (e.g., a single drawn wire or several wires wrapped concentrically around a core). If a cable structure includes several conductors, each of the conductors can be shielded from each other by a non-conductive sheath or coating. For example, a plastic can be extruded over a conductor. As another example, a non-conductive coating can be applied via deposition or by dipping a conductor in a non-conductive material (e.g., in a liquid bath of material).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Shell <b>210</b> can provide a cosmetic surface or layer for each cable structure. The material selected for shell <b>210</b> can have a color (e.g., white) and a texture (e.g., smooth) selected based on industrial design considerations. The material selected may have mechanical properties that allow a user to comfortably deform a cable structure during use (e.g., such that the cable does not resist to earpieces being placed in a user's ear). In particular, the material used for shell <b>210</b> can have limited stiffness or resistance to bending. The material, however, may be resistant to punctures, abrasions, stretching, and shrinking to maintain the aesthetic appearance of the cable as it is used. Shell <b>210</b> can be disposed over the conductors using any suitable approach including, for example, molding or feeding a tube over the conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, neither the conductor nor shell <b>210</b> may provide meaningful resistance to bending or tangling. Instead, core <b>212</b> provided between the conductor and shell <b>210</b> can serve to prevent tangling of the cable. Accordingly, the material used for core <b>212</b> can include mechanical properties that ensure a minimum resistance to bending (e.g., materials that have at least pre-determined yield stress or strain, or modulus of elasticity). Such materials can include, for example, a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), a polymer, another plastic, a malleable metal, a composite material, or combinations of these.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Several approaches can be used to control the bending, and thus the tangling, of each leg of a cable structure. In some cases, a cable structure can include different sections that are susceptible to bending in different manners (e.g., in different amounts, locations, and directions or orientations). In one implementation, a cable structure can include some stiffer portions that are less susceptible to bending, and other less stiff portions that are more susceptible to bending.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">One approach for varying the stiffness of different sections of a cable structure can include changing a shape or cross-section of core <b>212</b> in each of the sections. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, cable structure <b>200</b> can include sections <b>220</b> and <b>224</b> in which a profile of core <b>212</b> are similar, and section <b>222</b> in which a profile of core <b>212</b> differs from that of sections <b>220</b> and <b>224</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of cable structure <b>200</b> taken at line A-A in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of cable structure <b>200</b> taken at line B-B in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of cable structure <b>200</b> taken at line C-C in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. By changing the profile of core <b>212</b> within each section, shown by the difference in shapes of core <b>212</b><i>a </i>of cross-section <b>400</b>A, core <b>212</b><i>b </i>of cross-section <b>400</b>B, and core <b>212</b><i>c </i>of cross-section <b>400</b>C, a bending moment or moment of inertia associated with at least two sections (e.g., sections <b>220</b> and <b>222</b>, or sections <b>222</b> and <b>224</b>) can differ. The difference in mechanical properties of each section of cable structure <b>200</b> can result in different resistance to bending. In particular, because of its smaller profile, core <b>212</b><i>b </i>can bend more easily than either of core <b>212</b><i>a </i>or core <b>212</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The different segments of cable structure <b>200</b> can have any suitable length. For example, stiffer sections <b>220</b> and <b>224</b> can be longer than flexible section <b>222</b>. Alternatively, the sections can have similar lengths, or stiffer sections <b>220</b> and <b>224</b> can be shorter than flexible section <b>222</b>. The disposition and size of the different sections of cable structure <b>200</b> can be defined to minimize or reduce overlapping of or looping of the cable structure, which can cause tangling.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Shell <b>210</b> can vary in each of the cable structure segments. For example, shell <b>210</b><i>a </i>of cross-section <b>400</b>A and shell <b>210</b><i>c </i>or cross-section <b>400</b>C can include similar dimensions (e.g., similar inner and outer diameters corresponding to a thin shell or wall). Shell <b>210</b><i>b </i>of cross-section <b>400</b>B, however, may have a smaller inner diameter than shell <b>210</b><i>a </i>or <b>210</b><i>c </i>to accommodate the smaller dimensions of core <b>212</b><i>b </i>(e.g., a larger shell or wall thickness). The outer diameter for shell <b>210</b><i>b</i>, however, may be the same as the outer diameter for other sections of cable structure <b>200</b> (e.g., the same as shell <b>210</b><i>a </i>and shell <b>210</b><i>c</i>), to provide a smooth and continuous outer surface for cable structure <b>200</b>. Because shell <b>210</b> can be constructed from a different material than core <b>212</b>, and in particular from a material having different mechanical properties, the sections of cable structure <b>200</b> that include a thicker shell <b>212</b> may have a different susceptibility to bending than sections of cable structure <b>200</b> that have a thinner shell <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Cable structure <b>200</b> can be constructed using any suitable approach. In some embodiments, material for core <b>212</b> can be extruded around conductive wires using a variable-sized die. As the die diameter is reduced, the core diameter can decrease and create a flexible segment of the wire. In some embodiments, core <b>212</b> can instead or in addition be constructed using a molding process (e.g., a compression mold, a top-down mold, or an injection mold). The mold used can have variable cross-sections for defining different core sizes corresponding to stiff and flexible segments. Once the core has been appropriately shaped, cosmetic tubing can be placed around the core to form sheath <b>210</b>. As another example, a molding process (e.g., double shot molding) can be used to form sheath <b>210</b> over core <b>212</b>. The resulting cosmetic sheath can have a substantially smooth shape that hides cutouts, variations of the core diameter, or other features of the core.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the example of cable structure <b>200</b>, sections of the cable structure that are more susceptible to bending can bend in any orientation. In some cases, it may be desirable to further control a direction or orientation of bending. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an illustrative view of a portion of a cable structure in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view of the portion of the cable structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Cable structure <b>500</b> can include shell <b>510</b> placed over core <b>512</b>, which can enclose conductors (not shown). Shell <b>510</b> and core <b>512</b> can include some or all of the features of the shell <b>210</b> and core <b>212</b>, described above.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">One approach for controlling an orientation or direction of bending can include providing a core that has an axis of symmetry around which bending can be facilitated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, cable structure <b>500</b> can include sections <b>520</b>, <b>522</b> and <b>524</b> in which a profile of core <b>512</b> can differ. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of cable structure <b>500</b> taken at line A-A in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of cable structure <b>500</b> taken at line B-B in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of cable structure <b>500</b> taken at line C-C in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Sections <b>520</b>, <b>522</b> and <b>524</b> can be designed such that bending is facilitated in different orientations. For example, section <b>520</b> can be designed to bend in direction <b>702</b>, section <b>522</b> can be designed to be stiff, and section <b>524</b> can be designed to bend in direction <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some cases, different cable sections can have different moments of inertia. One approach for providing different moments of inertia can be to provide core <b>512</b> with different shapes in each section. For example, core <b>512</b><i>a </i>in cross-section <b>700</b>A can include cutouts <b>514</b><i>a </i>and <b>515</b><i>a </i>extending through the portion of core <b>512</b> in section <b>520</b>. The cutouts can have any suitable shape including, for example, notches cut into core <b>512</b><i>a</i>. Cutouts <b>514</b><i>a </i>and <b>515</b><i>a </i>can be oriented such that core <b>512</b><i>a </i>does not extend all the way to shell <b>510</b><i>a </i>along direction <b>702</b> (e.g., base <b>516</b><i>a </i>of cutout <b>514</b><i>a </i>and base <b>517</b><i>a </i>of cutout <b>515</b><i>a </i>extend in a plane formed by directions <b>704</b> and <b>706</b>). Because cutouts <b>514</b><i>a </i>and <b>515</b><i>a </i>reduce the amount of material of core <b>512</b><i>a </i>in direction <b>702</b>, the resulting moment of inertia of core <b>512</b><i>a </i>may allow section <b>520</b> to bend more easily in direction <b>702</b>. Cutouts <b>514</b><i>a </i>and <b>515</b><i>a </i>can have any suitable shape, or can extend over any suitable amount of core <b>512</b>. For example, cutouts <b>514</b><i>a </i>and <b>515</b><i>a </i>can include a planar base as described above, or a curved base. The cutouts can extend over any arc of core <b>512</b> including, for example an arc having any suitable length or angle. Those with skill in the art will recognize or appreciate that a cross-section of a section may be constant.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Similarly, core <b>512</b><i>b </i>in cross-section <b>700</b>B may include no cutouts, and may therefore be more difficult to bend in every direction than cross-section <b>700</b>A. In particular, a moment of inertia corresponding to core <b>512</b><i>b </i>may require more force to bend core <b>512</b><i>b </i>(e.g., section <b>522</b>) in direction <b>702</b> than a moment of inertia of core <b>512</b><i>a </i>may require to bend core <b>512</b><i>a </i>(e.g., section <b>520</b>) in direction <b>702</b>. To further control bending, core <b>512</b><i>c </i>in cross-section <b>700</b>C can include cutouts <b>514</b><i>c </i>and <b>515</b><i>c </i>extending through portions of core <b>512</b> in section <b>524</b>. To reduce tangling, one or both of the position and size of cutouts <b>514</b><i>c </i>and <b>515</b><i>c </i>can differ from those of cutouts <b>514</b><i>a </i>and <b>515</b><i>a</i>. In particular, cutouts <b>514</b><i>c </i>and <b>515</b><i>c </i>can be oriented such that core <b>512</b><i>c </i>does not extend all the way to shell <b>510</b><i>c </i>along direction <b>706</b> (e.g., base <b>516</b><i>c </i>of cutout <b>514</b><i>c </i>and base <b>517</b><i>c </i>of cutout <b>515</b><i>c </i>extend in a plane formed by directions <b>702</b> and <b>704</b>). Because cutouts <b>514</b><i>c </i>and <b>515</b><i>c </i>reduce the amount of material of core <b>512</b><i>c </i>in direction <b>706</b>, the resulting moment of inertia of core <b>512</b><i>c </i>may allow section <b>524</b> to bend more easily in direction <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cutouts of core <b>512</b> can be constructed using different approaches. In some cases, machining, cutting, grinding, milling, or any other process for removing material can be used to create cutouts <b>514</b> and <b>515</b> of core <b>512</b>. Alternatively, core <b>512</b> can be manufactured with the cutouts integrated in the core. For example, a molding process can be used in which the mold includes pre-defined cutouts.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The size and number of cutouts used in each section, and the orientation or position of the cutouts can be tuned to control the bending of the cable in a specific manner. In particular, different attributes of the cutout can be tuned to reduce tangling in one or more regions of a cable structure (e.g., reduce tangling in a vicinity of a bifurcation region, or in a vicinity of an end of cable leg).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some cases, a cable structure can include sections with several cutouts that extend around an entire periphery of a cable structure core. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an illustrative view of a portion of a cable structure in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view of the portion of the cable structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Cable structure <b>800</b> can include shell <b>810</b> placed over core <b>812</b>, which can enclose conductors (not shown). Shell <b>810</b> and core <b>812</b> can include some or all of the features of the shell <b>210</b> and core <b>212</b>, described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, cable structure <b>800</b> can include sections <b>820</b>, <b>822</b> and <b>824</b> in which a profile of core <b>812</b> can differ such that bending is facilitated or hindered in different sections. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of cable structure <b>800</b> taken at line A-A in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of cable structure <b>800</b> taken at line B-B in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of cable structure <b>800</b> taken at line C-C in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Cable structure <b>800</b> can include several different sections <b>820</b>, <b>822</b> and <b>824</b> designed to bend in different manners. For example, section <b>820</b> can be designed to bend in any of directions <b>1002</b> and <b>1006</b>, section <b>822</b> can be designed to be stiff, and section <b>824</b> can be designed to bend in any of directions <b>1002</b> and <b>1006</b>. To allow the bending, core <b>812</b><i>a </i>of cross-section <b>1000</b>A can include several cutouts <b>814</b><i>a </i>extending around a periphery of core <b>812</b><i>a</i>. Because of the cutouts, an outer diameter of core <b>812</b><i>a </i>may be smaller than an outer diameter of core <b>812</b><i>b </i>of cross-section <b>1000</b>B. The cutouts can modify a moment of inertia of core <b>812</b><i>a </i>in section <b>820</b>, and facilitate bending in section <b>820</b> relative to section <b>822</b>. Similarly, core <b>812</b><i>c </i>of cross-section <b>1000</b>C can include several cutouts <b>814</b><i>c </i>extending around a periphery of core <b>812</b><i>a</i>. Because of the cutouts, an outer diameter of core <b>812</b><i>c </i>may be smaller than an outer diameter of core <b>812</b><i>b </i>of cross-section <b>1000</b>B, and can facilitate bending in section <b>824</b> relative to section <b>822</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In contrast with cable structure <b>200</b>, cable structure <b>800</b> can include several cutouts <b>814</b> placed in sequence parallel to each other to form a section of cable structure <b>800</b>. Cable structure <b>800</b> can include any suitable number of cutouts having any suitable size. In some cases, a length or orientation of cutouts (e.g., if a cutout does not surround a periphery of core <b>812</b>) can be selected for each cutout of a cable structure section. The cutouts can thus be tuned to reduce or eliminate tangling of the cable. The cutouts can be constructed using any suitable approach including, for example, one or more of the approaches described above.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, other approaches can be used to ensure that different sections of a cable structure are susceptible to bending in different manners. In one implementation, instead of changing a shape of a core in different sections, a material used for the core can vary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an illustrative cable structure in which a core is constructed from several different materials in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Cable structure <b>1100</b> can include shell <b>1140</b> placed over core <b>1101</b>. Core <b>1101</b> can include several sections constructed from different materials. For example, core <b>1101</b> can include section <b>1102</b> constructed from elements <b>1103</b> and <b>1106</b> connected by arm <b>1104</b>. Section <b>1110</b> can extend around arm <b>1104</b> and between elements <b>1103</b> and <b>1106</b> to form an intermediate section. For example, section <b>1110</b> can include portions <b>1111</b> and <b>1112</b> that are positioned on opposite sides of arm <b>1104</b>, as seen in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. It will be understood, however, that portions <b>1111</b> and <b>1112</b> can be part of a single section having an opening through which arm <b>1104</b> extends. Core <b>1101</b> can also include section <b>1120</b> placed adjacent to section <b>1102</b>. The sections of core <b>1101</b> can be substantially aligned with an axis of cable structure <b>1100</b>, and can have similar outer diameters such that shell <b>1140</b> can provide a smooth and continuous cosmetic outer surface. By using different materials for each segment, the moments of inertia of each segment can differ, and the susceptibility of each segment to bend can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for creating a cable structure in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Process <b>1200</b> can begin at step <b>1202</b>. At step <b>1204</b>, a core can be provided around conductors of a cable structure. The conductors can serve to transfer electrical signals through the cable structure. The core can be provided from a material that provides thickness to the cable structure. For example, the core can be constructed from a polymer, TPU, TPE, or any other suitable material. The core can be constructed using molding, drawing, or any other suitable process. At step <b>1206</b>, the core can be modified to define stiff and flexible sections of the cable structure. For example, one or more sections of the cable structure can include cutouts. As another example, one or more sections of the cable structure can have a variable cross-section. As still another example, different sections of the core can be constructed from different materials. In some embodiments, the core shape can be defined as part of the process by which the core is placed around the conductors of the cable structure.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At step <b>1208</b> a cosmetic sheath can be placed around the core. For example, tubing can be placed around the core. As another example, a cosmetic sheath can be molded around the core. The cosmetic sheath can have a substantially smooth shape that hides cutouts or other features of the core. Process <b>1200</b> can then end at step <b>1210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The previously described embodiments are presented for purposes of illustration and not of limitation. It is understood that one or more features of an embodiment can be combined with one or more features of another embodiment to provide systems and/or methods without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
