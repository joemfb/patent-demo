<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The embodiments of the inventive concept will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which. It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element, it may be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram to describe program disturbance of a two dimensional nonvolatile memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a cell array of a NAND type flash memory device may include a string select line SSL and a ground select line GSL. Word lines WL<sub>0 </sub>to WL<sub>n-1 </sub>may be arranged between the string select line SSL and the ground select line GSL. Each of the string select line SSL, the ground select line GSL, and the word lines WL<sub>0 </sub>to WL<sub>n-1 </sub>may include a data storage layer and a control gate. Program voltage conditions of a memory cell MC<sub>1i </sub>selected in the NAND type flash memory device are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A ground voltage GND may be applied to a selected bit line BL<sub>i</sub>, a power voltage Vcc may be applied to a non-selected bit line BL<sub>i+1</sub>, and the power voltage Vcc may be applied to the string select line SSL. The ground voltage GND may be applied to the ground select line GSL, and the ground voltage GND may be applied to a common source line CSL. A program voltage Vpgm may be applied to a selected word line WL<sub>0</sub>, and a pass voltage Vpass may be applied to non-selected word lines WL<sub>1 </sub>to WL<sub>n-1</sub>. The ground voltage may be applied to a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A memory cell Mc<sub>1i+1 </sub>connected to the selected word line WL<sub>0 </sub>and the non-selected bit line BL<sub>i+1 </sub>is prevented from being programmed. Thus, a channel voltage of the memory cell Mc<b>1</b><sub>i+1 </sub>connected to the selected word line WL<sub>0 </sub>and the non-selected bit line BL<sub>i+1 </sub>may be boosted to a high level.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Due to a potential difference between a channel region of the ground select line GSL and the channel region boosted to the high level, a strong electric field may be generated in a source/drain region between the ground select line GSL and the word line WL<sub>0 </sub>adjacent to the ground select line GSL. Thus, electron-hole pairs may be generated. Holes of the electron-hole pairs may be moved toward the substrate by a substrate bias, and electrons may become hot electrons by a laterally strong electric field generated from a channel voltage of the ground select line GSL and a channel voltage of the selected word line WL<sub>0</sub>. The hot electrons may be scattered at the selected word line WL<sub>0 </sub>and injected into the data storage layer. This phenomenon may occur between the string select line SSL and the word line WL<sub>n-1 </sub>adjacent to the string select line SSL. Thus, a program disturbance phenomenon may occur. The program disturbance phenomenon means that a program-inhibited cell is programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram to describe program disturbance of a three dimensional memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a three dimensional device may include a common source line CSL, a plurality of bit lines BL<b>0</b>, BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and BL<b>3</b>, and a plurality of cell strings CSTR disposed between the common source line CSL and the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The common source line CSL may be a conductive layer disposed on a semiconductor substrate or an impurity region formed in the semiconductor substrate. The bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b> may be conductive patterns (e.g. metal lines) which are spaced apart from the semiconductor substrate over a top surface of the semiconductor substrate. The bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b> may be two dimensionally arranged, and a plurality of cell strings CSTR may be connected to each of the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b> in parallel. Thus, the cell strings CSTR may be two dimensionally arranged on the common source line CSL or the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each of the cell strings CSTR may include a ground select transistor GST connected to the common source line CSL, a string select transistor SST connected to each of the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b>, and a plurality of memory cell transistors MCT disposed between the ground and string select transistors GST and SST. The ground select transistor GST, the memory cell transistors MCT, and the string select transistor SST may be connected to each other in series. A ground select line GSL, a plurality of word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b>, and a plurality of string select lines SSL, which are disposed between the common source line CSL and the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b>, may be used as gate electrodes of the ground select transistors GST, the memory cell transistors MCT, and the string select transistors SST, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The ground select transistors GST may be disposed at substantially the same distance from the semiconductor substrate, and gate electrodes of the ground select transistors GST may be jointly connected to the ground select line GSL to be in an equipotential state. The ground select line GSL may be a conductive pattern having a plate shape or a comb shape which is disposed between the common source line CSL and the memory cell transistor MCT adjacent to the common source line CSL. Similarly, gate electrodes of a plurality of the memory cell transistors MCT which are disposed at substantially the same distance from the common source line CSL may also be jointly connected to one of the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> to be in an equipotential state. Each of the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> may be a conductive pattern having a plate shape or a comb shape parallel to a top surface of the substrate. Since one cell string CSTR may consist of a plurality of the memory cell transistors MCT which are disposed at different distances from the common source line CSL, multi-layered word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> may be disposed between the common source line CSL and the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Each of the cell strings CSTR may include a semiconductor pillar which vertically extends from the common source line CSL and is connected to a corresponding bit line of the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b>. The semiconductor pillars may be formed to penetrate the ground select line GSL and the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b>. Each of the semiconductor pillars may include a body portion and an impurity region formed at one end or both ends of the body portions. For example, a drain region may be formed at a top end of the semiconductor pillar.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A data storage layer may be disposed between the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> and the semiconductor pillar. According to an embodiment, the data storage layer may be a charge storage layer. For example, the data storage layer may include one of a trap insulating layer, a floating gate electrode, or an insulating layer including conductive nano dots.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A dielectric layer used as a gate insulating layer of the ground select transistor GST or the string select transistor SST may be disposed between the ground select line GSL and the semiconductor pillar, or between the string select line SSL and the semiconductor pillar. The gate insulating layer of at least one of the ground and string select transistors GST and SST may be formed of the same material as the data storage layer of the memory cell transistor MCT or may include a gate insulating layer (e.g. a silicon oxide layer) for a general MOS field effect transistor (MOSFET).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ground and string select transistors GST and SST and the memory cell transistors MCT may be MOS field effect transistors using the semiconductor pillar as channel regions. According to an embodiment, the semiconductor pillar may form MOS capacitors with the ground select line GSL, the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b>, and the string select lines SSL. According to an embodiment, the ground select transistor GST, the memory cell transistors MCT, and the string select transistors SST may share inversion layers formed by fringe fields of the ground select line GSL, word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b>, and string select line SSL and are thus electrically connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The program disturbance phenomenon may be caused at the three dimensional device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> under the same voltage conditions as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by the same principle as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, a non-selected memory cell MC<b>2</b> may be programmed under program voltage conditions for a selected memory cell MC<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a nonvolatile memory device according to an embodiment of the inventive concept. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph illustrating program characteristics of a nonvolatile memory device according to an embodiment of the inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a plurality of word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLn&#x2212;1 are provided on a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> may include impurities of a first conductivity type (e.g. P-type). Each of the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLn&#x2212;1 may include a tunnel insulating layer <b>20</b> on the semiconductor <b>10</b>, a charge trapping layer <b>30</b> on the tunnel insulating layer <b>20</b>, a blocking insulating layer <b>40</b> on the charge trapping layer <b>30</b>, a control gate <b>50</b> on the blocking insulating layer <b>40</b>, and a hard mask <b>60</b> on the control gate <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A ground select line GSL may be provided at one side of the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLn&#x2212;1. A string select line SSL may be provided at another side of the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLn&#x2212;1. A first dummy word line DWL<b>1</b> may be disposed between the ground select line GSL and the word line WL<b>0</b> which is a word line nearest to the ground select line GSL among the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLn&#x2212;1. A second dummy word line DWL<b>2</b> may be disposed between the string select line SSL and the word line WLn&#x2212;1 which is a word line nearest to the string select line SSL among the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLn&#x2212;1. The first and second dummy word lines DWL<b>1</b> and DWL<b>2</b> can decrease a horizontal electric field to reduce the program disturbance phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each of a first distance L<b>1</b> between the ground select line GSL and the first dummy word line DWL<b>1</b> or between the string select line SSL and the second dummy word line DWL<b>2</b> and a second distance L<b>2</b> between the first dummy word line DWL<b>1</b> and the word line WL<b>0</b> or between the second dummy word line DWL<b>2</b> and the word line WLn&#x2212;1 is greater than a third distance L<b>3</b> between a pair of the word lines adjacent to each other among the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLn&#x2212;1.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The first distance L<b>1</b> may be equal to or greater than the second distance L<b>2</b>. According to an embodiment, the first distance L<b>1</b> may be less than the second distance L<b>2</b>. Channel regions of the ground select line GSL and the first dummy word line DWL<b>1</b> may have the same conductivity type as the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> between the ground select line GSL and the first dummy word line DWL<b>1</b>. For example, a source/drain region having a conductivity type opposite to a conductivity type of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> may not be formed between the ground select line GSL and the first dummy word line DWL<b>1</b>. According to an embodiment of the inventive concept, a source/drain may be induced at the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> between the ground select line GSL and the first dummy word line DWL<b>1</b> by a fringe field.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Channel regions of the string select line SSL and the second dummy word line DWL<b>2</b> may have the same conductivity type as the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> between the string select line SSL and the second word line DWL<b>2</b>. Channel regions of the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLn&#x2212;1 may have the same conductivity type as the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> between the channel regions of the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLn&#x2212;1. As a consequence, the string of the nonvolatile memory device according to an embodiment of the inventive concept may induce a source/drain region using the fringe field.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a horizontal axis shows voltages, and a vertical axis shows electric field values in a program operation. A reference mark E<b>1</b> shows an electric field applied to the word line when hot electrons are generated.</p>
