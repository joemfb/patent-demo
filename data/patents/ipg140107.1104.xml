<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The apparatus and method components have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In various exemplary embodiments, context based scanning and reading systems and methods are provided with an end-to-end framework for receiving information and performing a plurality of different actions based thereon. An end-to-end framework includes one of scanning and reading an item to obtain a set of information such as data and symbology based thereon, presenting the set of information in context, obtaining a plurality of actions in context based on the set of information in context, and selecting one of the plurality of actions in context based on criteria. A system includes at least one readable device associated with an item, location, and the like, at least one mobile device configured to scan the at least one readable device, and an end-to-end framework operable on the at least one mobile device to obtain information from the at least one readable device and present the information and associated actions based on a context.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A mobile device includes a reader and/or a scanner, a network interface, a data store, and a processor, wherein each of the one of the reader and the scanner, the network interface, the data store, and the processor are communicatively coupled therebetween. The processor is configured to obtain information from an item using the one of the reader and the scanner, present the information to an output interface of the mobile device, and obtain a plurality of actions in context based on the information in context.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, a diagram illustrates a context based system <b>100</b> for an end-to-end framework. The context based system <b>100</b> includes, for example, one or more mobile devices <b>110</b> which optionally connect to a server <b>120</b> through a network <b>130</b>. Variously, the mobile devices <b>110</b> are configured to interact with tags <b>140</b>, barcodes <b>150</b>, and any other electronic, optical, wireless, etc. indicia mechanisms <b>160</b>. The tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b> are deployed in a geographic region such as a store, warehouse, file room, stock room, etc. and are typically affixed, disposed on, attached to, and/or integrated with objects. In an exemplary embodiment, the tags <b>140</b> may include RFID tags which communicate wirelessly with the mobile devices <b>110</b>. In another exemplary embodiment, the barcodes <b>150</b> may include 1D or 2D barcodes where the 1D or 2D refers to a mechanism for encoding data on the barcodes <b>150</b>. The barcodes <b>150</b> are configured to be scanned optically by the mobile devices <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the other mechanisms <b>160</b> may include any mechanism to communicate data with the mobile devices <b>110</b>. As described herein, the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b> may be referred to as readable devices, i.e. these are electronically/optically read devices to obtain information in context with the information being associated with an associated object, item, location, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The context based system <b>100</b> includes the framework operating on the mobile devices <b>110</b> and the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b>. Optionally, the server <b>120</b> and the network <b>130</b> are utilized in the framework. The framework could reside on the mobile device <b>110</b>, or it could reside on the server <b>120</b> (e.g., using the mobile device <b>110</b> for input/output) or it could be a combination of both. The framework allows an end-user with a mobile device <b>110</b> to scan and/or read information from the devices <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, and to have most important or relevant information displayed along with access to appropriate actions. For example, assume a mobile device <b>110</b> reads an arbitrary barcode <b>150</b>, and the mobile device <b>110</b> may display important information associated with that barcode <b>150</b> (or the underlying physical object associate therewith). The display information may be displayed along with access to appropriate actions which may be taken in context meaning the actions apply to some aspect of the scanned/read item or one levels deeper, an aspect of the aspect. This same framework supports plug-ins (typically on the server <b>120</b>) to provide this user experience for an arbitrary and extensible set of the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The framework provides available actions associated with context derived from the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b> (or associated underlying physical object and its attributes). For example, the framework provides the actions by finding them looking at context information and the actions available for those pieces of context information. The actions may include creation of tasks, report of problems, request for information, etc. Most of the actions likely would be associated with the physical object, for example, so for a shelf label the actions might be: create task for replenishment; create task for refacing or tidying up the presentation of the shelf/rack; report damage to shelf or items on shelf; request additional business information for the product: weekly sales, deliveries, etc; look at stock levels in nearby stores; and the like. In some exemplary embodiments, the action may not be directly associated with the object, but may use other context information. For example with a shelf scan or read, there could be an action to create a cleanup task for the far end of an aisle, where this location is automatically derived from the location of one of the tag <b>140</b>, the barcode <b>150</b>, and the other mechanism <b>160</b> associated with the shelf label. The action might also be to start a task associated with the item that was just scanned and/or read. Also, any of the information/actions could be provided by the customer to meet their specific needs rather than preprogrammed, i.e. the information/actions is a flexible, programmable framework. The exposed information and actions can also take into account the identity and permissions associated with the user so that only information and actions meaningful to the user are presented.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, a flowchart illustrates an end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> utilizing the system <b>100</b> for configurable, context based interactions. The end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> may be implemented with the system <b>100</b> including the mobile devices <b>110</b>, the server <b>120</b>, the network <b>130</b>, the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b>. Variously, the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> contemplates an interactive, context based approach to user's interactions with the environment, i.e. user's scan/read data associated with objects in the environment and interact based thereon. Further, the mobile devices <b>110</b> and optionally the server <b>120</b> may include a framework application operating thereon for implementation of the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b>. The framework functionality may reside either wholly on the mobile devices <b>110</b> or the server <b>120</b>, or be distributed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">First, the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> includes setup and preprogramming (step <b>405</b>). This may include, for example, physical deployment of the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b> and associated objects. This may also include preprogramming of the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b> along with preprogramming of the mobile devices <b>110</b> and the server <b>120</b>. By preprogramming, data and/or instructions are provided to the various devices <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>. For example, the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b> may be preprogrammed with associated data related to their underlying object, such as type, price, location, quantity, stock-keeping unit (SKU), and the like. Alternatively, the preprogramming may include instructions for retrieving associated data from another source. The mobile devices <b>110</b> and the server <b>120</b> may be preprogrammed with software instructions for executing the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A user, with the mobile device <b>110</b>, obtains information from a scan, read, etc. of the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b> (step <b>410</b>). Here, the user is physically proximate to an object with an associated tag <b>140</b>, barcode <b>150</b>, and/or other mechanism <b>160</b>, and the user obtains information and actions therefrom. Importantly, the obtaining of information and/or actions is said to be context based meaning the information and/or actions is based on location, type of user, time, day, type of underlying object, and/or any configurable attributes. For example, the context based information and/or actions may be different between users (e.g., customers, sales clerks, warehouse personnel, etc.), different between time/day (e.g., during operating hours, during restocking periods, etc.), and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the underlying object is likely to be the main key to locating information and actions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Put differently, the context based provides a mechanism that allows the end user to have direct access to the processes appropriate to their current circumstances with a minimum of data entry. This context leverages a plurality of attributes associated with a particular scan, read, etc., such attributes may include time/day, user type, object type, location, etc. The context further contemplates a plug-in based extensibility allowing new information and processes to be provided to the user without the usual burden of creating the screens and associated training that lead up to the new information/actions. The context may be determined through a combination of the mobile device <b>110</b>, the server, the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b>. For example, location may be determined from the mobile device <b>110</b>, user type may be pushed to the mobile device <b>110</b> from the server <b>120</b>, and the like. In some cases (e.g., scan/read of a shelf label) the scanned object may provide the detailed location information since the exact location of the label is known and the user must be very close to it. If the framework executes on the server <b>120</b>, then the user login (or other identification) would be the primary determining factor of &#x201c;user type&#x201d; and it would be known by the server <b>120</b> and used there without being &#x201c;pushed&#x201d; to the device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The context based information and/or actions may be presented to the user (step <b>415</b>). This may include through an output interface on the mobile device <b>110</b>, e.g. a GUI, text, hyperlinks, etc. The end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> may be configured to present the user the most important items for the information and/or actions based on the context. For example, in addition to information, the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> may present the user with actions, tasks, management, notification, etc. (step <b>420</b>). These may generally be divided between information presented to the user and actions available to the user. Specifically, the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> may include further steps of performing an action/task (step <b>425</b>) or receiving information/notifications (step <b>430</b>) and with additional context based information presented to the user (step <b>415</b>). The &#x201c;actions&#x201d; presented to the user are GUI items that the user can select. Once selected the action associated with the item will occur (or the initial step leading to the occurrence will be done.). An example of the &#x201c;initial step&#x201d; case is &#x201c;cleanup&#x201d;, where the cleanup operation would be scheduled by selecting the action rather than the action necessarily beginning immediately.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Formatting and presentation of information may be configurable and may depend on factors such as information available, area in which scan/read occurs, user role, time of day, calendar, etc. Formatting, ordering and presentation of actions may be configurable and may depend on factors such as actions and information available, area in which scan occurs, user role, time of day, calendar, etc. The actions will generally be found based on the information available. For example, an action to fetch item from store room is not unconditionally available and would only be available if the information for the item if the store room quantity was greater than zero.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Scan data used to lookup information and actions is a subset of the scan data&#x2014;For a given type of scan data, one (or more) subsets of the scan data would be taken and used for lookups. Essentially, the scanned data may contain multiple fields that can each be used in various ways to lookup information. Identification of scans that have fields and how to extract those fields would be part of the system configuration. Scan data (or a subset of it) may be available directly as information. In some cases, the price as well as item code might be encoded in the barcode in different fields. The scanned price should be part of the information eligible to be displayed or used to locate actions. For looking up information, information may be resident on the mobile device <b>110</b> and/or the server <b>120</b> running the framework or the lookup may communicate with other computers via identified protocols (usually related to web services). The lookup operation may involve multiple lookups from local and remote sources of information to find all the associated pieces of information. For instance, scanning an item UPC might involve a number of separate sub-lookups to get each of the following pieces of information: price, country of origin, dairy-free status, next delivery, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Variously, the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> contemplates the creating of tasks, reporting problems, requesting information, etc. Most of the actions probably will be associated with the physical object, so for a shelf label the actions might be: create task for replenishment; create task for refacing or tidying up the presentation of the shelf/rack; report damage to shelf or items on shelf; request additional business information for the product: weekly sales, deliveries, look at stock levels in nearby stores; and the like. In some cases, the action may not be directly associated with the object, but may use other context information. For a shelf scan, there could be an action to create a cleanup task, where this location is automatically derived from the location of the shelf label. The action might also be to start a task associated with the thing that was just scanned. The exposed information and actions can also take into account the identity and permissions associated with the user so that only information and actions meaningful to the user are presented. The end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> contemplates a completely configurable framework. For example, any of the information/actions could be provided by the customer to meet their specific needs rather than just preprogrammed. Also, multiple separate organizations may not need to know about each other with the framework providing a common point of contact.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an exemplary embodiment, the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> may include actions, tasks, task/time management, and the like. The actions may include activity to respond to customer and/or environmental situations. These may include access to business tools, an ability to communicate or create tasks for others, an ability to create reminders for themselves and/or others, and the like. Relative to tasks, the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> ensures a user with the mobile device <b>110</b> has a tool required to get the job done and limit its scope to the task at hand. Specifically, the mobile device <b>110</b> with the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> may include a base or primary task, a possible interruption task, a possible secondary task, and the like. Relative to task/time management, the mobile device <b>110</b> with the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> may enable a view and/or selection of tasks, an ability to get a next task, an ability to request and/or declare a break, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b>, actions and transient tools may be started manually, but usually may start in response to a scan, read, etc. Since these tools are easily started when needed, they may be automatically closed when a new tool is opened. Applications that are not driven by the scanner, reader, etc. activation are unlikely to be treated as transient application because of the time consumed to restart the applications. Non-scanner applications such as &#x201c;create reminder&#x201d; and &#x201c;make walkie-talkie announcement&#x201d; may be selected manually. The following table below outlines exemplary, non-limiting tools that may be started by a scanner, reader, etc. activation.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Being able to easily access the framework via a scan generates a number of requirements on the mobile device <b>110</b>. For example, a separate scan and/or read button allows a scan/read operation to automatically trigger the framework at any point. The current application may be suspended, and the framework presentation takes over and when it is closed, the previous application may continue. A separate scan and/or read button allows the scan/read to occur at any point. Additionally, a soft scan button may take up space on every screen, or require the user to bring up a scan application before a scan could occur.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">From a main screen of a transient application on the mobile device <b>110</b>, there may include a mechanism to go forward to a more detailed screen (and back); a mechanism to go forward to perform a further action on the item just scanned/read; a mechanism to go back to the initial transient app display; a mechanism go back to the previous application (or another open application); and the like. For cases where the user might desire to manually enter a code, the mobile device <b>110</b> may include a mechanism for a manually launched application which allows barcode, RFID tag, etc. information to be entered via an on-screen keypad. Alternatively, the keypad entry could come up after some number of failed scan attempts, e.g. anticipating the need.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The mobile device <b>110</b> may allow a configurable number of task screens to be open. There may be one task screen for each task which is in-progress. If tasks are kept short and specific (10-15 minutes), then there is little reason to be doing several tasks in parallel. When the task screen is in the foreground, the screen and device are a dedicated tool to assist in doing the task. The task assistance may be limited to just the task.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, if the task is to unpack a particular tote, then the screen and scanner may step the worker through the process: 1) identify the correct tote (scan); 2) for each item in the tote (scan), locate the shelf position; and 3) record the number placed on the shelf and the number put to backstock. When a task is completed, the associated task screen may be replaced by the new task selection screen.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an exemplary embodiment, a scan/read may occur shortly after another, which might imply that the user is looking for a comparison between two items. The comparison might generate additional information and therefore additional actions. For example, scanning/reading a bolt and then a nut might indicate whether the two are compatible.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, a flowchart illustrates an exemplary usage method <b>500</b> of the mobile device <b>110</b> with the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b>. On the mobile device <b>110</b>, the task/time management screen is the user's interface to the task management system which includes the scheduling of breaks. There are several ways that tasks can be doled out, so this screen may take several difference forms depending on the policy for this user. In an exemplary embodiment of the usage method <b>500</b>, the policies may include support for the following situations. First, a user at a station on a primary task (step <b>505</b>), e.g., a worker may have a primary assignment (cashier, cut fabric, help customers in plumbing, etc.), but when not busy with the primary assignment (step <b>510</b>) they may work on other assigned tasks (report low shelf quantities, restock, etc.) (step <b>515</b>). If the secondary task is not assigned (step <b>520</b>), then the user may receive an assigned task (step <b>525</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, in a large retail operation, replenishment (from truck to shelf&#x2014;or backstock) is broken down into hundreds of short duration tasks which are doled out to the workers one at a time according to worker skills and task priority. The tasks may include: moving pallets/cages from a truck; 2) movement of pallet/cage contents to aisles (or backstock); 3) movement of items from pallet/cage/tote in aisle to shelves; 4) and the like. A single truck delivery could have dozens of pallets/cages. Each of which could have dozens of totes or aisle level items. So the arrival of a truck may create hundreds of tasks. Unloading the truck may be the highest priority and allows the tasks associated with the movement of items in the store to become assignable.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an exemplary embodiment, the end-to-end framework method <b>500</b> contemplates an autonomous self managed team, i.e. a list of tasks for the team could be displayed to everyone and as desired team members could claim (self assign) tasks. This would be most effective if the number of tasks were relatively small. Messages and self-authored &#x201c;to dos&#x201d; would also appear in the list.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The end-to-end framework method <b>500</b> may include a plurality of different ways to dole out tasks which depend on the level of autonomy the users have. For example, the degree of visibility into future tasks depend on how tasks are doled out and how dynamic the tasks are. The delivery of tasks may be performed by the server <b>120</b> and may include delivery of the task to a user with integrated tools to assist in performing the task. Also, the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> may include ad-hoc user generated tasks and self generated reminders. In a process driven operation, these would amount to a small proportion of the total number of task.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an exemplary embodiment, the end-to-end framework method <b>500</b> and/or the system <b>100</b> may include an application framework which supports the applications and behaviors the user depends on. The application framework allows the user to run multiple web applications at the same time and switch between the applications easily, such as on the mobile device <b>110</b>. The applications are really separate web sessions that each appear as separate applications to the user, e.g. web sessions hosted through the server <b>120</b>. The application framework may provide login and device association, startup of initial set of applications, switching between different application displays, arbitration of access to shared resources (scanner, reader, and buttons), any gesture processing and take appropriate action, and the like. Of note, the server <b>120</b> can be any server, not just a dedicated server associated with the framework.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Given the relatively static nature of traditional task management systems, the tasks are scheduled well ahead of time and can include tasks of long (hours) duration, like changing out seasonal merchandise. In an exemplary embodiment, the system <b>100</b> assumes each user has one of the mobile devices allowing a more dynamic view of task management. For example, tasks may be shorter (less than 30 minutes). This allows better employee metrics, but also allows parallelism and multiple clean hand-off points if someone else takes over. Tasks may be dynamically assigned according to priority Advantageously, tasks cause the business to run in an efficient and timely fashion. This includes the worker cleaning up spill or restocking a shelf as well as the manager assigned to approve a credit application or address customer complaint. The tasks may be viewed as a dynamic best-guess list, doled of one-at-a-time.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A message to a worker/manager appears in their queue and if urgent may interrupt them. A message has a life-cycle just like a task. When a worker creates a reminder, it is just a message to themselves and appears in the same queue and may be nagging if its priority is high. In summary, everything that a worker/manager needs to do, read, respond to appears in the same prioritized list.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Anytime a task is being assigned across multiple people, it would be best if the tasks matched the worker. If user records are being updated by a supervisor, then user skill/training/preferences could be used to choose task. Within the priority constraints, a worker could be allowed to request an alternate task if they don't want the assigned one. Or, workers could be given a short list of possible next tasks to choose from. Task management is often imagined as the manager assigning tasks to the workers. But in a business process oriented task management system, the workers would also be assigning tasks to the manager/supervisor, such as, for example credit approval needed, void/over-ride on a cash register, customer issue escalation, etc. The manager may be a scarce commodity than the workers and therefore may be assigned many short duration tasks that keep the business moving.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, screen diagrams <b>600</b>, <b>602</b> illustrate exemplary screen shots from a mobile device <b>110</b> utilizing the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b>. The screen diagram <b>600</b> is displayed subsequent to scanning or reading an item, i.e. cola, and the screen diagram <b>602</b> is displayed subsequent to scanning or reading a digital sign, i.e. sign <b>9912</b>. Although only a shelf label, i.e. cola, and a digital sign, i.e. sign <b>9912</b>, are shown, the list of things that could be scanned for information and actions is unlimited. Some examples may include a digital sign, electronic shelf label, a shelf label, a UPC, an International Standard Book Number, a cage identification barcode or RFID, a cash register, a returns cart, a customer loyalty card, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">After scanning or reading cola <b>610</b>, the screen shot <b>600</b> displays select attributes <b>612</b>, e.g. cost, quantity, location, etc. and some exemplary tasks <b>614</b>. A first task <b>614</b> may include &#x201c;replenish cola&#x201d; which may be used to create a new task to restock the cola <b>610</b>. A second task <b>614</b> may include &#x201c;get help with cola&#x201d; which may bring up additional information. A third task <b>614</b> may include &#x201c;cleanup, in aisle 21&#x201d; which may create a new task to indicate cleanup is required in the aisle with the soda <b>610</b>. Yet another task <b>614</b> may include &#x201c;reface, cola in aisle 21&#x201d; which may create a new task to indicate the cola <b>610</b> needs to be refaced. Selection of any of the tasks <b>614</b> may communicate with the server <b>120</b> and with other devices <b>110</b> for creating new tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">After scanning or reading a digital sign <b>620</b>, the screen shot <b>602</b> displays select attributes <b>622</b>, e.g. what is associated with the sign <b>620</b>, i.e. Men's Tee Shirts, and some exemplary tasks <b>624</b>. The exemplary tasks <b>624</b> may include &#x201c;New association&#x201d; which modifies what items are associated with the digital sign <b>620</b>, &#x201c;change display&#x201d; to create a new task to change the display of the digital sign <b>620</b>, &#x201c;restock Men's Tee Shirts&#x201d; to create a new task, and &#x201c;tidy rack <b>5</b>&#x201d; to create a new task to clean up the rack associated with the digital sign <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, a dataflow diagram illustrates management <b>700</b> of data in the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b> with the system <b>100</b>. First, data and symbology <b>710</b> is input to preprocessed data <b>720</b>. Here, data is input into the mobile devices <b>110</b>, the server <b>120</b>, the tags <b>140</b>, the barcodes <b>150</b>, and the other mechanisms <b>160</b>. This step is an initial setup where data is imported or setup up for the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b>. Next, actions <b>730</b> are variously defined. These may include default and custom actions. For each action <b>730</b>, attributes <b>740</b> are defined with data, type, etc. that may be displayed to a user on the mobile device <b>110</b>, based on the user's permissions. In operation, the management <b>700</b> enables a flexible, dynamic configuration for a user to interact with the end-to-end framework method <b>400</b>. That is, the interaction is not static, but is adaptable in context.</p>
