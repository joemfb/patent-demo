<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to controllers suitable for use in bathing systems and, more particularly, to controllers adapted to for identifying abnormal operational conditions in bathing systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A bathing system, such as a spa, typically includes various components such as a water holding receptacle, pumps to circulate water in a piping system, a heating module to heat the water, a filter system, an air blower, an ozone generator, a lighting system, and a control system for actuating and managing the various parameters of the bathing system components. Other types of bathing systems having similar components include, for instance, whirlpools, hot tubs, bathtubs, therapeutic baths, and swimming pools.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, the control system of a bathing system includes a controller to which are connected the various bathing system components. The controller is adapted to control the power supplied to each one of the connected components. The controller receives input signals from various input devices such as, for example, a plurality of sensors that monitor the various components of the bathing system and a control panel allowing a user to control various operational settings of these components. In response to the input signals, the controller actuates, or de-actuates, the various bathing system components by supplying power, or ceasing to supply power, to those components.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The components in a bathing system, including the controller, are susceptible to abnormal operational conditions in which they operate in manners that do not correspond to their respective normal operational conditions. An abnormal operational condition can result, for example, from an operational failure in one or multiple components of the bathing system. Such an operational failure in a bathing system component can be due to a mechanical or electronic malfunction in the component, or to the component experiencing operating conditions for which it was not designed to operate in. For instance, inappropriate operating conditions can result from a blockage or clogging of the piping system leading to a pump and to a heating module of the bathing system, resulting in the pump operating at an inadequate flow rate and the heating module operating with an insufficient water level. An abnormal operational condition can also result from a decrease in operational efficiency of one or multiple components of the bathing system due to wear of the components in time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, abnormal operational conditions associated with the bathing system remain undetected by the controller and are thus not attended to for a certain period of time. As a result, the one or multiple bathing system components causing the abnormal operational conditions continue to operate in conditions for which they were not designed to operate in. This usually leads to accelerated wear of, or permanent damage to, the one or multiple components of the bathing system, which eventually results in total operational failure of the one or multiple components. Consequently, it is normally only after the occurrence of a total operational failure of one or multiple components of the bathing system that an abnormal operational condition associated with the bathing system is detected. At that point, a bathing system service person or technician is typically brought in to investigate the abnormal operational condition experienced by the bathing system and to identify the potential component or components causing the abnormal operational condition. In doing so, the bathing system service person or technician typically has to run a series of tests on the controller and various bathing system components in order to pinpoint the one or multiple components responsible for the abnormal operational condition of the bathing system. The whole process is thus inconvenient, time-consuming and expensive for the bathing system owner, which is also likely to incur additional costs related to the repair or replacement of the malfunctioning bathing system components.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In light of the above, there is a need in the industry to provide a controller suitable for a bathing system that alleviates at least in part the problems associated with existing controllers.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with a broad aspect, the invention provides a controller suitable for identifying an abnormal operational condition in a bathing system. The bathing system includes a set of bathing unit components each being adapted for acquiring an actuated state and a non-actuated state. The bathing unit components draw an electrical current when in the actuated state. The controller comprises a memory unit adapted for storing measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system under normal operating conditions, each measurement being indicative of the electrical current being drawn by a respective bathing unit component when in the actuated state. The controller also comprises a processing unit in communication with the memory unit. The processing unit is adapted for modifying the measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system stored in the memory unit and for detecting an abnormal operational condition associated with the bathing system at least in part on the basis of measurements stored on the memory unit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with a specific implementation, the memory unit includes a non-volatile memory component on which the measurements indicative of the electrical currents drawn by bathing unit components are stored.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a first specific implementation, the controller comprises a port for receiving a signal conveying measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system under normal operating conditions. The processing unit is adapted for modifying the measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system stored in the memory unit on the basis of the signal received at the port. Advantageously, this allows for the measurements in the memory unit to be modified without requiring the memory unit to be physically replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a second specific implementation, the processing unit is adapted for acquiring a self-programming state. In the self-programming state, the processing unit is operative for obtaining measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system under normal operating conditions and for storing these measurements on the memory unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a specific implementation, in the self-programming state the processing unit is operative for sequentially causing each bathing unit component in the set of bathing unit components to toggle from one of the actuated state and the non-actuated state to the other of the actuated state and the non-actuated state to obtain measurements indicative of electrical currents, each measurement being indicative of the electrical current being drawn by a respective bathing unit component when in the actuated state.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with another specific implementation, to obtain a measurement indicative of electrical current drawn by a given bathing unit component in the set of bathing unit components, the processing unit causes the given bathing unit component to acquire the actuated state and causes the other bathing unit components in the set of bathing unit components to acquire the non-actuated state.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a non-limiting implementation, the processing unit includes a sensing circuit adapted for obtaining a measurement indicative of the electrical current being drawn by the bathing system. Optionally, the controller further includes sensing circuitry adapted for obtaining measurements associated to controller components, such as relays and fuses. This sensing circuitry allows identify controller components, such as relays and fuses, as potential causes of an abnormal operational condition associated with the bathing system.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a specific implementation, the processing unit derives an expected measurement of a current drawn by the bathing system at least in part on the basis of the bathing unit components actuated in the bathing system and the measurements stored on the memory unit. An actual measurement of the current drawn by the bathing system is also obtained. The processing unit then determines if the bathing system is experiencing an abnormal operational condition at least in part on the basis of the expected measurement of a current drawn by the bathing system and the actual measurement of a current drawn by the bathing system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with another specific implementation, the processing unit includes means responsive to the detection of an abnormal operational condition associated with the bathing system for causing a GFCI breaker in the bathing system to trip. Any suitable means responsive to the detection of an abnormal operational condition associated with the bathing system for causing a GFCI breaker in the bathing system to trip may be used without detracting from the spirit of the invention. In a non-limiting implementation, the means include a circuit for inducing a current leakage to the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a specific example of implementation, the processing unit is operative for identifying at least one bathing unit component potentially causing at least part of the abnormal operational condition of the bathing unit. The bathing unit component potentially causing at least part of the abnormal operational condition of the bathing unit may be a pump, an air blower, a heater, an ozonator, a CD player, a power supply or any other component of the bathing system. Optionally, the processing unit is operative for identifying the controller, or a component of the controller, as potentially causing at least part of the abnormal operational condition of the bathing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a specific implementation, the controller includes an output module in communication with the processing unit for conveying the abnormal operational condition associated to the bathing system.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In implementations where a bathing unit component has been identified as potentially causing at least part the abnormal operational condition of the bathing system, the output module is adapted for conveying information indicative of the identified bathing unit component. The information may be conveyed in any suitable format such as for example a visual or an audio format. When in a visual format, the output module is embodied as part of the user operable control console of the bathing system such as to be seen by the user. Alternatively, the output module is embodied as part of controller box and is intended to be seen by a bathing unit technician.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an alternative embodiment, the output module includes a transmitter operative to transmit a signal conveying an abnormal operational condition associated to the bathing system. The transmitter is operative to transmit the signal over a wireless link, such as a radio frequency (RF) link or an infra-red (IR) link or over a wire-line link to a remote peripheral device. The peripheral device is equipped with the corresponding receiver equipment to receive the signal from the transmitter and convey the information contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with a specific implementation, the controller includes a plurality of actuators associated to respective bathing unit components. The processing unit controls the plurality of actuators such as to cause the bathing unit components in the set of bathing unit components to acquire either one of the actuated state or the non-actuated state. In a non-limiting implementation, the processing unit obtains measurements indicative of the state of the plurality of actuators. These measurements may include measurements of the currents through and voltages across the actuators. The processing unit is operative for identifying an actuator in the plurality of actuators as potentially causing at least part of the abnormal operational condition of the bathing unit at least in part on the basis of the measurements obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with a broad aspect, the invention provides a controller in a bathing system having a set of bathing unit components and a controller. Each bathing unit component is adapted for acquiring an actuated state and a non-actuated state, the bathing unit components drawing an electrical current when in the actuated state. The controller comprises a memory unit adapted for storing measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system under normal operating conditions, each measurement being indicative of the electrical current being drawn by a respective bathing unit component when in the actuated state. The controller also includes a processing unit in communication with the memory unit. The processing unit is adapted for modifying the measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system stored in the memory unit and for detecting an abnormal operational condition associated with the bathing system at least in part on the basis of measurements stored on the memory unit.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with another broad aspect, the invention provides a controller suitable for identifying an abnormal operational condition in a bathing system. The controller comprises a plurality of fuses, a burned fuse sensing circuit and a processing unit. The burned fuse sensing circuit is adapted for detecting a burned fuse in the plurality of fuses. The burned fuse sensing circuit is responsive to the presence of a burned fuse for releasing a burned fuse indicator signal. The processing unit is in communication with the burned fuse sensing circuit and receives the burned fuse indicator signal. In response to the receipt of the burned fuse indicator signal, the processing unit detects an abnormal operational condition of the bathing system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with another broad aspect, the invention provides a controller suitable for use in a bathing system. The bathing system includes a set of bathing unit components, each bathing unit component being adapted for acquiring an actuated state and a non-actuated state, the bathing unit components drawing an electrical current when in the actuated state. The controller comprises a plurality of actuators associated to respective bathing unit components and a processing unit in communication with the plurality of actuators. The processing unit is operative for controlling the plurality of actuators such as to cause the bathing unit components in the set of bathing unit components to acquire either one of the actuated state or the non-actuated state. The processing unit is also adapted for obtaining measurements indicative reaction times associated to the actuators in the plurality of actuators and for storing the measurements obtained on a memory unit.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a specific implementation, the processing unit is operative for detecting an abnormal operational condition associated with an actuator in the plurality of actuators at least in part on the basis of measurements stored on the memory unit.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a specific implementation, at least some actuators in the plurality of actuators are adapted for acquiring either one of a closed status and an open status for causing bathing unit components to acquire either one of the actuated state or the non-actuated state. In this specific implementation, the measurements indicative reaction times associated to the actuators in the plurality of actuators include opening reaction times and closing reaction times. The processing unit is adapted for causing a given actuator to acquire the closed status when a voltage across the given actuator is near zero. The processing unit is also adapted for causing a given actuator to acquire the open status when a current through the given actuator is near zero.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with a specific example, the processing unit obtains a measurement indicative of an actual reaction time associated with a given actuator in the plurality of actuators and is adapted to detect an abnormal operational condition associated with a given actuator at least in part on the basis the actual reaction time and a certain threshold reaction time. In accordance with an alternative implementation, the processing unit obtains a measurement indicative of an actual reaction time associated with a given actuator in the plurality of actuators and detects an abnormal operational condition associated with a given actuator at least in part on the basis the actual reaction time and a certain range of accepted reaction times. The certain threshold reaction time and the certain range of accepted reaction times may be derived at least in part on the basis of past measurements obtained by the processing unit or alternatively may be set to a default threshold reaction time or default range of accepted reaction times.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with another broad aspect, the invention provides a method for programming a controller of a bathing system. The bathing system includes a set of bathing unit components, each bathing unit component being adapted for acquiring an actuated state and a non-actuated state, the bathing unit components drawing an electrical current when in the actuated state. The method comprises obtaining measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system, each measurement being indicative of the electrical current being drawn by a respective bathing unit component when in the actuated state. The method also includes storing the measurements on a memory unit in communication with the controller.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the drawings, the embodiments of the invention are illustrated by way of examples. It is to be expressly understood that the description and drawings are only for the purpose of illustration and are an aid for understanding. They are not intended to be a definition of the limits of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The description below is directed to a specific implementation of the invention in which the bathing system is embodied as a spa system. It is to be understood that the term &#x201c;spa system&#x201d;, as used for the purposes of the present description, refers to spas, whirlpools, hot tubs, bathtubs, therapeutic baths, swimming pools and any other type of bathing system that can be equipped with a control system for controlling various operational settings.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a spa system <b>10</b> in accordance with a specific example of implementation. The spa system <b>10</b> includes a spa receptacle <b>18</b> for holding water, a plurality of jets <b>20</b>, a set of drains <b>22</b> and a control system. In the non-limiting embodiment shown, the control system includes a control panel <b>32</b>, a controller <b>30</b>, and a plurality of sensors <b>70</b> that monitor the various components of the spa. For example, the sensors <b>70</b> may include temperature and liquid level sensors to respectively monitor the water temperature and water level at various locations in the spa system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the specific embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the spa system <b>10</b> further includes a plurality of spa components including a heating module <b>60</b>, two water pumps <b>11</b> &#x26; <b>12</b>, a filter <b>26</b> and an air blower <b>24</b>. It should be understood that the spa system <b>10</b> could include more or less spa components without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the spa system <b>10</b> could include a lighting system for lighting up the water in the receptacle <b>18</b>, multimedia devices such as a CD/DVD player and any other suitable device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In normal operation, water flows from the spa receptacle <b>18</b>, through drain <b>22</b> and is pumped by water pump <b>12</b> through heating module <b>60</b> where the water is heated. The heated water then leaves the heating module <b>60</b> and re-enters the spa receptacle <b>18</b> through jets <b>20</b>. In addition, water flows from the spa receptacle <b>18</b>, through drain <b>22</b> and is pumped by water pump <b>11</b> through filter <b>26</b>. The filtered water then re-enters the spa receptacle <b>18</b> through jets <b>20</b>. Water can flow through these two cycles continuously while the spa system <b>10</b> is in operation. For its part, the air blower <b>24</b> is operative for delivering air bubbles to the spa receptacle <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Generally, each one of the components of the spa system <b>10</b> is capable of acquiring both an actuated state and a non-actuated state. In an actuated state, a given component of the spa system <b>10</b> receives power by drawing an electrical current at a certain voltage from the controller <b>30</b> via a respective electrical cable and utilizes the received power to perform the function for which it was designed. Conversely, in a non-actuated state, the given component does not receive power from the controller <b>30</b> and is essentially turned off. For instance, when in an actuated state, pump <b>12</b> draws an electrical current at a certain voltage from the controller <b>30</b> in order to perform the function for which it was designed, which is basically to pump water from receptacle <b>18</b> through drains <b>22</b>, into heating module <b>60</b>, and back into receptacle <b>18</b> through jets <b>20</b>. When in a non-actuated state, pump <b>12</b> does not draw any current from the controller <b>30</b> and thus does not perform any pumping action.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The control system is operative for monitoring and controlling the various components of the spa system <b>10</b>. The control panel <b>32</b> of the control system is typically in the form of a user interface that allows a user to enter commands for controlling the various operational settings of the spa. Some non-limiting examples of operational settings of the spa include temperature control settings, jet control settings, and lighting settings. In a non-limiting embodiment where the spa is connected to entertainment and/or multimedia modules, the operational settings of the spa may also include audio settings and video settings, amongst others. Consequently, the expression &#x201c;operational settings&#x201d;, for the purpose of the present invention, is intended to cover operational settings for any suitable equipment that can be used by a spa bather.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The control system receives electrical power from an electric power source <b>29</b> that is connected to the controller <b>30</b> via service wiring <b>31</b>. The controller <b>30</b> is then able to control the distribution of power supplied to the various spa components on the basis of control signals received from the various sensors <b>70</b> and the control panel <b>32</b> in order to cause the desired operational settings to be implemented. Amongst other functions, the controller <b>30</b> is adapted to control the power supplied to each spa component such that it acquires the actuated or non-actuated state. In a non-limiting implementation, the power source <b>29</b> is connected to the controller <b>30</b> via service wiring <b>31</b> which is passed through a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) <b>86</b>. The GFCI <b>86</b> is adapted for tripping in the presence of a current leakage to the ground. The ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) <b>86</b> provides an added safety measure to the spa system.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The power source <b>29</b> supplies the controller <b>30</b>, via service wiring <b>31</b>, with any conventional power service suitable for residential or commercial use. In a non-limiting implementation, the power source <b>29</b> can supply 240 volts (V) AC to the controller <b>30</b> via service wiring <b>31</b>. In an alternative non-limiting implementation, the power source <b>29</b> can supply 120 volts (V) AC to the controller <b>30</b> via service wiring <b>31</b>. In an alternative non-limiting implementation, the power source <b>29</b> can supply 120 Volts and 240 Volts AC to the controller <b>30</b> via service wiring <b>31</b>. It is to be appreciated that other voltage supply values or voltage supply combinations, for example depending on geographical location, are possible without detracting from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In operation, the various components of the spa system <b>10</b> will either be in a respective actuated state or in a respective non-actuated state, with each component in an actuated state drawing a certain current from the controller <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the total electrical current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b> at any point in time will be dependent on which components are in the actuated state and which components are in the non-actuated state. More specifically, the total electrical current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b> at any point in time will be essentially the sum of the respective electrical current drawn by each spa component in an actuated state. Hence, the electrical current supplied by the power source <b>29</b> to the controller <b>30</b> via service wiring <b>31</b> can be monitored in order to derive information relating to the operational state of the spa system <b>10</b> in general or of particular components of the spa system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram of a controller <b>30</b> in accordance with a specific example of implementation is illustrated. The controller <b>30</b> includes a processing module <b>40</b>, a memory unit <b>48</b> in communication with the processing module <b>40</b>, and a circuit element <b>50</b> that is adapted to convert power received from the power source <b>29</b> via service wiring <b>31</b> into a particular voltage and/or current to be supplied to a given spa component <b>47</b> connected to the controller <b>30</b>. Amongst other elements, the circuit element <b>50</b> includes a set of actuators <b>52</b>, such as switches, relays, contactors, or triacs, each adapted to enable or prevent the flow of an electrical current to a respective component <b>47</b> of the spa system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The memory unit <b>48</b> stores measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system under normal operating conditions, each measurement being indicative of the electrical current being drawn by a respective bathing unit component when in the actuated state. The measurements stored in memory unit <b>48</b> are the expected measurements for the bathing unit components when in the actuated state and when operating under normal operational conditions. The processing module <b>40</b> is also adapted for modifying the measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system stored in the memory unit. The processing module is in communication with the memory unit <b>48</b> and is adapted for detecting an abnormal operational condition associated with the bathing system at least in part on the basis of measurements stored on the memory unit <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a first non-limiting implementation, the controller <b>30</b> includes a port for receiving a signal conveying measurements associated to the bathing system under normal operating conditions. The port may include either a wireless interface or a wire-line interface without detracting from the spirit of the invention. The processing unit is adapted for modifying the measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system stored in the memory unit on the basis of the signal received. This allows for example an auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> to upload measurement data to the processing module <b>40</b> such as to cause the measurement values in the memory unit <b>48</b> to be modified.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a second non-limiting implementation, the processing module <b>40</b> is adapted for acquiring a self-programming state and a monitoring state.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the self-programming state, the processing module <b>40</b> is operative for obtaining measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the spa system <b>10</b>, each measurement being indicative of the electrical current being drawn by a respective component <b>47</b> of the spa system <b>10</b> when the component is in an actuated state. The processing module <b>40</b> is further operative for storing the obtained measurements in the memory unit <b>48</b>. In an alternative implementation, in the self-programming state the processing unit being also obtains measurements indicative reaction times associated to the actuators in circuit element <b>50</b> and stores the measurements in the memory unit <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the monitoring state, the processing module <b>40</b> is operative for detecting an abnormal operational condition associated with the spa system <b>10</b> at least in part on the basis of measurements stored in the memory unit <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the non-limiting example of implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the processing module <b>40</b> includes a sensing unit <b>44</b> and a control unit <b>58</b>. The sensing unit <b>44</b> is adapted for obtaining measurements indicative of the electrical current being drawn by the spa system <b>10</b>. The sensing unit <b>44</b> is adapted to measure the current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b> and to generate a signal indicative of the measured current, the generated signal being transmitted to the control unit <b>58</b>. Upon receiving the signal generated by the sensing unit <b>44</b>, the control unit <b>58</b> is adapted to process the received signal in order to extract the information indicative of the electrical current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b>. The control unit <b>58</b> is also adapted to store the extracted information in the memory unit <b>48</b> such that the information may be used by the processing module <b>40</b> at a later time. The memory unit <b>48</b> may be implemented using any suitable memory device such as an EPROM, EEPROM, RAM, FLASH, disc or any other suitable type of memory device. In a preferred implementation, the memory device <b>48</b> includes a non-volatile memory component and the control unit <b>58</b> stores the extracted information in the non-volatile memory component of memory unit <b>48</b>. As further detailed below, the extracted information is used in the self-programming state and in the monitoring state of the processing module <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The control unit <b>58</b> is also adapted to receive command signals from the control panel <b>32</b> in response to user input commands entered at the control panel <b>32</b> and from the various sensors <b>70</b> in the spa system <b>10</b>. Optionally, the control unit <b>58</b> may also be adapted to communicate with an auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b>, such as a laptop, a PDA or a cellular phone to receive command signals therefrom or to transmit information to be conveyed to a human. The control unit <b>58</b> may communication with auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> over a wireless link or a wire-line link without detracting from the spirit of the invention. For example, the link between the auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> and the control unit <b>58</b> can be configured to be used as a serial link such as RS-232, RS-485 or other serial link standard. In an alternative example, the link between the auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> and the control unit <b>58</b> may be a wireless link such as a RF or IR link. In such an alternative example, the controller <b>30</b> includes a transmitter adapted to transmit signals over the wireless link to auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b>. The auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> is equipped with a corresponding wireless receiver to receive the signals transmitted by the controller transmitter. The control unit <b>58</b> is in communication with the circuit element <b>50</b> and is adapted to control the operation of each of the various actuators <b>52</b> of the circuit element <b>50</b> such as to enable or prevent the flow of an electrical current to a respective component <b>47</b> of the spa system <b>10</b>. In other words, the control unit <b>58</b> is adapted to control the circuit element <b>50</b> such as to cause any given spa component <b>47</b> connected to the controller <b>30</b> to acquire an actuated state or a non-actuated state on the basis of the signals received from the control panel <b>32</b>, the sensors <b>70</b> and (optionally) the auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b>. In a non-limiting implementation, the controller <b>30</b> maintains a list of the spa component <b>47</b> in the system <b>10</b> with their respective current desired states.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although they are shown as separate elements, it is to be understood that the functionality of the sensing unit <b>44</b> and the control unit <b>58</b> could be integrated into a single element without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. It will be also appreciated that the functionality of the processing module <b>40</b> may be implemented as a programmable logic block or by using any suitable hardware, software or combination thereof. Similarly, the processing module <b>40</b> and the memory unit <b>48</b> can be integrated into a single physical element or be implemented as distinct elements without detracting from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Moreover, it is also to be understood that the processing module <b>40</b>, the memory unit <b>48</b>, and the circuit element <b>50</b> could be part of a single printed-circuit board mounted within the housing of the controller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The sensing unit <b>44</b> may be embodied in any suitable sensing circuit adapted for obtaining measurements associated to current, voltage or to both current and voltage. In a specific embodiment, the sensing unit <b>44</b> includes a current sensor adapted to measure the current drawn from the power source <b>29</b> by the spa system <b>10</b> via service wiring <b>31</b> and to generate a signal indicative of the measured current. The sensing unit <b>44</b> may also include a voltage sensor to measure the voltage being supplied by the power source <b>29</b> and a phase detection circuit to measure the phase between the current drawn from and the voltage supplied by the power source <b>29</b>. Such current sensors, voltage sensors and phase detection circuits are well known and understood by those skilled in the art and thus will not be described any further in the present description. It will be appreciated that the sensing unit <b>44</b> may be adapted for measuring the AC values of the voltage or, alternatively, the sensing unit <b>44</b> may be connected on the secondary side of an AC/DC transformer and obtain a DC measurement of the voltage. In such the alternative implementation, the control unit <b>58</b> may be adapted to derive the equivalent AC voltage on the basis of the DC voltage measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> of the drawings shows a non-limiting alternative example of implementation of the controller <b>30</b> having a sensing unit comprising a voltmeter <b>902</b>, a voltage phase detector <b>904</b>, a current phase detector <b>906</b>, a current sensor <b>908</b>, a fuse monitor <b>910</b> and a plurality of voltage detectors <b>900</b> associated to respective spa components <b>47</b><i>a</i>-<b>47</b><i>d</i>. The various devices of the sensing unit are adapted for providing control unit <b>58</b> with various operational parameters of the spa system. It will be appreciated that embodiments of the sensing unit including fewer or additional devices are possible without detracting from the spirit of the invention. In addition, the components of the sensing unit may be distributed without detracting from the spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In an embodiment in which the sensing unit <b>44</b> includes a current sensor, a voltage detector, and a phase detection circuit, the signal generated by the sensing unit <b>44</b> and transmitted to the control unit <b>58</b> includes information conveying the magnitude of the current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b>, the magnitude of the voltage supplied to the spa system <b>10</b>, and the phase between the drawn current and the supplied voltage. The control unit <b>58</b> extracts and uses the current, voltage and phase information conveyed by the signal in order to establish the real and reactive components of the current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b> and the voltage supplied thereto. Optionally, the current, voltage, and phase information contained in the signal generated by the sensing unit <b>44</b> are processed in order to establish the real and reactive components of the power supplied to the spa system <b>10</b> along with the power factor of the system. Mathematically, the relationship between the various current, voltage, power and phase measures can be expressed by the following equations:</p>

where I<sub>real </sub>is the real current and I<sub>reactive </sub>is the reactive current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b>; V<sub>real </sub>is the real voltage and V<sub>reactive </sub>is the reactive voltage supplied to the spa system <b>10</b>; P<sub>real </sub>is the real power and P<sub>reactive </sub>is the reactive power supplied to the spa system <b>10</b>; and pf is the power factor of the system. As can be seen by the above noted equations, each of the above measures may be obtained on the basis of measurements of either the rms (root-mean-square) value I<sub>rms </sub>or the peak value I of the current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b>, of either the rms value V<sub>rms </sub>or the peak value V of the voltage supplied to the spa system <b>10</b>, and of the phase &#x3b8; between the measured current and voltage. Consequently, the sensing circuit may be adapted for providing either one of these measurements to the control unit <b>58</b> since the remaining measurements may be derived on the basis of the above described equations. For the purpose of the remainder of this specification, a sensing circuit <b>44</b> adapted for obtaining a current measurement will be described. It will be readily appreciated that the description below also applies when the sensing circuit <b>44</b> is adapted for obtaining voltage and phase measurements.
</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As mentioned previously, the control unit <b>58</b> is adapted to process the received signal from the sensing unit <b>44</b> in order to extract the information conveyed by the signal. In an embodiment in which the sensing unit <b>44</b> includes only a current sensor, the extracted information will convey the current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b>. In an embodiment in which the sensing unit <b>44</b> includes a current sensor, a voltage detector, and a phase detection circuit, the extracted information will convey the current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b>, the voltage and power supplied to the spa system <b>10</b>, and the power factor of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As will now be described, the control unit <b>58</b> is configured such as to allow the processing module <b>40</b> to acquire a self-programming state and a monitoring state.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Self-Programming State</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the self-programming state, the processing module <b>40</b> obtains information indicative of the electrical current drawn by each particular component <b>47</b> of the spa system <b>10</b> that is connected to the controller <b>30</b> when that particular component is in an actuated state. In other words, in the self-programming state, the processing module <b>40</b> obtains a set of measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the spa system <b>10</b>, each measurement being indicative of the electrical current being drawn by a respective component <b>47</b> when in the actuated state. Optionally, voltage measurements, phase measurements, actuator de-actuation/actuation delays and power factor measurements may also be obtained during the self-programming state. The measurements are obtained by the sensing circuit <b>44</b> and processed by the control unit <b>58</b>. Furthermore, the obtained measurements are stored in the memory unit <b>48</b> so that they can be retrieved and used by the processing module <b>40</b> at a later time. For example, when the processing module <b>40</b> is in the monitoring state, as described further below, it makes use of the information stored in the memory unit <b>48</b> in order to detect an abnormal operational condition with the spa system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Optionally, during manufacturing of the controller <b>30</b>, the maximum allowable current rating of each output of the controller <b>30</b> can be stored in the memory unit <b>48</b>. Now, by monitoring the current being supplied to each spa component <b>47</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> consequently has knowledge of the current passing through the respective output to which each spa component <b>47</b> is connected. The processing module <b>40</b> can thus determine if the current passing through each output of the controller <b>30</b> is below the maximum allowable current rating of the output and, if this is not the case, can control the operation of the circuit element <b>50</b> such as to prevent power from being supplied to the spa component <b>47</b> connected to the output. Accordingly, this prevents permanent damage to the controller <b>30</b> as a result of electrical currents above the maximum allowable current rating of the outputs of the controller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart representing a specific non-limiting implementation of processes implement in the self-programming state of the processing module <b>40</b>. It is to be understood that a myriad of other implementations of the self-programming state can be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Such alternative implementations will become apparent to the person skilled in the art in light of the present specification and as such will not be described further here.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at step <b>100</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> enters the self-programming state. In a particular embodiment, this step is automatically executed upon powering of the spa system <b>10</b>. In an alternative embodiment, this step may be executed at any time upon reception by the processing module <b>40</b> of a signal indicative of an explicit command to enter the self-programming state. The signal could be generated in response to an explicit command entered, for instance, at the control panel <b>32</b> or at the auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> in communication with the processing module <b>40</b>. In yet another alternative embodiment, this step may be executed periodically at a predetermined period. In yet another alternative embodiment, the self-programming can be done during the normal operation of the spa system. For example, the processing module <b>40</b> could monitor the first five (5) times that each spa component is turned ON or OFF and obtain measurements for that specific spa component. These measurements will then be store in memory <b>48</b>. This alternative embodiment has the advantage to not interfere with the normal operation of the spa system. Upon completion of this step, the processing module <b>40</b> proceeds to step <b>102</b>. At step <b>102</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> obtains a measurement of the current intensity for the spa system <b>10</b>. At step <b>104</b>, a selected spa component <b>47</b> in the set of spa components is caused to acquire the actuated state. For instance, this can be achieved by the control unit <b>58</b> controlling the operation of the circuit element <b>50</b> such as to allow power to be supplied to the desired spa component <b>47</b>. Optionally, the spa components in the set of spa components, other that the selected spa component, are caused to acquire the de-actuated state. It will be appreciated that the spa components in the set of spa components, other that the selected spa component need not be de-actuated in all implementations. For instance it is possible to derived measurements associated with the selected spa component by taking a difference between the current measurement prior to actuation of the selected spa component and subsequent to the actuation thereof. In yet another alternative implementation, the selected spa component may originally be in the actuated state and be de-actuated at step <b>104</b>. The current measurement to be attributed to the selected spa component is again the difference between the current measurement prior to de-actuation of the selected spa component and subsequent to the de-actuation thereof. Therefore, by toggling between the actuated state and the de-actuated state, a current measurement to be attributed to the selected spa component can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">At step <b>106</b>, the processing module obtains a measurement of the current intensity to be attributed to the selected spa component. At step <b>108</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> performs a set of tests to determine if the spa component <b>47</b> is properly connect to the controller <b>30</b>. In a non-limiting implementation, the processing module <b>40</b> compares the current intensity measured prior to the actuation of the spa component <b>47</b> and the current intensity measured subsequent the actuation of the spa component to determine if the current intensity to be attributed to the spa component <b>47</b> lies within a current boundary. In a non-limiting example of implementation, the current boundary is a range of acceptable current measurement values.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Optionally, the processing module <b>40</b> is adapted for compensating the range of acceptable current measurement values on the basis of a voltage measurement taken at the power input. More specifically, a voltage variation at the power source will affect the current being drawn by each bathing component. Therefore, in accordance with a non-limiting implementation, the processing unit <b>40</b> is adapted for obtaining measurements indicative of electrical voltages applied to the bathing system and for deriving a data element conveying a variation in the electrical voltage applied to the bathing system from the nominal input voltage. The variation in the electrical voltage applied to the bathing system from the nominal input voltage is processed to derive a corresponding adjusted range of acceptable current measurement values. As such if the voltage applied is rated at a 240V nominal and the input voltage drops to 220V for some type of loads, the current drawn should also drop in the same proportion. The processing unit <b>40</b> makes use of the measurement of the voltage at the supply end to make a correction to the expected range of acceptable current measurement values to derive adjusted range of acceptable current measurement values.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the tests applied at step <b>108</b> are not passed successfully, meaning that the current intensity to be attributed to the spa component <b>47</b> does not lie within the current boundary, the system proceeds to step <b>110</b> where an error handling process is initiated. The error handling process will be described in greater detail further on in the specification with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">If the tests applied at step <b>108</b> is passed successfully, meaning that the current intensity to be attributed to the spa component <b>47</b> lies within the current boundary, the system proceeds to step <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">At step <b>114</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> obtains a plurality of the measurements. The types of measurements obtained will differ from one implementation to another and will be affected by the functionality of the sensing unit <b>44</b>. Accordingly, although the specific implementations of the self-programming state of the processing module <b>40</b> are adapted to obtain and store information indicative of the electrical current drawn by each component <b>47</b> of the spa system when in an actuated state, it will be appreciated that, in other implementations, the processing module <b>40</b> may be operative to obtain and store information indicative of any suitable desired parameter suitable to be conveyed by a signal generated by the sensing unit <b>44</b>. For example, the sensing unit <b>44</b> may be configured to include a current sensor, a voltage detector to measure the voltage being supplied by the power source <b>29</b> and a phase detection circuit to measure the phase between the current drawn from and the voltage supplied by the power source <b>29</b>. Consequently, the signal transmitted by the sensing unit <b>44</b> may include any combinations of electrical parameters for transmission to control unit <b>58</b>. In a specific example of implementation, the control unit <b>58</b> extracts the information contained in the signal generated by the sensing unit <b>44</b> and processes that information to extract therefrom the following information data elements:

<p id="p-0084" num="0093">In will be appreciated that in order to obtain certain ones of the above noted measurements, the control unit <b>58</b> may need to cause the actuator corresponding to the selected spa component to be actuated and de-actuated.

<p id="p-0085" num="0094">At step <b>116</b>, the measurements obtained at step <b>114</b> are compared to reference measurements to determine whether the measurements are reasonable. In a non-limiting example of implementations, the measurements obtained at step <b>114</b> are compared to acceptable ranges of measurements.

<p id="p-0086" num="0095">Optionally, at step <b>116</b>, the control unit <b>58</b> processes the measurements obtained at step <b>114</b> to associate the selected spa component with a corresponding spa component type selected from a set of spa component types. In effect, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that electrical parameters are different for each type of spa components, such as a pump, a heater, a power supply or a blower, and are even different for each model of spa component in a given type of spa components. Accordingly, in this variant, memory unit <b>48</b> is adapted to store a set of electrical parameters for a respective types of spa components and, optionally, for a set of models of each type of spa component. The control unit <b>58</b> accesses the set of electrical parameters of each spa component type from the memory unit <b>48</b> and compares the set of electrical parameters to the measurement obtained at step <b>114</b> in order to associate the selected spa component to a certain type of spa component.

In other words, a human operator, such as a spa manufacturer or spa technician, does not need to manually configure the controller <b>30</b> in order to program into the controller <b>30</b> knowledge of the specific type of spa component that is connected to each one of its connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0096">At step <b>118</b>, the processing unit updates the characteristics of the selected spa component in memory unit <b>48</b> with the measurements obtained at step <b>114</b>.

In a non-limiting implementation, the control unit <b>58</b> stores in the memory unit <b>48</b> the measurements as established in step <b>114</b> along with an identifier for the selected component <b>47</b>. The identifier of the selected component <b>47</b> could be, for example, the connector of the controller <b>30</b> to which the selected component <b>47</b> is connected.

<p id="p-0089" num="0098">At step <b>122</b>, a verification of the measurement stored in the memory unit <b>48</b> is effected by simulating a real spa system usage situation.

The port may include either a wireless interface or a wire-line interface without detracting from the spirit of the invention. The measurements indicative of electrical currents drawn by the bathing system stored in the memory unit <b>48</b> may then be modified on the basis of the signal received. This allows for example an auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> to upload measurement data to the processing module <b>40</b> such as to cause the measurement values in the memory unit <b>48</b> to be modified.

An abnormal operational condition associated with the spa system <b>10</b> could also result from a decrease in operational efficiency of one or multiple spa components <b>47</b> due to wear of the components in time.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0105">When such an abnormal operational condition is experienced by the spa system <b>10</b>, the electrical parameters of the spa system, including the electrical current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b>, will vary.

The processing module <b>40</b> then proceeds to step <b>518</b> where the processing module <b>40</b> waits for the next initiation of the monitoring state.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0119">At step <b>510</b>, the second stream of the monitoring state is initiated periodically either at preset time intervals or random intervals. Optionally, the second stream of the monitoring state may also initiated upon reception by the processing module <b>40</b> of a signal indicative of an explicit command to enter the monitoring state. The signal could be generated in response to an explicit command entered, for instance, at the control panel <b>32</b> or at the auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> in communication with the processing module <b>40</b>. Following step <b>510</b> the processing module <b>40</b> proceeds to step <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0120">At step <b>512</b> the processing module <b>40</b> receives diagnostic information from the sensing unit <b>44</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and optionally at step <b>514</b> maintains a record of the diagnostic information in a memory unit such as memory unit <b>48</b>. In a non-limiting implementation, at step <b>512</b> the processing module <b>40</b> is adapted for obtaining actual measurements of the current drawn by the spa system and, optionally, voltage measurements, phase measurements and any other suitable diagnostic measurements.

In a non-limiting implementation, the processing module <b>40</b> is adapted for computing an expected measurement of the current drawn that should be drawn by the spa system on the basis of the set of actuated and de-actuated spa components. In a non-limiting implementation, the processing module <b>40</b> compares the actual measurement of the current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b> to the expected measurement of the current. In a non-limiting implementation, the processing module <b>40</b> determines whether or not the actual measurement of the current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b> is within a certain range from the expected measurement of the current. The certain range could be expressed in absolute terms (e.g., &#xb1;2 amps (A)) or in relative terms as a percentage of the expected measurement of the current (e.g., &#xb1;5% of the expected measurement of the current). In the event that the actual measurements obtained do not lie within acceptable expected measurement limits, the processing module <b>40</b> proceeds to step <b>516</b> where an error handling process is initiated.

<p id="p-0113" num="0122">The above described self-programming state and monitoring state allow the processing module <b>40</b> to detect the presence of an abnormal condition associated with the spa system <b>10</b>.

At step <b>402</b>, the processing unit <b>40</b> identifies a potential cause for at least part of the abnormal operational condition. Identifying a potential cause of at least part of the abnormal operational condition may be effected in a plurality of different manners. The potential cause of the abnormal operational condition may be a component of the spa system or may be a portion of the controller. Optionally, the processing unit <b>40</b> may also be adapted for identifying that maintenance is required. The spa component potentially causing at least part of the abnormal operational condition of the spa system may be for example a pump, an air blower, a heater, an ozonator, a CD player, a power supply, a fuse or any other device in the spa system. The portion of the controller potentially causing at least part of the abnormal operational condition of the spa system may be for example one or more burned fuses, an actuator, a defective trace in the PCB board implementing the controller or some other component.

For example, the message may be displayed on the controller module, on any component of the bathing system, on a dedicated user interface, on a user operable console of a spa system, on an external direct wire device, on a display device positioned on the skirt of the bathing unit or on a device positioned remotely from the controller and in wireless communication with the controller. In a specific non-limiting implementation, the device may be positioned remotely from the controller and in wireless communication with the controller and can be installed for example inside a house.</p>

The signal may include information indicative of the identified bathing unit component potentially causing at least part the abnormal operational condition of the bathing system. The transmitter/transceiver is operative to transmit the signal over either one of a wireless link, such as a radio frequency (RF) link or infra-red (IR) link, or alternatively over a wire-line link. The transmitter/transceiver communicates with an auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b>, such as a laptop, a PDA or a cellular phone to convey information to a human.

<p id="p-0120" num="0134">In a non-limiting implementation, where the identified potential cause of at least part of the abnormal operational condition is a spa component, the processing module <b>40</b> is operative for causing the identified spa component <b>47</b> to acquire a non-actuated state.

Accordingly, the controller <b>30</b> can thus have the capability to identify and de-actuate the particular one or multiple spa components <b>47</b> that are operating in conditions that do not correspond to their respective normal operating conditions. This prevents spa components <b>47</b>, and the controller <b>30</b>, from being permanently damaged as a result of operation in conditions for which they were not intended to operate in. In this fashion, the processing module <b>40</b> can prevent an output of the controller <b>30</b> from allowing the passage of a current above its maximum allowable current rating. By de-actuating the spa component potentially causing the abnormal operational condition of the spa system <b>10</b>, the processing module can prevent the current from exceeding the breaker rating thereby preventing damage to the controller or preventing a fuse to blow.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0137">In a non-limiting implementation, to identify one or more spa components potentially causing at least part of the abnormal operational condition of the spa system <b>10</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> sequentially toggles the spa components from one of the actuated state and the non-actuated state to the other of the actuated state and the non-actuated state to obtain measurements indicative of electrical currents, each measurement being indicative of an actual electrical current being drawn by a respective component <b>47</b> when in the actuated state. The processing module <b>40</b> can then process the obtained measurements on the basis of the measurements stored in the memory unit <b>48</b> in order to identify at least one spa component <b>47</b> potentially causing at least part of the abnormal operational condition of the spa system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0138">In accordance with a variant, processing module <b>40</b> is configured to monitor the evolution in time of the electrical current drawn by each spa component <b>47</b> in order to monitor the wear experienced by the component. For example, by monitoring variations in time of the reactive and real components of the current drawn by a given spa component <b>47</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> can determine whether the given spa component <b>47</b> has experienced a certain level of wear. As another example, an aging pump or a dirty filter will increase Ireactive and Ireal. Similarly, a sudden increase of the power factor gives an indication that something may be blocking the water intake causing a flow reduction in the pump circuit. Upon establishing that a given spa component <b>47</b> has experienced a certain level of wear, the processing module <b>40</b> can convey this information to a human operator, for instance, via a display module on the control panel <b>32</b> or on the auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The human operator is then informed of the potentially worn out spa component <b>47</b> and can take appropriate preemptive action, such as repairing or replacing the worn component, before the worn out component experiences an operational failure which could result in significant damage to the spa system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0139">In accordance with another variant, processing module <b>40</b> may be configured to monitor the operation of each actuator <b>52</b> of the circuit element <b>50</b> in order to detect any malfunction of the actuators <b>52</b>. For instance, the processing module <b>40</b> monitors the time taken for each actuator <b>52</b> to close (or open) when the corresponding spa component <b>47</b> is actuated (or de-actuated). By using the opening and closing reaction times of each switch <b>52</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> can determine if the monitored time taken for a given actuator <b>52</b> to close (or open) is within a certain range of the closing (or opening) reaction time stored in the memory unit <b>48</b> for that given actuator <b>52</b>. For example, if the time taken by a given actuator <b>52</b> to open exceeds by a certain amount the stored opening reaction time of that given actuator <b>52</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> can determine that the contact elements of that given actuator <b>52</b> are damaged or are stuck together. A warning message can then be conveyed to a human operator, for instance, via a display module on the control panel <b>32</b> or on the auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) such that appropriate preemptive action can be taken.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0140">In accordance with another variant, processing module <b>40</b> is configured to monitor the power factor of the spa system <b>10</b>. Through measurements of the phase between the current drawn by the spa system <b>10</b> and the voltage supplied by the power source <b>29</b> to the spa system <b>10</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> can directly compute the value of power factor of the spa system <b>10</b> and monitor its variation in time. For example, an abnormally high reading of a power factor for a spa component such as a pump, may indicate that the pump is probably running dry (without water). In response to such a situation the processing module may cause a warning message to be conveyed to a human operator, for instance, via a display module on the control panel <b>32</b> or on the auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> such that appropriate preemptive action can be taken.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0141">In accordance with yet another variant, processing module <b>40</b> may be configured to monitor the fuses of the spa system <b>10</b> to detect a burned fuse. In the non-limiting example of implementation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the sensing unit <b>44</b> includes fuses monitor <b>910</b>. The fuses monitor <b>910</b> is comprised of a burned fuse sensing circuit adapted for detecting a burned fuse in the plurality of fuses <b>912</b>. The burned fuse sensing circuit may be implemented using any suitable technique for detecting a burned fuse. A non-limiting example of implementation of a suitable fuse sensing circuit is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The burned fuse sensing circuit is responsive to the presence of a burned fuse for releasing a burned fuse indicator signal for transmission to the control unit <b>58</b>. The control unit <b>58</b> is responsive to the receipt of the burned fuse indicator signal, identifying the plurality of fuses as potentially causing an abnormal operational condition of the bathing system. Upon receiving a burned fuse indicator signal, the control unit <b>58</b> may convey a warning message to a human operator identifying the plurality of fuses as potentially causing an abnormal operational condition of the bathing system, for instance, via a display module on the control panel <b>32</b> or on the auxiliary I/O device <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) such that appropriate action can be taken.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0142">In accordance with another variant, processing module <b>40</b> may be configured for causing a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) <b>86</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to trip in the presence of an abnormal operational condition of the bathing system. In a non-limiting implementation, the processing module generates a signal for causing a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) <b>86</b> to trip. The ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) <b>86</b> includes a breaker, which is adapted to trip if a ground fault or current overload condition occurs. The GFCI may be part of the circuit element <b>50</b> of the controller <b>30</b> or may be an outside component connected between the power source <b>29</b> and the controller <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In a specific implementation, the processing module <b>40</b> includes circuitry for causing a current leakage to ground in order to cause the GFCI to trip. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts a non-limiting example of implementation of a circuit suitable for causing the GFCI to trip. The circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> causes the GFCI to trip by inducing a current of about 5 mA or more in one of the lines. As depicted, a resistance is connected between the ground and one of the line voltages (L<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), the resistance being selected to generate a current sufficiently large in order to make the GFCI trip.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0143">The processing module <b>40</b> is adapted to store in memory data indicating that the ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) trip was due to an overload condition.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0144">In a first implementation where the GFCI is external to the controller <b>30</b>, after the restoration of the supply with the ground-fault interrupter, the processing unit is adapted to display an error message to convey the overload condition to a human operator such that appropriate preemptive action can be taken. The message indicates to the user that the cause of the breaker trip was an overload.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0145">In a second non-limiting implementation, where the GFCI is part of the controller <b>30</b>, the processing module <b>40</b> stays powered even if the GFCI goes in the overload condition. In this case, the processing unit <b>40</b> is adapted to convey the overload condition message in real time to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0146">In a non-limiting implementation, if the GFCI was tripped and no overload condition was detected, the GFCI trip is assumed to be caused by a current leakage to the ground (ground fault). In this implementation, the processing module <b>40</b> is adapted for storing in memory the set of components and their corresponding actuated/non-actuated state. By knowing which spa components <b>47</b> were in the actuated state and which were just actuated before the breaker tripped, it is possible to determine which spa component potentially caused the failure. The processing module <b>40</b> is also adapted to send a message to convey to a human operator which spa components <b>47</b> were in the actuated state and which were just actuated before the breaker tripped such that appropriate preemptive action can be taken.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0147">The above description of the embodiments should not be interpreted in a limiting manner since other variations, modifications and refinements are possible within the spirit and scope of the present invention. The scope of the invention is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
