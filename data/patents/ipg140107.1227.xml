<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a step unit, which includes a step member adjacent to a vehicle sliding door, and a drive device for the vehicle sliding door.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, a step unit is provided on a vehicle main body at a position that is adjacent to a vehicle sliding door. One type of typical step unit includes a step member and a drive device (motor unit), which is fixed to the step member and operates to open and close a vehicle sliding door. For example, refer to Patent Document 1.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In such a step unit, the step member is typically formed through sheet-metal processing and has a flat plate portion, on which occupants put their feet. The drive device is mounted at a position of the flat plate portion where the drive device is least obstructive to occupants. For example, the drive device is mounted at a position on the flat plate portion that is at the rearmost end.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2007-132141</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the above described step unit, since the drive device is fixed onto the flat plate portion, on which an occupant put a foot, the drive device undesirably protrude upward from the upper surface of the flat plate portion by a significant amount. This, for example, hampers a low-floor design of the passenger compartment. The drive device may be fixed to the lower surface of the step member, or the side that faces the ground surface. However, there is a limitation to the space below the step member, and the configuration has other drawbacks. For example, the waterproof design for the drive device (and its control circuit) would be complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a step unit that easily reduces upward protrusion of a drive device by a great degree.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the present invention, a step unit that includes a step member and a drive device is provided. The step member is provided on a vehicle main body to be adjacent to a vehicle sliding door, and has a flat plate portion for allowing an occupant to put his/her foot thereon. The drive device is fixed to the step member, and is for operating the vehicle sliding door to open and close. The step member is molded of a resin material and has an accommodation portion, which has a bottom that is formed at a position lower than an upper surface of the flat plate portion. The drive device is fixed such that at least a part thereof is accommodated in the accommodation portion.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This configuration reduces upward protrusion of the drive device from the upper surface of the flat plate portion. As a result, a low-floor design of the passenger compartment is possible. Further, unlike conventional step members, the step member is not formed through sheet-metal processing, but is molded of a plastic material. This allows the step member to have wide variety of shapes. Accordingly, it is possible to form the bottom of the accommodation portion at a position significantly lower than the upper surface of the flat plate portion. Therefore, it is possible to reduce upward protrusion of the drive device from the upper surface of the flat plate portion by a great degree.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A peripheral wall may be molded integrally with the step member to encompass the accommodation portion. The peripheral wall extends to a position upward of the upper surface of the flat plate portion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This configuration restricts liquid from entering the accommodation portion, for example, from the upper surface of the flat plate portion. The drive device is therefore prevented from being wet. Particularly, it is difficult to form the peripheral wall about the accommodation portion through sheet-metal processing. However, since the step member is molded of a plastic material, the peripheral wall can be easily molded integrally with the step member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A loop belt may be supported by a pulley provided on the lower surface of the step member and be arranged in an opening-closing direction of the vehicle sliding door. In this case, the drive device is used for rotating the belt. Also, a shaft support portion may be molded integrally with the step member, and the pulley may be detachably and rotationally supported by the shaft support portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This configuration eliminates the need for additional components such as a bracket for attaching the pulley and facilitates the attachment of the pulley. Particularly, it is difficult to form the shaft support portion, to which a pulley can be detachably attached and rotationally supported, through sheet-metal processing. However, since the step member is molded of a plastic material, the shaft support portion can be easily molded integrally with the step member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The shaft support portion may be a non-annular shaft support portion, which has an opening on a side opposite to the direction of force that is perpendicular to the axis and applied to the pulley by the belt in a taut state. Further, the pulley may be attached to the non-annular shaft support portion by being inserted through the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to this configuration, the pulley is attached to the non-annular shaft support portion by being inserted through the opening. This allows the pulley to be easily installed and prevented from falling off by a force in a direction perpendicular to the axis applied by the belt in a taut state.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A loop belt may be provided on the lower surface of the step member and arranged in an opening-closing direction of the vehicle sliding door, and the drive device may be used for rotating the belt.

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">One embodiment according to the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A vehicle has a step unit <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is located adjacent to a vehicle sliding door (not shown). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, &#x201c;outside&#x201d; refers to the outside of the passenger compartment in the direction of the vehicle width, and &#x201c;inside&#x201d; refers to the direction toward the center of the passenger compartment in the direction of the vehicle width.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The step unit <b>1</b> is a type that includes a drive device (motor unit) <b>2</b> for opening and closing the vehicle sliding door. The step unit <b>1</b> is mainly constituted of the drive device <b>2</b> and a substantially plate-like step member (step) <b>3</b>. The step unit <b>1</b> is fixed to the main body (not shown) of the vehicle. The entire upper surface of the step unit <b>1</b> is covered with a scuff plate, which is a thin plate-like decorative member (not shown). The upper surface of the drive device <b>2</b> (the lower surface of the thin plate-like scuff plate) is covered with a rigid plate or a cover (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The step member <b>3</b> is molded of a plastic material. The step member <b>3</b> is located in the passenger compartment at a position adjacent to the vehicle sliding door in the closed state, and includes a flat plate portion <b>4</b>, on which an occupant places a foot when getting in or out of the vehicle, and an accommodation portion <b>5</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>). The accommodation portion <b>5</b> is formed continuous to the flat plate portion <b>4</b> and is located on a side of the flat plate portion <b>4</b> in the opening direction of the sliding door, or rearward of the flat plate portion <b>4</b>. The step member <b>3</b> is fixed with a part of the drive device <b>2</b> accommodated in the accommodation portion <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Specifically, when the accommodation portion <b>5</b> is installed in the vehicle, a bottom <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the accommodation portion <b>5</b> is located at a lower position than an upper surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the flat plate portion <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. The height (depth) of the bottom <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the accommodation portion <b>5</b> is determined based on the shape of the drive device <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the drive device <b>2</b> includes a motor <b>2</b><i>a</i>, which is a drive source, an output portion <b>2</b><i>b</i>, which has a gear attached to the motor <b>2</b><i>a </i>and an electromagnetic clutch, a control circuit portion <b>2</b><i>c</i>, which is installed in the output portion <b>2</b><i>b</i>. The accommodation portion <b>5</b> includes a motor accommodating section <b>5</b><i>b</i>, an output portion accommodating section <b>5</b><i>c</i>, and a circuit accommodating section <b>5</b><i>d </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. The drive device <b>2</b> is fixed by screws such that it partly contacts the bottom <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the accommodation portion <b>5</b>, that is, a part of the drive device <b>2</b> is located lower than the upper surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the flat plate portion <b>4</b>. One third or more of the entire thickness of the drive device <b>2</b> in the vertical direction is located below the upper surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the flat plate portion <b>4</b>. In the present embodiment, substantially half the entire thickness is located below the upper surface <b>4</b><i>a</i>. In the present embodiment, a peripheral wall <b>6</b> is molded integrally with the step member <b>3</b> to encompass the accommodation portion <b>5</b>. More specifically, the peripheral wall <b>6</b> substantially entirely surrounds the accommodation portion <b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B. The peripheral wall <b>6</b> extends to a position above the upper surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the flat plate portion <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, pulleys <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are located on the lower surface of the step member <b>3</b>. A loop belt <b>13</b> is supported by the pulleys <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and extends in the opening-closing direction of the vehicle sliding door. The drive device <b>2</b> rotates the belt <b>13</b>. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, an output shaft <b>2</b><i>d </i>of the output portion <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the drive device <b>2</b> extends through a through hole <b>5</b><i>e </i>formed in the bottom <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the accommodation portion <b>5</b> and protrudes from the lower surface of the step member <b>3</b>. The output shaft <b>2</b><i>d </i>transmits power to the belt <b>13</b> via a power transmitting portion <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), which is provided on the lower surface of the step member <b>3</b>, thereby rotating the belt <b>13</b>. In the present embodiment, the opening-closing direction of the vehicle sliding door corresponds to the front-rear direction of the vehicle. However, the path of the sliding door is curved inward toward the center of the passenger compartment at a front portion in accordance with the closed position of the vehicle sliding door. The position of the belt <b>13</b> is regulated by the pulleys <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, which are located at ends in the vehicle front-rear direction, and a regulation portion <b>15</b>, which is located between the pulleys <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and extends from the lower surface of the step member <b>3</b>. The regulation portion <b>15</b> is molded integrally with the lower surface of the step member <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Non-annular shaft support portions <b>16</b>, which serve as a shaft support portion, are molded integrally with the step member <b>3</b>. The pulley <b>11</b>, which is located at the front end, is rotationally supported by the non-annular shaft support portions <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The non-annular shaft support portions <b>16</b> are formed to support the pulley <b>11</b> in a detachable and rotational manner. Specifically, the non-annular shaft support portions <b>16</b> are formed in a pair each having an opening <b>16</b><i>a </i>on the side opposite to the direction of the force that is perpendicular to the axis and applied to the pulley <b>11</b> by the belt <b>13</b> in a taut state. In other words, the openings <b>16</b><i>a </i>are located on the front side. The pulley <b>11</b> has a shaft <b>11</b><i>a</i>, which is fitted to the openings <b>16</b><i>a</i>, so that the pulley <b>11</b> is rotationally supported by the non-annular shaft support portions <b>16</b>. The width of the openings <b>16</b><i>a </i>is slightly smaller than the diameter of the shaft <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the pulley <b>11</b> to form a holding structure, in which, regardless of the force applied by the belt <b>13</b>, the pulley <b>11</b> does not come off when receiving a small force. The pulley <b>12</b>, which is located at the rear end, is rotationally supported by the cover of the power transmitting portion <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A pair of lower rails <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> is molded integrally with the lower surface of the step member <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The lower rails <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> extend in the opening-closing direction of the vehicle sliding door (substantially, the front-rear direction of the vehicle). The lower rails <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are connected to each other at both ends in the opening-closing direction (that is, substantially the front-rear direction of the vehicle). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, a cutout portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>is formed in a part of the lower rail <b>21</b>. A rail plate member <b>31</b> is arranged at the cutout portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>to make the lower rail <b>21</b> continuous in the opening-closing direction of the vehicle sliding door. Rollers <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) are provided between the lower rails <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> (including the rail plate member <b>31</b>). The rollers <b>32</b> are coupled to the vehicle sliding door, for example, via brackets (not shown). Thus, the rollers <b>32</b> and the vehicle sliding door are guided in the opening-closing direction by the lower rails <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>. The rollers <b>32</b> are coupled to the belt <b>13</b> via brackets (not shown), so that, as the belt <b>13</b> rotates, the rollers <b>32</b> are moved in the opening closing direction while being guided by the lower rails <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9A</figref>, the step member <b>3</b> has an insertion slit <b>23</b> extending in the vertical direction at a position that corresponds to the cutout portion <b>21</b><i>a</i>. Also, the step member <b>3</b> has support extensions <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The support extensions <b>21</b><i>b </i>extend from the ends of the cutout portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the lower rail <b>21</b> to support the rail plate member <b>31</b> against the load applied to the rail plate member <b>31</b> by the rollers <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the pair of support extensions <b>21</b><i>b </i>extend from the ends of the cutout portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the lower rail <b>21</b> in the direction in which load is applied (upward as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and toward the outside with respect to the vehicle width direction), to approach each other without being connected to each other, so that there is a space therebetween. The support extensions <b>21</b><i>b </i>are thicker than the lower rail <b>21</b> in the direction in which the load is applied (the up-side direction as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">On the other hand, the rail plate member <b>31</b> is formed by processing a metal plate, and installed by being inserted through the insertion slit <b>23</b> from above the step member <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>, the rail plate member <b>31</b> has an angled portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>at the upper edge (the upper edge in a state after being installed). The angled portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>extends in a direction perpendicular to the vertical direction, or into the passenger compartment in the present embodiment. The rail plate member <b>31</b> is inserted into the insertion slit <b>23</b> such that the lower side of the angled portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>contacts the upper surface of the step member <b>3</b>. In the present embodiment, the rail plate member <b>31</b> is fixed through press-fitting as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. Specifically, the rail plate member <b>31</b> has a pair of press-fit portions <b>31</b><i>b</i>, which protrude from the sides of the rail plate member <b>31</b> that face the ends of the cutout portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>to be press fitted to the ends of the cutout portion <b>21</b><i>a</i>. When being inserted through the insertion slit <b>23</b> from above the step member <b>3</b>, the rail plate member <b>31</b> is press fitted when the press-fit portions <b>31</b><i>b </i>are pressed against the ends of the cutout portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the lower rail <b>21</b>. At this time, the sides of the cutout portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the lower rail <b>21</b> are shaven or elastically deformed by the press-fit portions <b>31</b><i>b</i>. However, as long as the rail plate member <b>31</b> can be press fitted, the structure may be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the above described configuration, the rail plate member <b>31</b> can be removed to insert rollers <b>32</b> into the space between the lower rails <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> through the cutout portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>or remove the rollers <b>32</b> from the space between the lower rails <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>. When the drive device <b>2</b> is operated, the belt <b>13</b> is rotated. Accordingly, the rollers <b>32</b> are moved while being guided by the lower rails <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, and the vehicle sliding door is operated to open or close. The output shaft <b>2</b><i>d </i>of the drive device <b>2</b> or the housing of the drive device <b>2</b> has an O-ring, which is not shown, so that water is completely or almost completely prevented from entering the interior of the drive device <b>2</b> or the bottom <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the accommodation portion <b>5</b> through the through hole <b>5</b><i>e </i>formed in the bottom <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the accommodation portion <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present embodiment operates and has advantages as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">(1) The drive device <b>2</b> is fixed such that a part thereof is accommodated in the accommodation portion <b>5</b>, which has the bottom <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and the bottom <b>5</b><i>a </i>is formed at a position lower than the upper surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the flat plate portion <b>4</b>, on which an occupant put a foot. This structure reduces the amount of protrusion of the drive device <b>2</b> from the upper surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the flat plate portion <b>4</b>. As a result, the low-floor design of the passenger compartment is possible. Further, unlike conventional step member, the step member <b>3</b> is not formed through sheet-metal processing, but molded of a plastic material. This allows the step member <b>3</b> to have wide variety of shapes. Accordingly, it is possible to form the bottom <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the accommodation portion <b>5</b> at a position significantly lower than the upper surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the flat plate portion <b>4</b>. Therefore, it is possible to reduce upward protrusion of the drive device <b>2</b> from the upper surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the flat plate portion <b>4</b> by a great degree.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">(2) The peripheral wall <b>6</b> is molded integrally with the step member <b>3</b> to encompass the accommodation portion <b>5</b> of the step member <b>3</b>. The peripheral wall <b>6</b> extends to a position above the upper surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the flat plate portion <b>4</b>. This reduces entry of liquid to the interior of the accommodation portion <b>5</b> from the upper surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the flat plate portion <b>4</b>. The drive device <b>2</b> is therefore prevented from being wet. Particularly, it is difficult to form the peripheral wall <b>6</b> about the accommodation portion <b>5</b> through sheet-metal processing. However, since the step member <b>3</b> is molded of a plastic material, the peripheral wall <b>6</b> can be easily molded integrally with the step member <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">(3) The step member <b>3</b> includes the integrally molded non-annular shaft support portions <b>16</b>, which is a support shaft portion for detachably and rotationally support the pulley <b>11</b>. This eliminates the necessity for additional components such as brackets. Also, the pulley <b>11</b> can be easily assembled with the non-annular shaft support portions <b>16</b>. Particularly, it is difficult to form the shaft support portion, to which the pulley <b>11</b> can be detachably attached and rotationally supported, through sheet-metal processing.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">However, since the step member <b>3</b> is molded of a plastic material, the shaft support portion can be easily molded integrally with the step member <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">(4) The shaft support portion includes the non-annular shaft support portions <b>16</b>, which have openings <b>16</b><i>a </i>on the side opposite to the direction of the force that is perpendicular to the axis and applied to the pulley <b>11</b> by the belt <b>13</b> in a taut state. The pulley <b>11</b> is inserted to the openings <b>16</b><i>a </i>to be attached to the non-annular shaft support portions <b>16</b>. This allows the pulley <b>11</b> to be easily installed and prevented from falling off by a force in a direction perpendicular to the axis applied by the belt <b>13</b> in a taut state. It is difficult to form the pair of non-annular shaft support portions <b>16</b> described in the present embodiment through sheet-metal processing. However, since the step member <b>3</b> is molded of a plastic material, the non-annular shaft support portion <b>16</b> can be easily molded integrally with the step member <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The above-described embodiment may be modified as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above illustrated embodiment, the regulation portion <b>15</b> is molded integrally on the lower surface of the step member <b>3</b> to regulate the position of the belt <b>13</b>, and the position of the belt <b>13</b> is regulated only by the regulation portion <b>15</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12</figref>, a metal sheet member <b>42</b> may be fixed to a surface of a regulation portion <b>41</b> on which the belt <b>13</b> sides.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Specifically, the regulation portion <b>41</b> for regulating the position of the belt <b>13</b> is molded integrally with the lower surface of the step member <b>3</b>. The regulation portion <b>41</b> has a metal sheet receiving portion <b>41</b><i>a </i>at a position on which the belt <b>13</b> is likely to slide as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. The metal sheet receiving portion <b>41</b><i>a </i>of this modification is configured to have an arcuate bulge <b>41</b><i>b </i>protruding toward the belt <b>13</b> as viewed from below (in the state installed in the vehicle, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and locking grooves <b>41</b><i>c</i>, which are provided on the sides of the bulge <b>41</b><i>b</i>. On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the metal sheet member <b>42</b> is formed to be curved and has an elastic piece <b>42</b><i>a </i>at in a lower portion (lower end when installed in the vehicle, the upper end as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). The elastic piece <b>42</b><i>a </i>is formed by cutting and raising from the back of the metal sheet member <b>42</b> (concave side). The side edges of the metal sheet member <b>42</b> are fitted in the locking grooves <b>41</b><i>c</i>, and the elastic piece <b>42</b><i>a </i>is elastically deformed and pressed against the bulge <b>41</b><i>b</i>, so that the metal sheet member <b>42</b> is fixed to the regulation portion <b>41</b> of the step member <b>3</b>. The elastic piece <b>42</b><i>a </i>is arranged at a position lower than the position of the belt <b>13</b>, the vertical position of which is determined by the brims of the pulleys <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Therefore, the belt <b>13</b> slides on the smooth front surface (bulging curved surface) of the metal sheet member <b>42</b>, on which the elastic piece <b>42</b><i>a </i>is not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The metal sheet member <b>42</b> of this modification has a folded back portion <b>42</b><i>b </i>at the lower end (lower end in a state installed in the vehicle, upper end as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12</figref>. The folded back portion <b>42</b><i>b </i>prevents the belt <b>13</b> from falling off downward.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Since the metal sheet member <b>42</b> is fixed to the surface of the regulation portion <b>41</b> that slides on the belt <b>13</b>, wear of the regulation portion <b>41</b> molded of plastic material is easily suppressed. Also, wear of the belt <b>13</b> can be reduced. Further, it is possible to reduce the generation of noise during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Since the metal sheet member <b>42</b> is press-fitted in the step member <b>3</b>, no additional fasteners such as screws are needed. Particularly, it is difficult to form the metal sheet receiving portion <b>41</b><i>a</i>, to which the metal sheet member <b>42</b> is press fitted, through sheet-metal processing. However, since the step member <b>3</b> is molded of a plastic material, the metal sheet receiving portion <b>41</b><i>a </i>can be easily molded integrally with the step member <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Since the metal sheet member <b>42</b> has a folded back portion <b>42</b><i>b </i>for preventing the belt <b>13</b> from falling off downward, it is possible to prevent the belt <b>13</b> from falling off downward without increasing the number of components.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The metal sheet member <b>42</b> may be press fitted to the step member <b>3</b> using other structure. Also, the metal sheet member <b>42</b> may be fixed to the step member <b>3</b> using fastening members such as screws. The folded back portion <b>42</b><i>b </i>may be omitted.</p>
