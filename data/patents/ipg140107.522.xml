<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Dental brushes, and particularly dental brushes used to apply and sculpture dental composite and porcelain work.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many current brushes used to apply and sculpture composite resin materials (e.g., smooth the composite resin over a tooth surface and across a filling) in dentistry are straight artist brushes designed for applying paint to easily accessible painting surfaces, such as canvas. The oral cavity presents a number of surfaces that are difficult to reach for oral hygiene (e.g., tooth brushing, flossing and the like). These areas include the lingual areas of the teeth (the tongue side of teeth), the gingival marginal areas (where a tooth meets with the gum), embrasure spaces (spaces between teeth) and occlusal surfaces of the posterior teeth (chewing surfaces of the molars). These areas see a larger percentage of dental issues including decay and cavities requiring dental restoration work such as composite fillings, sealants and the like. As previously described with oral hygiene, these difficult to reach areas are similarly difficult to reach with current straight brushes used to apply and sculpture composite material for dental restoration. A variety of brushes are used with differing shaped brush surfaces and then the user contorts the hand and wrist to reach the desired surfaces of the teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A dental tool with an angled head fails to address these problems as a single angle cannot adequately access every tooth surface that may need attention in the mouth. Similarly, a single brush type cannot easily apply and sculpt composite material over a variety of tooth surfaces and filling locations.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. Therefore, the following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A dental brush assembly <b>100</b> for forming composite dental materials is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The assembly <b>100</b> includes a handle <b>102</b>, a first shank <b>104</b> and a second shank <b>106</b>. A first detachable dental brush <b>108</b> is detachably coupled with the first shank <b>104</b> at a first coupling <b>110</b>, and a second detachable dental brush <b>112</b> is detachably coupled with the second shank <b>106</b> at a second coupling <b>114</b> (the first shank and first coupling provide a first coupling end of the handle, in one example, and the second shank and second coupling similarly provide a second coupling end). The dental brush assembly <b>100</b> is used to finish composite materials, for instance, by forming tooth line angles, cusps, ridges and the like. In another example, the dental brush assembly <b>100</b> is used to finish composite materials by planarizing the composite into a flush configuration with the surrounding tooth enamel.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The handle <b>102</b> is sized and shaped to provide an ergonomic grip for the user to easily grasp the dental brush assembly <b>100</b> and use either or both of the brushes <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> for forming composite materials for dental work (e.g., composite fillings, crown construction and the like). The handle <b>102</b> has a larger diameter <b>109</b> to provide a comfortable grip for the user and facilitate fine motor control of the dental brush assembly <b>100</b>. Additionally, the first and second shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> have smaller diameters <b>105</b>, <b>107</b> relative to the handle diameter <b>109</b> as they approach the brushes <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> for ease of use within the mouth of a patient. The handle <b>102</b> is constructed with, but not limited to metals, composites and the like, such as aluminum, stainless steel and plastics.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first shank <b>104</b> and the second shank <b>106</b> are at different orientations relative to the handle <b>102</b>. In one example, these orientations are non-identical, and the first and second shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> similarly position the dental brushes <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> to provide multiple non-identical orientations to access and form composite materials in the mouth (e.g., for finishing of composite fillings). The user may thereby have multiple brush orientations available to easily form composite materials while keeping his hand in a small number of relatively comfortable postures. Similarly, the dental brush assembly <b>100</b> provides multiple angles of attack for dental surfaces in a single assembly. Providing multiple brush orientations alleviates hand strain and enhances the forming of composite dental material into the desired surface. Additionally, the non-linear orientations of the brush relative to the handle improve visibility of the operative field (e.g., the dental surface) for the user where a straight brush and handle combination may partially conceal the dental surface.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, one example of a dental brush assembly <b>100</b> is shown with first and second shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> having non-identical and unique orientations relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. The variations in the shank orientations allow for multiple brush orientations that facilitate easy forming of composite materials within the mouth along dental surfaces as well as in composite construction, such as crown construction. As shown, the first shank <b>104</b> has a counter-offset orientation <b>201</b> and a first portion <b>202</b> of the first shank <b>104</b> extends away from the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b> while a second portion <b>204</b> of the first shank <b>104</b> positions the detachable dental brush <b>206</b> near the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. This counter-offset orientation allows the detachable dental brush <b>206</b> to have a near-perpendicular orientation relative to the handle <b>102</b> without the dental brush <b>206</b> extending remotely away from the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b> (e.g., the axis <b>200</b> extends through the brush <b>206</b>). The counter-offset orientation thereby maintains a compact brush configuration along the handle for difficult-to-reach and relatively small areas of the mouth, for instance the space between the molar occlusal surfaces (chewing surfaces), and lingual surfaces of the anterior teeth (tongue side surfaces of the front teeth). Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the first shank <b>104</b> has an angular orientation A relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b> of approximately 80 degrees. This allows the dental brush <b>206</b> to reach behind the anterior teeth and easily contact composite material applied to the lingual tooth surfaces while handle <b>102</b> is held at a relatively comfortable orientation (e.g., parallel with the plane of the upper jaw). The dental brush <b>206</b> is thereby provided with an angle of attack that easily extends from behind the teeth toward the lingual surfaces while the handle <b>102</b> extends out of the mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second shank <b>106</b> has an offset orientation <b>203</b> and the second shank extends away from the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. The detachable dental brush <b>208</b> is thereby similarly positioned away (remote relative to the counter-offset brush) from the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. This offset configuration facilitates longer brushing strokes usable with easily reached dental surfaces, for instance the facial surfaces of the anterior teeth (the front surfaces of the front teeth), as shown and described further below. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the second shank <b>106</b> has an angular orientation B relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b> of approximately 165 degrees. In another example, the first and second shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> have angular orientations A, B of between around 80 degrees and 165 degrees relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. In still another example, and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>, the first and second shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> have non-identical angular orientations. The non-identical angular orientations A, B cooperate with the offsets <b>201</b>, <b>203</b> to provide a variety of orientations for the detachable dental brushes <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. This variety of brush orientations gives the user multiple options for accessing a desired dental surface while allowing the hand of the user to comfortably manipulate the dental brush assembly handle <b>102</b> in fewer orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows another example of a dental brush assembly <b>100</b>. The first shank <b>104</b> is shown with an offset configuration <b>210</b>, and the second shank has a counter-offset configuration <b>212</b>. The angular orientation C of the first shank <b>104</b> is approximately 165 degrees while the angular orientation D of the second shank <b>106</b> is approximately 100 degrees relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. The counter-offset configuration <b>212</b> and angular orientation D of the second shank <b>106</b> facilitate access to compact areas of the mouth such as the anterior facing ridges and cusps of the molars (e.g., the ridged portions of the molar chewing surfaces that face toward the lips) and the molar mesial surfaces that form the embrasures between molars (e.g, the triangular geometry between teeth). The combination of orientations (e.g., angles of attack at dental surfaces) provided by the angular orientations C, D and the offset and counter-offset configurations <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> gives the user multiple options for accessing a desired dental surface while allowing the hand of the user to comfortably manipulate the dental brush assembly handle <b>102</b> in fewer orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows yet another example of a dental brush assembly <b>100</b>. Both shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of this example assembly <b>100</b> have counter-offset configurations <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>. As previously described, the counter-offset configurations <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> provide easier access to compact areas of the mouth while the detachable dental brushes <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> are still at a near-perpendicular orientation relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. In the compact area around the molars, for instance, because the detachable brushes <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> are near the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>, the brushes can easily form and finish composite material on the molars even at a near-perpendicular orientation to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. Further, the counter-offset configurations <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> allow for easy access to the lingual (tongue side) surfaces of all of the teeth including the molars and anterior teeth (front teeth).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Moreover, the angular orientations E, F of the shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, are usable for access to differing surfaces of the teeth. The angular orientation E, for instance, is approximately 80 degrees relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. The angular orientation F, in another example, is approximately 100 degrees relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. As previously described for angular orientation A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, having an acute angular orientation (less than 90 degrees) such as E allows the detachable dental brush <b>206</b> to reach behind the anterior teeth and easily contact composite material applied to the lingual tooth surfaces while handle <b>102</b> is held at a relatively comfortable orientation (e.g., parallel with the plane of the upper jaw). Further, the acute angular orientations A, E provide easy access to the marginal ridges and distal line angles of the distal areas of the molars that form the distal embrasures of the molars on the lingual and facial sides of the teeth. The detachable dental brush <b>206</b> is thereby able to reach behind the molars to access these areas by using the angular orientations A, E of shank <b>104</b>. Further still, the angular orientations A, E of the first shank <b>104</b> facilitate access to compact areas of the mouth such as the distal facing ridges and cusps of the molars (e.g., the ridged portions of the molar chewing surfaces that face toward the back of the mouth).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The angular orientation F of the second shank <b>106</b>, as similarly described with regard to angular orientation D shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, facilitates access to compact areas of the mouth such as the mesial facing ridges and cusps of the molars (e.g., the ridged portions of the molar chewing surfaces that face toward the lips) and the mesial molar line angles and marginal ridges that form the embrasures between molars (e.g, the triangular geometry between teeth). The angular orientations D, F and counter-offsets <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> provide a variety of brush orientations. These various brush orientations give the user multiple options for accessing a desired dental surface while allowing the hand of the user to comfortably manipulate the dental brush assembly handle <b>102</b> in fewer orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3F</figref>, examples of detachable dental brushes are shown for detachable coupling and use with the handle <b>102</b> of the dental brush assembly <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As shown, each brush, <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> includes a brush surface (described below) and brush end <b>312</b>. The brush ends <b>312</b> include coupling orifices <b>314</b> sized and shaped to mate with the first and second couplings <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> of the first and second shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, respectively (described further below and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The brush surface is coupled with the brush end <b>312</b> by a neck <b>316</b>. The neck <b>316</b> retains the brush bristles in the desired orientation, for instance, by crimping of the neck <b>316</b> over the brush bristles. In another example, the neck <b>316</b> is formed with a resin material, such as plastic, and the bristles are placed within the molten plastic and retained therein as the neck <b>316</b> hardens.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Brushes <b>300</b>, <b>306</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, D. The brushes <b>300</b>, <b>306</b> include flat brush surfaces <b>318</b>. The flat brush surfaces <b>318</b> provide a wide surface to smooth composite dental materials into a desired shape, for instance a composite surface flush with the surrounding surfaces of a tooth. Additionally, the flat brush surface <b>318</b> is usable along the mesial and distal surfaces of the teeth (the surfaces that extend toward the line angles dividing the facial and lingual portions of the teeth) and thereby define the embrasures between teeth as desired by the user. The brush <b>300</b> is constructed with stiff bristles, including, but not limited to horse, pig and synthetic bristles that are used to form and smooth viscous composites that are otherwise difficult to move with softer brushes. The brush <b>306</b> is constructed with soft bristles, including, but not limited to, sable, camel, and synthetic bristles that are used to form and smooth less viscous composites.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Brushes <b>302</b>, <b>308</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B</figref>, E. The brushes <b>302</b>, <b>308</b> include medium pointed brush surfaces <b>320</b>. The medium pointed brushes <b>302</b>, <b>308</b> provide a pointed surface to provide access to smaller dental areas where detailed brush work is needed, such as the gingival marginal areas (where the tooth meets the gum) and the embrasure spaces (e.g, the triangular geometry between teeth).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The brushes <b>304</b>, <b>310</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C</figref>, F) with fine pointed brush surfaces <b>322</b> provide even more detailed access to these areas and are used as needed where the medium pointed brushes <b>302</b>, <b>308</b> cannot provide adequate access, for instance, where the medium pointed brushes could not fit into the apex of an embrasure.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above with regard to brush <b>300</b>, the brushes <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are constructed with stiff bristles, including, but not limited to horse, pig and synthetic bristles that are used to form and smooth viscous composites that are otherwise difficult to move with softer brushes. The brushes <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, similarly to brush <b>306</b>, are constructed with soft bristles, including, but not limited to, sable, camel, and synthetic bristles that are used to form and smooth less viscous composites.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3G</figref>, <b>3</b>G<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>G<b>2</b> show another example of a brush, a multi-orientation brush <b>324</b>. The multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> includes a brush surface <b>326</b> (e.g., as shown a flat brush surface), a neck <b>316</b> and a brush end <b>312</b>. The brush end <b>312</b> includes a non-circular coupling orifice <b>328</b> used in cooperation with a similarly formed coupling on the handle <b>102</b> (described below) to orient the brush surface <b>326</b> in a variety of orientations for added flexibility and enhanced access to dental surfaces while allowing the user to maintain the dental brush assembly handle <b>102</b> in a relatively comfortable posture.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in the cross-sectional view of FIG. <b>3</b>G<b>1</b>, the non-circular coupling orifice <b>328</b> has a faceted geometry, in one example. The coupling orifice <b>328</b> shown in <b>3</b>G<b>1</b> has first, second and third facets <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>. In another example, the coupling orifice includes two or more facets. Each of the first, second and third facets <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> corresponds to similar brush facing surfaces on the couplings <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> of the handle <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, described below). As the facets <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> are aligned with the brush facing surfaces of the couplings <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> the brush surface <b>326</b> is correspondingly oriented relative to the handle <b>102</b>. See FIG. <b>3</b>G<b>2</b>, where the brush surface <b>326</b> is shown relative to the facets <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>. The first, second and third facets <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> allow the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> to assume three separate orientations on each coupling <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> of the handle <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Because each of the shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> provides a different orientation, the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> thereby may assume six separate orientations (three for each differently oriented shank). This provides the user a large variety of orientation options for the brush and gives enhanced access to difficult-to-reach dental surfaces while allowing the user to maintain the dental brush assembly <b>100</b> in a comfortable posture.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Optionally, the non-circular coupling orifice <b>328</b> has a different geometry, such as ovoid, star, square, multiple orifice geometries and the like. The non-circular geometry of the coupling orifice <b>328</b> cooperates with the similar geometry of the coupling <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> to prevent rotation of the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> relative to the handle <b>102</b> while also allowing detachment of the brush <b>324</b> and reattachment in a different orientation. In a similar manner, the previously described brushes <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> also include coupling orifices <b>314</b> have non-circular geometries to prevent relative rotation between the handle <b>102</b> and the brushes.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows one example of the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> separated from the coupling <b>400</b> and shank <b>402</b> (e.g., coupling <b>110</b> or <b>114</b>, and shanks <b>104</b> or <b>106</b>). As shown, the brush end <b>312</b> is provided with three facets <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, and the coupling end is provided with complementary first, second and third brush facing surfaces <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>. When the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> is detachably coupled with the coupling <b>400</b>, the brush surface <b>326</b> is correspondingly oriented in one of a plurality of orientations. For example, when the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> is detachably coupled with the coupling <b>400</b> and oriented with the first brush facing surface <b>404</b>, the brush surface <b>326</b> is directed in a first orientation (e.g., parallel to the first brush facing surface). When the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> is detachably coupled with the coupling <b>400</b> and oriented with the second brush facing surface <b>406</b>, the brush surface <b>326</b> is directed in a second orientation approximately 45 to 60 degrees offset from the first orientation (e.g., parallel to the second brush facing surface). Similarly, when the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> is detachably coupled with the coupling <b>400</b> and oriented with the third brush facing surface <b>408</b>, the brush surface <b>326</b> is directed in a third orientation approximately 120 to 135 degrees offset from the first orientation (e.g., parallel to the third brush facing surface). Because the shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> each have a unique geometry relative to the other (e.g., offset and angular orientation) each of the three orientations of the brush surface <b>325</b> are different on each shank <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> providing at least six possible orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another example, a coupling orifice with a different geometry (such as shape, number of facets and the like) and a correspondingly shaped coupling would provide a varied number of orientations for the brush surface <b>326</b>. In such an example, where the coupling orifice and the coupling provide two possible orientations for the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b>, with shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> having unique geometries, the brush surface <b>326</b> would have four possible orientations. Similarly, if the coupling orifice and the coupling have four or more orientations, then shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, each unique relative to the other shank, would provide a total of eight possible brush surface <b>326</b> orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the coupling <b>400</b> is shown with a groove <b>410</b> extending at least part way around the coupling <b>400</b>. The multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> is shown with one or more detents <b>412</b> sized and shaped to engage with the surfaces of the coupling <b>400</b> defining the groove <b>410</b> to removably lock the brush <b>324</b> on the coupling <b>400</b>. As shown, the detents <b>412</b> are biased into an inward position by elastic members <b>414</b>, such as springs. The groove <b>410</b> and detent <b>412</b> reliably hold the brush <b>324</b> in position on the coupling <b>400</b>. In another example, the groove <b>410</b> and detent <b>412</b> provide an audible &#x2018;click&#x2019; when engaged to assure the user the brush <b>324</b> has been successfully coupled with the coupling <b>400</b>. Other means for removably locking the brush <b>324</b> with the coupling include, but are not limited to, magnetic features, temporary adhesives, snap-fit features, friction engagement and the like. In still another example, where the coupling orifice <b>314</b> is a circular orifice, the features, such as the detent <b>412</b> is engaged within a correspondingly shaped cavity to prevent rotation of the brush relative to the handle <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Moreover, while the coupling orifices and couplings so far have been described as being present on the brushes and shanks respectively, the shanks include orifices and the brushes include couplings in another option.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">FIGS. <b>5</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>5</b>A<b>2</b> show the dental brush assembly <b>100</b> with the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> in two separate orientations.

The angle J of the brush surface <b>326</b> in FIG. <b>5</b>C<b>1</b> allows the brush surface to easily access the facial mesial surfaces <b>509</b> (front tooth surfaces near the center of the mouth) of the anterior tooth <b>504</b>. The angle J of the brush surface <b>326</b> in FIG. <b>5</b>C<b>2</b> allows the brush surface <b>326</b> to easily access the facial distal surfaces <b>511</b> (front tooth surface away from the center of the mouth) of the anterior tooth <b>504</b>.

The angle N of the brush surface <b>326</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> allows the brush surface to easily access the facial distal surfaces <b>612</b> and lingual mesial surfaces <b>614</b> of the occlusal portion of the tooth <b>600</b>. Both orientations of the brush surface <b>326</b> allow the user to easily access all of the occlusal surfaces of the tooth <b>600</b> with a single tool with the handle <b>102</b> in substantially the same comfortable orientation. Additionally, where dental composite materials are formed behind features of the occlusal surfaces, the counter-offset configuration allows the brush <b>324</b> to easily reach behind these surfaces (cusps <b>606</b>, ridges <b>608</b> and the like) and access the composite material for forming and finishing while the handle <b>102</b> extends outside of the mouth in a comfortable orientation for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, in the orientations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, the brush surface <b>326</b> is also usable to access the lingual mesial <b>616</b>, lingual distal <b>618</b>, facial mesial <b>620</b> and facial distal <b>622</b> surfaces of the non-occlusal portions (e.g., the sides of the tooth) of the posterior tooth <b>600</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. With the orientations shown in <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, the dental brush assembly <b>100</b> is thereby able to form and finish the composite materials along the posterior tooth <b>600</b> and thereby form the embrasures <b>624</b>, <b>626</b> (lingual embrasures are concealed behind the tooth <b>600</b>) between teeth as desired by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a kit <b>700</b> is provided including a selection of handles <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> and brushes <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>701</b>, <b>703</b>. The kit <b>700</b> in one example is provided in a sterile package and opened by the user prior to performing dental composite material formation and finishing with a patient. In another example, the kit <b>700</b> includes the handles <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> and the user may obtain a personal selection of brushes according to the desires of the user and needs of the patient. In still another example, the kit <b>700</b> is sterilized (further described below) and the handles <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> and brushes <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>701</b>, <b>703</b> are replaced in a case for storage and easy access for future use. Optionally, the kit <b>700</b> includes a subset of brushes, for instance brushes <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>. Alternatively, the multi-orientation brushes <b>701</b>, <b>703</b> may be included instead of brushes <b>302</b> and <b>308</b>. The kit <b>700</b> includes soft brushes <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>703</b> for use with less viscous dental composite material. The kit <b>700</b> includes stiff brushes <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> and <b>701</b> for use with more viscous dental composite material that is difficult to form and finish with softer bristles.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The kit <b>700</b> includes the handles <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> which substantially correspond to the examples of handles shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>. As previously described, each handle <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> provides varying access to different dental surfaces relative to the other handles and thereby provides an advantageous instrument to form and finish composite materials. Each handle <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> provides a combination of shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>) that correspondingly combine a selection of brush orientations that are desirable for particular dental surfaces, such as, the posterior teeth (molars), for example. The user may thereby need a subset of the handles <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> and brushes <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>701</b>, <b>703</b> to adequately finish a composite dental surface for a particular tooth.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, kit <b>800</b> includes one example of a handle <b>702</b> with shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> sized and shaped for use with the posterior teeth. The kit <b>800</b> further includes a set of brushes <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>701</b>, <b>703</b> as described above. Optionally, the user may obtain a subset of these brushes to fit the particular needs of the procedure or the technique of the user. As described above, handle <b>702</b> with its counter-offset shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>) may be used advantageously on the posterior teeth, such as the molars. The kit <b>800</b> thereby provides a dental brush assembly that is assembled for a particular dental surface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> for the posterior teeth. In another example, the other handles <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> or a subset of handles <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> are assembled into a kit with the desired brushes for any variety of dental features, including, but not limited to, anterior teeth, facial surfaces, lingual surfaces, occlusal surfaces (chewing surfaces), gingival surfaces and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a method <b>900</b> for making a dental brush assembly, such as dental brush assembly <b>100</b> described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. At <b>902</b>, an elongate handle <b>102</b> is formed with a first coupling end (e.g., first coupling <b>110</b> and first shank <b>104</b>) and a second coupling end (e.g., second coupling <b>114</b> and second shank <b>106</b>). See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The first coupling end is at a first angle relative to a handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and the second coupling end is at a second angle relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>; the first and second angles are not identical. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>, the shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> have different angles and offsets relative to each other to provide a variety of brush orientations. In one example, the elongate handle <b>102</b> is formed with a handle diameter <b>109</b> greater than coupling end diameters <b>105</b>, <b>107</b> of the first and second coupling ends (e.g., diameters of the couplings <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> and the shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At <b>904</b>, a first brush facing surface and a second brush facing surface are formed on the first coupling end (e.g., the first coupling <b>110</b>). In one example, brush facing surfaces include surfaces <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> formed on the coupling end as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. At <b>906</b>, third and fourth brush facing surfaces are formed on the second coupling end (e.g., the second coupling <b>114</b>). As previously described, because each of the shanks <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> has a different geometry, the brush facing surfaces of the second coupling <b>114</b>, identical in one example to surfaces <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, provide different brush orientations. At <b>908</b>, the method <b>900</b> includes forming at least a first detachable multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3G</figref>, <b>3</b>G<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>G<b>2</b>) with a directional brush surface <b>326</b> and a brush end <b>312</b> complementary to the first, second, third and fourth brush facing surfaces for first and second coupling ends.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the multi-orientation brush <b>324</b> is coupled with the first coupling end (e.g., first coupling <b>110</b>) and oriented with the first brush facing surface (e.g., one of surfaces <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>) the directional brush surface <b>326</b> is directed in a first orientation relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>, and when the first detachable dental brush <b>324</b> is oriented with the second brush facing surface (e.g., another of the surfaces <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>) the directional brush surface <b>326</b> is directed in a second orientation relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. Similarly, when the first detachable dental brush <b>324</b> is coupled with the second coupling end (e.g., second coupling <b>114</b>) and oriented with the third brush facing surface (one of the surfaces <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> on the second coupling <b>114</b>) the directional brush surface <b>326</b> is directed in a third orientation relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>, and when the first detachable dental brush <b>324</b> is oriented with the fourth brush facing surface (another of the surfaces <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> on the second coupling <b>114</b>) the directional brush surface <b>326</b> is directed in a fourth orientation relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. The first, second, third and fourth orientations are not identical.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Several options for the method <b>900</b> are provided below. In one example, forming the first brush facing surface (e.g., one of surfaces <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and a second brush facing surface (another of the surfaces <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>) on the first coupling end includes forming a fifth brush facing surface on the first coupling end (another of the surfaces <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>). The first, second and fifth brush facing surfaces are not parallel with each other. For instance they form the triangular pattern of the coupling <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When the first detachable dental brush <b>324</b> is coupled with the first coupling end <b>110</b> and oriented with the fifth brush facing surface the directional brush surface <b>326</b> is directed in a fifth orientation relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and the fifth orientation is not identical with the first, second, third and fourth orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another example, forming at least the first detachable dental brush <b>324</b> with the directional brush surface <b>326</b> and the brush end <b>312</b> complementary to the first, second, third and fourth brush facing surfaces, includes forming a brush end <b>312</b> configured to non-rotatably couple with the first and second coupling ends (e.g., couplings <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>). As described above, the brush end <b>312</b> and couplings <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> include, but are not limited to, complementary non-circular, ovular, triangular, star, square, pin/multiple orifice geometries and the like. Optionally, forming the elongate handle <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) includes forming non-circular first and second couplings <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> configured to non-rotatably couple with at least the first detachable dental brush <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In still another example, the method <b>900</b> includes forming a brush end <b>312</b> of the detachable dental brush (e.g., brushes <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>324</b>) configured to detachably lock with the first coupling <b>110</b> and the second coupling end <b>114</b>. For example, forming the elongate handle <b>102</b> with the first coupling <b>110</b> and the second coupling <b>114</b> includes forming at least one groove <b>410</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in one of the first and second couplings <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>, and the first detachable dental brush <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>324</b> with the brush end <b>312</b> is formed with a detent <b>412</b> sized and shaped to fit in the at least one groove <b>410</b>. Optionally, the at least one groove <b>410</b> is disposed on the brush end <b>312</b> and the detent <b>412</b> is formed on the coupling <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>. Other means for removably locking the brush <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>324</b> with the coupling include, but are not limited to, magnetic features, temporary adhesives, snap-fit features, friction engagement and the like, as previously described above.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In yet another example, the method <b>900</b> further includes forming a second detachable dental brush <b>304</b>, <b>310</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) with a pointed geometry, the second detachable dental brush <b>304</b>, <b>310</b> having a brush end <b>312</b> configured to couple with the first and second couplings <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>. In another example, forming the first detachable dental brush includes forming a first soft detachable dental brush <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>322</b> (and soft brush <b>324</b>) and a first stiff detachable dental brush <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> (and stiff brush <b>324</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, one example of a method <b>1000</b> for sterilizing a dental brush assembly, such as dental brush assembly <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, is shown. At <b>1002</b>, a detachable dental brush <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>324</b> is removed from one of a first coupling end (coupling <b>110</b> and shank <b>104</b>) and a second coupling end (coupling <b>114</b> and shank <b>106</b>) of an elongate handle <b>102</b>. The first coupling end (coupling <b>110</b> and shank <b>104</b>) is at a first angle (e.g., A, C, E as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>) relative to a handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>, and the second coupling end (coupling <b>114</b> and shank <b>106</b>) is at a second angle (e.g., B, D, F as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>) relative to the handle longitudinal axis <b>200</b>. The first angle is non-identical to the second angle.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At <b>1004</b>, the elongate handle <b>102</b> is separated from the detachable dental brush, and the handle <b>102</b> is heat sterilized. The heat sterilization process provides a rapid and effective manner to eliminate contaminants, microorganisms and the like. Because the elongate handle <b>102</b> is constructed with materials such as aluminum, stainless steel and plastics, the handle <b>102</b> can withstand the heat of the sterilization process, and is thereafter ready for future use with the detachable dental brushes. At <b>1006</b>, the detachable dental brush <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>324</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is chemically sterilized separately from the elongate handle <b>102</b>. For instance, the brushes <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>324</b> are sterilized with rubbing alcohol, quaternary ammonium products and the like to similarly eliminate contaminants and microorganisms. The chemical sterilization is less harsh on the brushes <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>324</b> than heat sterilization and does not substantially damage the brush surfaces <b>318</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>326</b>. The chemical sterilization thereby allows for repeated sterile use of the brushes. At <b>1008</b>, the detachable dental brush <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>324</b> is coupled with one of the first coupling and second couplings <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> after the elongate handle <b>102</b> is heat sterilized and the detachable dental brush is chemically sterilized. Optionally, the used detachable dental brush <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>324</b> is discarded in favor of a sterile replacement brush thereby eliminating the need to chemically sterilize the used brush.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The above described dental brush assembly provides a comfortable handle having multiple non-identical orientations for brushes on the ends of the handle. The orientations are created using a variety of coupling end angles, offsets of the coupling ends and orienting the brushes with the brush facing surfaces of the coupling ends. The multiple orientations provide varied angles of attack on a variety of tooth surfaces throughout the mouth to facilitate the forming and finishing of dental composite material on the tooth surfaces. The multiple orientations allow for ease of use in compact and difficult-to-reach areas of the mouth while allowing the user to perform detailed work on the dental composite to form it relative to the surrounding tooth surfaces (e.g., finishing the composite material into a smooth surface that is flush with the tooth surface). Moreover, the non-linear orientations of the brush relative to the handle improve visibility of the operative field (e.g., the dental surface) for the user where a straight brush and handle combination may partially conceal the dental surface. Further, the user is able to comfortably manipulate the dental brush assembly into the various orientations within the mouth while maintaining the elongate handle in a relatively comfortable posture for the hand of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, the user is able to choose a particular handle having the desired coupling end orientations (angles and offsets) along with the desired brushes according to the user's particular technique. The user is thereby able to assemble a dental brush assembly that is comfortable and is configured to optimally form and finish dental composite material according to the technique of the user. Moreover, the user is able to choose a particular handle and brush combination or combinations to provide the best access and brush orientations for a particular tooth surface, such as a the posterior teeth (e.g., molars). As described above, kits are provided for the user to assemble the dental brush assembly according to the needs and/or technique of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further still, the detachable dental brushes allow for easy sterilization of the handle by heat sterilization. The handle is thereby rapidly and effectively sterilized prior to the next procedure. The detached brushes are chemically sterilized separately to preserve the integrity of the brushes. The sterilized brush assembly is then assembled prior to the procedure. Alternatively, the used brushes are detached from the handle and discarded in favor of replacement sterile brushes.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description. It should be noted that embodiments discussed in different portions of the description or referred to in different drawings can be combined to form additional embodiments of the present application.
