<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates generally to information handling systems, and relates more particularly to embedded information handling system platform management and configuration variance detection.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Configuration of an information handling system can be a complex task. Comparison of a selected system to be configured with a baseline system having a desirable configuration can facilitate configuration but can be a time consuming, tedious, and error prone task. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements can vary between different applications, information handling systems can also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information can be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data processing and storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems can include a variety of hardware and software components that can be configured to process, store, and communicate information and can include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a general information handling system, generally designated at <b>100</b>. In one form, the information handling system <b>100</b> can be a computer system such as a server. The information handling system <b>100</b> may contain numerous components, some examples of which are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Several example components are discussed herein. It should be appreciated by one of skill in the art that other information handling system components may be included or subtracted from the example components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the information handling system <b>100</b> can include a first physical processor <b>102</b> coupled to a first host bus <b>104</b> and can further include additional processors generally designated as n<sup>th </sup>physical processor <b>106</b> coupled to a second host bus <b>108</b>. The first physical processor <b>102</b> can be coupled to a chipset <b>110</b> via the first host bus <b>104</b>. Further, the n<sup>th </sup>physical processor <b>101</b> can be coupled to the chipset <b>110</b> via the second host bus <b>108</b>. The chipset <b>110</b> can support multiple processors and can allow for simultaneous processing of multiple processors and support the exchange of information within information handling system <b>100</b> during multiple processing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one aspect, the chipset <b>110</b> can be referred to as a memory hub or a memory controller. For example, the chipset <b>110</b> can include an Accelerated Hub Architecture (AHA) that uses a dedicated bus to transfer data between first physical processor <b>102</b> and the n<sup>th </sup>physical processor <b>101</b>. For example, the chipset <b>110</b>, including an AHA enabled-chipset, can include a memory controller hub and an input/output (I/O) controller hub. As a memory controller hub, the chipset <b>110</b> can function to provide access to first physical processor <b>102</b> using first bus <b>104</b> and n<sup>th </sup>physical processor <b>101</b> using the second host bus <b>108</b>. The chipset <b>110</b> can also provide a memory interface for accessing memory <b>112</b> using a memory bus <b>114</b>.

In one form, the video graphics interface <b>122</b> can be an Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) interface to display content within a video display unit <b>126</b>. Other graphics interfaces may also be used. The video graphics interface <b>122</b> can provide a video display output <b>128</b> to the video display unit <b>126</b>. The video display unit <b>126</b> can include one or more types of video displays such as a flat panel display (FPD) or other type of display device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The information handling system <b>100</b> can also include an I/O interface <b>130</b> that can be connected via an I/O bus <b>120</b> to the chipset <b>110</b>. The I/O interface <b>130</b> and I/O bus <b>120</b> can include industry standard buses or proprietary buses and respective interfaces or controllers. For example, the I/O bus <b>120</b> can also include a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus or a high speed PCI-Express bus. In one embodiment, a PCI bus can be operated at approximately 11 MHz and a PCI-Express bus can be operated at approximately 128 MHz. PCI buses and PCI-Express buses can be provided to comply with industry standards for connecting and communicating between various PCI-enabled hardware devices. Other buses can also be provided in association with, or independent of, the I/O bus <b>120</b> including, but not limited to, industry standard buses or proprietary buses, such as Industry Standard Architecture (ISA), Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI), Inter-Integrated Circuit (I<sup>2</sup>C), System Packet Interface (SPI), or Universal Serial buses (USBs).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an alternate embodiment, the chipset <b>110</b> can be a chipset employing a Northbridge/Southbridge chipset configuration (not illustrated). For example, a Northbridge portion of the chipset <b>110</b> can communicate with the first physical processor <b>102</b> and can control interaction with the memory <b>112</b>, the I/O bus <b>120</b> that can be operable as a PCI bus, and activities for the video graphics interface <b>122</b>. The Northbridge portion can also communicate with the first physical processor <b>102</b> using first bus <b>104</b> and the second bus <b>108</b> coupled to the n<sup>th </sup>physical processor <b>106</b>. The chipset <b>110</b> can also include a Southbridge portion (not illustrated) of the chipset <b>110</b> and can handle I/O functions of the chipset <b>110</b>. The Southbridge portion can manage the basic forms of I/O such as Universal Serial Bus (USB), serial I/O, audio outputs, Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE), and ISA I/O for the information handling system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The information handling system <b>100</b> can further include a disk controller <b>132</b> coupled to the I/O bus <b>120</b>, and connecting one or more internal disk drives such as a hard disk drive (HDD) <b>134</b> and an optical disk drive (ODD) <b>136</b> such as a Read/Write Compact Disk (R/W CD), a Read/Write Digital Video Disk (R/W DVD), a Read/Write mini-Digital Video Disk (R/W mini-DVD), or other type of optical disk drive. The internal disk drives may include a Solid State Drive (SSD) (not shown) such as flash memory, EEPROMs or any other type of solid state storage media.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The information handling system <b>100</b> can further include network connectivity via a network interface controller (NIC) <b>138</b> coupled to the I/O Interface <b>130</b>. The NIC <b>138</b> may include any suitable system, apparatus, or device operable to serve as an interface between the information handling system <b>100</b> and a network. The NIC <b>138</b> may enable the information handling system <b>100</b> to communicate over one or more wired or wireless networks using any suitable network transmission protocols or standards for communication over the network. The networks may include communication infrastructure which provide physical connections and a management layer to communicatively couple information handling system <b>100</b> and NIC <b>138</b> to other information handling systems and networked components.

Communication protocols may include without limitation, for example, Fibre Channel, Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Internet Protocol (IP), small computer system interface (SCSI), Internet SCSI, serial advanced technology attachment (SATA), Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or any combination of these or other network protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The information handling system <b>100</b> can include a service processor <b>140</b> to enable remote monitoring and management of the information handling system <b>100</b>. Typically, a service processor controls and monitors power supplies, cooling systems, system sensors among other functional aspects of the information handling system <b>100</b>. The service processor may contain its own CPU, memory <b>142</b>, power supply (not shown), and NIC <b>144</b>. Additionally, the service processor may be connected to many, if not all, of the components of the information handling system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The service processor may even be connected to system peripherals including I/O devices, RAID memory, or devices operating via a NIC.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the service processor NIC <b>144</b> may be a dedicated NIC or, alternatively, it may be a NIC shared with the information handling system. The service processor may be connected via a network connection, such as an Ethernet connection, to a remote information handling system serving as a management station. Secure connection may be established with the management station or an alternative remote information handling system. Example secure connections via NIC <b>144</b> can include network communication using secure protocols such as HTTPS and messaging via communication protocols such as the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Remote management may be conducted via the NIC <b>144</b> using management protocols such as WS-Management (WSMAN) protocol, RMCP, SNMP, or similar protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The service processor <b>140</b> and its connections to information handling system components permit data to be acquired from the various components. For example, the service processor <b>140</b> may read registers at the various components of information handling system <b>100</b> and acquire data that relates to configuration settings for a variety of attributes of each component. For example, a device driver that is associated with a disk drive may have several attributes that relate to the disk drive component. There may be dozens of attributes associated with the disk drive component. Fundamentally, whether or not the disk drive is enabled is one attribute. Other example disk drive attributes may relate to settings for power saving options, caching enablement, and drive partitioning among others. Each component within the information handling system <b>100</b> is set up similarly with multiple attributes associated with the component that define its configuration within the overall configuration of the information handling system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The information handling system <b>100</b> may run on a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) compliant basic input/output system (BIOS) (not shown) in accordance with a specific embodiment of the present disclosure. The UEFI BIOS may be stored in flash memory that may be connected to the information handling system <b>100</b> via the disk controller <b>132</b>. The UEFI BIOS may include a Human Interface Infrastructure (HII) database. The HII database may be used to store information describing the configuration of components included at the information handling system <b>100</b>, and to provide an interface through which the configuration of components in the system <b>100</b> can be manipulated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The information handling system <b>100</b>, and the UEFI BIOS in particular, is preferably substantially compliant with one or more revisions of the UEFI specification. Furthermore, the UEFI BIOS includes enhancements to extend the existing capabilities of the UEFI specification in order to provide particular operational benefits above the existing UEFI specification. In an embodiment, a method and a corresponding system is disclosed to facilitate analysis of the configuration of selected system attributes in the information handling system. For example, UEFI compliant device drivers associated with subsystem components may disclose respective configuration information. In a particular example, a UEFI compliant driver associated with a disk drive component may include data defining configuration attributes for the driver. Consequently, application software, such as system configuration software, can manage and detect the configuration of the component in the information handling system.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The techniques disclosed herein can be used by application software to detect and quantify component configuration variances between a selected information handling system and a &#x201c;baseline&#x201d; configuration in a baseline information handling system. The administration and configuration of information handling systems may be conducted both locally and remotely. An application program comprising an embedded system comparison tool is a systematic methodology to discover devices and associated configurable attributes in a systematic manner within the information handling system. For example, an embedded system comparison application running on a service processor <b>140</b> can extract configuration information from an information handling system using UEFI protocols, and determine a relationship between the configuration options and the various devices included in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The embedded system comparison tool may be implemented as an embedded component within the system. Specifically in one embodiment, the embedded system comparison tool may be embedded within the service processor in the information handling system. The embedded system comparison tool in the described embodiment may be part of the service processor firmware. In an alternative embodiment, the embedded system comparison tool may be part of a BIOS/UEFI application for management of the selected information handling system. Example components of the information handling system assessed by the embedded system comparison tool can include system BIOS, RAID, NIC, and other hardware and firmware components.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With the embedded system comparison tool functionality, an information handling system selected for analysis may have the embedded ability to compare itself against another information handling system and calculate the differences in configuration information. The embedded tool in a selected information handling system may use a baseline information handling system as a target or baseline of system configuration information and settings for the selected information handling system. The baseline information handling system data may be acquired via an internet protocol address pointing to the baseline information handling system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The embedded system comparison tool is also remotely accessible. As long as the services processor is active or the system is running the BIOS/UEFI application and the baseline information handling system is accessible via a network, the tool can be utilized. The embedded comparison tool will remotely acquire the baseline system information using secure network protocols currently implemented in the information handling system and the BIOS/UEFI running on the system. The NIC <b>144</b> may be used for example to support remote access by a management station via a secured network connection.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a comparison <b>200</b> between a selected information handling system (system 1) <b>210</b> and a baseline information handling system (system 2) <b>220</b>. It can be appreciated that any two information handling system configurations may be compared using the embedded comparison tool and the method disclosed. The embedded comparison tool establishes proper credentials <b>230</b> and inputs the baseline information handling system address to execute a comparison. With the credentials and address, a secure request <b>240</b> is placed from the selected information handling system <b>210</b> to the baseline information handling system <b>220</b> via any type of wired or wireless network connection or connections such as those described above. For example, the secure request may be sent via the WSMAN protocol to the baseline system <b>220</b>. The baseline information handling system <b>220</b> authenticates the request at <b>250</b>. In the described embodiment, the baseline information handling system <b>220</b> collects configuration data and provides a request response <b>260</b> to the selected information handling system <b>210</b>. The baseline information handling system configuration data and settings for various attributes may be detected from registers at the baseline information handling system's components. These data settings provide the baseline information handling system's configuration. In an alternative embodiment, the baseline configuration data and settings may have been previously collected for provision with the request response <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The request response <b>260</b> provides the target baseline information handling system data to the selected information handling system <b>210</b>. This may include baseline configuration data relating to boot configuration, system BIOS, NIC, RAID and other components. The target baseline information handling system configuration data may be received at the service processor of the selected information handling system <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The embedded comparison system tool in the selected information handling system <b>210</b> service processor processes the target baseline information handling system data <b>270</b> to perform the configuration variance calculations on the selected information handling system <b>210</b>. The algorithm shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and described below may be used to parse and compare the system configurations. The configuration variance calculations show the difference between the selected information handling system <b>210</b> and an information handling system with the desired baseline configuration <b>220</b>. These calculated differences are useful to efficiently manage the selected information handling system's configuration or detect differences that may explain operational differences between the compared systems.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embedded system comparison tool may calculate differences from among hundreds of attributes and configuration details for the information handling system platform, its storage, and its I/O subsystems. Generally, the configuration information can comprise hardware inventory data including types of hardware present and how that hardware is connected. Configuration information may comprise firmware inventory data including what versions of firmware are present. Configuration information may also comprise configuration inventory that can include huge volumes of data. For example, BIOS configurations may comprise hundreds of attribute settings, RAID configurations may comprise dozens of attribute settings, and hard disk drives, virtual drive or other storage systems may comprise dozens of individual settings each. NICs may comprise the type of network interface as well as thousands of settings relating to partition levels and controls. Many additional hardware components discussed above in the context of information handling systems may each have a multitude of settings. Those settings may also be detected on a baseline information handling system for comparison to the selected information handling system. A manual comparison of each server configuration against a desired baseline may be time consuming, tedious, and error-prone.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At <b>280</b>, the embedded comparison system may generate a report outlining the differences between the selected information handling system <b>210</b> and the baseline information handling system <b>220</b>. This variance report may be stored in the selected information handling system's database or stored at another storage location. Similarly the variance report may be displayed by the selected information handling system, or may be sent to a different information handling system for display. For example, a variance report may be sent to a PDA or smartphone for use in configuration synchronization by a technician. Alternatively, the variance report may be sent to and stored at a remote management station for display to a remotely located system configuration technician. Analysis of the variance report may alternatively be used to determine causes in code errors that appear when code is run on one information handling system, but do not appear on a baseline information handling system when the same code is run.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a flowchart showing an example method of an embedded system comparison. According to one embodiment, method <b>300</b> may begin at step <b>305</b>. As noted above, the teachings of the present disclosure may be implemented in a variety of ways within the embedded system comparison tool described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The preferred beginning point and the order of steps <b>305</b>-<b>390</b> comprising method <b>300</b> may depend on the implementation chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At <b>305</b>, the embedded comparison tool acquires the selected information handling system (system 1) configuration information from a data source within the selected information handling system. This data source may be a database associated with the service processor of the selected information handling system or may be a tangible storage medium associated with the selected information handling system platform. The selected information handling system configuration data may have been acquired from the selected information handling system by reading the registers of an UEFI BIOS compliant system to acquire data for the several attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At <b>310</b>, the embedded comparison system acquires the baseline information handling system (system 2) target configuration information via a request response from the baseline information handling system as described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The target configuration information includes data for the various attributes of the baseline information handling system as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Using hardware inventory information from the configuration data acquired from both the selected and baseline information handling systems, the embedded comparison system conducts a variance analysis by identifying a component for comparison in the selected baseline information handling system at <b>315</b>. At <b>320</b>, the embedded comparison system parses the baseline information handling system target configuration data for a matching component. At <b>325</b>, if a matching component is not found, an output notes the absence of the component at <b>330</b> and stores this information in a database. If a matching component is found at <b>325</b>, the embedded comparison system identifies an attribute for that component in the selected information handling system at <b>335</b>. At <b>340</b>, the embedded comparison system parses the baseline information handling system target configuration data to identify a matching attribute. If the attribute is not found at <b>345</b>, the embedded comparison system notes the absence of the attribute at <b>350</b> and stores the information in a database. If the attribute is found at <b>345</b>, the system assesses the configuration setting values for the selected information handling system and the baseline information handling system at <b>355</b>. The embedded comparison system then calculates a variance value between the configuration settings of the attribute at <b>355</b>. This variance value is output and stored in a database.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At <b>360</b>, the embedded comparison system determines if the last attribute for a component has been reached. If not, the embedded comparison system assesses the next attribute for the component at <b>335</b>. The system then parses the baseline information handling system target configuration data at <b>340</b> for a matching attribute and the processing proceeds as described above for attributes at <b>340</b>-<b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If the last attribute has been reached at <b>360</b>, the system assesses whether the last component for the selected information handling system has been analyzed at <b>365</b>. If the last component has not been assessed, the embedded comparison system assesses the next component for the selected information handling system at <b>315</b>. The system then parses the baseline information handling system target configuration data at <b>320</b> for a matching component and the processing proceeds as described above. The system may determine at <b>370</b> what components may remain in the baseline information handling system target configuration data to determine what components exist in the baseline system but are absent in the selected information handling system. This information is noted and stored in a database at <b>375</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Optionally at <b>380</b>, the embedded comparison system uses the stored variance data to create a variance report as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The variance report generated by the embedded comparison system may include some or all of the stored variance data and may be customizable to include specific configuration variance information.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A built-in or embedded always-available mechanism to discern the configuration differences between a selected information handling system and an information handling system with a desired baseline configuration has several advantages. Several inefficiencies may be avoided by embedding the software tools to compare a specific information handling system against a baseline configuration and discern the configuration differences. There is no dedicated information handling system needed to run the system comparison tool. There is no need to run agents on the selected information handling systems. The information handling system comparison does not interrupt or otherwise burden the operating system of the selected information handling system if the embedded comparison system is run on the service processor. Finally, the embedded system comparison tool is available and installed when needed to configure the selected information handling system.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although only a few exemplary embodiments have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the embodiments of the present disclosure.
