<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to improved vaccines, improved methods for prophylactically and/or therapeutically immunizing individuals against immunogens, and to improved immunotherapeutic compositions and improved immunotherapy methods.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Immunotherapy refers to modulating a person's immune responses to impart a desirable therapeutic effect. Immunotherapeutics refer to those compositions which, when administered to an individual, modulate the individual's immune system sufficient to ultimately decrease symptoms which are associated with undesirable immune responses or to ultimately alleviate symptoms by increasing desirable immune responses. In some cases, immunotherapy is part of a vaccination protocol in which the individual is administered a vaccine that exposes the individual to an immunogen against which the individual generates an immune response in such cases, the immunotherapeutic increases the immune response and/or selectively enhances a portion of the immune response (such as the cellular arm or the humoral arm) which is desirable to treat or prevent the particular condition, infection or disease.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vaccine protocols can be improved by the delivery of agents that modulate a person's immune responses to induce an improved immune response. In some vaccination protocols in which the individual is administered a vaccine that exposes the individual to an immunogen against which the individual generates an immune response, an agent is provided that increases the immune response and/or selectively enhances a portion of the immune response (such as the cellular arm or the humoral arm) which is desirable to treat or prevent the particular condition, infection or disease.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Vaccines are useful to immunize individuals against target antigens such as allergens, pathogen antigens or antigens associated with cells involved in human diseases. Antigens associated with cells involved in human diseases include cancer-associated tumor antigens and antigens associated with cells involved in autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In designing such vaccines, it has been recognized that vaccines that produce the target antigen in cells of the vaccinated individual are effective in inducing the cellular arm of the immune system. Specifically, live attenuated vaccines, recombinant vaccines which use avirulent vectors, and DNA vaccines each lead to the production of antigens in the cell of the vaccinated individual which results in induction of the cellular arm of the immune system. On the other hand, killed or inactivated vaccines, and sub-unit vaccines which comprise only proteins do not induce good cellular immune responses although they do induce an effective humoral response.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A cellular immune response is often necessary to provide protection against pathogen infection and to provide effective immune-mediated therapy for treatment of pathogen infection, cancer or autoimmune diseases. Accordingly, vaccines that produce the target antigen in cells of the vaccinated individual such as live attenuated vaccines, recombinant vaccines that use avirulent vectors and DNA vaccines are often preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The generation of potent CD8+ T cell responses by DNA vaccine technology is a goal sought by DNA vaccine developers. There are reports that CD8+ T cells contribute to controlling viral replication in both human (Koup et al., 1994; Cao et al., 1995; Musey et al., 1997; Ogg et al., 1998; Betts et al., 1999) and non human primate models (Jin et al., 1999; Schmitz et al., 1999; Barouch et al., 2000; Amara et al., 2001; Shiver et al., 2002) in the HIV model as well as other viral infections.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many different strategies have been used along with DNA vaccine technology, including improved delivery techniques, enhanced construct design, heterologous prime-boost strategies, and the use of molecular adjuvants. Molecular adjuvants including chemokines and cytokines can be incorporated into a vaccine strategy to skew the immune response towards cellular or humoral immunity. Cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-15 have been effective in enhancing the immune response in both murine and non-human primate models (Morrow and Weiner, 2008).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Interleukin-15 (IL-15) has been shown to play a role in the generation and maintenance of CD8+ T cells as it signals through the common &#x3b2;&#x3b3; chain, which is also utilized by IL-2. IL-15 has been shown to be trans-presented on the surface of antigen presenting cells via IL-15R&#x3b1; during the priming of Natural Killer and CD8+ T cells (Dubois et al., 2002; Koka et al., 2004; Lucas et al., 2007; Sato et al., 2007). IL-15R&#x3b1; has also recently been shown to play a role in the regulation of IL-15 secretion (Duitman et al., 2008). This cell surface complex is thought to allow IL-15 to signal thorough the &#x3b2;&#x3b3; receptor on memory CD8+ T cells promoting cell division and survival of these cells (Lodolce et al., 1998; Kennedy et al., 2000; Lodolce et al., 2001; Burkett et al., 2003; Burkett et al., 2004; Sandau et al., 2004; Schluns et al., 2004a; Schluns et al., 2004b). IL-15 and IL-15R&#x3b1; together as a complex exhibit enhanced stability and secretion compared to either molecule alone (Bergamaschi et al., 2008).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In regards to its employment in vaccination models, the use of plasmid-encoded IL-15 as an HIV-1 vaccine adjuvant has been previously reported to enhance cytolytic and memory CD8+ T cell responses in mice (Oh et al., 2003; Kutzler et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Calarota et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008). Studies in rhesus macaques have also shown the ability of IL-15 to enhance effector functions of CD4+ T cells (Picker et al., 2006) and rescued dual IFN-&#x3b3;/TNF responses in both effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Halwani et al., 2008). Importantly, addition of pIL-15 with SIV/HIV antigens in rhesus macaques resulted in enhanced protection after SHIV89.6p challenge (Boyer et al., 2007).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">While such vaccines are often effective to immunize individuals prophylactically or therapeutically against pathogen infection or human diseases, there is a need for improved vaccines. There is a need for compositions and methods that produce an enhanced immune response. There still remains a need for improved strategies to enable effective DNA vaccines, including new adjuvants that enhance the immune response to DNA vaccines.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Likewise, while some immunotherapeutics are useful to modulate immune response in a patient there remains a need for improved immunotherapeutic compositions and methods.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d; is meant to refer to a fragment of IL-15Ra that, when delivered in conjunction with an immunogen, provides an increased immune response compared to the immune that is induced when the immunogen is delivered without the fragment. Fragments are generally 10 or more amino acids in length.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein the term &#x201c;target protein&#x201d; is meant to refer to peptides and protein encoded by gene constructs of the present invention that act as target proteins for an immune response. The terms &#x201c;target protein&#x201d; and &#x201c;immunogen&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to a protein against which an immune response can be elicited. The target protein is an immunogenic protein that shares at least an epitope with a protein from the pathogen or undesirable cell-type such as a cancer cell or a cell involved in autoimmune disease against which an immune response is desired. The immune response directed against the target protein will protect the individual against and/or treat the individual for the specific infection or disease with which the target protein is associated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;genetic construct&#x201d; refers to the DNA or RNA molecules that comprise a nucleotide sequence which encodes a target protein or immunomodulating protein. The coding sequence includes initiation and termination signals operably linked to regulatory elements including a promoter and polyadenylation signal capable of directing expression in the cells of the individual to whom the nucleic acid molecule is administered.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As used herein, the term &#x201c;expressible form&#x201d; refers to gene constructs that contain the necessary regulatory elements operably linked to a coding sequence that encodes a target protein or an immunomodulating protein, such that when present in the cell of the individual, the coding sequence will be expressed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used herein, the term &#x201c;sharing an epitope&#x201d; refers to proteins that comprise at least one epitope that is identical to or substantially similar to an epitope of another protein.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially similar epitope&#x201d; is meant to refer to an epitope that has a structure that is not identical to an epitope of a protein but nonetheless invokes a cellular or humoral immune response that cross-reacts to that protein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;intracellular pathogen&#x201d; is meant to refer to a virus or pathogenic organism that, at least part of its reproductive or life cycle, exists within a host cell and therein produces or causes to be produced, pathogen proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x201c;hyperproliferative diseases&#x201d; is meant to refer to those diseases and disorders characterized by hyperproliferation of cells.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, the term &#x201c;hyperproliferative-associated protein&#x201d; is meant to refer to proteins that are associated with a hyperproliferative disease.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The invention arises from the discovery that when delivered as part of a vaccine, nucleic acid molecules that encode IL-15Ra and functional fragments thereof, and combinations thereof modulate immune responses. Accordingly nucleic acid molecules that encode IL-15Ra and functional fragments thereof, and combinations thereof may be delivered as immunotherapeutics in combination with or as components of a vaccine.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, the invention arises from the discovery that when delivered as part of a vaccine, nucleic acid molecules that encode IL-15Ra or functional fragments thereof, in combination with nucleic acid molecules that IL-15 or functional fragments thereof modulate immune responses. Accordingly nucleic acid molecules that encode IL-15Ra or functional fragments thereof, in combination with nucleic acid molecules that IL-15 or functional fragments may be delivered as immunotherapeutics in combination with or as components of a vaccine.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Some aspects of the invention provide the use of nucleic acid coding sequences of IL-15Ra protein in therapeutic vaccines, particularly in such cases where a CD8+ memory T cell response is not desired. Such therapeutic vaccines include those in which the antigen target is an antigen expressed in normal as well as disease associated cells whereby short term elimination of antigen-bearing cells has a therapeutic effect without a long term immune response directed to normal cells expressing the antigen. Accordingly, this aspect of the invention is particularly useful in therapeutic vaccines directed toward antigens on cancer cells which are also present on normal cells, therapeutic vaccines directed toward antigens expressed by cells associated with autoimmune disease which are also present on normal cells, and therapeutic vaccines directed toward pathogen antigens involved in chronic infections for which a persistent immune response would be undesirable. Chronic infections refer to those pathogen infections in which the pathogen is not cleared. Examples include but are not limited to HCV, HSV, CMV, chicken pox, HIV, and the like, as contrasted with acute infections such as polio, small pox, mumps and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Some aspects of the invention provide the use of nucleic acid coding sequences that encodes IL-15Ra protein in combination with nucleic acid coding sequences that encodes IL-15 in therapeutic vaccines, particularly in such cases where an enhanced burst immune response is desired. The combination of nucleic acid coding sequences of IL-15Ra protein and nucleic acid coding sequences that encodes IL-15 provide an additive adjuvant effect upon initial induction of the immune response. The nucleic acid coding sequences that encodes IL-15Ra protein may be administered to the same site as the nucleic acid coding sequences that encodes IL-15 or the nucleic acid coding sequences that encodes IL-15Ra protein and the nucleic acid coding sequences may be delivered to different sites to achieve the additive immune response.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When taken up by a cell, the genetic construct(s) may remain present in the cell as a functioning extrachromosomal molecule. DNA may be introduced into cells, where it is present on a transient basis, in the form of a plasmid or plasmids. Alternatively, RNA may be administered to the cell. It is also contemplated to provide the genetic construct as a linear minichromosome including a centromere, telomeres and an origin of replication. Gene constructs may constitute part of the genetic material in attenuated live microorganisms or recombinant microbial vectors which are administered to subjects. Gene constructs may be part of genomes of recombinant viral vaccines where the genetic material remains extrachromosomal. Genetic constructs include regulatory elements necessary for gene expression of a nucleic acid molecule. The elements include: a promoter, an initiation codon, a stop codon, and a polyadenylation signal. In addition, enhancers are often required for gene expression of the sequence that encodes the target protein or the immunomodulating protein. It is necessary that these elements be operably linked to the sequence that encodes the desired proteins and that the regulatory elements are operable in the individual to whom they are administered.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The present invention may be used to immunize an individual against pathogens such as viruses, prokaryote and pathogenic eukaryotic organisms such as unicellular pathogenic organisms and multicellular parasites. The present invention is particularly useful to immunize an individual against those pathogens which infect cells and which are not encapsulated such as viruses, and prokaryote such as gonorrhea, listeria and shigella. In addition, the present invention is also useful to immunize an individual against protozoan pathogens that include a stage in the life cycle where they are intracellular pathogens. Table 1 provides a listing of some of the viral families and genera for which vaccines according to the present invention can be made. DNA constructs that comprise DNA sequences that encode the peptides that comprise at least an epitope identical or substantially similar to an epitope displayed on a pathogen antigen such as those antigens listed on the tables are useful in vaccines. Moreover, the present invention is also useful to immunize an individual against other pathogens including prokaryotic and eukaryotic protozoan pathogens as well as multicellular parasites such as those listed on Table 2. Those skilled in the art can readily identify and distinguish those pathogens which cause chronic infections from those which are cleared post infection, i.e. acute infection.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In order to produce a genetic vaccine to protect against pathogen infection, genetic material that encodes immunogenic proteins against which a protective immune response can be mounted must be included in a genetic construct as the coding sequence for the target. Because DNA and RNA are both relatively small and can be produced relatively easily, the present invention provides the additional advantage of allowing for vaccination with multiple pathogen antigens. The genetic construct used in the genetic vaccine can include genetic material that encodes many pathogen antigens. For example, several viral genes may be included in a single construct thereby providing multiple targets.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Tables 1 and 2 include lists of some of the pathogenic agents and organisms for which genetic vaccines can be prepared to protect an individual from infection by them. In some preferred embodiments, the methods of immunizing an individual against a pathogen are directed against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile Virus (WNV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Another aspect of the present invention provides a method of conferring a protective immune response against hyperproliferating cells that are characteristic in hyperproliferative diseases and to a method of treating individuals suffering from hyperproliferative diseases. Examples of hyperproliferative diseases include all forms of cancer and psoriasis.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">It has been discovered that introduction of a genetic construct that includes a nucleotide sequence which encodes an immunogenic &#x201c;hyperproliferating cell&#x201d;-associated protein into the cells of an individual results in the production of those proteins in the vaccinated cells of an individual. To immunize against hyperproliferative diseases, a genetic construct that includes a nucleotide sequence that encodes a protein that is associated with a hyperproliferative disease is administered to an individual.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In order for the hyperproliferative-associated protein to be an effective immunogenic target, it must be a protein that is produced exclusively or at higher levels in hyperproliferative cells as compared to normal cells. Target antigens include such proteins, fragments thereof and peptides; which comprise at least an epitope found on such proteins. In some cases, a hyperproliferative-associated protein is the product of a mutation of a gene that encodes a protein. The mutated gene encodes a protein that is nearly identical to the normal protein except it has a slightly different amino acid sequence which results in a different epitope not found on the normal protein. Such target proteins include those which are proteins encoded by oncogenes such as myb, myc, fyn, and the translocation gene bcr/abl, ras, src, P53, neu, trk and EGRF. In addition to oncogene products as target antigens, target proteins for anti-cancer treatments and protective regimens include variable regions of antibodies made by B cell lymphomas and variable regions of T cell receptors of T cell lymphomas which, in some embodiments, are also used target antigens for autoimmune disease. Other tumor-associated proteins can be used as target proteins such as proteins that are found at higher levels in tumor cells including the protein recognized by monoclonal antibody 17-IA and folate binding proteins or PSA.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">While the present invention may be used to immunize an individual against one or more of several forms of cancer, the present invention is particularly useful to prophylactically immunize an individual who is predisposed to develop a particular cancer or who has had cancer and is therefore susceptible to a relapse. Developments in genetics and technology as well as epidemiology allow for the determination of probability and risk assessment for the development of cancer in individual. Using genetic screening and/or family health histories, it is possible to predict the probability a particular individual has for developing any one of several types of cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Similarly, those individuals who have already developed cancer and who have been treated to remove the cancer or are otherwise in remission are particularly susceptible to relapse and reoccurrence. As part of a treatment regimen, such individuals can be immunized against the cancer that they have been diagnosed as having had in order to combat a recurrence. Thus, once it is known that an individual has had a type of cancer and is at risk of a relapse, they can be immunized in order to prepare their immune system to combat any future appearance of the cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The present invention provides a method of treating individuals suffering from hyperproliferative diseases. In such methods, the introduction of genetic constructs serves as an immunotherapeutic, directing and promoting the immune system of the individual to combat hyperproliferative cells that produce the target protein.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The present invention provides a method of treating individuals suffering from autoimmune diseases and disorders by conferring a broad based protective immune response against targets that are associated with autoimmunity including cell receptors and cells which produce &#x201c;self&#x201d;-directed antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">T cell mediated autoimmune diseases include Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), autoimmune thyroiditis, reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, psoriasis, vasculitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Each of these diseases is characterized by T cell receptors that bind to endogenous antigens and initiate the inflammatory cascade associated with autoimmune diseases. Vaccination against the variable region of the T cells would elicit an immune response including CTLs to eliminate those T cells.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In RA, several specific variable regions of T cell receptors (TCRs) that are involved in the disease have been characterized. These TCRs include V.beta.-3, V.beta.-14, 20 V.beta.-17 and Va-17. Thus, vaccination with a DNA construct that encodes at least one of these proteins will elicit an immune response that will target T cells involved in RA. See: Howell, M. D., et al., 1991 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 88:10921-10925; Piliard, X., et al, 1991 Science 253:325-329; Williams, W. V., et al., 1992 J. Clin. Invest. 90:326-333; each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In MS, several specific variable regions of TCRs that are involved in the disease have been characterized. These TCRs include VfP and Va-10. Thus, vaccination with a DNA construct that encodes at least one of these proteins will elicit an immune response that will target T cells involved in MS. See: Wucherpfennig, K. W., et al., 1990 Science 248:1016-1019; Oksenberg, J. R., et al, 1990 Nature 345:344-346; each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In scleroderma, several specific variable regions of TCRs that are involved in the disease have been characterized. These TCRs include V.beta.-6, V.beta.-8, V.beta.-14 and Va-16, Va-3C, Va-7, Va-14, Va-15, Va-16, Va-28 and Va-12. Thus, vaccination with a DNA construct that encodes at least one of these proteins will elicit an immune response that will target T cells involved in scleroderma.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In order to treat patients suffering from a T cell mediated autoimmune disease, particularly those for which the variable region of the TCR has yet to be characterized, a synovial biopsy can be performed. Samples of the T cells present can be taken and the variable region of those TCRs identified using standard techniques. Genetic vaccines can be prepared using this information.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">B cell mediated autoimmune diseases include Lupus (SLE), Grave's disease, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, asthma, cryoglobulinemia, primary biliary sclerosis and pernicious anemia. Each of these diseases is characterized by antibodies that bind to endogenous antigens and initiate the inflammatory cascade associated with autoimmune diseases. Vaccination against the variable region of antibodies would elicit an immune response including CTLs to eliminate those B cells that produce the antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In order to treat patients suffering from a B cell mediated autoimmune disease, the variable region of the antibodies involved in the autoimmune activity must be identified. A biopsy can be performed and samples of the antibodies present at a site of inflammation can be taken. The variable region of those antibodies can be identified using standard techniques. Genetic vaccines can be prepared using this information.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the case of SLE, one antigen is believed to be DNA. Thus, in patients to be immunized against SLE, their sera can be screened for anti-DNA antibodies and a vaccine can be prepared which includes DNA constructs that encode the variable region of such anti-DNA antibodies found in the sera.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Common structural features among the variable regions of both TCRs and antibodies are well known. The DNA sequence encoding a particular TCR or antibody can generally be found following well known methods such as those described in Kabat, et al 1987 Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda Md., which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, a general method for cloning functional variable regions from antibodies can be found in Chaudhary, V. K., et al, 1990 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:1066, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In addition to using expressible forms of immunomodulating protein coding sequences to improve genetic vaccines, the present invention relates to improved attenuated live vaccines and improved vaccines that use recombinant vectors to deliver foreign genes that encode antigens. Examples of attenuated live vaccines and those using recombinant vectors to deliver foreign antigens are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,722,848; 5,017,487; 5,077,044; 5,110,587; 5,112,749; 5,174,993; 5,223,424; 5,225,336; 5,240,703; 5,242,829; 5,294,441; 5,294,548; 5,310,668; 5,387,744; 5,389,368; 5,424,065; 5,451,499; 5,453,364; 5,462,734; 5,470,734; and 5,482,713, which are each incorporated herein by reference. Gene constructs are provided which include the nucleotide sequence that encodes an IL-R15&#x3b1; or functional fragments thereof, wherein the nucleotide sequence is operably linked to regulatory sequences that can function in the vaccine to effect expression. The gene constructs are incorporated in the attenuated live vaccines and recombinant vaccines to produce improved vaccines according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The present invention provides an improved method of immunizing individuals that comprises the step of delivering gene constructs to the cells of individuals as part of vaccine compositions which include DNA vaccines, attenuated live vaccines and recombinant vaccines. The gene constructs comprise a nucleotide sequence that encodes an IL-15 RECEPTOR ALPHA or functional fragments and that is operably linked to regulatory sequences that can function in the vaccine to effect expression. The improved vaccines result in an enhanced cellular immune response.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Mice were co-immunized with pIL-15 and pIL-15R&#x3b1; to determine enhanced immune response generated using HIV-1 DNA vaccine antigens. Data show that although the IL-15 and IL-15R&#x3b1; combination indeed enhanced the overall cellular immune response, surprisingly the IL-15R&#x3b1; plasmid augmented immune responses in an IL-15 independent manner. Importantly, the induced memory response was only maintained in mice co-vaccinated with pIL-15 as well as the pIL-15R&#x3b1;, but not the IL-15R&#x3b1; alone. These studies for the first time demonstrate that the IL-15R&#x3b1; protein alone can function as an adjuvant with a limited immune expansion phenotype.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Materials and Methods</heading>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Western Blot Analysis</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Western blotting analysis was performed according to standard protocols. 3 &#x3bc;g per well of recombinant IL-15R&#x3b1; or VPR protein (Abgent) was run on a SDS-PAGE gel (Cambrex, Rockland, Me.), blotted on nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with either the R&#x26;D or the KK1.23 anti-human IL-15R&#x3b1; antibody. The signal was amplified using an anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Zymed) and detected with ECL (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, United Kingdom).</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">DNA Plasmids</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">DNA vaccine constructs expressing HIV-1gag and HIV-1pol (Kim et al., 1998) and human IL-15 (Kutzler et al., 2005) were prepared as previously described. The open reading frame of human IL-15R&#x3b1; was moved into pVAX1 and pTRACER vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Restriction enzyme digestion using EcoRI and BamHI or NheI and EcoRI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) were used, respectively. Positive clones were verified by sequence analysis.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">In-Vitro Translation Assay</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The TNT-T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega, Wis.) and [35S] methionine were used to create labeled IL-15R&#x3b1; protein product. pVAX vector alone (negative control) or pVAX vector containing IL-15R&#x3b1; and [35S] methionine were added to the reaction mix according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. The reaction was carried out at 30&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. Labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated using 5 &#x3bc;g purified monoclonal anti-IL-15R&#x3b1; antibody (R&#x26;D Systems) or Clone KK1.23 at 4&#xb0; C. with rotation overnight in RIPA buffer. Approximately 5 mg of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) (50 &#x3bc;L of 100 mg/mL stock) was added to each immunoprecipitation reaction, and the samples were incubated at 4&#xb0; C. with rotation for 2 hours. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer containing high salt and bovine serum albumin and finally suspended in 2&#xd7; sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated protein complexes were eluted from sepharose beads by boiling for 5 minutes and were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Cambrex). The gel was fixed and treated with amplifying solution (GE Healthcare), and dried for 2 hours in a gel drier (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). The dried gel was exposed to X-ray film at &#x2212;80&#xb0; and developed using the Kodak automatic developer (Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.).</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Indirect Immunofluorescent Assay</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The indirect immunofluorescent assay for confirmation of the pIL-15R&#x3b1; plasmid expression was conducted by the following protocol previously described (Ramanathan et al., 2002). HeLa cells (ATCC, Rockville, Md.) grown in slide chambers (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass.) at a density of 100,000 cells per chamber in complete DMEM plus 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, Utah) and antibiotic-antimycotic (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) were allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were transfected with pIL-15R&#x3b1;p TRACER or pVAX-1 (1 m/well) using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) according to manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed on slides using 2% PFA/PBS for 1 hour at RT. Slides were incubated with 5 ug Clone KK1.23 mouse antihuman IL-15R&#x3b1; made in our laboratory or IgG1 Isotype control (R&#x26;D systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) for 90 minutes at 37 degrees. Anti mouse IgG-Rhodamine conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.) was added at 1:200 and the slides were incubated for 45 minutes at RT. Following, DAPI (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) stain for 10 minutes at RT, slides were mounted in Fluoromount G medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pa.) and analyzed using the Phase 3 Image Pro Program for fluorescent microscopy (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, Md.).</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Plasmid Immunization and Mice</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The tibialis anterior muscle of 6 to 8 week old female BALB/c (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.), C57BL/6 (Taconic, Germantown, N.Y.), or IL-15 knockout (Taconic) (Kennedy et al., 2000) mice were injected 3 times, 2 weeks apart, and electroporated as previously described (Khan et al., 2003; Laddy et al., 2008) using the CELLECTRA&#xae; adaptive constant current device (VGX Pharmaceuticals, The Woodlands, Tex.). For all experiments in mice, the animals were immunized with either 35 ug of pVAX1, 5 &#x3bc;g of HIV-1 antigenic plasmid (gag, pol), 10 &#x3bc;g of pIL-15, and/or 7.5, 10, or 15 &#x3bc;g of pIL-15R&#x3b1; (n=3-7 per group). Co-administration of various gene plasmids involved mixing the designated DNA plasmids before injection in 0.25% bupivicaine-HCL (Sigma) in isotonic citrate buffer (Kim et al., 1998; Kutzler et al., 2005) to a final volume of 40 &#x3bc;l. All animals were housed in a temperature-controlled, light-cycled facility at the University of Pennsylvania, and their care was under the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Method for Mouse Sacrifice, Sample Collection and Tissue Harvest</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">At timepoints designated in the immunization schedule, the animals were sedated using an analgesic and blood, was taken before animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The spleen from each mouse were harvested and pooled (per experimental group) into a 15 ml conical containing R10 medium (RPMI1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotic/antimycotic, and B-Mercaptoethanol). In a sterile tissue culture hood, the pooled spleen/medium mixture from each experimental group was crushed into a single cell suspension using a stomacher apparatus (Seward 80, Metrohm, Riverview, Fla.). The cell/tissue stroma were put through a 40-micron cell strainer and washed with R10, pelleted and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature in ACK lysing buffer (Lonza, Switzerland) to lyse red blood cells. The splenocytes were then counted and utilized in immune assays described below.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">IFN-&#x3b3; ELISPOT Assay</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">IFN-&#x3b3; ELISPOT was performed as previously described (Kutzler et al., 2005) to determine antigen specific cytokine secretion from immunized mice. Briefly, ELISpot 96-well plates are coated with anti-mouse IFN-&#x3b3; capture antibody and incubated for 24 hours at 4&#xb0; C. (R&#x26;D Systems). 2&#xd7;105 splenocytes from immunized mice were added to each well of an ELISpot plate and stimulated overnight at 37&#xb0; C., 5% CO2, in the presence of R10 (negative control), concanavalin A (positive control), or specific peptide (HIV-1 gag or pol) antigens (10 &#x3bc;g/ml). HIV-1 Consensus Clade B subtype HIV-1 gag and pol 15-mer peptides spanning the entire respective protein, overlapping by 11 amino acids, were acquired from by the AIDS Reagent and Reference Repository (Frederick, Md.). For CD8 depletion experiments, CD8+ T cells were removed from total splenocytes by positive magnetic selection using an anti-CD8a (Ly-2) antibody (Miltenyi Biotech, Germany) according to manufacture's protocol. Following 24 hours of stimulation, the plates were washed and incubated at 4&#xb0; C. overnight with biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-&#x3b3; antibody (R&#x26;D Systems). The plates were washed and incubated with streptavidinalkaline phosphatase (R&#x26;D Systems) for 2 hours at room temperature. The plate was washed, and 5-Bromo-4-Chloro-3&#x2032; Indolylphosphate p-Toluidine Salt (BCIP) and Nitro Blue Tetrazololium Chloride (NBT) (the Chromogen Color Reagent, R&#x26;D Systems) was added. The plate was rinsed with distilled water, and dried at room temperature. Spots were counted by an automated ELISpot reader (CTL Limited, Inc. Cleveland, Ohio). Raw values are determined and multiplied by a factor of five so that data is represented as spot forming cells per million splenocytes. Background values in the R10 wells of each group were subtracted from peptide-stimulated wells before graphing.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Intracellular Cytokine Staining HIV-1 specific T cell responses were also determined by intracellular cytokine staining using the Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit and standard protocol (BD Biosciences). Splenocytes from immunized mice were stimulated for 5 hours in the presence of 1 ul/ml GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) with R10 and DMSO (negative control), 10 ng/ml PMA and 250 ng/ml ionomycin (positive control), or HIV-1 consensus Clade B gag or pol 15-mer peptides. Prior to surface staining, cells were stained with the LIVE/DEAD fixable violet kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) at 37&#xb0; for 10 minutes and Fc block (BD) was added for 15 minutes at 4&#xb0; to block Fc receptors. All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences and used at 1 ul/test. Prior to permeabilization/fixation cells were stained with CD4-Alexa700 and CD8-PerCP for 30 minutes at 4 o. CD3-PECy5 and IFN-&#x3b3; PE-Cy7 were included in the intracellular stain for 45 minutes at 4 o. Data from 50,000 live CD3+ lymphocyte gated events were acquired using a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Inc., Ashland, Oreg.). Responses from the negative control wells were subtracted from the antigenic stimulations prior to graphing.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Analysis of HIV-1Gag Binding Antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">ELISA was used to determine HIV-1 Gag-specific antibodies IgG in mouse sera as described (Ogawa et al., 1989; Mestecky et al., 2004). EIA/RIA plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, Mass.) were coated with 1 &#x3bc;g/ml of recombinant HIV-1IIIB gag p24 (Immunodiagnostics, Woburn, Mass.) diluted in PBS (Mediatech, Herndon, Va.) at a final volume of 100 ul per well and incubated overnight at 4 C. Plates were washed with PBS/Tween (0.05% Tween 20) and blocked against non-specific binding with 200 &#x3bc;l of blocking buffer/diluent (3% BSA in PBS) for 2 hours at room temperature. The plates were washed and diultions of pooled sera from immunized mice were added in triplicate (100 &#x3bc;l per well), at dilutions from 1 to 10 to 1 to 1600 and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Zymed) and developed with substrate TMB H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich). The color reaction was stopped with 2N H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm read in an EL312 Bio-Kinetics microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, Vt.).</p>

<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Generation of Anti-Human IL-15R&#x3b1; Antibody</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">A monoclonal antibody was generated against human IL-15R&#x3b1;, as commercially available antibodies are deficient in the ability to detect expression of the IL-15R&#x3b1; plasmid (pIL-15R&#x3b1;) on cells. Recombinant human IL-15R&#x3b1; was generated as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Recombinant human IL-15R&#x3b1; protein was generated by Abgent (San Diego, Calif.). The open reading frame of human IL-15R&#x3b1; (a generous gift from Thomas Waldmann (NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Md.)) was cloned into high expressing bacterial vector, pET21a (EMD Biosciences, Gibbstown, N.J.). Competent cells were transformed, amplified in <i>E. coli</i>, and recombinant protein was purified using a Ni-NTA column. The accuracy of the purified protein was confirmed by direct ELISA using anti-human IL-15R&#x3b1; antibody (R&#x26;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">To confirm the size of the newly generated IL-15R&#x3b1; protein, decreasing dilutions of purified protein were run on a SDS-PAGE gel and stained with coomassie blue dye (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>).

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">To generate an antibody against IL-15R&#x3b1;, recombinant human IL-15R&#x3b1; protein was injected into BALB/c mice as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, and as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Recombinant human IL-15R&#x3b1; protein was injected into BALB/c mice (n=4) for monoclonal antibody generation. 5 &#x3bc;g of total protein emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (first immunization only) or incomplete Freund's adjuvant (subsequent immunizations) was given per injection (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). 50 &#x3bc;l was injected subcutaneously into each flank and 100 &#x3bc;l was injected into the peritoneum. Mice were given a final boost of 35 ug protein in sterile PBS intravenously three days prior to fusion. Antibody levels in the sera were determined by direct ELISA using recombinant IL-15R&#x3b1; protein and anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Zymed, San Francisco, Calif.). One mouse with a 1:8,000 titer of antibody against IL-15R&#x3b1; was sacrificed at its spleen removed for fusion with a myeloma cell line. 1,500 hybridoma supernatants were screened by ELISA, 8 positive clones were expanded, and one was purified by an ammonium sulfate column, antibody KK1.23. Monoclonal antibodies were generated and purified by Julia Conicello of the Wistar Institute Hybridoma Facility (Philadelphia, Pa.).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">After screening approximately 1,500 hybridoma supernatants by ELISA, one hybridoma KK1.23 exhibited titers of antibody (&#x3e;1 to 12,800) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. This hybridoma was subsequently cloned, expanded, and purified. Purified antibody KK1.23 is specific for human IL-15R&#x3b1; as shown by Western blot analysis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>. In addition, KK1.23 appears to bind to human IL-15R&#x3b1; with a higher affinity than the commercially available antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">pIL-15R&#x3b1; Expresses Bioactive Protein</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">An IL-15R&#x3b1; expression vector was created that was suitable for use in vaccination studies. The human IL-15R&#x3b1; ORF was cloned into the pVAX1 expression vector as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, under the control of the CMV promoter. To assess the appropriate expression of the IL-15R&#x3b1; plasmid, an in vitro translation assay was carried out. The S35 radiolabeled protein is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B &#x26; 2C</figref> migrating at roughly 30.0 kD, whereas the control plasmid, pVAX, did not yield any detectable protein product as expected. The commercial R&#x26;D (<b>2</b>B) or the KK1.23 (<b>2</b>C) antibody against human IL-15R&#x3b1; was utilized to immunoprecipitate the radiolabeled protein.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">To confirm expression of the plasmid IL-15R&#x3b1;, an immunoflourescence assay was performed using the KK1.23 antibody from Example I, above. The ORF of human IL-15R&#x3b1; was cloned into the pTRACER expression vector, which also encodes for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. Therefore, cells fluorescing green (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E-G</figref>) also express pIL-15R&#x3b1;. The KK1.23 anti-human IL-15R&#x3b1; is detected using anti-mouse IgG-PE (Red). The untransfected control is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, and the isotype control in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. The data illustrates both the ability of the pIL-15R&#x3b1; plasmid to express as well as the ability of the anti-human pIL-15R&#x3b1; antibody to detect the translated protein product. The pIL-15R&#x3b1; plasmid encodes for a conformationally accurate and surface localized protein.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Combining pIL-15 and pIL-15R&#x3b1; as an Adjuvant</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">To examine the ability of pIL-15R&#x3b1; to enhance immune responses as compared with pIL-15, BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly in the tibialis anterior muscle accompanied by in vivo electroporation, according to the schedule shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Mice were immunized with either pVAX control vector, or 5 &#x3bc;g of antigenic constructs (HIV-1 gag, HIV-1 pol) with 10 &#x3bc;g of pIL-15, 15 &#x3bc;g of pIL-15R&#x3b1;, or both pIL-15 and pIL-15R&#x3b1; in a final volume of 40 ul. These doses were predetermined to give optimal responses in preliminary studies (data not shown). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, immunization with antigenic constructs alone resulted in 2,300 spot forming cells (SFC)/106 splenocytes as measured by IFN-&#x3b3; ELISpot. The addition of pIL-15 enhanced the response to 3,800 SFC, while co-immunization with pIL-15R&#x3b1; and pIL-15 exhibited the most dramatic increase over the antigenic group alone, resulting in 5,900 SFC. These results support the idea that the formation of the IL-15/IL-15R&#x3b1; immune complex can serve as a more potent adjuvant than IL-15 alone.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">To determine whether this immune complex was truly being formed in vivo, another immunization group was added in which the pIL-15 and pIL-15R&#x3b1; were injected (with antigen) in separate legs. In this split delivery method, plasmid-delivered IL-15 and IL-15R&#x3b1; would be unable to form an immune complex. The co-immunization of pIL-15 and IL-15R&#x3b1; in separate legs was found to elicit levels of IFN-&#x3b3; similar to those observed with the same combination delivered in the same leg (4,562 vs. 4,072 SFC, respectively). It is noted that the immunization group with antigenic construct and pIL-15R&#x3b1; also augmented antigen specific IFN-&#x3b3; secretion to approximately 3500 SFC (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). To confirm these results, we immunized a new set of mice with increasing doses of pIL-15R&#x3b1; plasmid in conjunction with antigenic constructs to see if the pIL-15R&#x3b1; would induce responses in a dose-dependent fashion. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the inclusion of pIL-15R&#x3b1; did enhance the induced IFN-&#x3b3; secretion in a dose dependent fashion, in measured responses against pGag (Panel A) or pPol (Panel B). Regardless of the HIV-1 antigenic construct used, co-immunization with pIL-15R&#x3b1; augmented cellular immune responses by 1.5 to 2 fold at the highest dose used. Notably, IL-15R&#x3b1; appears to enhance antigen specific immune responses even in the absence of IL-15.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">To further confirm the adjuvant properties of pIL-15R&#x3b1;, the effector functions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after vaccination were examined. CD8+ T cells were depleted from splenocytes of mice immunized with each vaccine combination previously mentioned, above, prior to carrying out the IFN-&#x3b3; ELISpot assay. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the depletion of CD8+ T cells from the splenocytes of mice immunized with either pIL-15, pIL-15R&#x3b1; or the combination of both significantly decreased the amount of IFN-&#x3b3; secretion detected. There was no difference between the CD4+ T cell contribution (grey bars) in any of the immunized groups, compared to the total responses observed in whole splenocytes (black bars). Taken together, the combination of pIL-15R&#x3b1; and pIL-15 in a vaccination strategy greatly enhance the immune response over either construct delivered alone. This additive effect primarily acts on CD8+ T cells, as the effect was lost with the depletion of this cell population.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">To determine whether pIL-15R&#x3b1; would also have an effect on humoral immune responses, antibody responses elicited through each vaccination strategy were also measured by ELISA. Sera from immunized mice was assayed to measure the levels of IgG antibodies against the HIV-1 Gag (p24) protein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). While the combination of pIL-15 and pIL-15R&#x3b1; was the best at eliciting cellular immunity, mice immunized with either pIL-15 or pIL-15R&#x3b1; alone had the highest titers of HIV-1 specific antibodies (1:1600) compared to mice immunized with pVAX (not detected), pGag alone or the combination (1:800).</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">The pIL-15Ra Adjuvant Does Not Appear to Enhance CD8+ T Cell Memory</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Mice were immunized three times as previously mentioned, herein; however, instead of sacrificing these animals one week post the third immunization, they were allowed to rest for approximately 30 weeks to be sure the responses observed would be contributed primarily by the memory population. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the responses after a significant rest period were still quite robust. The mice immunized with the antigenic construct alone had responses around 1700 SFC. The highest responses were clearly in groups of mice co-immunized with pIL-15, &#x2dc;2800 SFC for both pIL-15 and pIL-15/pIL-15Ra combination. In mice co-immunized with pIL-15R&#x3b1; in the absence of pIL-15, an adjuvant affect was no longer observed (&#x2dc;1700 SFC). The same trends were also observed by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) where the level of IFN-&#x3b3; production by CD8+ T cells was most pronounced in mice coimmunized with pIL-15. The addition of pIL-15R&#x3b1; in the vaccination strategy was observed to have little effect on memory responses, whereas pIL-15 was observed to have a large effect. Thus, supporting the theory that while pIL-15R&#x3b1; was a robust adjuvant early after vaccination, over time IL-15 appears to be a better inducer of memory CD8+ T cells.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The memory antibody response was similar to that observed during the effector phase. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, mice immunized with pIL-15 had detectable antibodies against HIV-1 Gag (p24) at dilutions out to 1:1600, whereas all other groups, including the combination of pIL-15/pIL-15R&#x3b1; diluted out at 1:400. While pIL-15 shows to be an effective adjuvant in the generation of humoral as well as cellular memory responses; pIL-15R&#x3b1;, on the on the other hand, appears to play role in accelerating the acute immune response to antigen.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">pIL-15R&#x3b1; Adjuvant Without IL-15</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">To test whether human IL-15R&#x3b1; protein could be augmenting immune responses in vaccinated mice by forming complexes with endogenous murine IL-15, or independently of IL-15, vaccinations were studied in IL-15 knockout mice. Initially, as a control, translated human IL-15R&#x3b1; protein was tested for binding to mouse IL-15. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, S35 radiolabeled human IL-15R&#x3b1; protein incubated with murine IL-15 was able to be immunoprecipated with an anti-mouse IL-15 antibody suggesting the ability of murine IL-15 to bind to human IL-15R&#x3b1;.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The ability of pIL-15R&#x3b1; to adjuvant in the absence of murine IL-15 was examined. Accordingly, the same vaccination studies in IL-15 knockout mice were conducted, which lack endogenous IL-15 and as a result have a deficiency in NK and memory CD8+ T cells (Kennedy et al., 2000). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> shows that pIL-15R&#x3b1; adjuvants the immune responses in the absence of endogenous murine IL-15 in the knockout mice, as determined by IFN-&#x3b3; ELISpot. Furthermore, the combination of pIL-15 and pIL-15R&#x3b1; fails to further enhance the immune response by either adjuvant administered alone as initially observed in BALB/c mice. The IL-15&#x2212;/&#x2212; mice were generated on a C57/BL6 background from Taconic. Therefore, to verify we would get similar responses in the appropriate background control mice as were observed in BALB/c, the same experiments were repeated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows the results from the control mice immunized with the identical schedule and shows the same trend as BALB/c immunized mice.</p>
<heading id="h-0024" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Communization of the IL-15R&#x3b1; construct together with a human IL-15 and HIV-1 antigenic DNA constructs resulted in levels of IFN-&#x3b3; secretion that were 2.5 fold more potent than immunization with the antigenic constructs alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). The IFN-&#x3b3; secretion was attributable to CD8+ T cells as the depletion of these cells prior to plating on the ELISpot resulted in 10 fold less IFN-&#x3b3; secretion. The increased potency observed with the combined delivery of IL-15/IL-15R&#x3b1; is not likely due to the formation of a stable complex in transfected cells as injecting these pIL-15 and pIL-15Ra into separate legs (with antigen) also elicited immune responses similar to delivery in the same leg. It is therefore more likely that the enhanced response observed with the co-delivery of pIL-15/pIL-15R&#x3b1; is an additive effect of two independent adjuvants. Co-delivery of these two adjuvants did not appear to further enhance humoral immune responses as measured by IgG antibodies in the sera.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The long-term effects of the combined pIL-15/pIL-15R&#x3b1; on the immune response was also examined. In order to observe the memory responses, 30 weeks after the third immunization was allowed to pass prior to carrying out immune analysis. The results showed that although the combination of these two adjuvants elicits potent CD8+ T cell responses in the early phase of an immune response, the effect on memory T cells is primarily observed only in mice immunized along with pIL-15. The inclusion of pIL-15 was needed for an enhanced memory immune response over the antigen alone. Similarly, IL-15R&#x3b1; initially elicited immune responses equal to or greater than that IL-15, but it did not help to sustain the memory response. Therefore, while IL-15R&#x3b1; expanded burst size, burst size in the absence of the IL-15 signal for memory was not enough to sustain a long-term response.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In a surprising observation, the delivery of the antigenic plasmid with pIL-15R&#x3b1; also augmented cellular immune responses, and equal to those elicited by pIL-15. To be certain, immunizations were performed with increasing amounts of pIL-15R&#x3b1; and dose-dependent responses were observed. It may be that the human IL-15R&#x3b1; protein was able to bind to endogenous murine IL-15 and transpresent it in a similar fashion since murine IL-15 is &#x2dc;73% identical to the human IL-15 (Anderson et al., 1995a). To test this hypothesis, IL-15 knockout mice, which lack any endogenous IL-15, were immunized. An approximate 2 fold increase in the IL-15 knockout mice immunized with pIL-15R&#x3b1; over antigen alone was observed. Due to the difficulty of obtaining IL-15&#x2212;/&#x2212; female mice in large numbers between the ages of 6-8 weeks, the pIL-15 group from these experiments were excluded. However, the enhanced effect of the combination of pIL-15/pIL-15R&#x3b1; was no longer observed. It should be noted that control C57/BL6 mice exhibited the same trends that were seen in BALB/c mice (albeit lower total spot counts and higher background in the pVAX group) and that the IL-15 knockout mice had overall lower responses even compared to the C57/BL6 mice. These mice have been previously described to have somewhat defective host defense responses including the inability to protect against a vaccinia challenge (Kennedy et al., 2000). Regardless of the overall lower immune responses, the adjuvanting effect of pIL-15R&#x3b1; was still observed in the absence of any endogenous IL-15. While not intending to be bound by this theory, considering the full complement of results, it is believed that IL-15R&#x3b1; can serve as a novel adjuvant capable of eliciting responses independently of IL-15. This amplification of the immune response appears particularly focused on immune expansion during the acute phase rather than the memory phase of the host T cell response.</p>
