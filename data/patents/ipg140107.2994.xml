<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a process for preparing a fluorocarboxylic acid. More particularly, it relates to a process for preparing a fluorocarboxylic acid in high purity and in high yield.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fluorocarboxylic acids, such as C<sub>8 </sub>fluorocarboxylic acids and their salts, are known to have excellent chemical stability based on good heat resistance, chemical resistance, and oxidation resistance, in addition to good surface activity. These fluorocarboxylic acids, as well as their ammonium salts and metal salts, are widely known as surfactants used for polymerization of fluoroolefins such as tetrafluoroethylene, surfactants for an aqueous dispersion, and water and oil repellents. It is well known that such fluorocarboxylic acids are generally prepared by hydrolyzing the corresponding fluorocarboxylic acid fluorides.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following process can be cited as an example of a process for preparing fluorocarboxylic acids. That is, the process comprises the steps of hydrolyzing fluorocarboxylic acid fluorides in the presence of a sulfuric acid aqueous solution to form a reaction product containing fluorocarboxylic acids and hydrogen fluorides, and removing at least some of the hydrofluoric acids from the reaction product by washing the reaction product with the sulfuric acid aqueous solution (for example, see Patent Document 1). In this method, at a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of fluorocarboxylic acids, fluorocarboxylic acids are rendered into a molten state and separated into a hydrogen fluoride-containing sulfuric acid aqueous phase and a fluorocarboxylic acid-containing organic phase based on the low solubility of the fluorocarboxylic acids to the sulfuric acid aqueous solution. As a result, a fluorocarboxylic acid phase is obtained. Distillation is carried out on the fluorocarboxylic acid phase, so that fluorocarboxilic acids can be obtained in comparatively high purity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the above fluorocarboxylic acids can be prepared by recovering and regenerating the fluorocarboxylic acids after used in surfactants for polymerization (for example, see Patent Document 2).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 1: JP-W 2006-500423</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Document 2: JP-W 2006-501300</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is a need for a process for preparing fluorocarboxylic acids in higher purity and in higher yield compared to those achieved in the conventional process for preparing fluorocarboxylic acids. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a process for industrially preparing a fluorocarboxylic acid in high purity and in high yield.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is a process for preparing a fluorocarboxylic acid, which comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a dehydration step of removing from a mixture containing a fluorocarboxylic acid and water at least apart of said water to obtain a dehydrated fluorocarboxylic acid solution; and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a purification step of purifying said dehydrated fluorocarboxylic acid solution.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is specifically described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The process disclosed in Patent Document 1 includes separation of a sulfuric acid aqueous phase from a fluorocarboxylic acid phase (hereinafter, referred to as liquid-liquid separation). As above described, fluorocarboxylic acids obtained through this liquid-liquid separation may be further subjected to a simple distillation, so that fluorocarboxylic acids can be obtained in comparatively high purity. However, there has been a problem that achieving the higher purity significantly lowers the yield. On the other hand, there has been a problem that achieving the higher yield lowers the purity. Such behavior can be seen also in the fluorocarboxylic acids obtained by the process for preparing fluorocarboxylic acids by recovering and regenerating the same, which is disclosed in Patent Document 2.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Research to clarify the reason for this has brought the inventors to reach the below presumption. Fluorocarboxylic acids obtained by the above liquid-liquid separation contain at least a few percents of water. Here, the fluorocarboxylic acids azeotrope with water, and form gel with water over a wide range in composition. Consequently, distillation presumably tends to be unstable. In addition, coexistence of water and the fluorocarboxylic acids having surface active properties presumably prevents purification, for example, by generating bubbles inside a distillation column.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Based on these findings, the inventors have found out that preparation of fluorocarboxylic acids in high purity and in high yield is enabled by a dehydration step for obtaining a dehydrated fluorocarboxylic acid solution by removing at least a part of water contained in a mixture. Accordingly, the inventors have completed the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the process of the present invention, it is possible to prepare a fluorocarboxylic acid in high yield, without lowering the purity.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The preparation process of the present invention comprises a dehydration step of removing, from a mixture containing a fluorocarboxylic acid and water, at least a part of the water to obtain a dehydrated fluorocarboxylic acid solution.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The dehydration step desirably includes adding concentrated sulfuric acid to the mixture containing a fluorocarboxylic acid and water. Addition of concentrated sulfuric acid advances the dehydration quite effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Solubility of a fluorocarboxylic acid to concentrated sulfuric acid and solubility of concentrated sulfuric acid to a fluorocarboxylic acid are both low. That means fine separability between a fluorocarboxylic acid phase and a concentrated sulfuric acid phase. The system allowed to stand easily forms a phase interface, and is separated into an aqueous phase mainly containing sulfuric acid and an organic phase mainly containing a fluorocarboxylic acid. Accordingly, the dehydration step proceeds in a liquid (aqueous phase)-liquid (organic phase) heterophase dispersed (or mixed) system at any stage in the process from the addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to the completion of a dehydration reaction. The amount of the fluorocarboxylic acid in the organic phase is not particularly limited, and is desirably 80% by mass or more, and is more desirably 90% by mass or more.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Water is more likely to be present in the aqueous phase than in the organic phase containing carboxylic acids. Accordingly, after the completion of dehydration reaction, the aqueous phase is separated and the organic phase is recovered, and thus a dehydrated fluorocarboxylic acid solution is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the present description, the term &#x201c;concentrated sulfuric acid&#x201d; refers to a sulfuric acid aqueous solution containing sulfuric acid at a concentration of 95% by mass or more. The concentrated sulfuric acid desirably has a sulfuric acid concentration of more than 95% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The quantity ratio of the fluorocarboxylic acid and concentrated sulfuric acid to be used in the reaction is not particularly limited, as long as it can maintain the later-described sulfuric acid concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The dehydration step may be carried out under any suitable conditions with use of any suitable instruments, as long as the fluorocarboxylic acid is present in a liquid state. Dehydration is generally carried out at a temperature higher than the melting point of the fluorocarboxylic acid, normally at a temperature at least 3&#xb0; C. higher than the melting point, and desirably at a temperature at least 5&#xb0; C. higher than the melting point. For example, dehydration is carried out at a temperature 5 to 15&#xb0; C. higher than the melting point. This condition can achieve substantially 100% dehydration in a comparatively short time. For example, in the case of preparing a linear C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>15</sub>COOH, dehydration at a temperature of 60 to 70&#xb0; C. for two minutes can provide a dehydration product with the dehydration ratio of substantially 100%.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the present invention, dehydration reaction may be carried out either in a batchwise manner or in a continuous manner. Dehydration reaction in a batchwise manner is carried out as follows. First, a fluorocarboxylic acid and concentrated sulfuric acid are sufficiently mixed. Next, the mixed solution is allowed to stand so as to be separated into an aqueous phase containing sulfuric acids and an organic phase containing a target fluorocarboxylic acid, and then, the organic phase is recovered. If needed, the obtained organic phase is again mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid and the mixture is placed still, so that the organic phase containing a smaller amount of water can be obtained. This operation is repeated until the water concentration in the organic phase has become lower than the desired level.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The dehydration step is a kind of extraction operation, and therefore, an organic phase may be continuously contacted with an aqueous phase in a liquid-liquid heterophase dispersed system including an organic phase and an aqueous phase. For example, an organic phase is desirably dispersed in an aqueous phase, or an aqueous phase is desirably dispersed in an organic phase. More specifically, the dehydration reaction can be carried out by, for example, dispersing liquid droplets of a mixture (organic phase) of a fluorocarboxylic acid and water as the dispersed phase in the concentrated sulfuric acid (aqueous phase) as the continuous phase. It promotes contact and material transfer between the aqueous phase as the continuous phase and the organic phase as the dispersed phase, so that dehydration reaction subsequently proceeds. The dispersed phase and the continuous phase may be reversed. The dehydration reaction is carried out by mixing the organic phase and the aqueous phase for a given period of time. The dehydrated fluorocarboxylic acid solution can be obtained by halting the mixing, subjecting the organic phase and the aqueous phase in the mixture to liquid separation, and collecting the organic phase.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also, the dehydration step may include, in a liquid-liquid heterophase dispersed system including an aqueous phase and an organic phase, continuously contacting the organic phase with the aqueous phase, and separating the organic phase and the aqueous phase. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a static mixer, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a liquid-liquid separation column. A fluorocarboxylic acid solution and concentrated sulfuric acid are together fed into the static mixer <b>10</b> from feed opening <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. A dehydration reaction is carried out continuously in the static mixer <b>10</b> and both liquids are sent to the liquid-liquid separation column <b>20</b> from a discharge opening <b>14</b>. Liquid-liquid separation of the both liquids fed from a feed opening <b>23</b> is carried out in the liquid-liquid separation column <b>20</b>, and thereby a heavy liquid <b>21</b> and a light liquid <b>22</b> are obtained. A fluorocarboxylic acid phase separated in the liquid-liquid separation column <b>20</b> can be recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the dehydration step, dehydration can be continuously carried out by feeding the mixture and a sulfuric acid to a contacting column so that they flow countercurrent to each other. More specifically, dehydration may be carried out as follows. Either of the mixture and the concentrated sulfuric acid is fed as the light (i.e. lower density) liquid and the other material is fed as the heavy (i.e. higher density) liquid into a differential contacting extraction device, so to say &#x201c;an extraction column (for example, Karr column extractor and the like)&#x201d;. Then, countercurrent contact is induced between the two liquids. The operation may be carried out with the aqueous phase serving as the continuous phase, and the organic phase serving as the dispersed phase, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the dehydration step, a mixture containing a fluorocarboxylic acid and water may be contacted with diphosphorus pentoxide and/or zeolite at a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of the fluorocarboxylic acid. In this case, concentrated sulfuric acid is not necessarily added. Namely, in the dehydration step, at least one material selected from the group consisting of concentrated sulfuric acid, diphosphorus pentoxide, and zeolites may be added to the mixture containing a fluorocarboxylic acid and water. Examples of zeolites include aluminosilicate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The dehydrated fluorocarboxylic acid solution is obtainable after the dehydration reaction, and contains a fluorocarboxylic acid, sulfuric acid, and water. The dehydrated fluorocarboxylic acid solution desirably contains water at 1.0% by mass or less, because foaming and gel formation at purification can be avoided. If the water content is more than 1.0% by mass, a fluorocarboxylic acid may be ultimately obtained in lower purity and in lower yield. The water content is more desirably 0.7% by mass or less.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The sulfuric acid concentration is desirably 70.0 to 99.9% by mass in the dehydration step. The sulfuric acid concentration is a sulfuric acid concentration of an aqueous phase (concentration to the total weight of the aqueous phase) in the dehydration step. If the sulfuric acid concentration is too low, the dehydration reaction may not proceed sufficiently. The sulfuric acid concentration is more desirably 80.0 to 99.9% by mass, further desirably 90.0 to 99.9% by mass, and particularly desirably 95.0 to 99.9% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The mixture containing a fluorocarboxylic acid and water used in the dehydration step may be prepared by any suitable methods and may contain another component, as long as it does not adversely affect the process of the present invention. Examples of the mixture include a material obtainable from the process for obtaining a fluorocarboxylic acid by hydrolyzing or oxidizing fluorocarboxylic acid fluorides, fluorocarboxylates, or the like. The mixture may be obtained by following the method disclosed in Patent Documents 1 and 2, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the purification step, the dehydrated fluorocarboxylic acid solution obtained in the dehydration step is purified. The purification may be carried out by distillation, crystallization, and the like. The distillation is desirably multi-stage distillation, because a fluorocarboxylic acid can be obtained in high purity.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the process of the present invention, the multi-stage distillation can be adopted, and therefore, it is possible to prepare a fluorocarboxylic acid in high purity by separating the target component and impurities in high yield.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The fluorocarboxylic acid obtained by the process of the present invention may be treated with ammonia or alkali so as to be made into ammonium salts or alkali metal salts. The obtained material may be suitably used as a surfactant for polymerizing fluoromonomers and as a surfactant for stabilizing aqueous dispersion of fluoropolymers.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
