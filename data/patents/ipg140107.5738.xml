<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to transaction of encrypted content over a network.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Systems for delivering various content data to users of a network in exchange for payment of costs through predetermined payment processes are in widespread use. Various types of mechanisms for efficiently operating these types of systems have been proposed. For example, in the digital content transaction support system disclosed in JP-A-2004-13743, encrypted content data is stored on a server device and a decryption key for such content data is transmitted to the terminal of the purchaser after the completion of payment processes by the purchaser.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is noted here that in cases of individual entities selling original content data, it is not easy for such entities to efficiently collect payment for such data. Namely, it is often necessary for sales to be implemented through a procedure of encrypting the original content data and registering the same on a server device on a network, requesting a deposit of payment for content data by specifying a bank account to an applicant of the content data, and transmitting decryption keys to the applicant after completing confirmation of receipt of the payment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in employing this mechanism the seller of the content data is required to perform cumbersome tasks such as a confirmation of a payment received, and a further problem exists in that it may not be possible to provide immediately to an applicant content data for which the applicant has applied.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention has been proposed in view of the background outlined above and aims to provide a mechanism for efficiently performing content-data transactions without requiring cumbersome tasks to be carried out by the seller or purchaser.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a content transaction management server device including: storage means for storing a decryption key used for decryption of encrypted content data; communication means for communicating information; payment-request reception means for receiving a payment request through the communication means, the payment request including a first storage address and a user identifier, the first storage address indicating a storage area in the storage means in which the decryption key is stored, the user identifier identifying a user, who is a purchaser of the encrypted content data; payment-procedure processing means for performing payment-procedure processes related to a transaction for purchase of the encrypted content data by the user identified by the user identifier included in the payment request; and decryption-key transmission means for transmitting the decryption key through the communication means to a transmission source of the payment request, after the payment-procedure processing by the payment-procedure processing means is completed, the transmitted decryption key being read out from the storage area in the storage means, the storage area being indicated by the first storage address included in the payment request.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of this content transaction management server device, content-data transactions can be performed efficiently without requiring cumbersome tasks to be carried out by the seller or purchaser.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This exemplary embodiment of a content transaction management server device may further include: content-data reception means for receiving, through the communication means, content data as well as a second storage address indicating a storage area of an external device; encryption means for generating encrypted content data by applying a predetermined encryption key to the received content data; storage control means for controlling the storage means to store a decryption key that is a counterpart of the encryption key used in the encryption by the encryption means; and file transmission means for transmitting a definitions file and the encrypted content data, through the communication means to a transmission source of the content data and the second storage address, the definitions file including the first storage address indicating the storage area where the decryption keys are stored and the second storage address, the encrypted content data being generated by the encryption means.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of this content transaction management server device, the definitions file for acquisition procedures and encrypted content data are transmitted to the source of transmission of the content data and the second storage address.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, the above exemplary embodiment may further include: content-data reception means for receiving, through the communication means, content data including a plurality of data sets, a second storage address indicating a storage area of an external device, and a data-set identifier for identifying one of the data sets included in the content data; encryption means for generating encrypted content data including an encrypted data set and unencrypted content data, by applying a predetermined encryption key to a data set specified from among the received content data by the data-set identifier; storage control means for controlling the storage means to store a decryption key that is a counterpart of the encryption key used in the encryption by the encryption means; and file transmission means for transmitting a definitions file and the encrypted content data through the communication means to a transmission source of the content data and the data-set identifiers, the definitions file including the first storage address, the second storage address and the data-set identifier, the encrypted content data being generated by the encryption means.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When the content purchasing service is selected, the controller <b>11</b> of the mobile terminal <b>10</b> reads out the third URL stored in the EEPROM <b>18</b> and transmits, to the content-providing server device <b>30</b>, a CPF transmission request including the third URL (S<b>300</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the controller <b>31</b> of the content-providing server device <b>30</b> receives the CPF transmission request, the controller <b>31</b> transmits, to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, the CPF stored in the hard disk <b>33</b> indicated by the third URL included in the request (S<b>310</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When the controller <b>11</b> of the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the CPF, the controller <b>11</b> extracts, from the CPF, the content-name data, price data, first URL, and second URL (S<b>320</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The controller <b>11</b> controls the liquid crystal display <b>14</b> to display a content purchase confirmation screen obtained by embedding, in a predetermined form, the content-name data and price data extracted in Step <b>320</b> (S<b>330</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Displayed on the content purchase confirmation screen are the content name, which is indicated by the content name data, and the price, which is indicated by the price data, and under these are displayed a character string reading &#x201c;Would you like to purchase this content?&#x201d; and a button reading &#x201c;Purchase.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The user referring to the content purchase confirmation screen selects the &#x201c;Purchase&#x201d; button through operations of the instruction input part <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">If the &#x201c;Purchase&#x201d; button is selected, the controller <b>11</b> of the mobile terminal <b>10</b> transmits, to the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>, a payment request including the content-name data, price data, and first URL extracted in Step <b>320</b> and the PIN code read out from the EEPROM <b>18</b> (S<b>340</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> receives the payment request, the controller <b>61</b> performs payment processing of the cost of the content data (S<b>350</b>). Specifically, the controller identifies, from a packet-communication-charge management database in a mobile packet gateway switching center, a call charge record of a user corresponding to the PIN code included in the payment request and adds the price data included in the payment request to the sum total of the call charge stored in the identified record. Thereby, the purchase amount of the content data is recorded in the calling rate claimed by the carrier from the user who is the purchaser. In this way, the process for determining the money amount claimed by a user is a payment-procedure process using the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Moreover, if the money amount determined through this type of payment-procedure process is reported to a payment system <b>70</b> and payment processing is requested, the payment system <b>70</b> withdraws the money amount from the bank account of the user who is the purchaser. At this time, the bank account used is a bank account that is pre-registered when the user enters into the user agreement with the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">At the same time, regarding the user who is the seller, the controller <b>61</b> performs processing to provide the money amount equivalent to the price data included in the payment request. Specifically, the controller <b>61</b> identifies, from the packet-communication-charge management database, a call charge record of the user who is the seller and subtracts the price data included in the payment request from the sum total of the call charge stored in the identified record. Thereby, the calling rate claimed by the user who is the seller enters a state in which the sales total of the content data is deducted. Moreover, the calling rate from which the sales total is deducted is paid by the above payment system. In addition, if the sum total of the call charge becomes negative upon subtracting the price data, the negative amount is registered in the packet-communication-charge management database. In this case, the payment system <b>70</b> may perform processing to deposit the negative money amount into the bank account of the user who is the seller by using the money amount collected from the purchaser as funds.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">If the controller <b>61</b> completes the payment processing, the controller <b>61</b> reads out the decryption key stored in the storage area of the decryption-key database <b>63</b><i>c </i>indicated by the first URL included in the payment request and transmits, to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, a payment completion message including the decryption key (S<b>360</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">If the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the payment completion message, the controller <b>11</b> controls the EEPROM <b>18</b> to store the decryption key included in the message (S<b>370</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Subsequently, the controller <b>11</b> transmits, to the content-providing server device <b>30</b>, a download request including the second URL extracted in Step <b>320</b> (S<b>380</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">If the content-providing server device <b>30</b> receives the download request, the controller <b>31</b> transmits, to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, the encrypted content data stored in the storage area of the hard disk <b>33</b> indicated by the second URL included in the request (S<b>390</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">If the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the encrypted content data, the controller <b>11</b> restores the content data by applying the decryption key to the encrypted content data (S<b>400</b>), the decryption key being stored in the EEPROM <b>18</b> in Step <b>370</b> and being read out from the EEPROM <b>18</b>. The restored content data is played in response to, as a trigger, a predetermined operation through the instruction input part <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">With the above, the content-purchasing-service process is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the present exemplary embodiment described above, when a user transmits original content data from the mobile terminal <b>10</b> to the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>, the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> encrypts the content data. The content transaction management server device <b>60</b> returns the encrypted content data and CPF obtained through encryption to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>. The content data and CPF are registered on the content-providing server device <b>30</b>. The CPF includes a first URL, which is a URL of a storage area of the content transaction server device <b>60</b> in which a decryption key that is a counterpart of the encryption key used in the encryption is stored, and a second URL, which is a URL of a storage area of the content-providing server device <b>30</b> in which the encrypted content data is stored. When the mobile terminal <b>10</b> of the user purchasing the content sequentially transmits requests for the first URL and second URL included in the CPF, processes from the payment of compensation for the content to acquisition of the content are performed automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this way, by variously coordinating the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>, and the content-providing server device <b>30</b> and executing a sequence of operations related to content-data transactions, it is possible to efficiently perform content-data transactions without requiring the conventional cumbersome tasks by either the seller or purchaser.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Moreover, the following is a further detailed description of the respective merits for the seller and the purchaser.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">First, the seller can easily obtain a CPF and encrypted content data by registering content data on the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>. Furthermore, the seller may sell content simply through operations of coordinating the obtained CPF and encrypted content data and storing the CPF and encrypted content in a downloadable state on the content-providing server device <b>30</b>. Consequently, the merits for the seller are that there is no need to prepare encryption software and no need to establish a payment system.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The purchaser may obtain the CPF by accessing the content-providing server device <b>30</b> and specifying the desired content data, and may purchase the content data simply through relatively simple operations using the CPF.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">First, when the purchaser refers to the CPF obtained using their personal mobile terminal <b>10</b> and performs operations for purchasing the content data, the mobile terminal <b>10</b> transmits, to the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>, a payment request including the first URL, which refers to the storage area of the decryption key, the PIN code, and the like. In response to this request, the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> performs payment procedures for the user corresponding to the PIN code and also reads out the decryption key from the storage area indicated by the first URL and transmits the decryption key to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>. At this stage, the purchaser may complete the payment procedure, which is absolutely imperative for the content-data transaction, and may also obtain the decryption key necessary for the decryption of the encrypted content data. If the decryption key may be obtained at approximately the same time that the payment procedure is completed as described above, all that subsequently remains is a simple operation for obtaining the encrypted content data.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Subsequently, the purchaser performs operations for requesting encrypted content data using the mobile terminal <b>10</b>. In response to the operations, the mobile terminal <b>10</b> transmits, to the content-providing server device <b>30</b>, a download request including the second URL. In response to this request, the content-providing server device <b>30</b> reads out the encrypted content data from the storage area indicated by the second URL and transmits it to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>. The mobile terminal <b>10</b> decrypts the encrypted content data using the previously obtained decryption key and obtains the content data. In this way, the operations for acquiring the content data are not very different from standard procedures for downloading content data on the Web, for example, and the operational burden imposed on the purchaser is very low.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Further Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Various modified exemplary embodiments are possible for the present invention. The modified examples described below may also be used in combinations of two or more.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A configuration in which the content purchase application, instead of being a Java application operating in a Java execution environment, is preliminarily stored in the ROM <b>16</b> of a mobile terminal <b>10</b> as a native application may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the above exemplary embodiment, the content purchase application is implemented in the mobile terminal <b>10</b> (i.e., a cellular phone handset that may access an Internet <b>40</b> intermediated by a mobile packet communication network <b>20</b>), but similar functions may be obtained even if an application of the same type were implemented on a personal computer that may directly access the Internet <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Moreover, in the above exemplary embodiment, it is presumed that the person (the seller) registering the content data subject to sales on the content-providing server device <b>30</b> is a party who has entered into a user agreement for a mobile packet communication network with the carrier (i.e., a user). However, the seller is not limited to a party who has entered into a user agreement for a mobile packet communication network with the carrier, and may simply be a party having a communication terminal that may establish a communication connection with the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> and/or content-providing server device <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Regarding the method for determining the price of the content, a wide range of variations may be conceived. In the exemplary embodiment, the price is determined on the basis of each individual content, but the price may also be determined on the basis of the period of use of the content data. Specifically, the user who is the seller, when registering the content price on the marketed-content registration screen, registers a period and a compensation (price) for the act of using the content within that period and submits these to the purchaser. For example, if the seller wishes to provide, to the purchaser, a certain content for 100 yen per month, they register &#x201c;1 month&#x201d; as the &#x201c;period&#x201d; and &#x201c;100 yen&#x201d; as the &#x201c;price,&#x201d; and this information is described in the CPF. In this case, the controller <b>11</b> of the mobile terminal <b>10</b> of the purchaser limits the period of use of the content in accordance with the details described in the CPF. That is, the controller <b>11</b> permits use of the content (e.g., start-up, execution, playing, transfer, and the like of the content data) during the period described in the CPF, but once the period described in the CPF has elapsed, the controller <b>11</b> does not permit use of the content.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Moreover, there is also a wide range of variations for the payment procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the exemplary embodiment, the bank account used for payment is a bank account that is registered in advance when the user enters into the user agreement with the carrier. However, as alternatives, for example, a bank account used for payments for a credit card owned by the user may be used, or a bank account used through a credit function implemented on the mobile terminal <b>10</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Furthermore, payments may be made using an electronic value implemented on the mobile terminal <b>10</b>. In this case, the payment-procedure process of the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">If the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> receives the payment request, the controller <b>61</b> requests, from the mobile terminal <b>10</b> corresponding to the PIN code included in the payment request, the electronic value equivalent to the price data included in the payment request. In response to this request, the mobile terminal <b>10</b> subtracts, from the electronic value stored therein, the requested electronic value. If the mobile terminal <b>10</b> completes the subtraction process, the mobile terminal <b>10</b> reports this to the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In addition, the payment is not limited to using currency and may use points that may be converted into some privilege for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Moreover, only a part of the data sets included in the content data may be encrypted. For example, if the content data is software providing a role-playing game, data showing an item, for example a weapon or the like used by characters in the game, is an example of the above part of data sets. In this case, in addition to the first URL and second URL described in the exemplary embodiment, multiple data-set identifiers attached to each item are described in the CPF. The first URL indicates the storage area in which the decryption keys for decrypting each of the data sets attached with the data-set identifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The following is an explanation of the details centering on points of difference from the above exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the content registration service is selected, the controller <b>11</b> of the mobile terminal <b>10</b> transmits, to the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>, a request for a transmission of the marketed-content registration screen (S<b>100</b>). If the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> receives the request, the controller <b>61</b> transmits, to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, display data of the marketed-content registration screen (S<b>110</b>). If the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the display data, the controller <b>11</b> displays the marketed-content registration screen on the liquid crystal display <b>14</b> (S<b>120</b>). In addition to the first input column <b>91</b> for inputting the content name, the second input column <b>92</b> for inputting the price of the content, the third input column <b>93</b> for inputting the attached content, and the fourth input column <b>94</b> for inputting the content URL, which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the marketed-content registration screen is set with a fifth input column for inputting data-set identifiers allocated to the data sets (items used by characters in this example).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The user, referring to the marketed-content registration screen, after inputting the content name and price of the content they are registering into the first input column <b>91</b> and the second input column <b>92</b>, performs operations for attaching the content data stored in the EEPROM <b>18</b> through operations of the instruction input part <b>13</b>. Thereby, the file name of the content data to be attached is input into the third input column <b>93</b>. Additionally, after inputting, into the fourth input column <b>94</b>, the URL of the storage area of the content-providing server device <b>30</b> secured for storage of the content data and inputting, into the fifth input column, the data-set identifiers allocated to the data sets, the user selects the &#x201c;Register&#x201d; button. In addition, multiple data-set identifiers may be input. When the &#x201c;Register&#x201d; button is selected, the controller <b>11</b> of the mobile terminal <b>10</b> transmits, to the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>, a content registration request including: data indicating the content name input into the first input column <b>91</b>, the price input into the second input column <b>92</b>, and the URL input into the fourth input column <b>94</b>; the data-set identifiers input into the fifth input column; and the attached content data (S<b>130</b>). If the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> receives the content registration request, the controller <b>61</b> generates encrypted content data by applying unique encryption keys for only the data sets for which the data-set identifiers are allocated from among the content data included in the request (S<b>140</b>). Therefore, the encrypted content data includes encrypted data sets and non-encrypted data sets. At this time, if there are multiple data-set identifiers, encryption is conducted by applying different encryption keys for each data set for which a data-set identifier is allocated. Finally, the controller <b>61</b> stores, in the decryption-key database <b>63</b><i>c</i>, the decryption keys that is a counterpart of the encryption keys used in the encryption of Step <b>140</b> (S<b>150</b>). In addition, the controller <b>61</b> generates the CPF (S<b>160</b>). In addition to the content-name data indicating the content name, the price data indicating the price, and the first URL and the second URL, the CPF includes the above data-set identifiers. The controller <b>61</b> transmits, to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, the encrypted content data generated in Step <b>140</b> and the CPF generated in Step <b>160</b> (S<b>170</b>). If the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the encrypted content data and CPF, the controller <b>11</b> transmits, to the content-providing server device <b>30</b>, a content registration request including the encrypted content data and CPF (S<b>180</b>). If the content-providing server device <b>30</b> receives the content registration request, the controller <b>31</b> identifies the encrypted content data and CPF from the request (S<b>190</b>). Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the controller <b>31</b> stores the encrypted content data identified in Step <b>190</b> in the storage area of the hard disk <b>33</b> indicated by the second URL included in the CPF identified in Step <b>190</b> (i.e., the storage area indicated by the URL allocated in advance for storage of the content data) (S<b>200</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Subsequently, the controller <b>31</b> stores the CPF identified in Step <b>190</b> in an unused storage area of the hard disk <b>33</b> (S<b>210</b>). The controller <b>31</b> transmits, to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, a registration completion message including the URL (this URL shall hereinafter be referred to as &#x201c;third URL&#x201d;) of the storage area of the hard disk <b>33</b> in which the CPF is stored in Step <b>210</b> (S<b>220</b>). If the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the registration completion message, the controller <b>11</b> controls the EEPROM <b>18</b> to store the third URL included in the message (S<b>230</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Next, the content-purchase-service process is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the same reference numerals are used for processes that are nearly identical to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The user using the content purchase service selects the content purchase service from the service selection screen upon acquiring the third URL indicating the storage area of the CPF of the content data from a separate user who has registered encrypted content data onto the content-providing server device <b>30</b> using the content registration service, and storing the third URL in the EEPROM <b>18</b> of their personal mobile terminal <b>10</b>. When the content purchase service is selected, the controller <b>11</b> of the mobile terminal <b>10</b> reads out the third URL from the EEPROM <b>18</b> and transmits, to the content-providing server device <b>30</b>, a CPF transmission request including the third URL (S<b>300</b>). If the content-providing server device <b>30</b> receives the CPF transmission request, the controller <b>31</b> transmits, to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, the CPF stored on the hard disk <b>33</b> indicated by the third URL included in the request (S<b>310</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">If the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the CPF, the controller <b>11</b> extracts the content-name data, the price data, the first URL, and the second URL from the CPF (S<b>320</b>). The controller <b>11</b> displays, on the liquid crystal display <b>14</b>, a content purchase confirmation screen obtained by embedding, in a predetermined form, the content-name data and price data extracted in Step <b>320</b> (S<b>330</b>). Then, when the &#x201c;Purchase&#x201d; button is selected, the controller of the mobile terminal <b>10</b> transmits, to the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>, a payment request including the content-name data and price data extracted in Step <b>320</b> and a PIN code read out from the EEPROM <b>18</b> (S<b>340</b>). If the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> receives the payment request, the controller <b>61</b> performs payment processing of the cost of the content data (S<b>350</b>) and transmits, to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, a payment completion message (S<b>360</b>). If the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the payment completion message, the controller <b>11</b> transmits, to the content-providing server device <b>30</b>, a download request including the second URL extracted in Step <b>320</b> (S<b>380</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">If the content-providing server device <b>30</b> receives the download request, the controller <b>31</b> transmits, to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, the encrypted content data stored in the storage area of the hard disk <b>33</b> indicated by the second URL included in the request (S<b>390</b>). If the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the encrypted content data, the controller <b>11</b> plays, opens, and executes the encrypted content data (S<b>410</b>). At this time, because only a part of the data sets of the encrypted content data are encrypted, the controller <b>11</b> may, with the exception of parts that are encrypted within the encrypted content data, play, open, and execute. The user, in the course of implementing the content data, which is a role-playing game in this example, will use items prepared in advance in accordance with progress in the game. In this case, when there is an instruction for an item that the user wishes to use, the controller <b>11</b> transmits, to the content transaction management server device <b>60</b>, a request including the first URL and PIN code corresponding to the data-set identifier for the item (S<b>420</b>). The controller <b>61</b> of the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> performs payment processing of the cost of the item specified by the data-set identifier (S<b>430</b>). Specifically, the controller <b>61</b> identifies, from the packet-communication-charge management database, the call charge record of the user corresponding to the PIN code included in the payment request and adds, to the sum total of the call charge stored in the identified record, the predetermined price data corresponding to the item. Thereby, the purchase amount of the item is recorded in the calling rate claimed by the carrier from the user who is the purchaser. Then, when the money amount determined upon completion of this type of payment-procedure processing is reported to the payment system <b>70</b> and payment processing is requested, the payment system <b>70</b> withdraws the money amount from the bank account of the user who is the purchaser. At the same time, regarding the user who is the seller, the controller <b>61</b> performs processing to provide the money amount equivalent to the price data included in the payment request.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">If the controller <b>61</b> has completed the payment processing, the controller <b>11</b> reads out the decryption key stored in the storage area of the decryption-key database <b>63</b><i>c </i>indicated by the first URL included in the above request and transmits, to the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, a payment completion message including the decryption key (S<b>440</b>). If the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the payment completion message, the controller <b>11</b> controls the EEPROM <b>18</b> to store the decryption key included in the message (S<b>450</b>). Subsequently, the controller <b>11</b> restores the item by applying the decryption key to the above data set (S<b>460</b>), the decryption key being read out from the EEPROM <b>18</b>. The restored item is used by the character in the role-playing game.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In addition, in the above example, the first URL and the data-set identifiers are described in the CPF, and the second URL may not be described. In this case, the encrypted content data is not provided to the mobile terminal <b>10</b> through the content-providing server device <b>30</b> and may be provided to the mobile terminal <b>10</b> through a separate arbitrary method. Finally, after the encrypted content data is stored by the mobile terminal, the processes from S<b>410</b> onward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> that are described above are performed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The hardware configurations of the mobile terminal, content transaction management server device, and content-providing server device are not limited to each of those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. If the required configuration may be implemented, these devices may have any type of hardware configuration. For example, in the exemplary embodiment described above, the controller <b>61</b> of the content transaction management server device <b>60</b> includes multiple functions, specifically, the functions of the payment-request reception means, the payment-procedure processing means, the decryption-key transmission means, the content-data reception means, the encryption means, the storage control means, and the file transmission means. However, at least one of these functions may be implemented using a hardware component separate from the controller <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The programs that are executed by controller <b>11</b>, controller <b>31</b>, or controller <b>61</b> in the exemplary embodiment described above may be provided in a state of storage on a computer-readable storage medium, such as a magnetic recording medium (magnetic tape, magnetic disk (HDD (Hard Disk Drive), FD (Floppy Disk)), or the like), an optical recording medium (optical disk (CD (Compact Disc), DVD (Digital Versatile Disc)), or the like), a magneto-optical medium, a semiconductor memory (flash ROM or the like), or the like. Moreover, the programs may also be downloaded through a network such as the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Although this invention has been shown and described with respect to the detailed embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, modifications may be made to adapt a particular device or program to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed in the above detailed description, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
