<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Introduction</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Systems and methods are anticipated that provide for the downloading of software applications to a wireless device. Software applications can come pre-loaded at the time the wireless device is manufactured, or the user may later request that additional programs be downloaded over cellular telecommunication carrier networks, where the programs are executable on the wireless device. As a result, users of wireless devices can customize their wireless devices with programs, such as games, printed media, stock updates, news, or any other type of information or program available for download from application download servers through the wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one scenario, if the user of the wireless device desires to download and use a software application or other data using a wireless network, the user will typically either call a service provider or contact the service provider through other means, such as through an Internet access, and the service provider will either transmit the application or data to the wireless device across the wireless network or allow the user access a network site where the application or data is downloadable or accessible. To connect to the application download server, the wireless device bridges a communication connection to the wireless network, such as a cellular network, and then attempts to contact an application download server where the desired software application is resident. Once the wireless device contacts the application download server, an initial connection is made and the application download server determines what applications and data are available to the wireless device and sends the appropriate information, such as a menu, for display on the wireless device so the user can learn of the available applications and data. After access is provided to the downloadable applications, the user of the wireless device can download or any of the available applications or data.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A problem that may arise is that the version of the application or data that the wireless device downloads to be resident thereupon can be updated or altered at the application download server, and the wireless device resident application or data has no simple manner to be likewise updated. The update problem is exacerbated as the wireless device does not always communicate with the application download server every time the wireless device bridges a communication to the wireless network. Because the communication connection from the wireless device to the application download server can be expensive (especially in a cellular network), it is otherwise very expensive for the wireless device to periodically connect to the application download server and check for more recent version of application or software. Furthermore, while each wireless device resident application or data can be checked against its parallel version resident on the download server every time a connection is made to the download server, such checking would lengthen the connection time and cause more expense to the wireless device owner.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Accordingly, systems and methods consistent with the present invention include updating applications and data resident on a wireless device with the most recent version stored on a download server that the wireless device is connected to. Such systems and methods should be able to determine if more recent versions of the wireless device resident applications and data are present on the download server without significantly lengthening the connection duration in order to effect a full comparison of all wireless device resident applications and data. It is thus to the provision of such a system and method of checking and updating wireless device resident applications and data that the present invention is primarily directed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is an object to provide systems and methods whereby the datasets, such as applications, information and other data, resident on a wireless device can be updated with the most recent version of the dataset resident on a download server that the wireless device is connected to. The present invention allows a rapid determination as to whether more recent versions of the wireless device resident datasets are present on the download server, and such determination does not significantly lengthen the connection duration between the wireless device and download server. The present invention thus provides an advantage in that it gives a wireless device the ability to quickly execute a full comparison of dataset versions with a download server and download any newer version of a wireless device resident dataset.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, as wireless devices become more complex and sophisticated, it is desirable to keep the wireless device up-to-date with actions that need to be performed. For example, an action may include upgrade an application, delete an application, download certain data, disable an application. An action can include modifying the licensing terms associated with an application, for example to upgrade the number of uses for a game application from 10 uses to 100. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that an action can be any type of instruction(s) that can be performed or initiated by a device. The action may require the wireless device to execute the action within the domain of wireless device, or it may require the wireless device to request an action from another server, such as an application download server, or any combination of such actions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, it is beneficial that there be a mechanism to be able to store all the actions that needs to be performed by the wireless device without having to send a message to the wireless device immediately to perform the action. A wireless device environment does provide constraints that are not typically contained in the wire-based devices. For example, a wireless device may need to connect to a server. Depending on the service and technology the wireless uses, this may require a separate call or connection.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Requiring a message to be sent or to establish connection can have negative impacts to the wireless subscriber, such as the user of the wireless device may have a plan based on amount of time used. If a call or connection is initiated by the network, it could impact the amount of minutes available to the user. Also, there is processing overhead associated with making a connection and because the wireless device is very sensitive to network usage and processing efficiency, it is preferable to limit the amount of overhead associated with establishing a connection to the wireless device.</p>

It should be noted that server-side functions as described herein can be performed on one server, such as application download server <b>16</b>. Further, a computer server-side computer platform can provide separate services and processes to the wireless devices <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> across the wireless network <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram that more fully illustrates the components of the wireless network <b>14</b> and interrelation of the elements of the system <b>10</b>. The wireless network <b>14</b> is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote modules, such as wireless devices <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, communicate over-the-air between and among each other and/or between and among components of a wireless network <b>14</b>, including, without limitation, wireless network carriers and/or servers, as well as including a non-wireless network alone or in combination with a wireless network. The application download server <b>16</b> and the stored applications database <b>28</b>, other servers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, including group manager server <b>200</b>, will be present on the cellular data network with any other components that are needed to provide cellular telecommunication services. The application download server <b>16</b>, and/or other servers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>200</b> communicate with a carrier network <b>40</b>, through a data link, such as the Internet, a secure LAN, WAN, or other network. The carrier network <b>40</b> controls messages (generally being data packets) sent to a messaging service controller (&#x201c;MSC&#x201d;) <b>42</b>. The carrier network <b>40</b> communicates with the MSC <b>42</b> by a network, the Internet and/or POTS (&#x201c;plain ordinary telephone system&#x201d;). Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network <b>40</b> and the MSC <b>42</b> transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC <b>42</b> is connected to multiple base stations (&#x201c;BTS&#x201d;) <b>44</b>. In a similar manner to the carrier network, the MSC <b>42</b> is typically connected to the BTS <b>44</b> by both the network and/or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS <b>44</b> ultimately broadcasts messages wirelessly to the wireless devices, such as cellular telephone <b>12</b>, by short messaging service (&#x201c;SMS&#x201d;), or other over-the-air methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The wireless device, such as cellular telephone <b>12</b>, has a computer platform <b>50</b> that can receive and execute software applications and display data transmitted from the application download server <b>16</b> or other network servers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>200</b>. The computer platform <b>50</b> may also include an application-specific integrated circuit (&#x201c;ASIC&#x201d;) <b>52</b>, or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC <b>52</b> or other processor executes the application programming interface (&#x201c;API&#x201d;) layer <b>54</b> that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory <b>56</b> of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform <b>50</b> also includes a local database <b>58</b> that can hold the software applications, file, or data not actively used in memory <b>56</b>, such as the software applications or downloaded from the application download server <b>16</b>. The local database <b>58</b> is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The wireless device, such as cellular telephone <b>12</b>, can access and download many types of applications, such as games and stock monitors, or simply data such as news and sports-related data. The downloaded data can be immediately displayed on the display or stored in the local database <b>58</b> when not in use. The software applications can be treated as a regular software application resident on the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and the user of the wireless device can selectively upload stored resident applications from the local database <b>58</b> to memory <b>56</b> for execution on the API <b>56</b>. The end-user of the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can also selectively delete a software application from the local database <b>58</b> whereby other applications and data can be downloaded into the cleared storage space.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A group manager server <b>200</b> may be used to manage actions lists and action versions associated with the wireless devices <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, actions are defined to be performed on a wireless device. These actions may be requested by a carrier, application developer, network operator or other entity desiring to impact the environment of the wireless device. While not shown, a separate interface to the group manager server <b>200</b> may exist so that actions for a wireless device may be entered into the group manager.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The group manager may implement a group scheme to track the actions associated with a group of wireless devices. For example, a set of wireless devices may belong to a company and a group can be established for those wireless devices belonging to that company. If the company wants a particular application distributed to all the wireless devices of the company, the group manager may be configured in such a way as to allow the action of &#x201c;Install Application xxx&#x201d; to all wireless devices in a group.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The wireless device may be part of multiple groups. For example, it may be part of a company group, it may be part of a device type (a specific model of wireless device) group, etc. The definition of groups can be arbitrary so a group may be established by any criteria desired.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The group manager server <b>200</b> generates the action list associated with a wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the action list changes, the group manager server <b>200</b> also changes the action list version so that the wireless device can check the version of its current action list to quickly determine if additional actions need to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When using groups to help manage the action lists associated with a wireless device, hashing algorithms based on the groups the wireless device is associated with may be used to simplify the creation of action lists. Alternatively, while this may impact the processing and storage efficiency, the group manager may also simply store the action list associated with each of the wireless device instead of using a hashing or other algorithm to help manage actions associated with each wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The group manager is connected to an application download server <b>16</b> so that it may transfer the action lists and the current action list version associated with a wireless device.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Groups</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The following is an example of delineating groups and using action lists. Assume Device ID <b>111</b> is part of Group 1, Group 2 and Group 111, but Device ID <b>222</b> is only part of Group 2.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the Action list for Device ID <b>111</b> is developed, knowing that it is part of Groups 1, 2 and 111, all the actions associated with those groups are compiled for the Device ID <b>111</b> action list. Note that a group may be defined containing only that Device's ID (e.g., &#x201c;Group <b>111</b>&#x201d; is a group on one containing only Device <b>111</b>) so that actions may be defined solely to that device. The action list for Device ID <b>222</b> is developed only by pulling out those actions associated with Group 2 (and its individual group if any actions were listed), since that is the only group it is a part of that has any actions associated with it.</p>

Note that action lists may also include data (such as Application 3 having the data of price type and Price Base Type, indicating to upgrade the application to 100 uses). While Table 2 only refers to applications, any instruction that can be recognized by the wireless device may be included in the action lists, including instructions that use data or any file type.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore action lists and the described embodiments allow actions to be performed by the wireless device automatically without the user needing to initiate any actions: It may be preferable to indicate to the user that actions are occurring, but that is an implementation decision.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the computer platform <b>50</b> of the wireless device (such as cellular telephone <b>12</b>) will have a data or file structure resident thereon. The category Files <b>60</b> within it the API file called BREW <b>62</b>, representing the API in the platform, in this case the BREW&#xae; API developed by QUALCOMM, Incorporated, and BREW <b>62</b> contains an applications file <b>64</b> with a specific chess game held in a chess folder <b>66</b>. All of these files can be &#x201c;versioned&#x201d; wherein updates to the data in each file give the file a different version to identify what changes have been made in the data. The server, such as application download server <b>16</b>, will keep its own resident copy of the application and data files such that a wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> contacting the server can download copies of the applications and data to selectively overwrite the wireless device resident copy.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The present invention allows the creation of &#x201c;summary files&#x201d; of the versions of some or all datasets resident on the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> or download server, such as application download server <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the download server <b>16</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>200</b> preferably maintains a download server dataset update summary file <b>70</b>, and the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> will maintain wireless device dataset version summary file <b>72</b> that contain or reference some or all files on the server or computer platform <b>50</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The system <b>10</b> thus selectively updates the versions of stored datasets on a wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> attempting to communicate with at least one download server (application download server <b>16</b>) across the wireless network <b>14</b>, through the computer platform <b>50</b> of the wireless device comparing the version of each specific resident dataset listed in the resident dataset version summary file <b>72</b> with the version of the downloadable dataset resident on the download server, preferably stored in a download server dataset update summary <b>70</b>, to thereby determine if the version of the wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of the download server resident dataset. And upon determining the version of the wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of the download server resident dataset, the computer platform <b>50</b> of the wireless device can download the download server resident dataset to overwrite the old version of the application or data resident and be executable on the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. Other methods can be used on the download server <b>16</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>32</b> to provide version information to wireless devices <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, such as a header for each dataset file, a direct comparison of the dataset after a predetermined duration since download, or a command can be present in the wireless device-download server handshake that informs the wireless device to compare a specific dataset to determine if the wireless device has the most recent version.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The download server dataset update summary file <b>70</b> can identify the versions of files or datasets resident on the download server, such as a graphics data that is present in a welcome screen file, device drivers such as a graphics driver file, and the chess file <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The wireless device dataset version summary file <b>72</b> has parallel files to those resident on the download server dataset update summary file <b>70</b> and can compare each version of the datasets through a simple file comparison between the download server dataset update summary file <b>70</b> and the wireless device dataset version summary file <b>72</b> and locate different version numbers. The summary files <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are shown here as having a greater number indicating a more recent version of the dataset. Other systems and method could be used to indicate the version difference as would be known in the art, such as an alphanumeric or other symbolic system that is predefined such that the computer platform <b>50</b> of the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can determine if an individual download server resident dataset is a newer version than the wireless device resident dataset.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, if a version number of the download server resident dataset is greater than the version number of the wireless device resident dataset, then the computer platform <b>50</b> of the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> will download the newer version of the dataset from the download server <b>16</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>200</b>. After it has been determined that a newer dataset version is on the download server, the computer platform <b>50</b> of the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can prompt the user of the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> to communicate with the download server to download the different version of the download server resident dataset to be executable on the wireless device. The prompting of the user to make the communication may be important in certain circumstances, such as if the owner of the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> will be billed for the communication connection. Otherwise, upon the determination that the version of the wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of the download server resident dataset, the computer platform <b>50</b> of the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can automatically download the different download server resident dataset to overwrite the wireless device resident dataset.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The specific process executing on the wireless device, such as cellular telephone <b>12</b>, is shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> bridges a connection to an application download server <b>16</b> (or other network server) as shown in step <b>80</b>, and then determine whether there is a download server version dataset update summary file <b>70</b> present, as shown by decision <b>82</b>. If the download server keeps track of changes to resident dataset versions in a manner other than an update summary file <b>70</b>, then decision <b>82</b> would be made in accord with the other method. If there is not a download server dataset update summary file <b>70</b> present at decision <b>82</b> (or other version comparison method present), then the connection to the application download server <b>16</b> is otherwise completed, and the version update process is terminated. If there is a download server dataset update summary file <b>70</b> present at decision <b>82</b>, then the download server dataset update summary file <b>70</b> is retrieved by the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> as shown at step <b>86</b>, and the first parallel dataset version for which the wireless device has a resident copy of is fetched, as shown at step <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A determination is then made as to whether the download server resident dataset is a more recent version than the wireless device resident dataset, as shown at decision <b>90</b>. If the download server dataset is not more recent at decision <b>90</b>, then the process returns to step <b>88</b> to fetch the next download server resident dataset version. If the download server resident dataset is a more recent version at decision <b>90</b>, then the wireless device downloads to the computer platform <b>50</b> the more recent version of the dataset from the download server, as shown at step <b>92</b>. A check is made to determine if the more recent version of the dataset was downloaded, as shown at decision <b>94</b>. If the more recent version of the dataset was not downloaded at decision <b>92</b>, then the user of the wireless device is informed of the failure to download the more recent dataset version, as shown at step <b>96</b>, and the process continues to decision <b>98</b>. Otherwise, if the more recent dataset version was downloaded at decision <b>94</b>, then a determination is made as to whether there are any further datasets resident on the download server that are parallel to datasets resident on the wireless device <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, as shown at decision <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If there are more parallel datasets on the download server at decision <b>98</b>, then the process returns to step <b>88</b> wherein another parallel download server resident dataset is fetched.

A sub-routine executing on the download server <b>16</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>200</b> makes a first determination as to whether the download server resident dataset has been updated, as shown at decision <b>104</b>. If the resident dataset has not been updated, then the process enters a wait state by returning to decision <b>104</b>, until a resident dataset is updated. Otherwise, if the resident dataset has been updated at decision <b>104</b>, then a decision is made as to whether the version of the dataset as listed in the download server dataset update summary requires updating, as shown at decision <b>106</b>. If the version of the resident dataset does not require updating, then the process returns to the wait state at decision <b>106</b> until an update is made to resident datasets. And if the version of the resident dataset has changed at decision <b>106</b>, then the version of the dataset in the download server dataset update summary <b>70</b> is overwritten so that connecting wireless devices <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> will be able to learn and download the newer version of the dataset.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart depicts the process performed by the application download server in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As described above, the application download server stores the action lists version associated with a wireless device. The association may be by subscriber identification.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment, the wireless device indicates what groups that it is a part of. The application download server then determines, via internal processing or using a group manager server, the action list version associated with the groups the wireless device is a part of.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When an action is added to the action list, i.e., an action needs to be performed by a wireless device, the action list version is updated (Step <b>310</b>). This update may occur in response to a request coming in from the wireless device. In this instance, the application download server sends a request to the group server and the group server indicates that there is a upgrade action list version or not.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Alternatively, the group manager may have received an action added to the list associated with the wireless device and updated the action list version and sent the upgraded action list version to the wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the wireless device connects to the application download server, it sends a message to the application download server to get the action list version. Note the wireless device may send this message while it is waiting on or initiating other tasks with the application download server or other servers. In this manner, it can save overhead processing associated with making the connection to the server.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In response to the request, the application download server send the action list version to the wireless device (Step <b>315</b>). If it is determined that the wireless device needs a new action list (step <b>320</b>), then the application download server sends the new action list associated with the version to the wireless device (Step <b>325</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In performing this method, the application download server may initiate a request to the group manager to determine the latest action list version and the latest action list associated with the wireless device. The wireless device sends some identifying information, such as the subscriber identification (SID), to the application download server so that that action list version and the action list associated with the wireless device can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart depicting the process performed by the group manager server in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. An action is received associated with a wireless device (Step <b>400</b>). As indicated in the description above, the action may be associated with a group and group manager server may use a group managing scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Furthermore, the associating may be by a unique wireless device identification, such as a subscriber id. Next the action is stored (step <b>405</b>) and associated with the wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When an action is added to the action list associated with the wireless device, the action list version is updated (Step <b>410</b>). The action list version update may be initiated upon the addition of the action to the list. Alternatively, the action list version may be generated when the request comes in from the wireless device to check the action list version. Furthermore, the action list and action list version may be generated using a hashing algorithm with groups and a group managing scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The action list version is sent to the application download server (Step <b>415</b>). This may be in response to a request from the application download server or alternatively may be initiated by the group manager so that the application download server has the latest version stored internally.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">If the action list is needed by the application download server or the wireless device, the group manager server will receive a request for an action list associated with the wireless device (Step <b>420</b>) and in response to receiving the request, will compile the action lists and send it to the application download server (Step <b>425</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the process performed by the wireless device in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The wireless device stores an action list version associated with the last action list it received (Step <b>500</b>). The action list version may have been generated by the application download server or the group manager server and sent to the wireless device along with the action list.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The wireless device receives another action list version (Step <b>505</b>). This action list version may be in response to a request to for the action list version by the wireless device or may be initiated by one of the servers. After receiving the second action list, the wireless device compares the second action list with the one stored previously (Step <b>510</b>). If the versions are the same, the process ends (Step <b>515</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">If the versions are different, then the &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; branch is followed and the wireless device requests the action list associated with the second action list version from the download server (Step <b>520</b>). The wireless device may concurrently with this request or have previously given the application download server an identifier, such as a subscriber ID, so that the application download could send the action list version and action list associated with the wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The wireless device then receives the action list (Step <b>525</b>). The action list contains actions associated with wireless device. The wireless device than parses the action list and initiates the actions contained in the action list (Step <b>530</b>). The wireless device also updates the stored action list version to the second action list version, which is associated with the action list just downloaded.</p>
