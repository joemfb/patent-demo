<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a surface light source apparatus and a liquid crystal display device, and in particular, to a structure of a surface light source apparatus for efficiently entering light to a light guide plate having a thickness smaller than a thickness of a light source.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic view of a conventional liquid crystal display device using an edge light surface light source apparatus. A liquid crystal display device <b>11</b> is configured by a surface light source apparatus <b>12</b> and a liquid crystal panel <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The surface light source apparatus <b>12</b> has a point light source <b>18</b> using an LED arranged facing an end face (light incident surface) of a light guide plate <b>17</b> molded by a transparent resin, a diffusion plate <b>13</b> and two prism sheets <b>14</b> stacked on an upper surface (light outputting surface) of the light guide plate <b>17</b>, and a reflection plate <b>16</b> arranged facing a lower surface of the light guide plate <b>17</b>. The point light source <b>18</b> is mounted on a substrate <b>20</b>. The liquid crystal panel <b>15</b> is arranged on the prism sheet <b>14</b> through a rim sheet <b>19</b> (black frame).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Light emitted from the point light source <b>18</b> enters into the light guide plate <b>17</b> from the end face of the light guide plate <b>17</b>, propagates and expands in the light guide plate <b>17</b>, and exits from substantially the entire upper surface of the light guide plate <b>17</b>. The light outputted from the upper surface of the light guide plate <b>17</b> is transmitted through the diffusion plate <b>13</b> and the prism sheet <b>14</b> to illuminate the liquid crystal panel <b>15</b> from a back surface side. The light leaked from the lower surface of the light guide plate <b>17</b> is reflected by the reflection plate <b>16</b> to again return into the light guide plate <b>17</b>, so that the light is reused.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such a surface light source apparatus <b>12</b> is desired to have an even luminance, high luminance, inexpensive cost, large light outputting area (small area other than light outputting surface), and small thickness. In particular, in a case of being incorporated to a portable device, a demand for a thinner area light source apparatus <b>12</b> is increasing more and more with thinning of the portable device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The size of each part of a general surface light source apparatus is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Sum of thicknesses of substrate and point light source 600 &#x3bc;m</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Height of light outputting window of point light source 300 &#x3bc;m</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thickness of prism sheet 62 &#x3bc;m (per one sheet)</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thickness of diffusion plate 55 &#x3bc;m</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thickness of light guide plate 300 to 650 &#x3bc;m</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thickness of reflection plate 60 &#x3bc;m</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thickness of rim sheet 55 &#x3bc;m</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The thickness of the surface light source apparatus is about 600 &#x3bc;m on the point light source side, and is between 539 &#x3bc;m and 889 &#x3bc;m on the light guide plate side even when the thickness of the rim sheet is excluded. Therefore, the thickness on the light guide plate side occupying the majority of the area of the surface light source apparatus is desirably reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The light guide plate occupies the majority of the thickness of the surface light source apparatus (hereinafter, when referring simply to thickness of surface light source apparatus, this refers to the thickness on the light guide plate side of the surface light source apparatus). However, if the thickness of the light guide plate is made smaller than the height of the light outputting window of the point light source, the light that does not enter the light guide plate of the light emitted from the point light source increases and the light usage efficiency of the surface light source apparatus lowers. Thus, the thickness of the light guide plate is subjected to restriction by the height of the light outputting window of the point light source, and it is difficult to have the thickness of the surface light source apparatus smaller than the height of the light outputting window of the point light source. Similarly, if the light source is a cold cathode tube, it is difficult to have the thickness of the light guide plate smaller than the diameter of the cold cathode tube.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">(Regarding Patent Document 1)</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of a liquid crystal display device <b>21</b> disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 5-53111 (Patent Document 1). In a surface light source apparatus <b>22</b> used in the liquid crystal display device <b>21</b>, a tapered portion <b>25</b> is provided at the portion of small thickness of the light guide plate, that is, the end of the light guide plate main body <b>24</b> to efficiently enter light from a fluorescent tube <b>23</b> to the light guide plate having a thickness smaller than the fluorescent tube <b>23</b>. The end face of the tapered portion <b>25</b> has a height substantially equal to the diameter of the fluorescent tube <b>23</b>, and the fluorescent tube <b>23</b> faces the relevant end face. The light entered from the end face of the tapered portion <b>25</b> is introduced into the light guide plate main body <b>24</b> by being totally reflected at the front and back surfaces of the tapered portion <b>25</b>, and outputted from the upper surface of the light guide plate main body <b>24</b> toward a liquid crystal panel <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The surface light source apparatus <b>22</b> disclosed in Patent Document 1 aims to introduce the light of the fluorescent tube <b>23</b> to the light guide plate without leakage. To this end, the height of the end face of the tapered portion <b>25</b> is made substantially equal to the diameter of the fluorescent tube <b>23</b>, and the light of the fluorescent tube <b>23</b> is introduced to the tapered portion <b>25</b> without leakage. However, in the surface light source apparatus <b>22</b>, the leakage of light at the tapered portion <b>25</b> cannot be prevented. Thus, the light leaked from the tapered portion <b>25</b> appears shining from an observer side, and hence the edge of the display unit (screen) of the liquid crystal display device <b>21</b> emits light at high luminance, and the quality of the display unit degrades.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A reason that the leakage of light from the tapered portion <b>25</b> cannot be prevented in the structure of the surface light source apparatus <b>22</b>, for example, will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Assume that the light tends to leak out the most at the tapered portion <b>25</b>. If the leakage of such light that tends to leak out the most is prevented, the leakage of light at the tapered portion <b>25</b> can be eliminated in the surface light source apparatus <b>22</b>. The light that tends to leak out the most is a light ray L having a largest incident angle &#x3b1; of the light emitted from the fluorescent tube <b>23</b> and entered the tapered portion <b>25</b>, and thus a structure in which the light ray L with the maximum incident angle &#x3b1; measured from a direction perpendicular to the end face of the tapered portion <b>25</b> does not leak out at the tapered portion <b>25</b> and the thickness of the light guide plat main body <b>24</b> is reduced as much as possible is considered. To obtain such a structure, a condition for totally reflecting the light ray L having the maximum incident angle &#x3b1; at the upper end (point A) of an inclined surface of the tapered portion <b>25</b>, again totally reflecting at point B at the lower surface of the light guide plate, and reflecting at the upper surface (point C) adjacent to the tapered portion <b>25</b> of the light guide plate main body <b>24</b> is to be considered. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a flat plate-shaped short portion is shown at the end face portion of the tapered portion <b>25</b>, but this is shown for the sake of illustration, and the length can be assumed as infinitely short.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">First, the maximum incident angle &#x3b1; of the light ray that entered the light guide plate is determined by,

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The incident angle at which the light ray L having the maximum incident angle &#x3b1; enters point A having an inclination angle &#x3b8; is 90&#xb0;&#x2212;&#x3b8;&#x2212;&#x3b1;, and thus a condition that the light ray totally reflects at the inclined surface is,

</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The incident angle at which the light totally reflected at point A enters the lower surface of the tapered portion <b>25</b> is 90&#xb0;&#x2212;2&#x3b8;&#x2212;&#x3b1;, and thus a condition that the light ray totally reflects at point B of the lower surface is,

<br/>
If the equation 3 is satisfied, the light totally reflected at point B will also be totally reflected at point C of the light guide plate main body <b>24</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Therefore, according to the equations 2 and 3, &#x3b8;&#x2266;45&#xb0;&#x2212;&#x3b1; is to be satisfied in order for the light ray to be totally reflected at point A, point B, and point C.

</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, if the inclination angle &#x3b8; of the tapered portion <b>25</b> is small, the light totally reflected at the lower surface of the light guide plate after being totally reflected at the upper end of the inclined surface of the tapered portion <b>25</b> may again enter the inclined surface of the tapered portion <b>25</b> and leak out from the tapered portion <b>25</b>, and furthermore, the length of the tapered portion <b>25</b> becomes long if the inclination angle &#x3b8; is small, and hence the inclination angle &#x3b8; is desirably large as possible within a range satisfying the equation 4. Therefore, the inclination angle &#x3b8; is a value large as possible at a limit satisfying the equation 4. In other words,

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the thickness t of the light guide plate main body <b>24</b> is 3.75 mm (in the case of acrylic resin) or 3.45 mm (in the case of polycarbonate resin).

The value t=2.2 mm is significantly smaller than the value (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the thickness t obtained through the above calculation, and thus the light will always leak out from the tapered portion <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Therefore, in the surface light source apparatus <b>22</b> disclosed in Patent Document 1, the leakage of light from the tapered portion <b>25</b> cannot be prevented.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">(Regarding Patent Document 2)</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view showing a surface light source apparatus disclosed in FIG. 1 of Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-69751 (Patent Document 2). The surface light source apparatus <b>31</b> has a conical light introducing section <b>33</b> arranged at the end of a light guiding sheet <b>32</b>, and a point light source <b>35</b> arranged facing the end face (light receiving section <b>34</b>) of the light guiding section <b>33</b>. In the surface light source apparatus <b>31</b> as well, the point light source <b>35</b> and the light receiving section <b>34</b> of the light introducing section <b>33</b> have a height of the same extent, so that the light of the point light source <b>35</b> is entered from the light guiding section <b>33</b> and introduced to the light guiding sheet <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The surface light source apparatus <b>31</b> disclosed in Patent Document 2 aims to introduce the light of the point light source <b>35</b> to the light guiding sheet <b>32</b> without leakage. Thus, the height of the light receiving section <b>34</b> is made substantially equal to the height of the point light source <b>35</b>, and the light of the point light source <b>35</b> is introduced to the light guiding sheet <b>32</b> by the tapering of the light introducing section <b>33</b>. However, in this surface light source apparatus <b>31</b> as well, the leakage of light at the conical light introducing section <b>33</b> cannot be prevented. Thus, the light leaked from the light introducing section <b>33</b> appears shining from the observer side, and hence the edge of the display unit (screen) of the liquid crystal display device emits light at high luminance, and the quality of the display unit degrades.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a view showing the cross-section of the light introducing section <b>33</b> and the light receiving section <b>34</b> taken along a perpendicular plane passing through an axis center of the light introducing section <b>33</b>. The reason the leakage of the light from the light introducing section <b>33</b> cannot be prevented in the surface light source apparatus <b>31</b> of Patent Document 2 (FIG. 1) will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Since the acrylic resin is used for the light guide plate material in the surface light source apparatus <b>31</b> of the Patent Document 2, the maximum incident angle &#x3b1; of the light ray L entered to the light guiding section <b>33</b> is &#x3b1;=42.16&#xb0; from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and thus the inclination angle &#x3b8; of the surface of the light introducing section <b>33</b> in this case is &#x3b8;=2.84&#xb0;. However, the height of the light receiving section <b>34</b> is 3 mm and the thickness of the light guiding sheet <b>32</b> is 1 mm in the surface light source apparatus <b>31</b> of Patent Document 2, and thus the length of the light introducing section <b>33</b> is X=20.16 mm if the inclination angle of the light introducing section <b>33</b> is &#x3b8;=2.84&#xb0;. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the light totally reflected at the upper end of one inclined surface of the light introducing section <b>33</b> enters the other inclined surface at an incident angle of
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>90&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b1;+3&#x3b8;)=39.32&#xb0;.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
This incident angle 39.82&#xb0; is an angle smaller than the critical angle (42.16&#xb0;) of total reflection, and thus the light ray L that entered the other inclined surface leaks to the outside, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.
</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Therefore, in the surface light source apparatus <b>31</b> disclosed in Patent Document 2, light of a certain extent can be confined but light of about a few dozen percent leaks out from the light introducing section <b>33</b>, whereby the leaked light shines at the display surface and the quality of the liquid crystal display device degrades. In Patent Document 2, consideration is not made in preventing such leakage of light.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">FIG. 3 of Patent Document 2 discloses a light guide plate in which the end face (light receiving section <b>34</b>) of the light introducing section <b>33</b> is circular and the light introducing section <b>33</b> flatly expands and becomes thinner toward the side opposite to the light receiving section <b>34</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In such a surface light source apparatus as well, the surface on the upper surface side of the light introducing section <b>33</b> and the surface on the lower surface side face each other substantially in parallel in view of the cross-section taken along K-K of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, as apparent when seen from the light receiving section <b>34</b> side as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Therefore, the light leaks out from the light introducing section <b>33</b> same as in the case of FIG. 1 of Patent Document 2 even in the light guide plate of such a mode.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the surface light source apparatus <b>41</b> of such a structure, the light ray leaked from the light entering section <b>44</b> is reflected by the light reflection plate <b>45</b> to re-enter the light entering section <b>44</b>, and introduced to the light guide plate main body <b>43</b> by repeating reflecting at the interface of the light entering section <b>44</b> and the light reflection plate <b>45</b>, as with a light ray L<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">However, in such a structure, some of the light is absorbed by the light reflection plate <b>45</b> and the usage efficiency of the light lowers as with a light ray L<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Furthermore, when fixing the light reflection plate <b>45</b> to the light entering section <b>44</b> with an adhesive, a considerable amount of light is absorbed and lost by the adhesive. Furthermore, since the light entering section <b>44</b> has a step-form, the reflected light ray leaks out from the light incident surface as with the light ray L<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Therefore, the usage efficiency of the light is not satisfactory in such structure compared to the surface light source apparatus that confines the light by total reflection.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In such a surface light source apparatus, the thickness of the light entering section <b>44</b> may increase by the thickness of the light reflection plate <b>45</b> since the light reflection plate <b>45</b> is arranged on the light entering section <b>44</b>.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">In view of the above technical problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a surface light source apparatus in which a thickness of an end face of a light introducing section is substantially equal to a height of a light outputting window of a point light source so that light can be introduced to the light guide plate that is thin compared to the height of the light outputting window of the point light source, where a leakage of the light from the light introducing section can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0065">To achieve the above object, a surface light source apparatus according to the present invention is a surface light source apparatus including a point light source, and a light guide plate for introducing light of the point light source from a light incident surface and outputting to an outside from a light outputting surface; wherein the point light source is arranged at a position facing the light incident surface of the light guide plate; the light guide plate includes a light introducing section for confining the light from the point light source entered from the light incident surface, and a light guide plate main body, which has a thickness smaller than a maximum thickness of the light introducing section and being arranged to continue with the light introducing section, for outputting the confined light to the outside from the light outputting surface by a light outputting means; the light introducing section has an inclined surface, which is inclined toward an end of a surface of the light guide plate main body from a surface of a portion having a greater thickness than the light guide plate main body, on a surface on the light outputting side of the light guide plate or on an opposite surface thereof; and the light guide plate has a directivity converting pattern, for converting a directivity expansion in a thickness direction of the light guide plate of the light entered to the light introducing section to directivity characteristics tilted toward a direction parallel to a surface direction of the light guide plate, on the surface on the light outputting side or on the opposite surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0066">In the surface light source apparatus of the present invention, the light emitted from the point light source can be efficiently introduced into the light guide plate main body of small thickness since the light introducing section of large thickness is arranged at a position of entering the light from the point light source of the light guide plate. Furthermore, since the light introducing section includes the directivity converting pattern for converting the directivity expansion in the thickness direction of the light guide plate of the light entered to the light introducing section to the directivity characteristics tilted toward the direction parallel to the surface direction of the light guide plate, the light entered to the light introducing section can be introduced to the light guide plate main body of small thickness with a small leakage or preferably no leakage even if an inclination angle of the inclined surface is large. The thickness of the light guide plate thus can be reduced while suppressing a loss of light to a small extent.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0067">According to one aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the light guide plate has the directivity converting pattern, which is configured by a plurality of planes radially extending with a vicinity of the point light source as a center when seen from a direction perpendicular to the light outputting surface of the light guide plate, on the surface on the light outputting side or on the opposite surface thereof. In this aspect, since the directivity converting pattern, which is configured by a plurality of planes radially extending with the point light source as the center when seen from the direction perpendicular to the light outputting surface of the light guide plate, is arranged on the light guide plate, the light entered to the light introducing section can be introduced to the light guide plate main body of small thickness with a small leakage or preferably no leakage even if the inclination angle of the inclined surface is large. The thickness of the light guide plate can be reduced while minimizing the loss of light.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068">According to another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, an average inclination angle of a cross-section of the directivity converting pattern cut along a plane, which includes a line radially extending with the point light source as a center and which is parallel to the thickness direction of the light guide plate, is smaller than an average inclination angle of a cross-section of the directivity converting pattern cut along a plane, which is orthogonal to the plane and which is parallel to the thickness direction of the light guide plate. The line radially extending with the point light source as the center means the line connecting a point passing the center of a finite width of the point light source and a point of a predetermined pattern when the light guide plate is seen from the light outputting surface side. According to such an aspect, the leakage of light from the light guide plate can be evaluated using a concept of average inclination angle, which contributes to designing a surface light source apparatus of small leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0069">According to another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the directivity converting pattern is formed by a convex-concave structure including a concave portion and/or a convex portion; and the number of the concave portion and/or the convex portion passed when scanning a length from a certain point in a region formed with the convex-concave structure in a direction of a light source is less than the number of the concave portion and/or the convex portion passed when scanning the same length in a direction orthogonal to the scanning direction. The length in the direction of the light source is a length extending toward the center of the light source. According to such an aspect, the leakage of light from the light guide plate can be evaluated by the number of concave-convex portions, which contributes to designing a surface light source apparatus of small leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0070">According to still another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the directivity converting pattern is formed by arranging a concave portion and/or a convex portion extending in one direction in at least two or more extending directions; and the concave portion and/or the convex portion have the respective extending direction within &#xb1;&#xb0;20 with respect to a direction connecting the respective position and the point light source. The direction connecting with the point light source is the direction connecting with the center of the point light source. When exceeding &#xb1;&#xb0;20, the effect of reducing the leakage of light and improving light usage efficiency lowers.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0071">According to another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the directivity converting pattern is formed by repeating a concave portion and/or a convex portion extending in one direction; and when a region formed with directivity converting pattern is seen from the point light source, an expansion of the region is smaller than or equal to 80&#xb0;. The description &#x201c;seen from the point light source&#x201d; means &#x201c;seen from the center of the point light source&#x201d;. When the expansion exceeds 80&#xb0;, the effect of reducing the leakage of light and improving the light usage efficiency lowers.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0072">According to another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the directivity converting pattern is configured by a plurality of V-shaped groove structures. In this aspect, the directivity expansion in the thickness direction of the light guide plate of the light entered to the light introducing section can be converted to a direction parallel to the surface direction of the light guide plate since the directivity converting pattern is configured by a plurality of V-shaped groove structures.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0073">According to yet another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the directivity converting pattern is formed in an arcuate region when seen from a direction perpendicular to the light outputting surface of the light guide plate. According to such an aspect, the leakage at the light introducing section of the light outputted in each direction from the point light source can be minimized since the directivity converting pattern is arranged in the arcuate region having the point light source as the center.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0074">According to yet another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the directivity converting pattern is arranged in at least one part of the inclined surface formed in the light introducing section. Manufacturing of the light guide plate is facilitated since the inclined surface and the directivity converting pattern are formed in the same plane of the light guide plate by arranging the directivity converting pattern in the inclined surface.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0075">According to yet another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the directivity converting pattern is arranged in at least one part of a merged region of the light introducing section and an adjacent region of the light guide plate main body adjacent to the light introducing section at a surface opposite to the surface formed with the inclined surface of the light guide plate. The light which directivity is converted by the directivity converting pattern can enter the inclined surface and the leakage of light at the inclined surface can be suppressed to a minimum by arranging the directivity converting pattern in at least one part of the light introducing section and the adjacent region of the light guide plate main body adjacent to the light introducing section.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0076">According to yet another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the directivity converting pattern is arranged in a region on a side close to the point light source than a position where the light totally reflected by the inclined surface is totally reflected for a second time at a surface on an opposite side of the light outputting surface at a surface opposite to the surface formed with the inclined surface of the light guide plate. According to this aspect, the light reflected at the inclined surface of the light introducing section is prevented from entering the directivity converting pattern a plurality of times, and prevented from leaking outside by entering the directivity converting pattern a plurality of times, whereby the loss of light can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0077">According to yet another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the directivity converting pattern is formed on a surface opposite to the surface formed with the inclined surface of the light guide plate; and the directivity converting pattern is arranged on a side close to the point light source than a position defined at a distance

<br/>
from a position facing an edge on the light guide plate main body side of the inclined surface toward an interior of the light guide plate main body, where t is the thickness of the light guide main body and &#x3b8; is the inclination angle of the inclined surface. If such a condition is satisfied, the light reflected at the inclined surface of the light introducing section is prevented from entering the directivity converting pattern a plurality of times, and prevented from leaking outside by entering the directivity converting pattern a plurality of times, whereby the loss of light can be reduced,
</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0078">In the aspect of including the V-shaped groove structure of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, each of the V-shaped groove structures configuring the directivity converting pattern preferably forms an angle of greater than or equal to 100&#xb0; and smaller than or equal to 140&#xb0;. If the angle between the planes forming the V-shaped groove structure is greater than or equal to 100&#xb0; and smaller than or equal to 140&#xb0;, a ratio of leakage light (=leakage light/input light) can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0079">According to yet another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, an angle formed by a direction extended from an arbitrary point on an edge on a side close to the point light source of the directivity converting pattern to one end of a light outputting window of the point light source, and a direction extended from the arbitrary point to a middle of the light outputting window is smaller than or equal to 30&#xb0;; and an angle formed by a direction extended from an arbitrary point on an edge on the side close to the point light source of the directivity converting pattern to the other end of the light outputting window of the point light source, and a direction extended from the arbitrary point to the middle of the light outputting window is smaller than or equal to 30&#xb0;. According to such an aspect, the light outputted from an arbitrary point of the light outputting surface can be confined in the light introducing section and the leakage from the light introducing section can be suppressed to a minimum even when the light outputting window of the light source has a finite size.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0080">According to yet another aspect of the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, an aspect ratio in a vertical direction and a horizontal direction in plan view of a concave portion and/or a convex portion configuring the directivity converting pattern is smaller than or equal to 0.5. The aspect ratio in the vertical direction and the horizontal direction in plan view means a ratio of the length in the direction orthogonal to the vertical direction (direction the cross-sectional shape changes or short direction; horizontal direction) with respect to the length in the direction the cross-sectional shape of the concave portion and/or the convex portion configuring the directivity converting pattern does not change or longitudinal direction (vertical direction), and the leakage of light from the light guide plate can be reduced by having the value of the aspect ratio to smaller than 0.5.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0081">A liquid crystal display device according to the present invention includes the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, and a liquid crystal panel. Since the liquid crystal display device uses the surface light source apparatus according to the present invention, the thickness of the liquid crystal display device can be reduced by thinning the light guide plate, and the display surface of the liquid crystal panel can be made brighter by suppressing the loss of light in the surface light source apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0082">The means for solving the problems in the present invention has characteristics in which the above-described components are appropriately combined, and the present invention enables a great number of variations by combining the components.</p>

<p id="p-0173" num="0201">The present invention will now be described below with reference to the accompanied drawings. First, a behavior of light in a conventional surface light source apparatus will be described in detail to facilitate an understanding of direction cosine space that becomes a basic concept of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0202"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a view showing directivity characteristics S<b>1</b> of light (in air) emitted from a point light source <b>51</b> and directivity characteristics S<b>2</b> of light entered to a light guide plate <b>52</b>. The point light source <b>51</b> uses an LED, and is small compared to the width of the light guide plate <b>52</b>. The light guide plate <b>52</b> has a rectangular plate shape, and an index of refraction thereof is expressed as n. An x-axis is defined in a direction perpendicular to a light incident end face <b>53</b> of the light guide plate <b>52</b> and directed toward the interior of the light guide plate, a z-axis is defined in a direction perpendicular to a light outputting surface <b>54</b> of the light guide plate <b>52</b>, and a y-axis is defined in a direction perpendicular to the x-axis and the z-axis (direction parallel to the light incident end face <b>53</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0203">Since the light emitted from the LED is an isotropic Lambert distribution having an even light intensity in each direction, the directivity characteristics S<b>1</b> of the light emitted from the point light source <b>51</b> also has the isotropic Lambert distribution. However, the light is represented with semispherical directivity characteristics assuming that the light is emitted only toward the front side of the point light source <b>51</b>, and the directivity characteristics has an expansion of 180&#xb0; within an arbitrary plane passing through the x-axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>a</i>) is a view of the directivity characteristics S<b>1</b> seen from a diagonal direction, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>b</i>) is a view of the directivity characteristics S<b>1</b> seen from a direction of negative to positive of the y-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0204">When the light of such directivity characteristics S<b>1</b> advances through the light guide plate <b>52</b> from the light incident end face <b>53</b>, the light ray refracts (Snell's law), and the directivity characteristics S<b>2</b> of the light in the light guide plate <b>52</b> is restricted to the expansion of 2&#x3b1;=2&#xd7;arcsin (1/n), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(</figref><i>b</i>). For example, if the light guide plate <b>52</b> is made of polycarbonate resin, the index of refraction is n=1.59, and thus &#x3b1;=38.97&#xb0; (hereinafter, &#x3b1;=39&#xb0; for the sake of simplifying the description). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>13</b>(<i>b</i>), x, y, z components in a Q direction and an R direction of the directivity characteristics S<b>2</b> are also with respect to the light guide plate <b>52</b> made of polycarbonate resin. The directivity characteristics is generally expressed by an emitting direction and an intensity of the light, but a length of a light ray vector in the directivity characteristics is all set as one, and only a light ray direction is shown since the present invention addresses only the presence of leakage of light, that is, the light ray direction.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0205">Next, consider confining the light inside the light guide plate <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. If the light guide plate is made of polycarbonate resin (index of refraction n=1.59), and the height of the end face of the tapered portion <b>55</b> is T=0.3 mm, a condition that the light does not leak out from the light guide plate <b>52</b> can be calculated using the equations 1 to 8, and is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0206">Maximum incident angle &#x3b1;=39&#xb0;</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0207">Inclination angle &#x3b8; of inclined surface <b>57</b> of tapered portion <b>55</b>=6&#xb0;</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0208">Length X of tapered portion <b>55</b>=0.45 mm</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0209">High and low difference Y of inclined surface <b>57</b> of tapered portion <b>55</b>=0.05 mm</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0210">Thickness t of light guide plate main body <b>56</b>=0.25 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0211">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a flat plate shaped short portion is shown at the end face portion of the tapered portion <b>55</b>, but this is shown for the sake of illustration, and the length can be assumed as infinitely short.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0212">Consider the change in directivity characteristics of the light in a zx plane in the light guide plate <b>52</b>. If the light ray in the light ray direction (angle with x-axis; hereinafter, light ray direction refers to angle formed with x-axis) &#x3be;(&#x2212;&#x3b1;&#x2266;&#x3be;&#x2266;&#x3b1;) that entered the light guide plate <b>52</b> is totally reflected at the inclined surface <b>57</b> of inclination angle &#x3b8;, the light ray direction after the reflection becomes &#x2212;&#x3be;&#x2212;2&#x3b8;. Therefore, if the light ray in the light direction between &#x2212;6&#xb0; and +39&#xb0; of the light of the directivity characteristics S<b>2</b> in the range of between &#x2212;39&#xb0; and +39&#xb0; that entered the light guide plate <b>52</b> enters the inclined surface <b>57</b>, all light rays are totally reflected, and the directivity characteristics after the reflection is in the range of between &#x2212;51&#xb0; and &#x2212;6&#xb0; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref><i>a</i>)). Since the light in the range of between &#x2212;39&#xb0; and &#x2212;6&#xb0; does not enter the inclined surface <b>57</b>, the directivity characteristics of between &#x2212;39&#xb0; and &#x2212;6&#xb0; is maintained (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref><i>b</i>)). Furthermore, some light in the range of between &#x2212;6&#xb0; and +39&#xb0; maintain the directivity characteristics of between &#x2212;6&#xb0; and +39&#xb0; without entering the inclined surface <b>57</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref><i>c</i>)). Combining the light of each direction, the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> of the light between the inclined surface <b>57</b> and a lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b> has the light ray direction in the range of between &#x2212;51&#xb0; and +39&#xb0;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0213">At the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b>, the light of between &#x2212;51 and 0&#xb0; of the light of the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> of between &#x2212;51&#xb0; and +39&#xb0; is totally reflected without leaking at the lower surface <b>58</b>, and becomes the light in the range of between 0&#xb0; and +51&#xb0; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>a</i>)). Since the light of between 0&#xb0; and +39&#xb0; do not enter the lower surface <b>58</b>, such light maintains the directivity characteristics of between 0&#xb0; and +39&#xb0; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>b</i>)). Furthermore, some light of between &#x2212;51&#xb0; and 0&#xb0; may enter the light guide plate main body <b>56</b> while maintaining the directivity characteristics of between &#x2212;51&#xb0; and 0&#xb0; without entering the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>c</i>)). Combining the light of each direction, the directivity characteristics S<b>4</b> of the light between the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b> and the light guide plate main body <b>56</b> has the light ray direction in the range of between &#x2212;51&#xb0; and +51&#xb0;, as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0214">Therefore, according to the tapered portion <b>55</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the light of between &#x2212;39&#xb0; and 39&#xb0; advanced from the point light source <b>51</b> expands to the directivity characteristics of between &#x2212;51&#xb0; and +51&#xb0; within the zx plane, but the light can be introduced to the light guide plate main body <b>56</b> without leaking from the inclined surface <b>57</b> nor the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0215">A case in which the inclination angle &#x3b8; is increased and the thickness t of the light guide plate main body <b>56</b> is further reduced without taking the conditions of the equations 1 to 8 into consideration in the light guide plate <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> will be considered. The value of each portion is defined as below.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0216">Index of refraction n=1.59 (polycarbonate resin)</p>

<p id="p-0195" num="0223">The change in the directivity characteristics in the zx plane will be followed up for the light guide plate <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, same as in the light guide plate <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>a</i>), the directivity characteristics S<b>2</b> of the light of the point light source <b>51</b> that entered the light guide plate <b>52</b> is between &#x2212;39&#xb0; and +39&#xb0;. The incident angle of the light ray in the light ray direction &#x3be; is 90&#x2212;&#x3b8;&#x2212;&#x3be;, and thus the incident angle is between 36&#xb0; and 114&#xb0; when the light having the directivity characteristics of between &#x2212;39&#xb0; and 39&#xb0; enter the inclined surface <b>57</b>. The critical angle of total reflection at the inclined surface <b>57</b> is 39&#xb0;, and thus the light having an incident angle of between 36&#xb0; and 39&#xb0; (between 39&#xb0; and 36&#xb0; in the original light ray direction &#x3be;) at the inclined surface <b>57</b> leaks outside from the inclined surface <b>57</b> and becomes loss light Ls.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0224">Directivity of light reflected at inclined surface <b>57</b> &#x2212;66&#xb0; to &#x2212;15&#xb0;</p>

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Therefore, combining such lights, the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> between the inclined surface <b>57</b> and the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b> is between &#x2212;66&#xb0; and 39&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0227">The light of between &#x2212;66&#xb0; and 0&#xb0; of the light of directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> enter the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b>, but since an incident angle thereof is between 24&#xb0; and 39&#xb0;, the light having an incident angle to the lower surface <b>58</b> of between 24&#xb0; and 39&#xb0; (36&#xb0; to 21&#xb0; in original light ray direction &#x3be;) leaks outside from the lower surface <b>58</b> and becomes the loss light Ls. Therefore, only the light between &#x2212;51&#xb0; and 0&#xb0; of the light between &#x2212;66&#xb0; and 0&#xb0; is totally reflected at the lower surface <b>58</b> and becomes the light of between 0&#xb0; and +51&#xb0;, and becomes the light of directivity characteristics of between &#x2212;66&#xb0; and +51&#xb0; in combination with the light of between &#x2212;66&#xb0; and 39&#xb0; that is not reflected at the lower surface <b>58</b>, and the light is introduced to the light guide plate main body <b>56</b>. The light again leaks out at the upper surface of the light guide plate main body <b>56</b> and becomes the loss light Ls, and the light of directivity characteristics S<b>4</b> of between &#x2212;51&#xb0; and +51&#xb0; is guided through the light guide plate main body <b>56</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0228">Therefore, in such a light guide plate <b>52</b>, the light (light of between 21&#xb0; and 39&#xb0;) of the shaded region of the light of between &#x2212;39&#xb0; and 39&#xb0; that entered the light guide plate <b>52</b> leaks out from the inclined surface <b>57</b> and the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b> and becomes a loss, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0229">Therefore, in the surface light source apparatus including a two-dimensional tapered portion having a uniform shape in the width direction of the light guide plate <b>52</b>, the design is to be made such that the equation 1 and the equations 5 to 8 are satisfied if the light is not to leak out from the tapered portion, and the leakage of light occurs if the thickness of the light guide plate main body is made smaller than the thickness t determined by the equation 8. Thus, in the light guide plate having the structure of the related art, the thickness of the light guide plate main body cannot be reduced while having a leakage of light from the tapered portion to a minimum.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0230">The present invention avoids the above restriction and obtains a minimum leakage of light at the tapered portion and preferably prevents the leakage of light, and enables to reduce the thickness of the light guide plate.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0231">A concept of direction cosine space useful in understanding the present invention will be described, and the presence of the leakage of light in the light guide plate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 17</figref> is associated with the directivity characteristics in the direction cosine space.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0232">The direction cosine space represents the directivity characteristics (direction of light ray) of the light with a region at a surface of a sphere having a radius of one. For example, directivity characteristics QR within the zx plane of the directivity characteristics S<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> can be expressed with the yz plane and the xy plane of the direction cosine space, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>b</i>), respectively. A large circle on the outer side in the direction cosine space represents a sphere G<b>2</b> having a radius of one, and a small circle on the inner side represents a sphere G<b>1</b> having a radius of sin &#x3b1;=1/n.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0233">The directivity characteristics are generally expressed as a surface region at the surface of the sphere G<b>2</b> having a radius of one. However, in the light expansion in the y-axis direction as in the light within the xy plane of the directivity characteristics S<b>2</b>, the light ray direction within the zx plane merely changes even if totally reflected at the inclined surface <b>57</b> or the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b> and the expansion of the light does not change, and thus is not directly related to a leakage of light. Therefore, only the directivity characteristics in the zx plane is taken into consideration when considering the directivity characteristics S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and the like below since only the directivity characteristics in the zx plane needs to be taken into consideration when considering the presence of a leakage of light in the light guide plate having a two-dimensional tapered portion.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0234">Through the use of such direction cosine space, whether or not the light leaks out from the light guide plate <b>52</b> can be determined by whether or not the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> of the light between the inclined surface <b>57</b> and the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b> overlaps the shaded region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>20</b>(<i>c</i>). The reason therefor will be described with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20(</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0235">Assuming the light ray direction of the light entering the inclined surface <b>57</b> is &#x3be; (&#x2212;&#x3b1;&#x2266;&#x3be;&#x2266;&#x3b1;), the condition that the light does not leak at the inclined surface <b>57</b> is,

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>90&#xb0;&#x2212;&#x3b8;&#x2212;&#x3be;&#x3e;&#x3b1;, that is, 90&#xb0;&#x2212;&#x3b8;&#x2212;&#x3b1;&#x3e;&#x3be;&#x2003;&#x2003;(equation 9).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The condition that the light totally reflected at the inclined surface <b>57</b> enters the lower surface <b>58</b> and does not leak out from the lower surface <b>58</b> is,
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>90&#xb0;&#x2212;2&#x3b8;&#x2212;&#x3be;&#x3e;&#x3b1;, that is, 90&#xb0;&#x2212;2&#x3b8;&#x2212;&#x3b1;&#x3e;&#x3be;&#x2003;&#x2003;(equation 10).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Comparing the equation 9 and the equation 10, if the leakage of light does not occur at the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b>, the leakage of light also does not occur at the inclined surface <b>57</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0236">Consider the light entering the lower surface <b>58</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b>. As with the light of the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> shown with a solid line arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20(</figref><i>a</i>), the light that entered at an incident angle greater than &#x3b1; (critical angle) with respect to a normal line (z-axis) at the lower surface <b>58</b> is totally reflected at the lower surface <b>58</b>, and does not leak outside. On the contrary, as with the light of the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> shown with a broken line arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20(</figref><i>a</i>), the light that entered at an incident angle smaller than &#x3b1; (critical angle) with respect to a normal line (z-axis) at the lower surface <b>58</b> leaks outside from the lower surface <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0237">A region of light forming an angle smaller than &#x3b1; with respect to the z-axis is a region of broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>20</b>(<i>c</i>) when expressed with the direction cosine space. Therefore, the light leaks to the outside when the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> overlaps the shaded region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>20</b>(<i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0238">Representing the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> in the light guide plate <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> with the yz plane and the xy plane of the direction cosine space, QR&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>21</b>(<i>b</i>) is obtained. In the light guide plate <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the directivity characteristics <b>53</b> is deviated to a lower side, and a point R&#x2032; contacts the shaded region. Therefore, the leakage of light at the tapered portion <b>55</b> does not exist, but the light is at the limit of leaking outside.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0239">Similarly, representing the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> in the light guide plate <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> with the yz plane and the xy plane of the direction cosine space, QR&#x2033; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>22</b>(<i>b</i>) is obtained.

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0212" num="0240">First embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a perspective view showing a surface light source apparatus <b>61</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view thereof. The surface light source apparatus <b>61</b> includes a point light source <b>62</b> and a light guide plate <b>63</b>. The point light source <b>62</b> incorporates one or a plurality of LEDs, and emits white light. An LED <b>62</b><i>b </i>is sealed in a transparent sealing resin <b>62</b><i>c</i>, and the transparent sealing resin <b>62</b><i>c </i>is covered by a white resin <b>62</b><i>d </i>excluding a front surface, where the front surface exposed from the white resin <b>62</b><i>d </i>of the transparent sealing resin <b>62</b><i>c </i>is a light outputting window <b>62</b><i>a</i>. The point light source <b>62</b> is small compared to the width of the light guide plate <b>63</b> (dimension in a depth direction in the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>), and thus is referred to as a point light source as opposed to a cold cathode tube being referred to as a linear light source.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0241">The point light source is not a point light source in strict meaning. The point light source has a finite width, but does not have a width of greater than or equal to 10 mm as in the cold cathode tube. For example, the point light source includes a side view LED. One or more LED chips may be arranged in one package, and a plurality of LED chips may be simultaneously sealed. That in which a plurality of chips are simultaneously arranged may have an opening size in the width direction (y-axis direction) of about 5 mm, but is assumed as a point light source since it is sufficiently small with respect to the light outputting surface size of the light guide plate of about two inches. The point light source that emits parallel light such as a semiconductor laser element may also be used. Furthermore, the light guided using an optical fiber may be introduced to the light guide plate. In this case, the light output end of the optical fiber is assumed as the point light source.</p>

In the following, the light guide plate <b>63</b> is made of a polycarbonate resin.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0243">The light introducing section <b>65</b> is a portion of large thickness of the light guide plate <b>63</b>, and has the point light source <b>62</b> opposingly arranged at an end face thereof (light incident end face <b>66</b>). The thickness T of the end face of the light introducing section <b>65</b> is equal to or thicker than the height H of the light outputting window <b>62</b><i>a</i>, and thus the light emitted from the point light source <b>62</b> efficiently enters from the light incident end face <b>66</b> into the light introducing section <b>65</b>, and the light usage efficiency of the surface light source apparatus <b>61</b> becomes high. In the light introducing section <b>65</b>, a projection having a shape of substantially a half of a circular truncated cone shape projects out at the surface on the same side as the light outputting surface <b>69</b> of the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> so that the thickness of the light introducing section <b>65</b> becomes greater, where the outer circumferential surface of the projection becomes an inclined surface <b>67</b> and a directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> forms along the inclined surface <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0244">The inclined surface <b>67</b> is inclined from the surface of the portion having greater thickness than the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> toward the end of the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> in the light introducing section <b>65</b>.

<p id="p-0217" num="0245">The light guide plate main body <b>64</b> occupies a majority of the area of the light guide plate <b>63</b>, and the thickness t thereof is smaller than the thickness T of the light introducing section <b>65</b>, whereby the thickness of the light guide plate <b>63</b> can be reduced. In the embodiment described herein, the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> has a flat plate shape in which front and back surfaces are parallel, and the thickness of the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> is substantially even. Light outputting means <b>70</b> is arranged on a surface opposite to the light outputting surface <b>69</b> of the light guide plate main body <b>64</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, a triangular groove-shaped pattern is shown for the light outputting means <b>70</b>, but the light outputting means <b>70</b> which is subjected to sandblast processing, photograph printed with a diffusion ink, the light outputting means <b>70</b> with a diffraction pattern or an arbitrary concave-convex pattern, the light outputting means <b>70</b> which surface on the side opposite to the light outputting surface <b>69</b> of the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> is inclined (wedge-shaped light guide plate main body) and the like may be used. In addition, the light outputting means <b>70</b> may be arranged on the light outputting surface <b>69</b> or on both the light outputting surface <b>69</b> and the surface opposite thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0246">Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, in the surface light source apparatus <b>61</b>, light L emitted from the point light source <b>62</b> enters the light introducing section <b>65</b> from the light incident end face <b>66</b>, is totally reflected by the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> or the lower surface of the light introducing section <b>65</b> or passed through the light introducing section <b>65</b> and introduced to the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> having small thickness.

The light introducing section <b>65</b> has a structure in which the projection, which is one part of the circular truncated cone shape, is projected from the portion of same thickness as the light guide plate main body <b>64</b>.

<p id="p-0231" num="0259">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the envelope curve passing the upper end of each V-shaped groove structure <b>68</b><i>a </i>is a circular arc, a radius r<b>1</b> of the envelope curve passing the upper end of the valley line is 2.50 mm, and a radius r<b>2</b> of the envelope curve passing the upper end of the ridge line is 2.68 mm.

<p id="p-0232" num="0260">In the surface light source apparatus <b>61</b> of the first embodiment, the inclination angle &#x3b8; of the inclined surface <b>67</b> is designed as a large angle such as 15.3&#xb0;, and the thickness of the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> is thin or 0.18 mm. The leakage of light from the tapered portion cannot be prevented if the inclination angle and the thickness of the light guide plate main body are set to such values in the surface light source apparatus having a two-dimensional tapered portion of the related art, but the leakage of light at the light introducing section <b>65</b> can be prevented from occurring in the surface light source apparatus <b>61</b> of the present embodiment. The reason therefor will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0261">In the surface light source apparatus <b>61</b> of the first embodiment, a three-dimensional tapered structure is configured by lining the V-shaped groove structures <b>68</b><i>a</i>. In other words, each surface (total reflection surface) of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is rotatable not only about the y-axis but also about the z-axis. An inclined surface inclined three-dimensionally will now be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0262"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is a view describing a method of specifying the direction of the tilted surface. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, a plane F<b>1</b> represents a surface parallel to the xy plane. A plane F<b>2</b> is such that the plane F<b>1</b> is tilted by an angle &#x3b2; about the y-axis. A plane F<b>3</b> is such that the plane F<b>2</b> is rotated by an angle &#x3b3; about the z-axis, and a normal line N is a normal line perpendicular to the plane F<b>3</b>. The plane directed in the arbitrary direction can be specified by the tilt (inclination angle) &#x3b2; about the y-axis and the rotation angle &#x3b3; about the z-axis. For example, if &#x3b2;=0&#xb0;, the plane F<b>3</b> is the same as when not tilted, and the direction of the normal line N in this case is (0, 0, &#x2212;1). If &#x3b2;=30&#xb0;, and &#x3b3;=0&#xb0;, the direction of the normal line N is (&#x2212;0.5, 0, &#x2212;0.87).</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0263">When the direction of the normal line N of the plane F<b>3</b> changes, the directivity characteristics of the reflected light reflected at the surface F<b>3</b> changes. Assuming a three-dimensional flat plane tilted by &#x3b2; about the y-axis as with the plane F<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, and then rotated by &#x3b3; about the z-axis as the inclined surface <b>57</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b> of the light guide plate <b>52</b>, the directivity characteristics rotates by totally reflecting at the inclined surface <b>57</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b>. That is, considering the directivity characteristics QR within the zx plane shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31(</figref><i>a</i>) for the directivity characteristics S<b>2</b> of the light entered to the tapered portion <b>55</b>, the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> after such incident light is totally reflected at the inclined surface <b>57</b> of the three-dimensional tapered portion <b>55</b> expands to the lower side (Rs side) and rotates about the x-axis to be QsRs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31(</figref><i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31(</figref><i>b</i>) in the yz plane of the direction cosine space, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> in the xy plane of the direction cosine space.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0264">In the surface light source apparatus including the two-dimensional tapered portion <b>55</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> overlaps the sphere G<b>1</b> having a radius of sin &#x3b1; in the xy plane of the direction cosine space and the light leaks, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>22</b>(<i>b</i>), if the inclination angle &#x3b8; of the inclined surface <b>57</b> is 15&#xb0;. In the surface light source apparatus including the three-dimensional tapered portion <b>55</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, on the other hand, the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> tilts about the x-axis even if the inclination angle &#x3b2; is the same 15&#xb0; if the rotation angle &#x3b3; about the z-axis is 55&#xb0;, whereby the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> overlapping the sphere G<b>1</b> in the xy plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref><i>b</i>) tilts about the x-axis and no longer overlaps the sphere G<b>1</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32(</figref><i>b</i>). In other words, a point R&#x2033; of the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> that overlapped the sphere G<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref><i>b</i>) moves to the edge of the sphere G<b>1</b> as shown with a point Rs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32(</figref><i>b</i>). Therefore, according to the three-dimensional tapered portion, all of the light can be confined within the tapered portion by converting the directivity in the vertical direction of the yz plane to the horizontal direction, so that the leakage of light can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0265">Generally, the leakage of light at the inclined surface <b>57</b> can be eliminated by choosing an appropriate rotation angle &#x3b3; even if a large value is used for the inclination angle &#x3b2; of the inclined surface <b>57</b> for totally reflecting the light. This phenomenon is alleviated to an extent the incident angle of the light that hits the flat inclined surface <b>57</b> does not exceed the critical angle of total reflection since the inclination direction of the inclined surface of the tapered portion <b>55</b> changes when the inclined surface <b>57</b> of the tapered portion <b>55</b> is rotated by &#x3b3; about the z-axis, and the light is reflected in the diagonal direction at the inclined surface.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0266">With respect to the rotation angle &#x3b3; about the z-axis, the same effect of preventing the light leakage is obtained even when rotated in any direction. For example, even if the inclined surface <b>57</b> is rotated +55&#xb0; or rotated &#x2212;55&#xb0; about the z-axis, the effect is the same. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>33</b>(<i>b</i>), the V-shaped groove structure <b>68</b><i>a </i>of the present embodiment can be formed by arranging the positive rotated inclined surface <b>57</b> (+) and the negative rotated inclined surface <b>57</b> (&#x2212;) about the z-axis. Therefore, the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> in which the V-shaped groove structures <b>68</b><i>a </i>are lined can be formed by determining the angles &#x3b2;, &#x3b3; that can prevent the leakage of light, and alternately arranging the positive rotation inclined surface <b>57</b> (+) and the negative rotation inclined surface <b>57</b> (&#x2212;), and the leakage of light can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0267">An intersecting line d of the positive rotated inclined surface <b>57</b> (+) and the negative rotated inclined surface <b>57</b> (&#x2212;) is the ridge line or the valley line of the V-shaped groove structure <b>68</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33(</figref><i>b</i>) shows a state of the intersecting line d of the inclined surfaces <b>57</b> (+), <b>57</b> (&#x2212;) when seen from the x-axis direction, where the intersecting line d is tilted with respect to the upper surface of the light guide plate main body <b>56</b>. Therefore, if the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is formed by alternately arranging the inclined surfaces <b>57</b> (+), <b>57</b> (&#x2212;), the inclined surface <b>67</b> of the same inclination angle as the intersecting line d, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33(</figref><i>c</i>), can be obtained, the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> of small thickness can be formed at one inclined surface <b>67</b> and the light introducing section <b>65</b> of large thickness can be formed on the other inclined surface.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0268">The orthogonal coordinates x, y, z are used in the above description of the directivity characteristics, but the x-axis direction can be reinterpreted as the light outputting direction (i.e., radial direction of cylindrical coordinate) since the light is radially emitted with the point light source <b>62</b> as the center if the point light source <b>62</b> is used. Therefore, the V-shaped groove structure <b>68</b><i>a </i>is not arranged in a straight line, but is arranged in an arcuate shape with the hit of the point light source <b>62</b> as the center, so that the surface light source apparatus <b>61</b> of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0269">Lastly, the expansion in the horizontal direction of the light emitted from the point light source <b>62</b> will be considered. The expansion in the horizontal direction (xy plane) of the light entered to the light introducing section <b>65</b> is 39&#xb0; to both sides with the x-axis direction as the center, same as the directivity expansion in the vertical direction. Such directivity expansion in the horizontal direction does not need to be taken into consideration in the case of the two-dimensional tapered portion, but the directivity expansion in the horizontal direction needs to be taken into consideration in the three-dimensional tapered portion and the light guide plate <b>63</b> of the first embodiment since the light also performs total reflection within the xy plane.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0270">However, according to a detailed review, confining all lights of directivity characteristics S<b>2</b> having an expansion of &#xb1;39&#xb0; in the vertical direction and the horizontal direction in the light introducing section <b>65</b> is not possible regardless of how the tilt of each surface of the V-shaped groove structure <b>68</b><i>a </i>is adjusted. Furthermore, according to a detailed review, the light can be confined in the light introducing section <b>65</b> if the directivity expansion in the horizontal direction of the light entered to the light introducing section <b>65</b> is limited to be smaller than or equal to &#xb1;20&#xb0; with the x-axis as the center.</p>

In this example, the dead space of the light guide plate <b>63</b> becomes small since the size of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> becomes small, but the leakage of light cannot be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0272">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34(</figref><i>a</i>), an angle formed by a line segment connecting one end of the light outputting window <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the point light source <b>62</b> and the middle of the edge on the inner peripheral side of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b>, and a line segment connecting the middle of the light outputting window <b>62</b><i>a </i>and the middle of the edge on the inner peripheral side of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is 20&#xb0;.

However, the expansion in the horizontal direction of the light at the central part of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> becomes smaller than 20&#xb0; due to the refraction when entering the light introducing section <b>65</b>, and the expansion in the horizontal direction of the light becomes more smaller at the area deviated from the middle of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b>, whereby the leakage of light can be prevented with the entire directivity converting pattern <b>68</b>. According to an experiment, if an angle anticipating from the middle of the inner peripheral edge of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> to both ends of the light outputting window <b>62</b><i>a </i>is 40&#xb0; (&#xb1;20&#xb0;),</p>

<p id="p-0249" num="0277">If the directivity expansion in the horizontal direction is limited such that the angle anticipating from the inner peripheral edge of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> to both ends of the light outputting window <b>62</b><i>a </i>becomes smaller than or equal to 40&#xb0;, the directivity characteristics S<b>2</b> of the light entered to the light introducing section <b>65</b> becomes as shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35(</figref><i>b</i>) in the direction cosine space. In this case, the directivity characteristics in the vertical direction is represented as a continuous curve, but the directivity characteristics in the horizontal direction is represented in a discontinuous manner. As apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35(</figref><i>a</i>), the expansion in the horizontal direction of the directivity characteristics S<b>2</b> is small compared to the expansion in the vertical direction. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the direction characteristics S<b>3</b> of the light totally reflected at the inclined surface <b>67</b> of the light introducing section <b>65</b> in the yz plane of the direction cosine space, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the directivity characteristics S<b>3</b> in the xy plane of the direction cosine space.

In the direction cosine space of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, one part of the light expansion horizontally overlaps the shaded region, and one part of the light expansion to greater than or equal to 20&#xb0; leaks out. Through calculation, the leakage rate (=leakage light/input light) is about 15%. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34(</figref><i>b</i>), the leakage of light occurs if the thickness of the light guide plate main body is reduced when the expansion of light is about 30&#xb0; on one side, but it is to be put to practical use even with a slight leakage since reducing the dead space is also an important issue other than reducing the thickness in the demand of the surface light source apparatus <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0279">A method of fabricating the light guide plate <b>63</b> including the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> as above is as follows. First, a metal that is easy to process such as a Cu material is groove processed to a desired shape using a diamond bite to fabricate a master of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b>. Plating of Ni and the like is then performed with the master as the basis, and the plating is stripped from the master to obtain a stamper made of Ni. The stamper is then incorporated in a die for molding the light guide plate to simultaneously mold the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> and the light guide plate. Alternatively, the light guide plate including the projection is molded, and thereafter, an ultraviolet curable resin is applied on the inclined surface of the projection and pushed with the stamper, and the ultraviolet curable resin is irradiated with an ultraviolet ray to mold the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> separate from the light guide plate.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0280">The connecting portion (i.e., ridge line or valley line between inclined surface <b>57</b> (+) and inclined surface <b>57</b> (&#x2212;)) of the surfaces in the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> may be an earl surface in view of actual molding drip and the like. Since the leakage of light tends to easily occur beyond a control range of a certain surface of a design idea the larger the earl between the surfaces in the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b>, the earl is desirably as small as possible, and the connecting portion between the surfaces is ideally an acute angle. However, having the connecting portion between the surfaces as an acute angle is not possible in actual processing, whereby the size of the earl varies and a product with a large earl is also produced if the earl is formed by the molding drip. The die and the stamper may be processed such that the curvature radius of the cross-section of the earl surface is about 1 &#x3bc;m, so that even if the earl surface is formed, the formed earl surface is even. The leakage of light at the light introducing section <b>65</b> thus can be suppressed to</p>

<p id="p-0272" num="0300">If the inclined surface <b>67</b> is formed in a form of steps or a curved surface as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>53</b>(<i>c</i>), the inclination angle &#x3b8; is defined by a slope of a line connecting a starting point (upper end) and an ending point (lower end) of the inclined surface <b>67</b> when calculating the inclination angle &#x3b8;. Furthermore, in the case of the inclined surface <b>67</b> of step-form as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53(</figref><i>b</i>), the maximum inclination angle of the inclination angle of each step is preferably set to an angle the light does not leak out other than the inclination angle as a whole. In the case of the inclined surface <b>67</b> of curved surface form as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53(</figref><i>c</i>), the maximum inclination angle of the inclination angle (e.g., inclination angle of a tangent line of each point) of the curved portion is preferably set to an angle the light does not leak out. If the shape of the inclined surface <b>67</b> of step-form or the curved surface form is set so that some of the light leaks out, adverse effects arise in the bright light due to lowering in efficiency and light leakage, but problems do not arise if the extent thereof is a permissible extent. Furthermore, the inclination angle &#x3b8; when the inclined surface <b>67</b> is linear and not arcuate as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> has a different value of the inclination angle &#x3b8; for each direction (direction within xy plane seen from point light source <b>62</b>), and thus the inclination angle &#x3b8; for each direction is defined as the respective inclination angle &#x3b8;.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0301">This is due to the following reasons. The light entering the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> the most among the light entering the back surface of the light guide plate <b>63</b> after being reflected at the inclined surface <b>67</b> is light parallel to the inclined surface <b>67</b>, as the light shown with a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>. When such light is reflected by the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> at greater than or equal to 2 degrees, the light leaks out to the outside of the light guide plate <b>63</b>, and thus the end of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is desirably drawn to the point light source <b>62</b> side than the position entering the back surface of the light guide plate <b>53</b> the second time. The position the light enters the back surface of the light guide plate <b>63</b> the second time is a distance of D=(3&#xb7;t)/tan &#x3b8; measured from the end of the light guide plate main body <b>64</b>, as is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>. The directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is thus desirably in the region within D measured from the end of the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> to prevent the light of greater than or equal to 2 degrees from entering the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b>. If the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is formed in a concentric band shape as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the distance D becomes equal in any direction two-dimensionally, and a concentric circle distant by D to the outer side from the end of the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> is formed. If the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is formed on the linear inclined surface <b>67</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the inclination angle &#x3b8; changes depending on the direction seen from the point light source <b>62</b> in the region deviated from the front direction of the point light source <b>62</b>, and becomes smaller as the deviation from the front surface becomes larger with the front direction (x-axis direction) of the point light source <b>62</b> as a maximum. Therefore, by applying the equation 11, the distance D is the smallest in the front direction and becomes larger as the deviation from the front surface becomes larger. As a result, the line connecting the destination of the distance D extended in each direction is formed to be longer toward the outer side.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0302">If the projecting length of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> to the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> is smaller than or equal to D, the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> may be within the display area of the liquid crystal panel.

<p id="p-0288" num="0316">In the embodiments described above, a method of eliminating the leakage of light from the light guide plate by a more or less precise structure has been considered, but a more generalized principle will be described below. In other words, the leakage of light at the inclined surface <b>67</b> or a vicinity thereof can be reduced if the directivity of the light reflected at the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is expanded in a direction orthogonal to the light source direction (direction connecting with the center of the point light source <b>62</b>) (i.e., directivity in the vertical direction is expanded in the horizontal direction). This principle will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0317">To simplify the description, a case in which the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is arranged on a surface on the side opposite to the inclined surface <b>67</b> will be described (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>). Assume that the inclination angle of the inclined surface <b>67</b> is set to an angle that the light does not leak out (e.g., inclination angle of inclined surface <b>67</b> is 12.1&#xb0; if index of refraction of light guide plate <b>63</b> is 1.59).</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0318">The light entered to the light introducing section <b>65</b> has conical directivity characteristics (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(</figref><i>a</i>)), but the directivity characteristics of the light entered to a certain point positioned in the x-axis direction is the directivity characteristics shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55(</figref><i>a</i>) when seen from the z-axis direction perpendicular to the light guide plate <b>63</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>b</i>)). The concave portion and/or convex portion (hereinafter referred to as convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b</i>) configuring the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> has a shape of isotropically diffusing light as with the cone, as shown in plane in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56(</figref><i>a</i>) and in cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56(</figref><i>b</i>) (only one convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>is shown). When the light from the point light source <b>62</b> enters the conical convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b</i>, to which direction the light reflected at the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>only once is directed is obtained by calculation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55(</figref><i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55(</figref><i>b</i>) also shows the direction cosine space seen from the z-axis direction. The light reflected in an f<b>1</b> region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56(</figref><i>a</i>) is outputted to an f<b>1</b> region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55(</figref><i>b</i>), the light reflected in an f<b>2</b> region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56(</figref><i>a</i>) is outputted to an f<b>2</b> region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55(</figref><i>b</i>), and the light reflected in an f<b>3</b> region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56(</figref><i>a</i>) is outputted to an f<b>3</b> region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55(</figref><i>b</i>). In the direction cosine space, the light rays in the circle G<b>2</b> on the inner side leaks to the outside of the light guide plate <b>63</b>, and thus the light reflected at the inclined plane (f<b>1</b> region) on the side opposite to the point light source <b>62</b> of the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>leaks to the outside. The light reflected at the region (inclined plane on light source side) surrounded with a heavy line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56(</figref><i>a</i>) of the f<b>2</b>, f<b>3</b> regions includes those that hit the inclined plane on the side opposite to the point light source <b>62</b>. Thus, when the light hits the inclined plane of the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>twice, the light becomes the light that leaks out to the outside of the light guide plate <b>63</b>, and thus it is not preferable to reflect the light in such regions. The convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>configuring the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> includes the V-shaped groove structure <b>68</b><i>a. </i></p>

Therefore, in order to reduce the light that leaks outside, the proportion of the region where the light leaks of the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>is to be reduced and the other regions are to be made large.

In particular, if the pattern is periodically repeated in one of the directions of the light source direction or the direction orthogonal to the light source direction, the average inclination angle is desirably calculated for two periods defined in the direction the pattern is periodically repeated. If the pattern is periodic in both the light source direction and in the direction orthogonal thereto, a range that is worth two periods in one of the directions is the comparing range.

When the concave portion and/or the convex portion configuring the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is periodically repeated, the concave-convex extent in the light source direction and the concave-convex extent in the direction orthogonal to the light source can be compared. The concave-convex extent referred to herein is the number of concave portion and/or convex portion contained in a predetermined distance (e.g., length worth two periods of the pattern).</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0352">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, if the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>is periodically repeated in a direction orthogonal to the light source direction, the number of concave-convex portion (number of convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b</i>) contained in the two periods in the direction orthogonal to the light source direction and the number of concave-convex portion in the light source direction contained in the same distance are compared. If the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>is arcuately lined at a constant pitch, the number of concave-convex portion in the light source direction is zero, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73(</figref><i>a</i>) and the number of concave-convex portion in the direction orthogonal to the light source direction is two, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0353">If the number of concave-convex portion in the direction orthogonal to the light source direction is greater than the number of concave-convex portion in the light source direction contained in the same distance, which means that the shape of the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>is long in the light source direction, and thus the leakage of light from the light guide plate <b>63</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0354"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref> shows the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> in which the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>extending in one direction is arranged so as to be parallel to each other in a linear region. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref> shows the pattern shape when the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is scanned along the light source direction F, and the pattern shape when the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is scanned in the direction G orthogonal to the light source direction. Considering the number of concave-convex portion contained in the repeated two periods in the direction orthogonal to the light source direction, the number of concave-convex portion in the direction orthogonal to the light source is two, but the number of concave-convex portion in the light source direction is 1.7. Therefore, in this case as well, the number of concave-convex portion in the direction orthogonal to the light source direction is greater than the number of concave-convex portion in the light source direction contained in the same distance, and the leakage of light from the light guide plate <b>63</b> can be reduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0031" level="1">Angular Range in Extending Direction of Pattern</heading>
<p id="p-0327" num="0355">The angular range (tilt) in the extending direction of the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>will now be described. When each convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is radially arranged with the point light source <b>62</b> as the center, the extending direction of each convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>is parallel to the light source direction. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>, the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>may be arranged tilted from the light source direction. An extending direction J of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is desirably such that an angle &#x3bd; with respect to the light source direction F is within 20&#xb0; (i.e., &#xb1;20&#xb0;) in all directions. The extending direction J is the direction in which the cross-sectional shape of the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>does not change, or the longitudinal direction. The direction the convex-concave portion changes by the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>may be periodic or may not be periodic.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0356">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>, the angle &#x3bd; formed by the extending direction J of the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>with respect to the light source direction F is changed, and the efficiency improvement effect at the time is calculated. As a model, the effect of when each of a plurality of V-shaped groove structures <b>68</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is rotated all in the same direction seen from the light outputting surface side, and the pattern is tilted is calculated. The efficiency improvement effect is the efficiency indicating to what proportion the light is transmitted from the light introducing section <b>65</b> to the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> without leaking, where the efficiency when the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is not present is zero, a case in which the efficiency improvement effect of preventing light leakage is present (reduce light leakage) is positive, and a case in which the efficiency of preventing light leakage is lowered (increase light leakage) is negative. Specifically, with a light quantity transmitted to the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> when the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>is arranged in a certain extending direction as I&#x3bd;, and a light quantity transmitted to the light guide plate main body <b>64</b> without the pattern as Io, the effect is expressed as (I&#x3bd;&#x2212;Io)/Io. The efficiency improvement effect shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> is standardized to one with a point the efficiency improvement effect becomes the highest. In the calculation, calculation is performed with the model of the V-shaped groove structure for the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b>, but the tendency does not greatly change even if the shape of the directivity converting pattern is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0357">As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>, when the angle &#x3bd; exceeds 20&#xb0;, the efficiency improvement effect rapidly lowers, and the opposite effect is obtained when exceeding 25&#xb0;. The directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is desirably such that the angle formed by the extending direction J with respect to the light source direction F is smaller than or equal to 20&#xb0;.</p>
<heading id="h-0032" level="1">Aspect Ratio of Pattern</heading>
<p id="p-0330" num="0358">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>, if the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> extends to one direction when seen from the upper surface of the light guide plate <b>63</b>, the aspect ratio in plan view of the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b</i>, that is, a ratio M<b>1</b>/M<b>2</b> of a length M<b>1</b> in the direction orthogonal to the vertical direction and the direction the cross-section changes or the short direction (horizontal direction) with respect to a length M<b>2</b> in the direction the cross-section of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> does not change or the longitudinal direction (vertical direction=extending direction J) is desirably smaller than or equal to 0.5 times. If the lengths of the pitches p<b>1</b> and p<b>2</b> differ as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the average of the pitches p<b>1</b> and p<b>2</b> is considered the length M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0359"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> shows the result of calculating the efficiency improvement effect when the aspect ratio M<b>1</b>/M<b>2</b> of the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>is changed. As a model, the effect is calculated using the model shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 82 to 84</figref>. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> as well, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> as well, the efficiency when the directivity converting pattern is not present is zero, a case in which the efficiency improvement effect of preventing light leakage is present (reduce light leakage) is positive, a case in which the efficiency of preventing light leakage is lowered (increase light leakage) is negative, and the effect is standardized to one with a point the efficiency improvement effect becomes the highest. As is apparent from the result, the efficiency improvement effect is positive if the aspect ratio M<b>1</b>/M<b>2</b> is smaller than or equal to 0.5, and the opposite effect is obtained if larger. The aspect ratio for the vertical and horizontal directions of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> seen in plan view is desirably smaller than or equal to 0.5.</p>
<heading id="h-0033" level="1">Installation Range of Pattern</heading>
<p id="p-0332" num="0360">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80(</figref><i>a</i>), when the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> extending in one direction with respect to the light incident end face <b>66</b> of the light guide plate <b>63</b> is repeatedly arranged in a certain finite region, such a region is desirably within a expansion of 80&#xb0; seen from the center of light emission of the point light source <b>62</b>. Assume the range of expansion of the pattern seen from the center of light emission of the point light source <b>62</b> is a pattern expansion angle &#x3bc;. The range of expansion of the pattern is preferably substantially symmetric with respect to the front direction of the point light source <b>62</b>, that is, preferably the expansion of within &#xb1;40&#xb0; from the front direction.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0361">The graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref> shows calculation of a relationship of the angular range (pattern expansion angle &#x3bc;) of installing the directivity converting pattern and the efficiency improvement effect. As a model, the effect is calculated using the model of the V-shaped groove structure parallel to the front direction of the point light source <b>62</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80(</figref><i>a</i>). For example, the pattern expansion angle &#x3bc; of 0&#xb0; is a state in which the directivity converging pattern <b>68</b> is not arranged, and the pattern expansion angle &#x3bc; of 40&#xb0; is a state in which the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is arranged in the range in which &#x3bc; is 40&#xb0;. The efficiency improvement effect has a peak at the pattern expansion angle &#x3bc; of 50&#xb0; and the efficiency improvement effect starts to lower when the range becomes wider than 50&#xb0;, and a high efficiency improvement effect is obtained only up to about 80&#xb0;. In the case of this example, the efficiency near the front surface is high since the pattern in the front direction is substantially parallel to an advancing direction of the light and the extending direction of the directivity converting pattern, and the efficiency gradually drops as it deviates from the front surface, but the influence of the ends is small as the directivity converting pattern in the front direction is dominant in the entire efficiency. In this calculation as well, the model of the V-shaped groove structure is used for the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b>, but the tendency does not greatly change even if the shape of the convex-concave structure <b>68</b><i>b </i>is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0362">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80(</figref><i>b</i>), a tilt &#x3c3; in the extending direction of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> represents the angle tilted with respect to the front direction of the point light source <b>62</b>, and the extending direction of the directivity converting pattern <b>68</b> is tilted, but the tilt &#x3c3; is preferably within &#xb1;20&#xb0; and more preferably within &#xb1;5&#xb0; from a point of efficiency.</p>
