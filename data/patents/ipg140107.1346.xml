<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A first lead electrode containing nickel and chromium contacts a second upper electrode containing titanium. Here, since a difference between the normal electrode potential of nickel and chromium and the normal electrode potential of titanium is smaller than a difference between the normal electrode potential of nickel and chromium and the normal electrode potential of iridium, electric corrosion can be made difficult to occur as compared with the case where the first lead electrode containing nickel and chromium contacts a first upper electrode containing iridium. Therefore, a piezoelectric element can be obtained in which an increase in resistance due to the narrowing of the contact area between an upper electrode and a lead electrode for upper electrode or the separation of the lead electrode for upper electrode can be suppressed and which can be driven by a given voltage.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">THIS APPLICATION CLAIMS A PRIORITY TO JAPANESE PATENT APPLICATION NO. 2010-197432 FILED ON SEP. 3, 2010 WHICH IS HEREBY EXPRESSLY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN IN ITS ENTIRETY.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a piezoelectric element having an electrode and a lead wiring connected to the electrode and a method for manufacturing the same, and a liquid ejecting head and a liquid ejecting apparatus having the piezoelectric element.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A piezoelectric body containing crystals typified by lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and the like has piezoelectric effects and the like, and therefore is applied to a piezoelectric element. The piezoelectric element has a pair of electrodes, the electrodes on which a lead wiring for connecting to an external drive circuit or the like is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, known are an ink jet recording head as a liquid ejecting head and an ink jet recording device as a liquid ejecting apparatus, in which a piezoelectric element as a pressure generating unit is provided in a pressure generating chamber communicating with a nozzle opening that ejects ink as liquid, and ink in the pressure generating chamber is pressurized to thereby eject the ink from the nozzle opening.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The piezoelectric element adopted in the ink jet recording head has, for example, a piezoelectric layer sandwiched between a lower electrode and an upper electrode. Here, there is a problem in that the piezoelectric layer is easily broken due to the external environment, such as humidity. In order to solve the problem, a piezoelectric element is mentioned in which the lower electrode is used as an individual electrode and the upper electrode is used as a common electrode, and the piezoelectric layer is covered with the upper electrode (e.g., JP-A-2009-196329).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the upper electrode, a lead wiring for connecting an external drive circuit or the like and the upper electrode by bonding or the like is formed. Known as the lead electrode is one having an adhesion layer and a metal layer. The lead electrode is obtained by patterning (e.g., JP-A-2009-255536).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in patterning the lead electrode by wet etching, when an electrical conductor constituting the upper electrode as a common electrode and an electrical conductor constituting the adhesion layer of the lead electrode are different from each other, current flows through an etching solution due to differences in the ionization tendency between the electrical conductors, so that the electrical conductors melt in the etching solution, which causes electric corrosion. In particular, when the area of the common electrode is larger than the area of the individual electrode, Pt or Ir is used for the common electrode, and Ni, Ti, Cr, or the like is used for the adhesion layer of the lead electrode, a large amount of current flows through the etching solution, resulting in further progress of the electric corrosion in the adhesion layer of the lead electrode. When electric corrosion arises in the adhesion layer, the contact area between the upper electrode and the lead electrode become narrows or the separation of the lead electrode arises, which makes it difficult to obtain a piezoelectric element that can be driven by a predetermined voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, current flows also through moisture or the like adhering to the surface of the common electrode and the surface of the lead electrode, which causes electric corrosion in the adhesion layer, which makes it difficult to maintain a piezoelectric element that can be driven by a given voltage and a liquid ejecting head and a liquid ejecting apparatus having the same.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The given voltage refers to a voltage for generating the deformation amount required for driving the piezoelectric element. When the contact area between the upper electrode and the lead electrode becomes narrow or the separation of the lead electrode arises, so that the resistance between the upper electrode and the lead electrode becomes high, a voltage for generating the deformation amount required for driving the piezoelectric element cannot be applied.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention has been made in order to solve at least one of the above-described problems, and can be realized as the following aspects or application examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A piezoelectric element has: two or more lower electrodes formed in parallel; a piezoelectric layer formed on each of the lower electrodes; an upper electrode that is formed on the piezoelectric layers in such a manner as to face the two or more lower electrodes and that has a first upper electrode containing iridium and a second upper electrode containing titanium as the top layer; and a lead electrode having a first lead electrode that is formed in connection to the second upper electrode and contains nickel and chromium and a second lead electrode formed on the first lead electrode, in which the upper electrode is formed in common over the direction where the lower electrodes are arranged in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to this application example, the first lead electrode containing nickel and chromium contacts the second upper electrode containing titanium. Here, since a difference between the normal electrode potential of nickel and chromium and the normal electrode potential of titanium is smaller than a difference between the normal electrode potential of nickel and chromium and the normal electrode potential of iridium, electric corrosion is difficult to occur as compared with the case where the first lead electrode containing nickel and chromium contacts the first upper electrode containing iridium. Therefore, a piezoelectric element is obtained in which the narrowing of the contact area between the upper electrode and the lead electrode or the separation of the lead electrode can be suppressed and which can be driven by a given voltage.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the piezoelectric element above, the second lead electrode contains gold.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this application example, since the second lead electrode contains gold, the resistance becomes low. Therefore, a piezoelectric element is obtained that can be driven by a lower voltage.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A liquid ejecting head has a pressure generating chamber communicating with a nozzle opening that ejects liquid and the piezoelectric element above as a pressure generating unit for changing the pressure of the pressure generating chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to this application example, a liquid ejecting head having the above-described effects is obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A liquid ejecting apparatus has the liquid ejecting head above.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to this application example, a liquid ejecting apparatus having the above-described effects is obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 5</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A method for manufacturing a piezoelectric element, includes: a lower electrode formation process for forming two or more lower electrodes; a piezoelectric layer formation process for forming a piezoelectric layer on each of the lower electrodes; a first upper electrode film formation process for forming a first upper electrode film facing the two or more lower electrodes and containing iridium on the piezoelectric layers; a second upper electrode film formation process for forming a second upper electrode film containing titanium as the top layer of an upper electrode on the first upper electrode film; an upper electrode formation process for forming the upper electrode having a first upper electrode and a second upper electrode by patterning the first upper electrode film and the second upper electrode film; a first lead electrode film formation process for forming a first lead electrode film containing nickel and chromium on the second upper electrode; a second lead electrode film formation process for forming a second lead electrode film on the first lead electrode film; and a lead electrode formation process for forming a lead electrode having a first lead electrode and a second lead electrode by etching the first lead electrode film and the second lead electrode film by wet etching.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to this application example, the first lead electrode film containing nickel and chromium contacts the second upper electrode containing titanium. Here, since a difference between the normal electrode potential of nickel and chromium and the normal electrode potential of titanium is smaller than a difference between the normal electrode potential of nickel and chromium and the normal electrode potential of iridium. Therefore, electric corrosion is difficult to occur in the first lead electrode film when etching the first lead electrode film by wet etching in the lead electrode formation process as compared with the case where the first lead electrode film containing nickel and chromium contacts the first upper electrode containing iridium. Therefore, a piezoelectric element is obtained in which the narrowing of the contact area between the upper electrode and the lead electrode or the separation of the lead electrode can be suppressed and which can be driven by a given voltage.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 6</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the method for manufacturing a piezoelectric element above, the second lead electrode film contains gold.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this application example, since the second lead electrode obtained by wet etching the second lead electrode film contains gold, the resistance becomes low. Therefore, a method for manufacturing a piezoelectric element that can be driven by a lower voltage is obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 7</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the method for manufacturing a piezoelectric element above, the first lead electrode film is wet etched with an aqueous mixed solution containing ammonium cerium nitrate and nitric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this application example, a method for manufacturing a piezoelectric element in which the first lead electrode film can be more efficiently wet etched is obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 8</heading>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the ink jet recording head <b>1</b> has a flow path formation substrate <b>10</b>, a nozzle plate <b>20</b>, a protective substrate <b>30</b>, and a compliance substrate <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The flow path formation substrate <b>10</b>, the nozzle plate <b>20</b>, and the protective substrate <b>30</b> are stacked in such a manner as to sandwich the flow path formation substrate <b>10</b> with the nozzle plate <b>20</b> and the protective substrate <b>30</b> and the compliance substrate <b>40</b> is formed on the protective substrate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The flow path formation substrate <b>10</b> contains a silicon single crystal substrate having a crystal plane orientation of (<b>110</b>) in this embodiment, and an elastic film <b>50</b> containing an oxide film is formed on one surface. In the flow path formation substrate <b>10</b>, two or more pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> which are divided by partitions <b>11</b> and one surface of which is constituted from the elastic film <b>50</b> are disposed in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The flow path formation substrate <b>10</b> is provided with ink supply paths <b>13</b> and communicating paths <b>14</b> which are divided by the partitions <b>11</b> and which communicate with each pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> at the side of one end portion in the longitudinal direction of the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b>. At the outside of the communicating paths <b>14</b>, a communicating portion <b>15</b> communicating with each of the communicating paths <b>14</b> is provided. The communicating portion <b>15</b> communicates with a reservoir portion <b>32</b> of the protective substrate <b>30</b> described later to thereby constitute a part of a manifold <b>100</b> serving as a common ink chamber of each pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Here, the ink supply path <b>13</b> is formed in such a manner as to be narrower than the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> in the cross sectional area and maintains the flow path resistance of ink flowing into the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> from the communicating portion <b>15</b> at a fixed rate. For example, the ink supply paths <b>13</b> are formed with a width smaller than the width of the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> by narrowing the flow path at the side of the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> between the manifold <b>100</b> and each pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> in the width direction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this embodiment, the ink supply paths <b>13</b> are formed by narrowing the width of the flow path from one side but the ink supply paths may be formed by narrowing the width of the flow path from both sides. The ink supply paths may be formed by not narrowing the width of the flow paths but narrowing in the thickness direction. Each communicating path <b>14</b> is formed by extending the partitions <b>11</b> at both sides in the width direction of the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> to the communicating portion <b>15</b> and dividing the space between the ink supply paths <b>13</b> and the communicating portion <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As the materials of the flow path formation substrate <b>10</b>, a silicon single crystal substrate is used in this embodiment but it is matter of course that the materials are not limited thereto and, for example, glass ceramics, stainless steel, and the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the nozzle plate <b>20</b>, nozzle openings <b>21</b> communicating with the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> are formed near the end portion opposite to the ink supply path <b>13</b> of each pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The nozzle plate <b>20</b> has a thickness of 0.01 mm to 1.00 mm and contains, for example, glass ceramics, a silicon single crystal substrate, or stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The flow path formation substrate <b>10</b> and the nozzle plate <b>20</b> are stuck to each other with adhesives, a thermal fusion film, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The elastic film <b>50</b> formed on the surface of the flow path formation substrate <b>10</b> facing the surface to which the nozzle plate <b>20</b> is stuck contains an oxide film formed by thermal oxidation. For example, the elastic film <b>50</b> having a thickness of 0.50 &#x3bc;m to 2.00 &#x3bc;m is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">On the elastic film <b>50</b> of the flow path formation substrate <b>10</b>, an insulator film <b>55</b> containing a zirconium oxide film having a thickness of, for example, about 0.40 &#x3bc;m is formed. These films constitute a diaphragm as a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The elastic film <b>50</b> and the insulator film <b>55</b> constituting the diaphragm can be, for example, a layer of at least one substance selected from zirconium dioxide or aluminum oxide or a laminate of these layers, in addition to silicon oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">On the insulator film <b>55</b>, the lower electrodes <b>60</b> having a thickness of, for example, about 0.20 &#x3bc;m, the piezoelectric layers <b>70</b> having a thickness of, for example, about 1.30 &#x3bc;m as a piezoelectric body having a perovskite structure, and the upper electrode <b>80</b> having a thickness of, for example, about 0.05 &#x3bc;m, are further formed to thereby constitute a piezoelectric element <b>300</b> as a pressure generating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Here, the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> includes not only a portion including the lower electrode <b>60</b>, the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b>, and the upper electrode <b>80</b> but a portion at least including the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b>. For example, the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> also includes lead electrodes connected to the lower electrode <b>60</b> and the upper electrode <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In general, any one of the electrodes of the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> is used as a common electrode and the other electrode is patterned with the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> for each pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> to form an individual electrode. Here, the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> and the diaphragm that is deformed by driving of the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> are collectively referred to as a piezoelectric actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The diaphragm has a function of vibrating by driving of the piezoelectric element <b>300</b>. The diaphragm is deformed by the motion of the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> to thereby change the volume of the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b>. When the volume of the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> which are charged with ink becomes small, the pressure inside the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> becomes high, so that the ink is ejected from the nozzle openings <b>21</b> of the nozzle plate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Here, the structure of the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> according to this embodiment will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the lower electrode <b>60</b> constituting the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> is provided with a width narrower than the width of the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> for each region facing the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>, i.e., two or more of the lower electrode <b>60</b> are provided, and constitutes an individual electrode of each piezoelectric element <b>300</b>. Moreover, the lower electrode <b>60</b> is extended from the side of one end portion in the longitudinal direction of each of the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> to a portion above the wall around the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To the lower electrodes <b>60</b>, a lead electrode for lower electrode <b>90</b> containing, for example, gold or the like as a lead electrode is connected in a region outside each of the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b>, so that a voltage is selectively applied to each of the piezoelectric elements <b>300</b> through the lead electrode for lower electrode <b>90</b>. In contrast, the end portion of the lower electrode <b>60</b> at the side of the other end portion in the longitudinal direction of the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> is positioned in the region facing the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The materials of the lower electrodes <b>60</b> are not particularly limited insofar as the materials have conductivity and, for example, various kinds of metals, such as nickel, iridium, and platinum, conductive oxides thereof (e.g., iridium oxide), a complex oxide of strontium and ruthenium, a complex oxide of lantern and nickel, and the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> is provide with a width larger than the width of the lower electrode <b>60</b> and with a width narrower than the width of the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>. In the longitudinal direction of the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>, both ends of the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> are extended beyond the end portions of the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>. More specifically, the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> is provided in such a manner as to cover the upper surface and the end surface of the lower electrode <b>60</b> in the region facing the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>. The end portion of the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> at the side of one end portion in the longitudinal direction of the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> is positioned near the end of the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>, and the lower electrode <b>60</b> is further extended to a region outside of the end portion.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b>, a perovskite type oxide represented by General Formula ABO<sub>3 </sub>can be preferably used. Specifically mentioned are lead zirconate titanate (Pb(Zr, Ti)O<sub>3</sub>) (PZT), lead zirconate titanate niobate (Pb(Zr, Ti, Nb)O<sub>3</sub>) (PZTN (Registered Trademark)), barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>), potassium sodium niobate ((K, Na)NbO<sub>3</sub>), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> is deformed by the application of an electric field by the lower electrode <b>60</b> and the upper electrode <b>80</b>, to thereby perform mechanical output. The deformation amount is determined in accordance with the voltage to be applied. Therefore, a given voltage to be applied is set in accordance with the deformation amount required for driving the piezoelectric element <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The upper electrode <b>80</b> is continuously formed in a region facing the two or more lower electrodes <b>60</b> and the two or more pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> and is extended from the side of the other end portion in the longitudinal direction of the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> to a portion above the wall around the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b>. More specifically, the upper electrode <b>80</b> is formed in such a manner as to cover almost the entire region of the upper surface and the end surface of the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> in the region facing the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>. Thus, the penetration of moisture in the atmosphere into the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> is substantially prevented. Therefore, the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> can be prevented from breaking due to moisture, and thus the durability of the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> can be remarkably improved.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The thickness of the upper electrode <b>80</b> is, for example, 2 nm to 100 nm and contains iridium.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The end portion of the upper electrode <b>80</b> at the side of the other end portion in the longitudinal direction of the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> is positioned in the region facing the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> and a substantial actuator of the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> is provided in the region facing the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>. More specifically, the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> of a portion between the end portion of the lower electrode <b>60</b> and the end portion of the upper electrode <b>80</b> positioned in the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> serves as a substantial actuator. Therefore, even when the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> is driven, severe deformation does not arise in the diaphragm containing the elastic film <b>50</b> and the insulator film <b>55</b> in the vicinity of both ends in longitudinal direction of the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>, so that the generation of cracks in the diaphragm of this portion can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In such a structure, the surface of the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> is slightly exposed even in the region facing the pressure generating chamber <b>12</b>. However, the exposed portion is not a substantial actuator, the area thereof is very narrow, and the distance between the peripheral portion of the upper electrode <b>80</b> and the lower electrode <b>60</b> is large as described later, and therefore the breakage of the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> resulting from moisture can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, an intermediate film <b>85</b> is provided between the upper electrode <b>80</b> and the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b>. The intermediate film <b>85</b> contains materials having conductivity and substantially functions as one part of the upper electrodes <b>80</b>. More specifically, since the intermediate film <b>85</b> is formed from conductive materials and contacts the upper electrode <b>80</b>, the conductivity as the upper electrode <b>80</b> can be compensated.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although described later, the intermediate film <b>85</b> is patterned with the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b>, and has a function of preventing the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b> from being damaged during manufacturing. Therefore, the intermediate film <b>85</b> is formed only on the upper surface of the piezoelectric layer <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The intermediate film <b>85</b> is not always required and may be not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The upper electrode <b>80</b> has a two-layer structure containing a first upper electrode <b>81</b> containing iridium and a second upper electrode <b>82</b> containing titanium as the top layer, for example. The second upper electrode <b>82</b> also includes a natural oxidation film of titanium thinly formed on the surface of the second upper electrode <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The upper electrode <b>80</b> is not limited to the two-layer structure described in this embodiment and may be a structure of three or more layers in which another layer is formed between the first upper electrode <b>81</b> and the second upper electrode <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">At the end of the upper electrode <b>80</b> in the longitudinal direction of the ink jet recording head <b>1</b>, an upper electrode drawing portion <b>800</b> is formed. The upper electrode drawing portion <b>800</b> is extended to the same side as the side on which the lead electrode for lower electrode <b>90</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">On the upper electrode drawing portion <b>800</b>, a lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b> as a lead electrode is formed. The upper electrode drawing portion <b>800</b> and the lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b> will be described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b> is formed from the top of the upper electrode drawing portion <b>800</b> over the direction in which the lead electrode for lower electrode <b>90</b> extends. The lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b> is a two-layer structure having a first lead electrode <b>911</b> formed on the second upper electrode <b>82</b> and a second lead electrode <b>912</b> formed on the first lead electrode <b>911</b>. The lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b> is formed in such a manner that the first lead electrode <b>911</b> and the second upper electrode <b>82</b> contact.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The first lead electrode <b>911</b> contains nickel and chromium and the second lead electrode <b>912</b> contains, for example, gold.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b> is not limited to the two-layer structure described in this embodiment and may be a structure of three or more layers in which another layer is formed between the first lead electrode <b>911</b> and the second lead electrode <b>912</b>. Here, the structure of the lead electrode for lower electrode <b>90</b> can also be made the same as the structure of the lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b>. In this case, the lead electrode for lower electrode <b>90</b> and the lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b> can be formed in the same process.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, the lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b> is formed on the elastic film <b>50</b> and the insulator film <b>55</b> in a portion other than the region where the upper electrode drawing portion <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the protective substrate <b>30</b> having a piezoelectric element holding portion <b>31</b> capable of securing a space that does not inhibit the movement of the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> in a region facing the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> is joined onto a flow path formation substrate <b>10</b>, on which the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> is formed, through an adhesive <b>35</b>. The piezoelectric element <b>300</b> is formed in the piezoelectric element holding portion <b>31</b>, and therefor is protected in a state where the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> is hardly affected by the influence of the external environment.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the protective substrate <b>30</b>, a reservoir portion <b>32</b> is provided in a region corresponding to the communicating portion <b>15</b> of the flow path formation substrate <b>10</b>. The reservoir portion <b>32</b> is provided along the arrangement direction of the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> in such a manner as to penetrate the protective substrate <b>30</b> in the thickness direction and is made to communicate with the communicating portion <b>15</b> of the flow path formation substrate <b>10</b> to thereby constitute the manifold <b>100</b> serving as a common ink chamber of each pressure generating chamber <b>12</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this embodiment, the piezoelectric element holding portion <b>31</b> is integrally provided in a region corresponding to the line of the pressure generating chambers <b>12</b> and may be independently provided for each piezoelectric element <b>300</b>.

The protective substrate <b>30</b> is more preferably formed with materials whose coefficient of thermal expansion is substantially the same as that of the flow path formation substrate <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the protective substrate <b>30</b> is formed using a silicon single crystal substrate, which is the same material as that of the flow path formation substrate <b>10</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Furthermore, a through hole <b>33</b> that penetrates the protective substrate <b>30</b> in the thickness direction is provided in a region between the piezoelectric element holding portion <b>31</b> and the reservoir portion <b>32</b> of the protective substrate <b>30</b>. The end portion of the lead electrode for lower electrode <b>90</b> and the end portion of the lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b> are exposed into the through hole <b>33</b>. The lead electrode for lower electrode <b>90</b> and the lead electrode for upper electrode <b>91</b> are connected to, for example, a drive IC for driving the piezoelectric element <b>300</b> by connection wiring, which is not illustrated, extended into the through hole <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A drive signal includes a drive system signal for driving a drive IC, such as a driving power supply signal, and various control system signals, such as a serial signal (SI), and the wiring pattern is constituted by two or more wiring patterns to which each signal is supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Onto the protective substrate <b>30</b>, a compliance substrate <b>40</b> containing a sealing film <b>41</b> and a fixation plate <b>42</b> is further joined. The sealing film <b>41</b> contains materials having low rigidity and flexibility. One surface of the reservoir portion <b>32</b> is sealed with the sealing film <b>41</b>. The fixation plate <b>42</b> is formed with hard materials, such as metal. The region of the fixation plate <b>42</b> facing the manifold <b>100</b> is an opening portion <b>43</b> in which the fixation plate <b>42</b> is completely removed in the thickness direction. Therefore, one surface of the manifold <b>100</b> is sealed only by the sealing film <b>41</b> having flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In such an ink jet recording head <b>1</b>, ink is taken from the cartridges <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the inside thereof is filled with ink from the manifold <b>100</b> to the nozzle openings <b>21</b>.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">(1) The first lead electrode <b>911</b> containing nickel and chromium contacts the second upper electrode <b>82</b> containing titanium.

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">(4) The first lead electrode film <b>910</b> containing nickel and chromium contacts the second upper electrode <b>82</b> containing titanium.

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">(5) Since the second lead electrode film <b>912</b> obtained by wet etching the second lead electrode film <b>920</b> contains gold, the resistance can be made low.
