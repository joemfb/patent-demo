<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Application is a United States National Stage Application filed under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 of PCT Patent Application Serial No. PCT/CN2009/072328 filed on Jun. 18, 2009 which claims benefit of and priority to Chinese Patent Application Serial No. 200810198139.6 filed on Aug. 29, 2008, and Chinese Patent Application Serial No. 200810219169.0 filed on Nov. 17, 2008, the disclosures of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an implanted soft palate support, and more particularly to an implanted soft palate support and an implantation method for treating adult obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Adult OSAHS is a sleep breathing disorder with clinical features of snoring and apnea caused by upper airway collapse and obstruction during sleep. The morbidity of OSAHS is about 4% among adult men and about 2% among adult women even according to the lowest diagnosis criteria, and OSAHS presents a serious threat to the life and health of patients.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As for the pathogenesis of OSAHS, it is generally considered that the main cause is that, pharyngeal muscles for maintaining the upper airway open relax during sleep, resulting in soft tissue collapse and obstruction, and the plane of obstruction is usually located in the soft palate, tonsil, and tongue root. Many methods for treating OSAHS exist, which include two types, that is, non-surgical treatment and surgical treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Methods of Non-Surgical Treatment Mainly Include:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">1. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), in which a breathing machine capable of continuously generating a positive pressure air is closely connected with the nose and face of a patient via a nasal mask, so as to prevent collapse and obstruction of the soft tissues of the airway during sleep. Though the method has a good effect, it is difficult for approximately &#x2154; of the patients to adapt to the machine, and they cannot sleep when wearing the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">2. Oral appliance. A device is placed in an oral cavity to move forward the mandible or pull forward the tongue, so as to enlarge the pharyngeal cavity and release the airway obstruction during sleep. The method has many types and produces a certain effect, but most patients cannot adapt to it. The oral appliance leads to irritation and foreign body sensation, causing that the user cannot fall asleep, and may have temporo-mandibular joint injury with long term use.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, International Application PCT/US2005/00139, Jan. 3, 2005, has disclosed a method and a device for relieving upper airway obstructions. The device includes a mouthpiece that is adapted to form a sealed cavity within a human mouth. The patient bites the device during sleep, so as to form the sealed cavity within the oral cavity. A negative pressure generator is connected with the device. For a patient suffering from OSAHS, the device is effective to pull the patient's tongue and/or soft tissues of the upper airway up and away from the posterior pharyngeal wall to reopen the airway.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Chinese Utility Model Patent ZL200620110299.7 has disclosed a tongue forward-moving device for treating OSAHS and snoring. The tongue forward-moving device includes a semi-lunar base, in which a semi-lunar upper-tooth receiving groove formed by front and rear flanges is provided at an upper portion of the base; an arc-shaped rear baffle is provided at a bottom portion of the base, and a tongue anchoring hole running through front and rear edges is provided in the center of the base; and an arc-shaped front baffle is provided at the bottom portion of the base, and a bracket for a lower front dentition is formed between the front and rear baffles. The tongue forward-moving device provides a die for being actively bitten by a patient with upper and lower front dentitions, so that the upper and lower muscles are subconsciously in a relatively tension state during sleep, thereby forming a stable fulcrum between the maxilla and mandible and the tongue forward-moving device. The tongue anchoring hole provides a comfortable anchor station for the apex of tongue, and regulates the tongue between the tongue anchoring hole and the hyoid bone, so as to maintain a smooth airway at the mouth and pharynx, thereby achieving the objective of treating OSAHS and snoring.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Many patents similar to the device disclosed in International Application PCT/US2005/00139, Jan. 3, 2005, and the tongue forward-moving device disclosed in Chinese Utility Model Patent ZL200620110299.7 exist. All the patents use the teeth as a supporting point in the oral cavity, and various appliances are designed to change the tension state or position of the tongue or the soft palate during sleep, so as to achieve the objective of treating OSAHS and snoring. These appliances are placed in the oral cavity and are bitten and fixed before sleep, but since persons continuously change the posture and mouth shape during sleep, the appliances often cannot function effectively. In addition, it is uncomfortable and inconvenient for the patients to use the appliances.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Methods of Surgical Treatment Mainly Include:</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">1. Radiofrequency ablation, which is also referred to as low-temperature plasma radiofrequency ablation, and is a minimally invasive surgical method. An electronic de is penetrated into the soft tissues which cause airway obstruction, such as the soft palate, tonsil, and tongue root, and is electrified to induce tissue coagulation, necrosis, fibrosis, and contraction by heating. The method has a certain therapeutic effect, is effective for a slight case, has a poor long-term efficacy, and is ineffective for serious patients.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">2. Palatopharyngoplasty. Since Fujita improved the Palatopharyngoplasty of Ikematus, a Japanese scholar, into uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) and introduced it to the US in 1981, various improved technologies based on UPPP, including Simmons method, Fairbanks method, Dickson method, Woodson method, Z-palatoplasty (ZPP), uvulopalatal flap (UPF), H-uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (H-UPPP) have been successively reported in literatures, which made a great contribution to symptom alleviation and recovery of OSAHS patients. Countless patients benefit from the surgical treatment solution. However, in terms of long-term effect, since the mucous membrane and soft palate tissue structure are excessively removed, functional muscles are injured, resulting in complications of nasal regurgitation during swallowing, rhinolalia aperta, and nasopharyngeal stenosis and atresia. It is the leading edge and focus for the research and development of OSAHS treatment technologies nowadays to develop a method and corresponding surgical instruments which create a smaller wound or perform surgical treatment in a minimally invasive manner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">3. Soft palate implantation. International Application PCT/US2002/007966, Mar. 14, 2002, has disclosed a braided palatal implant for snoring treatment. In the invention, the implant is embedded in the soft palate to alter the center of gravity of the soft palate when swinging with the air flow and alter the aerodynamic characteristics of the soft palate, so as to increase the critical air flow speed at the soft palate and the pharynx, thereby preventing snoring from occurring. However, the method fails to prevent OSAHS from occurring, for OSAHS occurs when the soft palate collapses and obstructs the upper airway, so that the method and the adopted braided implant cannot be used to treat OSAHS. For serious patients, the risk of OSAHS is increased because the weight at the swinging portion of the soft palate is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Based on the above, though generating a certain effect, the existing technologies and methods for treating OSAHS and snoring still have many defects, and have a poor long-term effect. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method and design a new instrument to treat OSAHS and snoring, in which the new method should create a wound as small as possible, and the new instrument should be safe, effective, simple, and reliable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Research reports and clinical experience indicate that, the relaxation and collapse of the soft palate portion is the main cause of snoring and OSAHS. The following implanted soft palate support for treating OSAHS and snoring is invented in view of the pathogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention provides an implanted soft palate support, which is a flat implant made of a material capable of being implanted into human body for a long term, and includes: a hard palate connecting end having a connecting structure configured to be connected with a hard palate; and a support, being a flat implant capable of being inserted into a soft palate, in which the hard palate connecting end and the support are fixedly connected, or are detachably connected.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In order to make the present invention more comprehensible, the pathogenesis of OSAHS is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional side view of a human head during nasal breathing. When a human is breathing, the soft palate <b>102</b> naturally falls, the epiglottis <b>105</b> opens, and air may enter trachea <b>107</b> via nasal cavity <b>110</b> (or oral cavity <b>111</b>, during mouth breathing).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional side view of a human head during swallowing. When a human is swallowing, the soft palate <b>102</b> moves backwards, and nasopharynx <b>103</b> is blocked. At the same time, the epiglottis <b>105</b> blocks the trachea <b>107</b>, and food enters esophagus <b>106</b> via pharynx.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view depicting occurrence of OSAHS in a patient. When OSAHS occurs in a patient, soft tissues of the upper airway collapse, and the upper airway is obstructed, resulting in insufficient airflow and even apnea. Specifically, when OSAHS occurs, the soft palate <b>102</b> of the patient collapses backwards, so that the passage between soft palate <b>102</b> and nasopharynx <b>103</b> becomes narrow or is blocked, and at the same time soft tissues of the tongue root collapse, and thus, the passage between tongue root <b>114</b> and soft palate <b>102</b> becomes narrow or is blocked, resulting in insufficient airflow during breathing and even apnea. For some OSAHS patients, the collapse of the soft palate <b>102</b> not only directly causes the passage between soft palate <b>102</b> and nasopharynx <b>103</b> narrow or blocked, but also directly causes the passage between tongue root <b>114</b> and soft palate <b>102</b> narrow or blocked, resulting in insufficient airflow during breathing or apnea.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the present invention, the soft palate <b>102</b> is lifted or the tongue root <b>114</b> is indirectly lifted by implanting a soft palate support into the hard palate <b>101</b> and the soft palate <b>102</b>, so as to enlarge the passage between soft palate <b>102</b> and nasopharynx <b>103</b>, thereby achieving the objective of treating OSAHS. Specifically, the implanted soft palate support includes a hard palate connecting end <b>1</b> and a support <b>2</b>. The hard palate connecting end <b>1</b> has a connecting structure <b>11</b> configured to be connected with a hard palate, and the connecting structure <b>11</b> is connected and firmly fixed to a back end of the hard palate <b>101</b> via a fastener <b>116</b>. The support <b>2</b> is a flat implant with a certain supporting force, and the support <b>2</b> is inserted into the soft palate to raise or lift the soft palate, so as to enlarge the passage between soft palate <b>102</b> and nasopharynx <b>103</b>, thereby achieving the objective of treating OSAHS. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. The support <b>2</b> has a thickness of 0.01-5 mm, and most preferably 0.2-1.1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">It should be particularly noted that, one end (the hard palate connecting end <b>1</b>) of the implanted soft palate support of the present invention is fixed to the hard palate, and the other end (the support <b>2</b>) is implanted into a muscular layer of the soft palate. The support <b>2</b> implanted into the muscular layer of the soft palate is a flat implant, which not only provides for the convenience of inserting or implanting the support <b>2</b> into the muscular layer of the soft palate, but more importantly can effectively lift the soft palate, bear and separate the force generated when the soft palate swings. A cutting force generated when the soft palate swings back and forth after the support <b>2</b> is implanted into the soft palate is reduced by increasing the contact area of the support <b>2</b>. Therefore, the cutting force of a non-flat implant (such as a single fine metal wire) generated when the soft palate swings back and forth is avoided. After the support is implanted for a long time, the cutting force generated when the soft palate swings back and forth will cause the non-flat implant (such as a single fine metal wire) to shift in the soft palate, or even to be exposed. When the non-flat implant shifts in the soft palate or is even exposed, the patient will have a strong foreign body sensation, and the support fails to lift the soft palate at the same time. Therefore, it is necessary to use a flat implant as the support <b>2</b>, so as to effectively prevent the support <b>2</b> from shifting after being implanted into the soft palate, and effectively lift the soft palate.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The method and implanted instrument of the present invention for treating OSAHS have the advantages of small wound, fast recovery, and significant effect, thereby realizing an objective of minimally invasive treatment. Since one end (the hard palate connecting end <b>1</b>) of the implanted soft palate support of the present invention is firmly fixed to the hard palate and may act as a force-bearing fulcrum, and the other end, that is, the support <b>2</b> is implanted into the soft palate, the lifting degree of the soft palate being supported may further be adjusted within a certain range by adjusting the shape and degree of curvature of the support <b>2</b>, so as to achieve an optimal treatment effect.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In particular, for the patient implanted with the implanted soft palate support of the present invention, after surgery, when the patient is induced to sleep, the lifting degree of the soft palate being supported may be adjusted within a certain range by adjusting the shape and degree of curvature of the support <b>2</b> under the monitor of an electronic laryngoscope, so as to achieve optimal treatment effect and comfort. Clinical application has proved that, the treatment method and the implanted instrument are popular with patients for treating OSAHS and snoring because of small wound, reliable efficacy, and great comfort.</p>

In addition, the layout and size of the through holes configured on the support are also different from those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the connecting structure of the hard palate connecting end directly adopts the simplest circular through hole structure.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The implanted soft palate support of the present invention may be made of any material capable of being implanted into a pharynx for a long term and having a certain force bearing function. Medical titanium metal and titanium alloys are preferred materials. Among the titanium alloys, a titanium-nickel shape memory alloy (such as the Nitinol alloy) and a titanium-zirconium-niobium alloy are particularly suitable for manufacturing a tail portion of the support <b>2</b> because of superelasticity and shape memory capability thereof, so as to meet the requirement that the tail portion of the support <b>2</b> needs to swing along with the soft palate <b>102</b>; and may be designed into a fixed connecting structure <b>11</b> with a self-locking function because of shape memory characteristics thereof. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the hard palate connecting end is firstly manufactured by using a medical titanium alloy; then, the tail portion of the support is manufactured by using a titanium-nickel shape memory alloy wire and is then thermally set into a shape with a radian matching the curvature of the soft palate of the human body when it relaxes; and finally, a head end of the memory alloy wire is riveted to the hard palate connecting end made of the titanium alloy, thereby obtaining the implanted soft palate support of the present invention having a strong supporting force, good flexibility and good elasticity.</p>

See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36-1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36-2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the elastic module and the rigid module are alternately mounted on the tail portion of the support, so as to provide the tail portion of the support with good flexibility and an excellent restoring force after tensile deformation. The elastic module is made of a flexible polymer material, and the soft palate tissues cannot easily penetrate the elastic module. The elastic module may move within a certain range, and may generate an excellent restoring force. The rigid module is made of a light porous material (such as porous polythene, porous polypropylene, and a titanium metal plate with through holes), so that the soft palate tissues may penetrate and grow on the rigid module, thereby increasing the bonding force between the soft palate tissues and the support. As such, under an external force generated during breathing, the elastic module of the support may generate an excellent restoring force to lift the soft palate tissues growing on and attached to the rigid module, so as to help the soft palate restore to a normal position when the soft palate relaxes, thereby preventing OSAHS and snoring from occurring.</p>

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The feature of this embodiment lies in that, the distal end (also referred to as the tail portion) of the support <b>2</b> at least includes one elastic module <b>20</b>. The elastic module <b>20</b> has good elasticity, while the rigid module <b>40</b> is not readily deformable, but has a rough surface or holes, which facilitates tissue penetration and growth. In the implanted soft palate support of the present invention, the near end of the support <b>2</b> has a good lifting force for the soft palate <b>102</b>, and the tail portion has excellent flexibility and restoring force due to the configuration of the elastic module, which not only maintains the flexibility of the tail of the soft palate <b>102</b>, but also enhances the lifting force of the soft palate for restoring to the relaxed state of the soft palate during breathing, thereby producing a better treatment effect.

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">An Implanted Soft Palate Support of the Present Invention with an Elastic Module of a Spring Structure</heading>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The difference between this embodiment and the eighth embodiment lies in that, in this embodiment, the elastic module <b>20</b> directly adopts a spring structure.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">For example, a coil spring made of an elastic alloy wire may be directly used to manufacture the elastic module <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>). During the manufacturing process, the coil spring is connected to the tail portion of the support <b>2</b>, or between the tail portion of the support <b>2</b> and the rigid module <b>40</b>, or between the rigid modules <b>40</b>. Such a spring structure has good flexibility and restoring force, which not only maintains the flexibility of the tail of the soft palate <b>102</b>, but also enhances the lifting force of the soft palate for restoring to the relaxed state of the soft palate during breathing.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">A spring structure may be formed on the tail portion of the support <b>2</b> by a laser engraving method to serve as the elastic module <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>). The spring structure may have different engraved patterns. The elastic module <b>20</b> formed by the spring structure is wrapped and wound by the soft palate tissues, thereby enhancing the lifting force of the soft palate for restoring to the relaxed state of the soft palate during breathing. In the implanted soft palate support of the present invention with this structure, the near end of the support <b>2</b> has a good lifting force for the soft palate <b>102</b>, and the tail portion has excellent flexibility and restoring force as the spring structure is wrapped and wound by the soft palate tissues, which not only maintains the flexibility of the tail of the soft palate <b>102</b>, but also enhances the lifting force of the soft palate for restoring to the relaxed state of the soft palate during breathing. Therefore, the structure is simpler, and the connection is firm.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In addition, when the support <b>2</b> is made of the Nitinol alloy, a part of the support <b>2</b> close to the hard palate connecting end <b>1</b> may be annealed by local heat treatment and thus become plastically deformable under an external force, with other parts still maintaining superelasticity and shape memory capability. In this way, in the support <b>2</b> manufactured by this process, the near end (the part close to the hard palate connecting end <b>1</b>) is plastically deformable under an external force. Therefore, when the patient is induced to sleep, the lifting degree of the soft palate being supported may be adjusted within a certain range by adjusting the shape and degree of curvature of the implanted soft palate support under the monitor of an electronic laryngoscope, so as to achieve optimal treatment effect and comfort. The distal end of the support <b>2</b> still maintains good flexibility and restoring force, and particularly, the spring structure with complex patterns which is formed by laser engraving is wrapped and wound by the soft palate tissues, thereby enhancing the lifting force of the soft palate for restoring to the relaxed state of the soft palate during breathing.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In addition, surface modification is performed for the support <b>2</b> to improve the biocompatibility of the support <b>2</b>, so as to facilitate penetration and growth of the soft palate tissues. One of the adopted methods is to spray various coatings, in which a biodegradable material may be coated, such as polylactic acid, polylactic acid-polyether copolymer, polycaprolactone, polycaprolactone-polyether block copolymer, polycaprolactone copolymer, polycaprolactone-polyether-polylactide copolymer, poly(glycolide-polylactide)copolymer, glycolide-L-lactide-caprolactone copolymer, polycaprolactone-polylactide-polyglycolide copolymer, and other fatty acid polylactone copolymer, and collagen, chitosan, gelatin, alginate natural polymer material, or a blend thereof; or a non-absorbable material may be coated, such as hydroxyapatite and various biological ceramics. In addition, it is also one of the effective methods to perform surface treatment for titanium and the titanium alloy, for example, plasma spraying is performed for titanium and the titanium alloy, a porous structure is manufactured on the surface, or a coating is manufactured by a magnetron sputtering method.

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The difference between this embodiment and Embodiment 9 lies in that, in this embodiment, the elastic module <b>20</b> is a spring structure coated with a flexible polymer material. During the manufacturing process, the tail portion of the support <b>2</b> is firstly connected with the rigid module <b>40</b> by using a coil spring, and then, the coil spring is coated with a flexible polymer material, so as to prevent tissue penetration and growth towards the inside of the coil spring. The soft palate tissues are driven by the rigid module <b>40</b> connected behind the elastic module <b>20</b>. The rigid module <b>40</b> is made of a light porous material (such as porous polythene, porous polypropylene, and a titanium metal plate with through holes), so that the soft palate tissues may penetrate and grow on the rigid module, thereby increasing the bonding force between the soft palate tissues and the support.

<p id="p-0168" num="0167">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, the elastic module is manufactured by adopting the spring structure coated with the flexible polymer material.

<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The connecting structure <b>11</b> of the hard palate connecting end <b>1</b> has many different design solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The simplest solution is to adopt through holes with different shapes, and the hard palate connecting end is connected with the hard palate <b>101</b> via a fastener <b>116</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Common fasteners <b>116</b> include, but are not limited to, a titanium bone nail, a titanium rivet, a titanium nut bolt structure, a titanium metal male and female engagement fastening structure, and various other fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The number of through holes on the hard palate connecting end <b>1</b> for positioning may be multiple, for example, two, three, or four. In principle, each implanted soft palate support of the present invention may be firmly fixed by using one through hole or two through holes at most.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In a clinical surgery, in order to adjust the lifting degree of the soft palate, the following methods may be adopted. First, the fixed position of the hard palate connecting end <b>1</b> is adjusted. Second, the degree of curvature of the support <b>2</b> is adjusted. Third, the length of the support <b>2</b> inserted into the soft palate <b>102</b> is adjusted. All the three methods can effectively adjust the lifting degree of the soft palate, so as to achieve an optimal treatment effect.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">What is of particular interest is that, after surgery, when the patient is induced to sleep, the lifting degree of the soft palate being supported may be adjusted within a certain range by adjusting the shape and degree of curvature of the implanted soft palate support under the monitor of an electronic laryngoscope, so as to achieve an optimal treatment effect. Clinical application has proved that, the treatment method and the implanted instrument are popular with patients for treating OSAHS and snoring because of small wound, reliable efficacy, and great comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The implanted soft palate support of the present invention may be made of any material capable of being implanted into the human body for a long term and has a certain force bearing function. Medical titanium metal and titanium alloys are preferred materials. Among the titanium alloys, a titanium-nickel shape memory alloy (such as the Nitinol alloy) is particularly suitable for manufacturing a tail portion of the support <b>2</b> because of pseudoelasticity and shape memory capability thereof, so as to meet the requirement that the tail portion of the support <b>2</b> needs to swing along with the soft palate <b>102</b>; and may be designed into a fixed connecting structure <b>11</b> with a self-locking function because of shape memory characteristics thereof. In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the hard palate connecting end <b>1</b> may be made of a titanium-nickel shape memory alloy. In use, the connecting structure <b>11</b> of the hard palate connecting end <b>1</b> contracts in cold water (0&#xb0; C.-15&#xb0; C.), and after being passed through the through hole bored into the hard palate, the connecting structure <b>11</b> of the hard palate connecting end recovers to the geometrical shape set during the thermal setting process under the effect of body temperature, so that the implanted soft palate support of the present invention is firmly fixed to the hard palate.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The support <b>2</b> of the implanted soft palate support of the present invention has one or more through holes <b>21</b> or convex-concave lines or a rough surface <b>22</b>, which may enhance the adhesion between the support <b>2</b> and soft palate tissues. The through holes <b>21</b> may be arranged in many different manners, and the convex-concave lines or rough surface <b>22</b> may also be designed in many ways.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In order to improve the biocompatibility of the implanted soft palate support of the present invention with human tissues, surface treatment may also be performed on the implanted soft palate support to manufacture a coating <b>24</b> capable of improving biocompatibility. One of the adopted methods is to spray various coatings, in which a biodegradable material may be coated, such as polylactic acid, polylactic acid-polyether copolymer, polycaprolactone, polycaprolactone-polyether block copolymer, polycaprolactone copolymer, polycaprolactone-polyether-polylactide copolymer, poly(glycolide-polylactide)copolymer, glycolide-L-lactide-caprolactone copolymer, polycaprolactone-polylactide-polyglycolide copolymer, and other fatty acid polylactone copolymer, and collagen, chitosan, gelatin, alginate natural polymer material, or a blend thereof; or a non-absorbable material may be coated, such as hydroxyapatite and various biological ceramics. In addition, it is also one of the effective methods to perform surface treatment for titanium and the titanium alloy, for example, plasma spraying is performed for titanium and the titanium alloy, a porous structure is manufactured on the surface, or a coating is manufactured by a magnetron sputtering method.

<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In order to increase the contact area of an edge of the implanted soft palate support of the present invention, and achieve an objective of blunting the edge, the edge of the support <b>2</b> may be wrapped with a thread (such as a titanium-nickel shape memory alloy wire, a polyester thread, a polyurethane thread, and other polymer material threads). As such, not only the edge effect of the support <b>2</b> is improved, the contact area of the edge is increased, and the objective of blunting the edge is achieved, but also the degree of curvature of the support <b>2</b> may be adjusted, and the support <b>2</b> has good flexibility.

The degree of curvature of the support <b>2</b> may be adjusted by bending the support <b>2</b> to enable the support <b>2</b> to plastically deform, so as to control and adjust the lifting degree of the soft palate <b>102</b>. This embodiment may be made of titanium metal, and more particularly may be made of a titanium-nickel shape memory alloy (Nitinol alloy). A required geometrical shape of a product above a recovery temperature is set according to shape memory characteristics of a shape memory alloy (usually a memory alloy with a recovery temperature between 20&#xb0; C. and 33&#xb0; C.).
