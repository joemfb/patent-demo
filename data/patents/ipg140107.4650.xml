<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to scanning electron beam scanners and more particularly to a method and apparatus for electron beam scanning.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional scanning electron beam scanners, such as those used in computed tomography (CT) imaging systems, produce cross-sectional and three-dimensional (3D) images of the human body and objects such as baggage and cargo. The conventional scanning electron beam scanner includes a radiation source that is axially aligned with both a target and a detector. During operation, the radiation source emits radiation that impinges on the target. In response to this impingement, the target generates x-rays that are directed through the patient or object to the detector.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, conventional radiation therapy devices are often used to generate a high energy beam. The generated beam is typically axially aligned with the patient to receive the radiation treatment. More specifically, the conventional radiation therapy device includes a gantry which can be swiveled around a horizontal axis of rotation in the course of a therapeutic treatment. A treatment head (&#x201c;collimator&#x201d;) can be set at any angle (rotation on the z axis) of gantry directs a radiation beam along an axis toward a patient. The radiation beam is typically generated by a linear accelerator positioned within gantry. The radiation beam is trained on a treatment zone of the patient. The treatment zone is an area which includes the tumor for example to be treated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be desirable to incorporate a conventional electron beam scanner into a system having a radiation therapy source. However, since the conventional therapy source is axially aligned with the treatment area, and the radiation source used in the conventional scanning electron beam scanner is axially aligned with both the target and the detector, the conventional scanning electron beam scanner cannot easily be incorporated into a conventional radiation therapy system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, a radiation therapy and scanning system is provided. The radiation and therapy scanning system includes a therapy source adapted to deliver a predetermined dose of treatment radiation along an axis to a patient positioned in a scan field, a stationary scanning source producing an electron beam, and a detector positioned to partially circumscribe the scan field. The radiation therapy and scanning system also includes a target arranged concentric with the detector and located opposite the detector across the scan field, the target positioned at an angle &#x3b8; to the axis such that when the electron beam impinges on the target the target transmits radiation through the scan field to the detector.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, a detector for an electron beam scanner is provided. The detector includes a substrate having a first side and a second opposing side, a pixel array formed on the substrate first side, and an x-ray shield formed on the substrate opposing side.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further aspect, a detector for an electron beam scanner is provided. The detector includes a detector positioned to partially circumscribe a scan field, the detector divided into a pair of detector rings arranged adjacent to one another and separated by a gap extending at least partially about a circumference of the detector, and an x-ray shield extending at least partially through the gap.</p>

In the exemplary embodiment, the therapy and scanning system <b>8</b> includes a gantry <b>110</b> which can be swiveled around a horizontal axis of rotation <b>110</b> in the course of a therapeutic treatment. A treatment head <b>112</b> directs a radiation beam <b>113</b> along axis <b>114</b> toward a patient (not shown). The radiation beam <b>113</b> is generated by a linear accelerator positioned within gantry <b>110</b>. The radiation beam <b>113</b> may be a form of high energy radiation. The radiation beam <b>113</b> is trained on a treatment zone of the patient. The treatment zone is an area which includes the area to be treated such as a tumor for example. To facilitate aligning the treatment head <b>112</b> onto the treatment zone, the scanning and therapy system also includes a therapy source positioning system that is adapted to provide a signal to facilitate locating the therapy beam on the treatment zone.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">During operation, the outputs from the two x-ray detectors <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> are used to triangulate the position of the therapy source <b>112</b>. More specifically, to ensure that the therapy source is properly aligned with the lesion, etc. that is to be radiated, the combination of the radiation sources <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> and the detectors <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> are used to accurately position the therapy source <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b>, the therapy source <b>112</b>, the radiation sources <b>120</b> and <b>124</b>, and the detectors <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> are all positioned at the same axial location along the Z axis.</p>

The electron beam scanner <b>10</b> also includes a detector <b>16</b> that is positioned to partially circumscribe a scan field <b>18</b>. The electron beam scanner <b>10</b> includes the electron gun <b>12</b> and also includes a target <b>20</b> that is arranged concentric with the detector <b>16</b> and located opposite the detector <b>16</b> across the scan field <b>18</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the electron beam scanner <b>10</b> also includes a second electron gun <b>22</b> producing a second electron beam <b>24</b>, and a second target <b>26</b> that is arranged concentric with the detector <b>16</b> and located opposite the detector <b>16</b> across the scan field <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b>, in the exemplary embodiment, the detector <b>16</b> is offset from the Z-axis by an angle &#x3b8;. More specifically, as discussed above, the angle &#x3b8; is sufficient to enable the radiation sources used in the scanning electron beam scanner <b>10</b> to be aligned with both the targets and the detectors while still maintaining the axial alignment of the radiation sources <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> with both the detectors <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> and the therapy source <b>112</b> used in the therapy portion of the system <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a simplified schematic diagram illustrating the physical relationship between the detector <b>16</b>, the target <b>20</b>, and the target <b>26</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a cross-section of the detector <b>16</b>, target <b>20</b>, and target <b>26</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.

In one embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a diameter D<b>1</b> of the target <b>20</b> is greater than a diameter D<b>2</b> of the second target <b>26</b>. Increasing the diameter of the second target <b>26</b> enables the electron beam <b>24</b> emitted from the second stationary source <b>22</b> to impinge on the second target <b>26</b> without contacting the first target <b>20</b>. Optionally, the diameter of the target <b>20</b> may be less than the diameter of the second target <b>26</b> such that the electron beam <b>14</b> emitted from the stationary source <b>12</b> does not impinge on the second target <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view of a portion of the electron beam scanner <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> taken along lines <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the target <b>20</b> is positioned alongside and approximately parallel to target <b>26</b> along the Z-axis. In the exemplary embodiment, the detector <b>16</b> is divided into a pair of detector rings <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> that arranged adjacent to one another and separated by a gap <b>34</b> extending at least partially about a circumference of the detector <b>16</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, each of the targets <b>20</b> and <b>26</b> are radially aligned with the gap <b>34</b> that is defined between the detector rings <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, such that when the electron beams, <b>14</b> and <b>24</b> respectively, impinge on their respective target <b>20</b> and <b>26</b>, each target <b>20</b> and <b>26</b> transmits radiation through the gap <b>34</b> across the scan field <b>18</b> to an associated section of the detector, e.g. <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the detector <b>16</b> includes a first end <b>36</b> and a second end <b>38</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the gap <b>34</b> extends from the first end <b>36</b> at least partially towards the detector second end <b>38</b>. Moreover, the gap <b>34</b> extends from the second end <b>38</b> at least partially towards the first end <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As discussed above, the first and second targets <b>20</b> and <b>26</b> have end portions <b>28</b> that circumferentially overlap the detector <b>16</b> and are radially aligned with the gap <b>34</b> between the detector rings <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> such that when the electron beams <b>14</b> and <b>24</b> produced by the first and second stationary sources, <b>12</b> and <b>22</b>, impinge on their respective targets, <b>20</b> and <b>26</b>, the first and second targets <b>20</b> and <b>26</b> each transmit radiation through the gap <b>34</b>, across the scan field <b>28</b>, to an associated section of the detector.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary radiation pattern produced by the electron beam scanner <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a portion of the beam pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the exemplary embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, each stationary source <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> may be embodied as an electron gun. A conventional electron gun produces an electron beam inside a highly evacuated chamber. The electron beam produced by the electron gun is transmitted to a target wherein the electron beam impinges on a target. The electron beam impinging on a tungsten target for example causes radiation to be emitted from the target. Since the electron gun produces a single electron beam, this electron beam is typically rastered along a surface of the target to produce x-rays. In the exemplary embodiment, a cone-shaped field of x-rays is produced by the single electron beam. This cone-shaped field of x-rays is then transmitted through an object to be imaged, to a detector, wherein a resultant image may be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, in the exemplary embodiment, during operation the source <b>12</b> transmits a single electron beam <b>14</b> that impinges on the target <b>20</b> or <b>26</b>. It should be realized that numerous electron beams <b>14</b> are illustrated to reflect the raster pattern that produced by the single source <b>12</b> on the target <b>20</b> or <b>26</b>. The target <b>20</b> or <b>26</b> emits a fan or cone-shaped field of x-rays <b>40</b> that are transmitted through the gap <b>34</b>, across the scan field <b>28</b>, to the detector ring <b>30</b> or <b>32</b>. Moreover, the second stationary source <b>22</b> transmits a second electron beam <b>24</b> that impinges on the second targets <b>20</b> or <b>26</b>. Again, the target <b>20</b> or <b>26</b> emits a cone-shaped field of x-rays <b>42</b> that are transmitted through the gap <b>34</b>, across the scan field <b>28</b>, to the detector ring <b>30</b> or <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a simplified schematic illustration of a portion of the electron beam scanner <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As discussed above, the source <b>12</b> transmits a single electron beam <b>14</b> that impinges on the target <b>20</b>. The target <b>20</b> then emits a fan-shaped field of x-rays <b>40</b> that are transmitted through the gap <b>34</b>. Moreover, the source <b>22</b> transmits a single electron beam <b>24</b> that impinges on the target the target <b>26</b>. The target <b>26</b> then emits a fan-shaped field of x-rays <b>42</b> that are transmitted through the gap <b>34</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, target <b>20</b> is disposed and an angle &#x3b8; with respect to the detector <b>16</b> and target <b>26</b> is disposed at an angle &#x3a6; with respect to the detector <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, the angle &#x3b8; is equal to the angle &#x3a6;. Optionally, the angle &#x3b8; is different than the angle &#x3a6;. In the exemplary embodiment, the angle &#x3b8; and the angle &#x3a6; are approximately thirty-six degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the exemplary embodiment, both the angle &#x3b8; and the angle &#x3a6; are preselected based on the geometry of the desired electron beam scanner <b>10</b>. More specifically, the angle &#x3b8; and the angle &#x3a6; are based on at least the width (W) of each detector ring <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, the distance (D) between the opposing portions of the same detector ring, the width <b>44</b> of the gap <b>34</b>, and the distance between each respective target <b>20</b> and <b>26</b> and the detector <b>16</b>. For example, if either of angles &#x3b8; or &#x3a6; are increased to greater than thirty-six degrees to enable the electron beam scanner <b>10</b> to be assembled in a more compact arrangement, the distance <b>46</b> defined between the targets <b>20</b> or <b>26</b> is decreased. In the exemplary embodiment, the above parameters are selected such that the width of each field of x-rays <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> when impinging on a respective detector ring <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> is substantially the same as the width (W) of the detector ring itself. As such, if the width of either detector ring <b>30</b> or <b>32</b> is increased or increased, the width <b>44</b> of the gap <b>34</b> may be narrowed or widened to define a narrow or wider field of x-rays. Optionally, the distance <b>46</b> between the target <b>20</b> or <b>26</b> may be increased or decreased such that the resultant field of x-rays is narrower or wider when impinging on the detector rings <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the gap <b>34</b> defined between the detector ring <b>30</b> and the detector ring <b>32</b> enables the field of x-rays <b>40</b> to overlap the field of x-rays <b>42</b> in the scan field <b>18</b>. This overlap produces a diamond-shaped area (h) that is not imaged. In the exemplary embodiment, the area (h) is between 0 and approximately two millimeters in width. To improve image quality the area (h) is made to be very small, e.g. between approximately 0 millimeters and approximately 2 millimeters. In one exemplary embodiment, to reduce the area (h) and thus further improve image quality, a thickness (c) of an x-ray shield <b>50</b> is reduced. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and discussed in more detail below, the detector ring <b>30</b> is separated from the detector ring <b>32</b> by a distance (S). Moreover, the detector <b>16</b> also includes an x-ray shield <b>50</b> that is coupled to the detector <b>16</b> and extends at least partially through the gap <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the area (h) is directly related to the thickness (c) of the x-ray shield <b>50</b>. Accordingly, the area (h) may be reduced by reducing the thickness (c) of the x-ray shield <b>50</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the thickness (c) is greater than 0 millimeters and less than approximately 2 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the detector <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the exemplary embodiment, the electron beam scanner <b>10</b> also includes a collimator <b>52</b> that is positioned between the targets <b>20</b> and <b>26</b> and the detector <b>16</b>. During operation, the collimator <b>52</b> is adapted to narrow the field of x-rays <b>40</b> and/or <b>42</b> to focus the field of x-rays <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> through the gap <b>34</b>. More specifically, the collimator <b>52</b> is adapted to narrow the spatial cross-section of the field of x-rays <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> and to align the field of x-rays <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> with the gap <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As discussed above, the detector <b>16</b> includes the detector ring <b>30</b> that is separated from the detector ring <b>30</b> by a gap <b>34</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the detector <b>16</b> is adapted for detecting x-rays emitted from the targets <b>20</b> and <b>26</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the detector <b>16</b> includes a substrate <b>60</b> and a pixel array <b>62</b> (sometimes referred to as a photosensor array) disposed on the substrate <b>60</b>. The pixel array <b>62</b> includes a data acquisition electronics layer <b>64</b> and a plurality of photodiodes <b>66</b> arranged in rows and columns. The data acquisition electronics layer <b>64</b> includes a capacitor (not shown) and a switching device, such as a thin film transistor TFT (not shown). Each respective photodiode <b>66</b> is electrically coupled to a respective capacitor and switching device. The switching devices selectively couple a respective capacitor and photodiode to a respective data line (not shown). The detector <b>16</b> also includes a plurality of scan lines (not shown) for addressing a plurality of individual pixels. The detector <b>16</b> also includes a scintillator medium <b>68</b> disposed on the pixel array <b>64</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the scintillator medium <b>68</b> includes a plurality of scintillators <b>70</b>, wherein a single scintillator <b>70</b> is disposed on each respective photodiode <b>66</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the detector <b>16</b> provides approximately 18 centimeters of coverage along the Z axis. More specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, each detector ring <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, includes a pixel array <b>62</b> having two rows of photodiodes <b>66</b> arranged in twenty-four columns. Moreover, each photodiode <b>66</b> is approximately 2 millimeters&#xd7;3 millimeters. Accordingly, the total detector area is 48*(2 mm*3.5 mm)=18 centimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">During operation, x-rays emitted from the targets <b>20</b> and <b>26</b> are absorbed in the scintillators <b>70</b>. Each scintillator <b>70</b> then generates optical photons which in turn pass into a photosensor, such as the photodiode <b>66</b>. The photon is absorbed in the photosensor and an electrical signal corresponding to an incident photon flux is generated. The electrical signal is then transmitted, via the data lines, to a computer to generate an image of the scanned object.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the exemplary embodiment, the detector <b>16</b> also includes the x-ray shield <b>50</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the x-ray shield <b>50</b> extends along the length of the detector <b>16</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the x-ray shield <b>50</b> is fabricated using a material that inhibits x-rays from passing through the material. For example, the x-ray shield may be fabricated using a lead material. The x-ray shield <b>50</b> includes a first shield portion <b>72</b> that extends along a length of the detector <b>16</b>. The x-ray shield <b>50</b> also includes a second shield portion <b>74</b> that is perpendicular to the first shield portion <b>72</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the second shield portion <b>72</b> is adapted to be received within the gap <b>34</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the second shield portion <b>74</b> has an outer diameter or width that is approximately equal to the width (S) of the gap <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As discussed above, the thickness (c) of the second shield portion <b>74</b> may be either increased or decreased based on the geometry of the electron beam scanner. In the exemplary embodiment, a thickness <b>76</b> of the first shield portion <b>72</b> is selected based on the power of the x-rays being transmitted through the detector <b>16</b>. During operation, the shield <b>50</b> is adapted to restrict x-rays from contacting any portion of the detector <b>16</b> with the exception of the scintillator medium <b>68</b>. The shield <b>50</b> therefore protects the electronic components within the detector <b>16</b> from undesirable effects that may be introduced from the exposure to x-rays other than through the scintillator medium <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the detector <b>16</b> may have a variable thickness. More specifically, a portion of the detector <b>16</b> may have the first thickness (T) and a second portion of the detector <b>16</b> may have a second thickness (T<b>1</b>). In the exemplary embodiment T&#x3c;T<b>1</b> to enable the width and or length of the gap <b>34</b> to be reduced. As discussed above, reducing the size of the gap <b>34</b> further improves image quality by reducing the size of the area (h) that is not imaged.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graphical illustration of an exemplary incident angle <b>80</b> of at least one of the electron beams <b>14</b> or <b>24</b> impinging on a respective target <b>20</b> or <b>26</b>. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the incident angle <b>80</b> of the electron beam <b>20</b> or <b>26</b> with respect to the normal vector of either the target <b>20</b> or target <b>26</b>. During operation when the electron beam impinges on the target, the electron beam does not impinge on the target transversely. In the exemplary embodiment, the incident angle <b>80</b> of the electron beam causes an electron beam having an oval-shaped cross-sectional profile to impinge on the target. For example, if the incident angle <b>80</b> is greater than 60 degrees, since the incident angle <b>80</b> is defined as 1/cos 60 degrees=&#xbd;, the radius of the electron beam increases by a factor of 2. To maintain the radius of the electron beam to be as small as possible, in the exemplary embodiment, the incident angle <b>80</b> is less than 60 degrees. In the exemplary embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the incident angle <b>80</b> of the electron beam on a respective target is between approximately 52 and 58 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a graphical illustration of the umbra produced by an exemplary x-ray radiation impinging on an exemplary detector during operation. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the umbra formed on the detector <b>16</b> by the x-ray <b>40</b>. The umbra is located approximately centrally on the detector <b>16</b>. Moreover, the penumbras extend radially outward from the umbra on each side of the umbra. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> therefore illustrates that the alignment of the detector with respect to the targets <b>20</b> and <b>26</b>, and the detector rings <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> produce an umbra and penumbra that is sufficient to produce acceptable images during operation.</p>
