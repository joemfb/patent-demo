<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Application No. 10-2009-0020861, filed Mar. 11, 2009, in Korea, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments relate to a rechargeable battery.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A high-capacity rechargeable battery may be used as a power supply for driving motors in hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, and the like. The high-capacity rechargeable battery may include a plurality of rechargeable batteries forming unit cells that are electrically connected to each other, e.g., in series.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The rechargeable battery of the unit cell may include an electrode assembly formed of a positive electrode and a negative electrode with a separator therebetween. The rechargeable battery may further include an electrode terminal electrically connected to the electrode assembly and protruding outside a battery case that surrounds the electrode assembly. The electrode terminal may protrude through a terminal hole in a cap plate of the rechargeable battery.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the related art and is not an admission of prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments are directed to a rechargeable battery, which substantially overcome one or more problems arising from limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore a feature of an embodiment to provide a battery including one or more structures engaging with one another and offset from a central line of an electrode terminal so as to reduce or eliminate relative rotation of the one or more structures and the electrode terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">At least one of the above and other features and advantages may be realized by providing a battery, including a case housing an electrode assembly, the case having an opening for receiving the electrode assembly, a cap plate combined with the opening so as to close the case, a first insulator on an outer surface of the cap plate, an electrode terminal electrically connected to the electrode assembly, the electrode terminal extending through a first terminal hole in the cap plate and a second terminal hole in the first insulator, a first connection portion that mates the cap plate to the first insulator so as to oppose rotation of the first insulator relative to the cap plate, the first connection portion being eccentric with respect to a central line of the first terminal hole, wherein the central line of the first terminal hole is axial to the first terminal hole and extends perpendicular to a plane of the first terminal hole, and a second connection portion that mates the first insulator to the electrode terminal so as to oppose rotation of the electrode terminal relative to the first insulator, the second connection portion being eccentric with respect to the central line of the first terminal hole.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first connection portion may include a first protrusion that protrudes from the outer surface of the cap plate, and a first groove formed concavely on a facing surface of the first insulator in a location corresponding to the first protrusion, the first groove mating to the first protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first protrusion may be between the first terminal hole and one end of the cap plate in the length direction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The second connection portion may include a first polygonal groove in the first insulator, the first polygonal groove having a polygon shape that encompasses an area that extends beyond the second terminal hole, and a protrusion portion of the electrode terminal, the protrusion portion of the electrode terminal having a shape mating with the first polygonal groove.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first polygonal groove and the protrusion may be offset to one end of the cap plate in the length direction so as to be eccentric with respect to the central line of the second terminal hole of the first insulator, and the first polygonal groove may have a rectangular shape.</p>

The uncoated regions <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be connected to respective electrode terminals <b>40</b> through respective current collecting members <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The case <b>20</b> may form the whole outer shell of the rechargeable battery <b>100</b>, and may be made of a conductive metal, such as aluminum, an aluminum alloy, or nickel-plated steel. The case <b>20</b> may form a space for incorporating the electrode assembly <b>10</b>, and may be made in a rectangular shape of a hexahedron, as shown, or another suitable shape.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The cap plate <b>30</b> may be made of a thin plate material, and may close and seal the opening in the case <b>20</b>. The cap plate <b>30</b> may be combined with the case <b>20</b> so as to close the opening formed on one side of the case <b>20</b>. The cap plate <b>30</b> may have an electrolyte injection opening provided for injecting an electrolyte solution into the closed and sealed inner portion of the case <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exploded view of a connection portion of the cap plate, and the electrode terminal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, from the perspective of one looking down, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exploded view of the connection portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, from the perspective of one looking up. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, the rechargeable battery <b>100</b> according to the first example embodiment may include a first insulator <b>70</b> placed on the outer surface of the cap plate <b>30</b>, and a second insulator <b>80</b> placed on the inner surface of the cap plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The rechargeable battery <b>100</b> may have a first connection portion <b>31</b> including a first protrusion <b>311</b> forming part of the cap plate <b>30</b> and a first groove <b>312</b> in the first insulator <b>70</b>. The first connection portion <b>31</b> may be provided between the cap plate <b>30</b> and the first insulator <b>70</b> so as to positively engage the cap plate <b>30</b> and the first insulator <b>70</b>. The rechargeable battery <b>100</b> may also have a second connection portion <b>32</b> including a protrusion <b>322</b> forming part of the electrode terminal <b>40</b> and a matching first polygonal groove <b>321</b> in the first insulator <b>70</b>. The second connection portion <b>32</b> may be provided between the first insulator <b>70</b> and the electrode terminal <b>40</b> so as to positively engage the first insulator <b>70</b> and the electrode terminal <b>40</b>. The rechargeable battery <b>100</b> may also have a third connection portion <b>33</b> including a second protrusion <b>331</b> forming part of the second insulator <b>80</b> and a matching second groove <b>332</b> in the cap plate <b>30</b>. The third connection portion <b>33</b> may be provided between the cap plate <b>30</b> and the second insulator <b>80</b> so as to positively engage the cap plate <b>30</b> and the second insulator <b>80</b>. The rechargeable battery <b>100</b> may also have a fourth connection portion <b>34</b> including a polygonal plate <b>342</b> forming part of the current collecting member <b>60</b> and a matching second polygonal groove <b>341</b> in the second insulator <b>80</b>. The fourth connection portion <b>34</b> may be provided between the second insulator <b>80</b> and the current collecting member <b>60</b> so as to positively engage the second insulator <b>80</b> and the current collecting member <b>60</b>. Each of the first, second, third, and fourth connection portions may be composed of opposed mating surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> provides a structure in which the first and second insulators <b>70</b> and <b>80</b> and the first, second, third, and fourth connection portions <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, and <b>34</b> are all included. However, in an implementation, the first insulator <b>70</b> may be used to form the insulating structure between the electrode terminal <b>40</b> and the cap plate <b>30</b>, and the second insulator <b>80</b> may not be used (not shown). Further, in another implementation, the electrode terminal <b>40</b> may be stably connected to the current collecting member <b>60</b> without using the second insulator <b>80</b>, in which case the third and fourth connection portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> may not be used (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the electrode terminal <b>40</b> may be installed at the first terminal hole <b>41</b> of the cap plate <b>30</b>. A second terminal hole <b>42</b> may be formed at the first insulator <b>70</b>, a third terminal hole <b>43</b> may be formed at the second insulator <b>80</b>, and a fourth terminal hole <b>44</b> may be formed at the current collecting member <b>60</b>. The second, third, and fourth terminal holes <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, and <b>44</b> may be aligned with the first terminal hole <b>41</b> along a central line (CL, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that extends in the length direction of the externally-protruding portion of the electrode terminal <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A gasket <b>53</b> may be interposed between first, second, and third terminal holes <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b>, and the electrode terminal <b>40</b>. The gasket <b>53</b> may seal the coupling portion of the electrode terminal <b>40</b> to the cap plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first connection portion <b>31</b> may be formed between the cap plate <b>30</b> and the first insulator <b>70</b> thereby combining them. The first connection portion may be eccentrically positioned, i.e., offset to one side, with respect to the center of the first and second terminal holes <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> coinciding with the central line CL of the electrode terminal <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the structure described above, the central line CL of the electrode terminal <b>40</b>, which may receive the torque of a nut (not shown) when an electrical wire is connected to the terminal <b>40</b>, may be separated from the first connection portion <b>31</b> when assembling the rechargeable battery <b>100</b> such that the first insulator <b>70</b> maintains the state in which the first insulator <b>70</b> is fixed at the outside surface of the cap plate <b>40</b>. Thus, to fix the first insulator <b>70</b> at the outside surface of the cap plate <b>40</b> without rotation, the first connection portion <b>31</b> may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A flange <b>35</b> may protrude around the external circumference of the cap plate <b>30</b>. The first insulator <b>70</b> may have a facing surface of which at least one side surface is supported by the flange <b>35</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first insulator <b>70</b> may be formed with a polygonal plate shape that corresponds to and is shaped to match the flange <b>35</b> along three edges of the insulator <b>70</b> (where the fourth side faces the middle of the cap plate <b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first protrusion <b>311</b> of the first connection portion <b>31</b> may protrude outside at the outer surface of the cap plate <b>30</b>, and the first groove <b>312</b> concavely formed on the facing surface of the first insulator <b>70</b> may engage with the first protrusion <b>311</b>. The first protrusion <b>311</b> and the first groove <b>312</b> may be disposed between the end of the cap plate <b>30</b> in the length direction and the first and second terminal holes <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With the first insulator <b>70</b> placed on the outer surface of the cap plate <b>30</b>, the first protrusion <b>311</b> and the first groove <b>312</b> may be combined with each other at a position eccentric to, i.e., offset from, the central line CL of the first and second terminal holes <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. Thus, rotation of the first insulator <b>70</b>, effected by torque transmitted to the first insulator <b>70</b> through rotation of a binding nut around the central line CL of the electrode terminal <b>40</b>, may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With the second connection portion <b>32</b> placed between the first insulator <b>70</b> and the electrode terminal <b>40</b>, the first insulator <b>70</b> and the electrode terminal <b>40</b> may be connecting to each other.

In an implementation, the protrusion <b>322</b> and the corresponding first polygonal groove <b>321</b> may each be made as a rectangle.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With the electrode terminal <b>40</b> inserted into the first insulator <b>70</b>, the protrusion <b>322</b> of the electrode terminal <b>40</b> and the first polygonal groove <b>321</b> of the first insulator <b>70</b> may be combined to each other at a position spaced apart from the central line CL of the second terminal hole <b>42</b>, such that rotation of the electrode terminal <b>40</b> may be prevented against the torque transmitted to the electrode terminal <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The third connection portion <b>33</b> may be formed between the cap plate <b>40</b> and the second insulator <b>80</b>, thereby combining them to each other, and may be eccentric to the one side with respect to the center of the first and third terminal holes <b>41</b> and <b>43</b> corresponding to the central line CL of the electrode terminal <b>40</b>.</p>

The second protrusion <b>331</b> and the second groove <b>332</b> may be formed between one end of the cap plate <b>30</b> in the length direction and the third and fourth terminal holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>. The second protrusion <b>331</b> and the second groove <b>332</b> may be placed on a same side of the central line CL as the extending direction of the first polygonal groove <b>321</b> and the protrusion <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">With the second insulator <b>80</b> placed in the inner surface of the cap plate <b>30</b>, the second protrusion <b>331</b> and the second groove <b>332</b> may be combined at a position spaced from the central line CL of the third and fourth terminal holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>, such that rotation of the second insulator <b>80</b> may be prevented against the torque transmitted to the second insulator <b>80</b> through the electrode terminal <b>40</b>.</p>

The second polygonal groove <b>341</b> and the polygonal plate <b>342</b> may extend from the central line CL in a direction of the second protrusion <b>331</b> and the second groove <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With the polygonal plate <b>342</b> of the current collecting member <b>60</b> disposed on the outer surface of the second insulator <b>80</b>, the second polygonal groove <b>341</b> and the polygonal plate <b>342</b> may be combined to each other at a position spaced from, i.e., eccentric to, the central line CL of the third and fourth terminal holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>, such that the rotation of the second insulator <b>80</b> and the current collecting member <b>60</b> may be prevented against the torque transmitted to the second insulator <b>80</b> and the current collecting member <b>60</b> through the electrode terminal <b>40</b>.</p>

Increasing the number of the first, second, third, and fourth connection portions <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, and <b>34</b> that are formed offset from the central line CL may help prevent rotation of the electrode terminal <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, a rechargeable battery may include one or more structures engaging with one another and offset from a central line of a binding portion, e.g., a threaded stud, of an electrode terminal, which may help prevent rotation of the electrode terminal when torque is applied thereto, e.g., during tightening of a fastener such as a nut that clamps a wire. Thus, embodiments may be suitable for large, high-current batteries, automated assembly procedures, etc., whereby torque is applied to the electrode terminals of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, as described above, the rechargeable battery may have electrically insulating structures that are configured to minimize the likelihood of insulation failure and attendant short circuits. In contrast, coupling an electrode terminal to a cap plate with a caulking method, whereby an insulating resin is coated between the cap plate and the electrode terminal, may be subject to damage and electrical breakdown as a result of torque applied to the electrode terminal. Further, as compared to the use of an insulating resin, the rechargeable battery according to the above-described embodiments may be less expensive to manufacture.</p>

Accordingly, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth in the following claims.</p>
