<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2007-0125040, filed on Dec. 4, 2007, and all the benefits accruing therefrom under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119, the contents of which in its entirety are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a light source assembly, a liquid crystal display (&#x201c;LCD&#x201d;) having the light source assembly, and a method of driving the light source assembly, and more particularly, to a light source assembly, an LCD having the light source assembly, and a method of driving the light source assembly, in which a reproducible color space is expanded to represent colors which more accurately represent natural colors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As society becomes more dependent on sophisticated information and communication technology, market needs for larger and thinner displays increase. In particular, conventional cathode ray tubes (&#x201c;CRTs&#x201d;) fail to fully satisfy the market needs, and demand for flat panel displays (&#x201c;FPDs&#x201d;) such as plasma display panels (&#x201c;PDPs&#x201d;), plasma address liquid crystal (&#x201c;PALC&#x201d;) display panels, liquid crystal displays (&#x201c;LCDs&#x201d;), and organic light emitting diodes (&#x201c;OLEDs&#x201d;), for example, is therefore rapidly increasing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, standard monitors set a color space of a standard red, green and blue (&#x201c;sRGB&#x201d;) standard as a standard color space for the standard monitor. However, only a limited number of colors can be represented in the color space of the sRGB standard. Thus, standard monitors which set the sRGB standard cannot represent colors outside a range of colors of the sRGB color space. In addition, devices such as digital cameras, for example, have recently been improved such that they capture colors outside the range of colors of the sRGB color space. However, if an image captured by such a digital camera, for example, is displayed on a standard monitor which utilizes the sRGB standard, colors captured by the digital camera cannot be accurately represented. Thus, a monitor having a color space including a wider range of colors than the sRGB color space, such as an ADOBE&#xae; RGB color space, is required.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A liquid crystal display (&#x201c;LCD&#x201d;) according to an exemplary embodiment which includes a wide color gamut wherein both a color filter and a light source represent a color space.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The LCD according to an exemplary embodiment further includes real time corrections of the properties of the light source or the color filter. As a result, the LCD, including a light source assembly, includes a reproducible color space and represents colors more accurately to those which exist in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A light source assembly according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a light source which emits light; a detector which detects the light and generates a light signal based on a property of the light source; an operator operably connected to the detector and which receives the light signal and calculates a color coordinate of the light source based on the light signal; a comparator operably connected to the operator and which compares the color coordinate of the light source to a predetermined reference color coordinate; and a control unit operably connected to the comparator and which controls a pulse width modulation (&#x201c;PWM&#x201d;) signal transmitted to the light source based on a result of the comparison of the comparator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to alternative exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an LCD includes a color filter and a light source assembly disposed on the color filter. The color filter includes a red filter, a green filter and a blue filter. The light source assembly includes: a red light source which emits red light having a wavelength with a main peak in a range of approximately 620 nm to approximately 630 nm and a spectrum having a full width at half maximum of less than approximately 15 nm; a green light source which emits green light having a wavelength with a main peak in a range of approximately 525 nm to approximately 535 nm and a spectrum with a full width at half maximum of less than approximately 30 nm; and a blue light source which emits blue light having a wavelength with a main peak in a range of approximately 445 nm to approximately 455 nm and a spectrum with a full width at half maximum of less than approximately 19 nm. The light source assembly mixes the red light, the green light and the blue light to generate white light and outputs the white light to the color filter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another alternative exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a method of driving a light source assembly includes detecting light emitted from a light sources with a detector and generating a light signal based on a property of the light with the detector, receiving the light signal with an operator and calculating a color coordinates of the light sources with the operator, comparing the color coordinates of the light sources to a predetermined reference color coordinates using a comparator, and controlling a pulse width modulation PWM signal transmitted to the light sources with a controller based on the comparison result.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. The present invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It will be understood that although the terms &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; &#x201c;third&#x201d; etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; or &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, components and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, relative terms, such as &#x201c;lower&#x201d; or &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper&#x201d; or &#x201c;top&#x201d; may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the &#x201c;lower&#x201d; side of other elements would then be oriented on the &#x201c;upper&#x201d; side of the other elements. The exemplary term &#x201c;lower&#x201d; can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of &#x201c;lower&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; depending upon the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures were turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements. The exemplary terms &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning which is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure, and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations which are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes which result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or described as flat may, typically, have rough and/or nonlinear features. Moreover, sharp angles which are illustrated may be rounded. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereinafter, a liquid crystal display (&#x201c;LCD&#x201d;) according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exploded perspective view of an LCD <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view illustrating a color filter and a light source assembly <b>100</b> included in the LCD <b>1</b> according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the LCD <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment includes a liquid crystal panel assembly <b>30</b>, an upper case <b>20</b>, and a backlight assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The liquid crystal panel assembly <b>30</b> includes a liquid crystal panel <b>31</b>, which includes a thin-film transistor (&#x201c;TFT&#x201d;) display substrate <b>32</b>, a common electrode display substrate <b>33</b>, and a liquid crystal layer (not shown) interposed between the TFT display substrate <b>32</b> and the common electrode display substrate <b>33</b>. The liquid crystal panel assembly <b>30</b> further includes a gate chip film package <b>35</b>, a data chip film package <b>34</b>, and an integrated printed circuit board (&#x201c;PCB&#x201d;) <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The liquid crystal panel <b>31</b> includes the TFT display substrate <b>32</b> and the common electrode display substrate <b>33</b>. The TFT display substrate <b>32</b> further includes gate lines (not shown), data lines (not shown), a TFT array (not shown), and pixel electrodes (not shown). The common electrode display substrate <b>33</b> includes a black matrix (not shown) and common electrodes (not shown), and is disposed to substantially face the TFT display substrate <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In operation, the liquid crystal panel <b>31</b> displays an image.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The gate chip film package <b>35</b> is connected to each gate line (not shown) formed on the TFT display substrate <b>32</b> under the common electrode display substrate <b>33</b>. The data chip film package <b>34</b> is connected to each data line (not shown) formed on the TFT display substrate <b>32</b>. The gate chip film package <b>35</b> and the data chip film package <b>34</b> each include a wiring pattern (not shown), in which semiconductor chips (not shown) are formed on a base film(not shown), and a tape automated bonding (&#x201c;TAB&#x201d;) tape (not shown) which is bonded with the semiconductor chips by TAB technology, for example, but alternative exemplary embodiments are not limited thereto. In an exemplary embodiment, the gate chip film package <b>35</b> and the data chip film package <b>34</b> may each include a tape carrier package (&#x201c;TCP&#x201d;) or a chip on film (&#x201c;COF&#x201d;), for example, but alterative exemplary embodiments are not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Driving parts (not shown) are mounted on the integrated PCB <b>36</b> to transmit a gate-driving signal to the gate chip film package <b>35</b> and a data-driving signal to the data chip film package <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The upper case <b>20</b> forms an exterior component of the LCD <b>1</b> which includes a space wherein the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>30</b> is accommodated. An opening, e.g. a window is formed proximate to a center of the upper case <b>20</b> to expose the liquid crystal panel <b>31</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An intermediate frame <b>110</b> interposed between the upper case <b>20</b> and a lower case <b>170</b> couples the upper case <b>20</b> to the lower case <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the backlight assembly <b>10</b> includes the intermediate frame <b>110</b>, at least one optical sheet <b>120</b>, a diffuser plate <b>130</b>, the light source assembly <b>100</b>, and the lower case <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The intermediate frame <b>110</b> is securely fixed to the lower case <b>170</b> and contains the optical sheet <b>120</b>, the diffuser plate <b>130</b>, and the light source assembly <b>100</b> In an exemplary embodiment, the intermediate frame <b>110</b> is substantially rectilinear and includes sidewalls formed along peripheral edges thereof. An opening, e.g., a window, is formed proximate to a center of the intermediate frame <b>110</b> to allow light which passes through the diffuser plate <b>130</b> and the optical sheet <b>120</b> to pass through the intermediate frame <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The optical sheet <b>120</b> collects and diffuses light received from the diffuser plate <b>130</b>. Thus, optical sheet <b>120</b> is disposed on the diffuser plate <b>130</b> and is contained by the intermediate frame <b>110</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the optical sheet <b>120</b> includes a first prism sheet (not shown), a second prism sheet (not shown) and a protective sheet (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first prism sheet and the second prism sheet refract light, e.g., light which is received at a low angle relative to a front side of the LCD <b>1</b>, which passes through the diffuser plate <b>130</b>, thereby concentrating the light received at the low angle onto the front side of the LCD <b>1</b> to improve a brightness of the LCD <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The protective sheet formed on the first prism sheet and the second prism sheet protects surfaces of the first prism sheet and the second prism sheet and diffuses light for uniform distribution of the light. A configuration of the optical sheet <b>120</b> in an alternative exemplary embodiment is not limited to the configuration described above.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The diffuser plate <b>130</b> receives light from a light source unit <b>150</b> and diffuses the received light in all directions. The diffuser plate <b>130</b> prevents bright defects, e.g., bright points such as point light sources having a shape of, and being produced by, individual light source units <b>150</b> of a plurality of the light source units <b>150</b>, from being visible on a front surface of the LCD <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The light source assembly <b>100</b> is a light-emitting device which supplies light to the diffuser plate <b>130</b>. The light source assembly <b>100</b> includes the light source units <b>150</b>, a circuit board <b>160</b>, and a reflective sheet <b>140</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, each of the light source units <b>150</b> emits white light and is connected to the circuit board <b>160</b> to receive a driving voltage. The light sources <b>150</b> are disposed on the circuit board <b>160</b>, and a reflective sheet <b>140</b> is disposed on the circuit board <b>160</b> to fix a position of each of the light source units <b>150</b> on the circuit board <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The reflective sheet <b>140</b> includes openings <b>141</b> which receive respective light source units <b>150</b>, e.g., expose the respective light source units <b>150</b> through the reflective sheet <b>140</b>, such that the reflective sheet <b>140</b> thereby allows light from the light source units <b>150</b> to travel in an upward direction (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and by reflecting light therefrom in the upward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Structures of a color filter <b>300</b> and the light source assembly <b>100</b> according to an exemplary embodiment will now be described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, light generated by the light source assembly <b>100</b> is selectively passed through the color filter <b>300</b> to display an image. The color filter <b>300</b> includes a red filter CF_R, a green filter CF_G, and a blue filter CF_B which correspond to each pixel (not shown). More specifically, each pixel is divided into a plurality of domains, and red light <b>105</b>, green light <b>106</b>, and blue light <b>107</b> are selectively passed through respective domains. The red filter CF_R, the green filter CF_G, and the blue filter CF_B of the color filter <b>300</b> may be sequentially and repeatedly arranged in a line using a stripe arrangement method, for example, but alternative exemplary embodiments are not limited thereto. They may also be arranged using other arrangement methods, such as a delta arrangement method and a mosaic arrangement method, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The light source assembly <b>100</b> generates light and provides the generated light to the liquid crystal panel <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In an exemplary embodiment, the light assembly <b>100</b> mixes red light, green light, and blue light to generate white light, and the light assembly <b>100</b> according to an exemplary embodiment therefore includes a red light source chip LM_R, a green light source chip LM_G, and a blue light source chip LM_B.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The red light source chip LM_R, the green light source chip LM_G, and the blue light source chip LM_B emit the red light <b>105</b>, green light <b>106</b>, and blue light <b>107</b>, respectively. The red light <b>105</b>, the green light <b>106</b>, and the blue light <b>107</b> are mixed to produce white light incident to the color filter <b>300</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the red light source chip LM_R, the green light source chip LM_G, and the blue light source chip LM_B may be light-emitting diodes, white light-emitting diodes, fluorescent lamps, or laser light sources, for example, but alternative exemplary embodiments are not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The red filter CF_R, the green filter CF_G, and the blue filter CF_B each passes only a light having a respective predetermined wavelength. Specifically, the red filter CF_R passes light which corresponds to a red wavelength from the incident white light. Likewise, the green filter CF_G passes light which corresponds to a green wavelength from the incident white light, and the blue filter CF_B passes light which corresponds to a blue wavelength from the incident white light. As a result, light which passes through the red filter CF_R, light which passes through the green filter CF_G, and light which passes through the blue filter CF_B are mixed at an appropriate ratio thereof to represent a desired color image.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Light emitted from the light source assembly <b>100</b> may contain wavelengths other than those which correspond to the red light <b>105</b>, the green light <b>106</b>, and the blue light <b>107</b>. In addition, depending on a luminance of an image to be displayed on the liquid crystal panel <b>30</b>, the color filter <b>300</b> may pass a wider range of wavelengths than the respective wavelength of light of each color. Therefore, a purity of each of the red light <b>105</b>, the green light <b>106</b>, and the blue light <b>107</b> may be reduced, thereby affecting a color space which can be displayed on the liquid crystal panel <b>30</b>. Changes in the color space of the LCD <b>1</b> according to a relationship between light generated by the light source assembly <b>100</b> and the color filter <b>300</b> will be described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Properties of the color filter <b>300</b> and the light source units <b>150</b> will now be described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 12B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an x-y chromaticity diagram showing a color gamut of the LCD <b>1</b> according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the x-y chromaticity diagram of an XYZ color system standardized by the Commission International de I'eclairage (&#x201c;CIE&#x201d;) includes a color gamut, e.g., subset, of a color space of the LCD <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a color gamut of a standard red, green, and blue (&#x201c;sRGB&#x201d;) color space, and a color gamut of an ADOBE&#xae; RGB color space.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Specifically, a CIE color space is a color space defined by the CIE and represents all natural colors. The sRGB color space is a standard jointly suggested by HEWLETT-PACKARD&#xae; and MICROSOFT&#xae; and is mainly used in display devices, such as monitors. The ADOBE&#xae; RGB color space is a color space standard suggested by ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED&#xae; and represents a wider range of colors relative to the sRGB color space. An RGB<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0 color space is a gamut of colors which are reproduced by the LCD <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Further, the RGB<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0 color space includes both the sRGB color space and the ADOBE&#xae; RGB color space, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Thus, the RGB<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0 color space represents a wider range of colors than both the sRGB color space and the ADOBE&#xae; RGB color space. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each vertex of a respective color space, e.g., the sRGB color space, the ADOBE&#xae; color space, and the RGB<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0 color space, indicates red, green and blue. For example, a first vertex of the RGB<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0 color space represents red R, a second vertex of the RGB<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0 color space represents green G, and a third vertex of the RGB<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0 color space represents blue B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The color filter <b>300</b>, the red light source chip LM_R, the green light source chip LM_G, and the blue light source chip LM_B according to an exemplary embodiment will now be described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph of wavelength versus transmission rate illustrating spectral characteristics of the color filter <b>300</b> and the red light source chip LM_R, the green light source chip LM_G, and the blue light source chip LM_B included in the LCD <b>1</b> according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, broken lines indicate respective transmission curves of the red filter CF_R, the green filter CF_G, and the blue filter CF_B, as labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In addition, solid lines indicate respective spectral curves of the red light source chip LM_R, the green light source chip LM_G, and the blue light source chip LM_B, as labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, transmission wavelength ranges, e.g., widths of the respective transmission curves, of the red filter CF_R, the green filter CF_G, and the blue filter CF_B are greater, e.g., wider, than transmission wavelength ranges, e.g., widths of the spectral curves of the red light source chip LM_R, the green light source chip LM_G, and the blue light source chip LM_B, respectively. When a transmission wavelength range of the color filter <b>300</b> is reduced, for example, a luminance is reduced while a purity of color is enhanced. Therefore, the transmission wavelength range of the color filter <b>300</b> according to an exemplary embodiment is greater, e.g., wider, than a transmission wavelength range of the light source unit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, the transmission wavelength ranges of the red filter CF_R, the green filter CF_G and the blue filter CF_B may partially overlap one another, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, light in a green-light region, for example, may pass through the red filter CF_R and the blue filter CF_B, and light in a red light region and light in a blue light region may pass through the green filter CF_G. When light in a region passes through an adjacent region of the color filter <b>300</b>, purity of the associated color is reduced, which thereby reduces the color gamut of the LCD <b>1</b>. Thus, in an exemplary embodiment, transmission characteristics of the color filter <b>300</b> and the spectral characteristics of the light source unit <b>150</b> are adjusted to maintain luminance of light at an appropriate level and, at the same time, represent a wide range of colors.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Each of the light source units <b>150</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) according to an exemplary embodiment includes the red light source chip LM_R, the green light source chip LM_G, and the blue light source chip LM_B (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The red light source chip LM_R emits red light which has a wavelength with a main peak of approximately 620 nm to approximately 630 nm and a spectrum having a full width at half maximum (&#x201c;FWHM&#x201d;) of less than approximately 15 nm. The green light source chip LM_G emits green light which has a wavelength with a main peak of approximately 525 nm to approximately 535 nm and a spectrum having an FWHM of less than approximately 30 nm.

A CIE color space is a color space defined by the CIE, and an ADOBE&#xae; RGB color space is a color space standard suggested by ADOBE&#xae; Systems. In addition, an RGB_c color space represents the color gamut of the comparative experimental example shown in Table 1, an RGB<sub>&#x2014;</sub>1 color space represents the color gamut of the experimental example 1 shown in Table 1, and an RGB<sub>&#x2014;</sub>2 color space represents the color gamut of the experimental example 2 shown in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">To expand a color gamut of light which passes through the color filter <b>300</b>, a light transmission ratio of the blue filter CF_B is changed. Specifically, the light transmission ratio of the blue filter CF_B is adjusted to reduce the FWHM of the blue filter CF_B.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 10B</figref>, as color temperature increases, both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the red light are reduced.

The detector <b>400</b> detects the respective wavelengths of the red light, green light and the blue light and outputs a red light signal, a green light signal and a blue light signal which are analog signals.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When each side of the triangle is extended, each vertex of the triangle and two lines extending from both sides of the triangle form a region located at an exterior angle of each vertex of the triangle. More specifically, a region located at an exterior angle of the red reference coordinates SD_R is referred to as a red light source region LA_R, a region located at an exterior angle of the green reference coordinates SD_G is referred to as a green light source region LA_G, and a region located at an exterior angle of the blue reference coordinates SD_B is referred to as a blue light source region LA_B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As described in greater detail above, coordinates of light emitted from the red light source chip LM_R, the green light source chip LM_G, and the blue light source chip LM_B (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) included in each of the light source units <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, are referred to as red light source color coordinates LC_R, green light source color coordinates LC_G, and blue light source color coordinates LC_B, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In order for the color gamut of the light source units <b>150</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present embodiment to include the entire reference color space, the red light source color coordinates LC_R, the green light source coordinates LC_G, and the blue light source color coordinates LC_B must be located in the red light source region LA_R, the green light source region LA_G, the blue light source region LA_B, respectively. Put another way, the space inside the triangle having the red light source color coordinates LC_R, the green light source color coordinates LC_G, and the blue light source color coordinates LC_B as three vertexes thereof is the color gamut of the light source units <b>150</b>. Thus, the red light source color coordinates LC_R, the green light source color coordinates LC_G, and the blue light source color coordinates LC_B must be controlled to be within the red light source region LA_R, the green light source region LA_G, and the blue light source region LA_B, respectively, so that the color gamut of the light source units <b>150</b> always includes the reference color space.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A specific algorithm for determining whether each color coordinates is located in a corresponding light source region will now be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In a color coordinate system, the red reference coordinates SD_R, the green reference coordinates SD_G, and the blue reference coordinates SD_B are set, and the red light source color coordinates LC_R, the green light source color coordinates LC_G and the blue light source color coordinates LC_B are set.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an equation for a straight line connecting the red reference coordinates SD_R and the green reference coordinates SD_G is referred to as an equation of a first line p, and an equation for a straight line connecting the red reference coordinates SD_R and the green light source color coordinates LC_G is referred to as an equation of a second line q. In addition, an equation for a straight line connecting the red light source color coordinates LC_R and the green reference coordinates SD_G is referred to as an equation of a third line r.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Further, an equation for a straight line connecting the green reference coordinates SD_G and the blue reference coordinates SD_B is referred to as an equation of a fourth line p&#x2032;, and an equation for a straight line connecting the green reference coordinates SD_G and the blue light source color coordinates LC_B is referred to as an equation of a fifth line q&#x2032;. An equation for a straight line connecting the green light source color coordinates LC_G and the blue reference coordinates SD_B is referred to as an equation of a sixth line r&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In addition, an equation for a straight line connecting the blue reference coordinates SD_B and the red reference coordinates SD_R is referred to as an equation of a seventh line p&#x2033;, an equation for a straight line connecting the red reference coordinates SD_R and the blue light source color coordinates LC_B is referred to as an equation of an eighth line p&#x2033;, and an equation for a straight line connecting the blue reference coordinates SD_B and the red light source color coordinates SD_R is referred to as an equation of a ninth line r&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In order for the color coordinates to be located in a corresponding light source region, a value a of the y-intercept in the equation of the first line p must be located between a value b of the y-intercept in the equation of the second line q and a value c of the y-intercept in the equation of the third line r. In addition, a value a&#x2032; of the y-intercept in the equation of the fourth line p&#x2032; must be located between a value b&#x2032; of the y-intercept in the equation of the fifth line and a value c&#x2032; of the y-intercept in the equation of the sixth line r&#x2032;, and a value a&#x2033; of the y-intercept in the equation of the seventh line p&#x2033; must be located between a value b&#x2033; of the y-intercept in the equation of the eighth line q&#x2033; and a value c&#x2033; of the y-intercept in the equation of the ninth line r&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">When a feedback control, e.g., an operation of the control unit <b>800</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), is operated in a way which satisfies the conditions described above by comparing the value of the respective y-intercepts in the equations of the above lines, the color gamut of the light source units <b>150</b> is effectively maintained at least within the reference color space.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">However, a light source chip may deteriorate over time, or changes in properties of the light source chip due to heat, for example, may exceed a predetermined level. In this case, it becomes impossible to reach an optimum level using the self-correction capability of the light source units <b>150</b> alone. More specifically, when it is not possible to meet the predetermined level by controlling the associated PWM signal transmitted to a given light source chip, a control operation using an infinite loop is terminated. Then, an allowed range of y-intercept values is set, and, when a correction value enters the allowed range, the control operation is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Properties of each light source chip, e.g., physical properties, have different properties based on a particular color of a given light source chip. Thus, a different range of y-intercept values may be set for each respective light source chip. Specifically, the red light source chip LM_R and the green light source chip LM_G may be controlled based on the red reference coordinates SD_R and the green reference coordinates SD_G, respectively, which are initially set. However, an allowed range of y-intercept values may be set for the blue light source chip LM_B. Thus, when the blue light source chip LM_B cannot be controlled based on the initially set blue reference coordinates SD_B, the control of the blue light source chip LM_B may be terminated when a correction value enters the allowed range.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">For example, in an exemplary embodiment, the blue light source chip LM_B is controlled within an approximately 15 percent deviation from the value a&#x2032; of the y-intercept in the equation of the fourth line p&#x2032; or the value a&#x2033; of the y-intercept in the equation of the seventh line p&#x2033;. Specifically, if the value a&#x2032; of the y-intercept in the equation of the fourth line p&#x2032; or the value a&#x2033; of the y-intercept in the equation of the seventh line p&#x2033; is m, for example, an allowed range p of y-intercept values may be set to m&#x2212;m&#xd7;0.15&#x2266;p&#x2266;m+m&#xd7;0.15. As a result, when they-intercept of the equation of the ninth line r&#x2033; and the y-intercept of the equation of the fifth line q&#x2032; are within the allowed range p, the loop may be terminated. In an exemplary embodiment, a value of the allowed range is varied according to conditions of each individual light source chip.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention as described herein, a light source assembly, an LCD having the light source assembly, and a method of driving the light source assembly provide at least the advantage of a reproducible color space substantially expanded to represent colors which more accurately represent natural colors.</p>
