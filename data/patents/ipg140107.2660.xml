<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of forming a through hole in a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) device is a device which has anew function and in which a micro structure and an electric circuit are combined and are miniaturized. Hitherto, in the MEMS device, a microfabrication technology developed mainly in a semiconductor device manufacturing technology is applied, and a structure of several &#x3bc;m to several hundred &#x3bc;m is formed on a silicon substrate or the like, so that a passive device such as a sensor and an active device such as an actuator are formed. Through holes for forming the structures of the MEMS devices are formed by etching or the like so as not to break the silicon substrate or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">JP-A-2007-168344 (patent document 1) discloses a through hole forming method including a step of forming a continuous nozzle hole (through hole), which has a small-hole end closed by a base member and a large-diameter hole base end opening on a surface of the base member and has a two-stage shape, by an etching process in the silicon base member, a step of bonding a support substrate to the large-diameter hole side surface of the silicon base member, and a step of thinning the small-diameter hole side surface of the silicon base member to open the end part of the small-diameter hole.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a through hole forming method disclosed in JP-A-2010-240852 (patent document 2), dry etching is performed from one surface side of a silicon substrate to form a recess which becomes a first nozzle part (through hole), a protecting film having etching resistance is formed on the whole of the one surface of the silicon substrate including an inner wall of the recess, and a support substrate is bonded to the one surface. In that state, the silicon substrate is thinned from the other surface side so as to have a desired thickness, and a second nozzle part (through hole) communicating with the first nozzle part is formed by performing dry etching from the other surface side so as to open the bottom of the recess which becomes the first nozzle part. A first protecting film remaining on a portion corresponding to the bottom of the recess, which becomes the first nozzle part, is removed, and the support substrate is removed from the silicon substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the patent document 1, since the formation of the through hole is performed from the one side of the substrate, there is a problem that the shape of the terminal part of the etched hole becomes thin as compared with the etching start point. In the patent document 2, there is a problem that if a plurality of recesses which become through holes having different opening areas are formed simultaneously, the depths of the formed recesses vary according to the opening areas, and the depths of the recesses cannot be controlled. Besides, there is also a problem that if the through hole having a large opening area is formed, the protecting film formed on the recess is damaged when the second nozzle part, which becomes the through hole opposite to the recess, is formed, and gas for cooling the heat generated by the etching leaks.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a through hole forming method is required in which in a substrate on which a MEMS device or the like is formed, the shape of a hole which becomes a through hole is uniform from the start point of etching to the terminal end, gas used for the etching does not leak, and depths of recesses which become through holes having different areas can be controlled.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An advantage of some aspects of the invention is to solve at least part of the problems described above, and can be realized by the following modes or application examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Application Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This application example is directed to a through hole forming method including forming a first hole by forming a plurality of small holes to be continuously connected in a first substrate surface of a substrate including the first substrate surface and a second substrate surface opposite to the first substrate surface and by cutting and forming the small holes by etching, forming a thermally oxidized film on the substrate by thermally oxidizing the substrate as partition walls between the small holes and the substrate as bottoms of the small holes, and removing the thermally oxidized partition walls, the thermally oxidized bottoms and the thermally oxidized film formed on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the through hole forming method, the plurality of small holes are formed to be continuously connected in the first substrate surface of the substrate including the first substrate surface and the second substrate surface and are cut and formed by the etching, so that the first hole having a desired opening area can be formed. Further, the substrate as the partition walls between the small holes, and the substrate as the bottoms of the small holes are thermally oxidized to form the thermally oxidized film on the substrate, and the formed thermally oxidized film is removed, so that the through hole passing through the first substrate surface and the second substrate surface can be formed.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Application Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is preferable in the through hole forming method that the first hole is formed by continuously connecting the small holes having polygonal shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to this configuration, the shapes of the small holes constituting the first hole are polygonal, and the small holes are formed to be continuously connected, so that the small holes can be formed closely. Thus, the thickness of the substrate as the partition walls of the small holes becomes uniform, and the partition walls can be uniformly thermally oxidized. Besides, the strength of the bottom is increased, and the damage of the bottom can be suppressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Application Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is preferable that the through hole forming method includes forming a second hole opposite to the first hole in the second substrate surface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to this configuration, since the second hole opposite to the first hole is formed, the through hole in which opening areas of the first hole and the second hole are different from each other can be formed. Besides, the accuracy of the etching depth of the small holes to be formed can be loosened.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Application Example 4</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is preferable in the through hole forming method that a plurality of the first holes are formed in which the numbers of the small holes formed to be continuously connected are different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to this configuration, the first holes are formed in which the numbers of the small holes constituting the first holes are different from each other, so that the plurality of the first holes having different opening areas can be formed. Accordingly, the plurality of the first holes different in opening area can be simultaneously formed.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Application Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is preferable in the through hole forming method that a plurality of the first holes are formed in which opening areas of the small holes formed to be continuously connected are different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to this configuration, the opening areas of the small holes constituting the first holes are different from each other, so that the cutting formation speed of the etching varies according to the difference in the opening areas of the small holes. Thus, the first holes can be formed to have different depths. Accordingly, the plurality of the first holes different in depth can be simultaneously formed.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Application Example 6</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is preferable in the through hole forming method that a plurality of the first holes different in opening areas and depths of the first holes are simultaneously formed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to this configuration, the numbers of the small holes constituting the first holes and formed to be continuously connected and the opening areas of the small holes are made different from each other, so that the plurality of the first holes different in the depths and the opening areas of the first holes can be simultaneously formed.</p>

Besides, cooling gas, which protects the substrate <b>10</b> from heat generated by the dry etching, can be prevented from flowing into the first hole <b>1</b> under formation. Accordingly, even if the flowing-out of the dry etching reactive gas and the flowing-in of the cooling gas are not suppressed by bonding another substrate to the substrate <b>10</b> in which the through hole <b>3</b> is formed, the flowing-out of the dry etching reactive gas and the flowing-in of the cooling gas can be suppressed.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Hereinafter, the through hole forming method for forming the nozzle plate <b>20</b> of the embodiment will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a schematic view showing the first photo process of transferring the shapes of the first holes <b>11</b> constituting the first hole <b>1</b><i>e </i>and the shape of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, similarly to the second embodiment, in the first photo process, the shapes of the small holes <b>11</b> and the shape of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f </i>are transferred onto the first substrate surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>to which a first resist film <b>101</b> is applied, and development is performed, so that the first resist film <b>101</b> having the shapes of the small holes <b>11</b> and the shape of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f </i>is peeled, and the first substrate surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The opening areas of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f </i>and the small hole <b>11</b> influence the depths of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f </i>and the small hole <b>11</b> which are cut and formed by using dry etching in the after-mentioned first hole forming process. As the opening area becomes large, the cutting depth per unit time by the etching becomes deep. In this embodiment, the opening area and the depth of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f </i>which becomes the hole of the nozzle hole <b>31</b> for discharging a droplet is made reference, and the first hole <b>1</b><i>f </i>and the first hole <b>1</b><i>e </i>different in depth and opening area are simultaneously formed in the first substrate surface <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this embodiment, since the first hole <b>1</b><i>e </i>is formed to be shallower than the first hole <b>1</b><i>f</i>, the small holes <b>11</b> constituting the first hole <b>1</b><i>e </i>are formed to have smaller opening areas than the first hole <b>1</b><i>f</i>. Thus, the cutting formation speed of the first hole <b>1</b><i>e </i>is reduced as compared with the cutting formation of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f</i>. That is, if the etching is performed for the same time, the first hole <b>1</b><i>e </i>is formed to be shallower.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a schematic view showing the first hole forming process of forming the first holes <b>1</b><i>e </i>and <b>1</b><i>f </i>by cutting and forming the shapes of the small holes <b>11</b> and the first hole <b>1</b><i>f</i>, which were transferred onto the first substrate surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>and were obtained by peeling the first resist film <b>101</b> in the first photo process, by dry etching. In the first hole forming process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, similarly to the foregoing embodiment, the small holes <b>11</b> which become the first hole <b>1</b><i>e </i>and the first hole <b>1</b><i>f </i>are formed by the dry etching.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> is a schematic view showing the thermally oxidized film forming process of forming the oxide film <b>201</b> on the substrate <b>10</b> by thermally oxidizing the bottom <b>13</b> of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f</i>, and the partition walls <b>12</b> and the bottoms <b>13</b> of the small holes <b>11</b> constituting the first hole <b>1</b><i>e</i>, which were formed in the first hole forming process. Similarly to the second embodiment, in the thermally oxidized film forming process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the film thickness of the formed oxide film <b>201</b> is made such that the partition walls <b>12</b> and the bottoms <b>13</b> of the small holes <b>11</b> are thermally oxidized, and all the silicon of the substrate <b>10</b> constituting the partition walls <b>12</b> is oxidized.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> is a schematic view showing the second photo process of transferring the shapes of the second holes <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>2</b><i>f</i>, which become the through holes <b>3</b><i>e </i>and <b>3</b><i>f</i>, onto the second substrate surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>opposite to the first substrate surface <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Similarly to the first photo process, in the second photo process, the shapes of the second holes <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>2</b><i>f </i>are transferred to the second substrate surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>by exposure onto a second resist film <b>102</b> formed on the second substrate surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>and development is performed, so that the second substrate surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>having the shapes of the second holes <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>2</b><i>f </i>is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> is a schematic view showing the second hole forming process of forming the second hole <b>2</b><i>e</i>, <b>2</b><i>f </i>by cutting and forming the shapes of the second holes <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>2</b><i>f</i>, which were transferred onto the second substrate surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>and were formed by peeling the second resist film <b>102</b> in the second photo process, by dry etching. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, in the second hole forming process, the shapes of the second holes <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>2</b><i>f </i>transferred in the second photo process are cut by the dry etching, and the second holes <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>2</b><i>f </i>are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the dry etching of the second hole forming process, the etching reaction is suppressed by the thermally oxidized bottoms <b>13</b> of the first holes <b>1</b><i>e </i>and <b>1</b><i>f</i>. Thus, similarly to the foregoing embodiment, the depths of the second holes <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>2</b><i>f </i>cut and formed by the dry etching are depths from the second substrate surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>to the thermally oxidized bottoms <b>13</b> of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f </i>and the small hole <b>11</b>, in other words, depths obtained by subtracting the depths of the first holes <b>1</b><i>e </i>and <b>1</b><i>f </i>and the thicknesses of the thermally oxidized bottom <b>13</b> from the thickness of the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref> is a schematic view showing the removing process of removing the partition walls <b>12</b> and the bottoms <b>13</b> thermally oxidized in the thermally oxidized film forming process and the oxide film <b>201</b> formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>, in the removing process, similarly to the foregoing embodiment, the partition walls <b>12</b> and the bottoms <b>13</b> thermally oxidized in the thermally oxidized film forming process and the formed oxide film <b>201</b> are removed by immersing the substrate <b>10</b> in a solution containing hydrofluoric acid or the like. The oxide film <b>201</b>, the thermally oxidized partition walls <b>12</b> and the bottoms <b>13</b> of the small holes <b>11</b>, and the bottom <b>13</b> of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f </i>are removed, so that the first holes <b>1</b><i>e </i>and <b>1</b><i>f </i>formed in the first substrate surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>communicate with the second holes <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>2</b><i>f </i>formed in the second substrate surface <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the through hole <b>3</b><i>e </i>which becomes the fixing hole <b>32</b> of the nozzle plate <b>20</b> and the hole <b>3</b><i>f </i>which becomes the nozzle hole <b>31</b> are formed, and the series of processes are completed.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to the third embodiment, the following effects are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the through hole forming method of the embodiment, the opening area and the depth of the first hole <b>1</b><i>f </i>constituting the through hole <b>3</b><i>f </i>is made the reference, and the depth of the first hole <b>1</b><i>e </i>constituting the through hole <b>3</b><i>e </i>cut and formed by the etching can be controlled. By this, the plurality of through holes <b>3</b> having the first holes <b>1</b> different in opening area and depth can be simultaneously formed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the through hole forming method of the embodiment, the first holes <b>1</b> different in opening area and depth are simultaneously formed, so that the number of times of the dry etching can be reduced. By this, when another hole or the like is formed by the dry etching in the substrate <b>10</b>, the already formed hole or the like can be prevented from being damaged. Besides, since the number of times of the dry etching is reduced, the efficiency of the dry etching can be raised.</p>
