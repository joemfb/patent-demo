<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conveying devices convey objects between two preset workstations. A conveying device can be slidably mounted on a preset one-way inclined tramway that is disposed between the two preset workstations. The one-way inclined tramway includes a top end positioned at a high level, and a bottom end positioned at a lower level. In use, the conveying device slides from the top end toward the bottom end automatically, and after the objects are taken away, the empty conveyer is slid back to the top end manually. Such a conveying device has a low transfer efficiency. In addition, because the tramway is inclined, gravity increases the force of the impacts and shocks on the tramway by the conveying device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In use, objects are put on the loading plate <b>31</b> and the gravity of the objects forces the rack <b>51</b> together with the loading plate <b>31</b> to slide downward relative to the top wall <b>11</b> of the conveyer bracket <b>10</b>. The elastic members <b>35</b> are compressed. The first transmission assembly is driven to rotate via the engagement of the first transmission gear <b>535</b> and the rack <b>51</b>. The second transmission assembly <b>55</b> is simultaneously driven to rotate relative to the first transmission assembly <b>53</b>, and further drives the wheel assembly <b>20</b> to rotate via the transmission belt <b>57</b>. Thus, the whole conveying device <b>100</b> is capable of being driven to move along a preset path. When the objects are taken off the loading plate <b>31</b>, the elastic members <b>35</b> push the loading plate <b>31</b> upward, until the elastic members <b>35</b> return to their original uncompressed positions. The conveying device <b>100</b> is then driven to move back to its original position.</p>
