<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This present invention relates generally to data security, and, in particular, to securing data within a system such that the data cannot be contaminated, lost, or leaked from the system even when data storage devices such as disk drives are removed from or added to the system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Storage systems are utilized to process and store sensitive data. This sensitive data includes medical records, financial data and even details of weapons simulations. Such data must be securely managed so that it is not contaminated, lost, or improperly leaked. Currently, such data is stored on data storage devices (e.g., disk drives) which tend to be readily replaceable to facilitate repair, failure, and migration to faster, cheaper and larger devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The ability to remove devices from the system means that data in the system could become vulnerable when a device is removed. This vulnerability could increase the risk of privacy law violations and/or increase the likelihood that sensitive data will be released.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, when storage devices are removed improperly, data stored in the system could be lost. For example, if two disks are removed from a RAID-5 disk array, the data stored in the array will be lost. The removal could be done out of malice or human error. In either case the resulting cost can be enormous. A typical ten hour restore from backup could cost millions of dollars, and cause serious harm to a company.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, inserting devices into a system could introduce contamination such as foreign data and even viruses. For example, in a system that enforces the WORM (Write Once Read Many) property on rewritable disks, allowing the disks to be removed and inserted back into the system could circumvent the enforcement of the WORM property and cause the system to become contaminated with rewritten data.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the present invention, there is provided a system for securing data with a storage system. The system includes at least one storage device. In addition, the system includes a security mechanism for recognizing an attempt to insert or remove the storage device. Moreover, the system includes a management unit to control the insertion and removal of the storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for securing data within a storage system. The method includes recognizing an attempt to insert or remove a storage device from a storage system. In addition, the method includes controlling the insertion and removal of the storage device form the storage system.</p>

In the exemplary embodiment, locking mechanism <b>14</b> is automatically engaged upon the insertion of storage device <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">At block <b>32</b>, storage device <b>12</b> is initialized. Storage device <b>12</b> is not accessible for reading or writing until it has been initialized. In the exemplary embodiment, initializing the storage device comprises removing all existing data resident on storage device <b>12</b> and filling storage device <b>12</b> with a predetermined bit pattern. In an alternate embodiment, initializing storage device <b>12</b> includes resetting the state of storage device <b>12</b> to its initial factory value. In a further alternate embodiment, initializing storage device <b>12</b> includes populating storage device <b>12</b> with legitimate data currently stored in storage system <b>10</b>. For example, if a storage device <b>12</b> is inserted to replace another storage device <b>12</b> in a RAID-5 array, it s initialization would include rebuilding the appropriate data on the inserted storage device <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">At block <b>34</b>, storage device <b>12</b> is made available for reading and writing.</p>
