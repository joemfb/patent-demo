<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a droplet ejection apparatus, and more particularly to a droplet ejection apparatus including a nozzle surface cleaning apparatus which wipes a nozzle surface with a wiping member having absorbency.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When a recording operation is carried out continuously in an inkjet recording apparatus, ink adheres and accumulates in the vicinity of the nozzles and blockages occur in the nozzles. Hence, in an inkjet recording apparatus, cleaning of the nozzle surface is carried out periodically.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the cleaning of the nozzle surface is performed by wiping the nozzle surface with a blade or ink absorbing body after subjecting the nozzle surface to a wet state.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2004-142450 discloses a method of cleaning a nozzle surface in which a nozzle surface is wiped with a wiping member having absorbency after removing ink from the nozzle surface with a non-contact-type ink receiving member. However, this method has a drawback in that the ink on the nozzle surface cannot be removed completely because the ink receiving member does not make contact with the nozzle surface. In particular, if a liquid repelling treatment is not applied on the whole of the nozzle surface, then there is a drawback in that the liquid adhering to the portion where no liquid repelling treatment is applied cannot be removed (in the region not applied with a liquid repelling treatment, the angle of contact of the ink is small, the ink wets and spreads, and therefore the ink does not make contact with the non-contact ink receiving member and the ink cannot be removed). Therefore, a drawback arises in that, if the nozzle surface is subsequently wiped with a wiping member having absorbency, the wiping member absorbs an excessive amount of ink, the absorption capability of the wiping member declines, and wiping residue occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 03-262646 discloses a method in which a nozzle arrangement region is swept with a first cleaning member constituted of a blade member and the periphery of the nozzle arrangement region is swept with a second cleaning member constituted of a blade member. However, if the nozzle surface is swept with the blade member having no absorbency, then soiled ink is pressed inside the nozzles, and hence there is a drawback in that preliminary ejection must be performed after sweeping. Furthermore, if a liquid repelling treatment is applied on the nozzle surface, then there is a drawback in that the liquid repelling treatment surface is rubbed by the blade member and becomes worn.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been contrived in view of these circumstances, an object thereof being to provide a droplet ejection apparatus capable of reliably wiping a nozzle surface by preventing liquid from being pushed inside nozzles during wiping of the nozzle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to attain the aforementioned object, the present invention is directed to a droplet ejection apparatus, comprising: a droplet ejection head which includes a nozzle surface having a non-nozzle forming region and a nozzle forming region of a prescribed width in a prescribed direction, a nozzle row being formed in the nozzle forming region; and a nozzle surface cleaning apparatus which cleans the nozzle surface of the droplet ejection head, the nozzle surface cleaning apparatus including: a wiping device which presses a wiping member having absorbency against the nozzle surface and wipes the nozzle surface with the wiping member by moving the wiping member relatively in the prescribed direction with respect to the nozzle surface; and a sweeping device which sweeps excess liquid from the non-nozzle forming region before the wiping member wipes the nozzle surface, by pressing a sweeping member having elasticity against the non-nozzle forming region and moving the sweeping member relatively in the prescribed direction with respect to the nozzle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to this aspect of the present invention, excess liquid adhering to the non-nozzle forming region other than the nozzle forming region is swept by pressing the sweeping member having flexibility against the non-nozzle forming region and moving the sweeping member relatively with respect to the nozzle surface, before wiping the nozzle surface with the wiping member having absorbency. Thus, it is possible to prevent the excessive liquid being absorbed by the wiping member, leading to decline in the absorption capability of the wiping member and the occurrence of wiping residue. Furthermore, since the sweeping device is pressed against the nozzle surface, then it is possible to remove the excess liquid suitably, even if no liquid repelling treatment is applied on the nozzle surface. On the other hand, since the sweeping member is pressed against the non-nozzle forming region other than the nozzle forming region, then it is possible to prevent liquid from being pushing inside the nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the nozzle surface is applied with a liquid repelling treatment only on the nozzle forming region.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to this aspect of the present invention, the liquid repelling treatment is applied only on the nozzle forming region of the nozzle surface. Thus, it is possible to suppress costs. On the other hand, the excess liquid is swept with the sweeping device from the non-nozzle forming region where no liquid repelling treatment is applied, and therefore it is possible to clean the nozzle surface reliably without the occurrence of wiping residue. Moreover, since the sweeping member is not pressed against the nozzle forming region where the liquid repelling treatment is applied, then it is possible to prevent wear of the liquid repelling treatment surface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the nozzle forming region of the nozzle surface is formed in a recessed shape with respect to the other region.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to this aspect of the present invention, the nozzle forming region of the nozzle surface is formed in the recessed shape with respect to the other regions. Thus, it is possible to protect the nozzle forming region in which the nozzles are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, a region of the wiping member corresponding to the nozzle forming region is formed in a projecting shape in accordance with a cross-sectional shape of the nozzle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to this aspect of the present invention, the region corresponding to the nozzle forming region of the wiping member is formed in the projecting shape in accordance with the cross-sectional shape of the nozzle surface. Thus, it is possible to press the wiping member suitably against the nozzle surface, and the nozzle surface can be cleaned reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the nozzle surface of the droplet ejection head is inclined with respect to a horizontal plane; the non-nozzle forming region is disposed to a lower side of the nozzle surface in terms of a direction of inclination of the nozzle surface; and the sweeping device presses the sweeping member against the non-nozzle forming region disposed to the lower side of the nozzle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to this aspect of the present invention, the nozzle surface is inclined with respect to the horizontal plane, and the non-nozzle forming region other than the nozzle forming region is arranged to the lower side in terms of the direction of inclination. The sweeping member is pressed against the non-nozzle forming region which is disposed to the lower side of the nozzle surface in terms of the direction of inclination. If the nozzle surface is inclined, then the liquid flows over the nozzle surface due to its own weight and collects at the lower side in the direction of inclination, and therefore it is possible to remove the excess liquid efficiently by pressing the sweeping member against the region on the lower side in the direction of inclination.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the wiping device includes: a wiping device main body; a supply spindle which is arranged on the wiping device main body; a take-up spindle which is arranged on the wiping device main body; a rotation drive device which drives the take-up spindle to rotate; the wiping member which is band-shaped and wound in a form of a roll installed on the supply spindle, the wiping member traveling along a prescribed path of travel from the supply spindle and being taken up onto the take-up spindle; and a pressing roller which is arranged on the wiping device main body, the wiping member being wrapped about a circumferential surface of the pressing roller, wherein the wiping device presses the wiping member being wrapped about the circumferential surface of the pressing roller against the nozzle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to this aspect of the present invention, the nozzle surface is wiped by causing the band-shaped wiping member to travel in one direction and pressing the wiping member against the nozzle surface by means of the pressing roller. Thus, the wiping position of the wiping member is changed progressively, and the nozzle surface can be wiped efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the sweeping device includes: the sweeping member which is arranged on the wiping device main body of the wiping device; a flow channel which is arranged in the wiping device main body of the wiping device and recovers the liquid swept with the sweeping member; and a waste liquid tank into which the liquid flowing in the flow channel is discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to this aspect of the present invention, the sweeping member is installed integrally with the wiping device. Consequently, the composition can be made more compact.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the droplet ejection head includes a line head having a length corresponding to a width of a medium; the nozzle forming region having the prescribed width is arranged along a lengthwise direction of the line head; and the nozzle row is aligned in the lengthwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to this aspect of the present invention, the droplet ejection head is constituted of the line head having the length corresponding to the width of the medium. The nozzle forming region having the prescribed width is formed along the lengthwise direction of the line head and the nozzle row is aligned in the lengthwise direction in the nozzle forming region. By moving the sweeping device and the wiping device relatively in the lengthwise direction with respect to the line head, so as to sweep and wipe away the excess liquid, it is possible to clean the nozzle surface of the line head efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, the droplet ejection head is arranged movably in the lengthwise direction; and the excess liquid adhering to the non-nozzle forming region is swept with the sweeping member and the nozzle surface is wiped with the wiping member, by moving the droplet ejection head.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to this aspect of the present invention, the excess liquid is swept and wiped away by moving the droplet ejection head. Thus, a separate mechanism for moving the sweeping device and the wiping device is not necessary, and the composition can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the droplet ejection apparatus further comprises a cleaning liquid deposition device which deposits cleaning liquid onto the nozzle surface while moving relatively in the prescribed direction with respect to the nozzle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to this aspect of the present invention, the cleaning liquid deposition device which deposits the cleaning liquid onto the nozzle surface is arranged. Thereby, it is possible previously to deposit and wipe away the prescribed cleaning liquid on the nozzle surface, and hence the nozzle surface can be cleaned more efficiently. Furthermore, even if the cleaning liquid is deposited onto the nozzle surface in advance in this way, the excess liquid is swept with the sweeping device before wiping with the wiping device, and therefore it is possible to clean the nozzle surface reliably without the occurrence of wiping residue.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the present invention, it is possible reliable to clean the nozzle surface while preventing liquid from being pushed into the nozzles during cleaning of the nozzle surface.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Here, an inkjet recording apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention which records an image on a cut sheet of paper.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Composition of Image Recording Unit of Inkjet Recording Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view diagram showing the general composition of an image recording unit of an inkjet recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image recording unit <b>10</b> of the inkjet recording apparatus according to the present embodiment conveys a medium (cut sheet of paper) <b>12</b> by means of an image recording drum <b>14</b>. Droplets of inks of respective colors of cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), black (K) are ejected and deposited on a surface of the medium <b>12</b> from inkjet heads (droplet ejection heads) <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, which are arranged about the periphery of the image recording drum <b>14</b>, whereby a color image is recorded on the surface of the medium <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The image recording drum <b>14</b> is arranged rotatably, and end portions of a rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image recording drum <b>14</b> are supported on a pair of bearings <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The bearings <b>22</b> are arranged on a main frame <b>20</b> of the inkjet recording apparatus, and due to the end portions of the rotating shaft <b>18</b> being supported on this pair of bearings <b>22</b>, the image recording drum <b>14</b> is installed horizontally (the rotating shaft <b>18</b> is installed in parallel with the horizontal installation surface).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A motor is coupled to the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image recording drum <b>14</b> through a rotation transmission mechanism (not illustrated). The image recording drum <b>14</b> is driven by the motor to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The image recording drum <b>14</b> is provided with grippers <b>24</b> arranged on the circumferential surface thereof (in the present embodiment, at two locations on the outer circumferential surface thereof) so as to grip a leading end portion of the medium <b>12</b>. The leading end portion of the medium <b>12</b> is gripped by the grippers <b>24</b> and thereby held on the outer circumferential surface of the image recording drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The image recording drum <b>14</b> is further provided with an attraction holding mechanism which is not illustrated (for example, an electrostatic attraction mechanism or a vacuum suction mechanism). The medium <b>12</b> which is wrapped about the outer circumferential surface of the image recording drum <b>14</b> and the leading end portion of which is gripped by the gripper <b>24</b> is held by attraction on the rear surface side thereof by the attraction holding mechanism and thereby held on the outer circumferential surface of the image recording drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the inkjet recording apparatus according to the present embodiment, the medium <b>12</b> is transferred to the image recording drum <b>14</b> through a conveyance drum <b>26</b> from a previous step. The conveyance drum <b>26</b> is disposed in parallel with the image recording drum <b>14</b> and transfers the medium <b>12</b> onto the image recording drum <b>14</b> in a synchronized fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the medium <b>12</b> after the image recording is transferred to a subsequent step through a conveyance drum <b>28</b>. The conveyance drum <b>28</b> is disposed in parallel with the image recording drum <b>14</b> and receives the medium <b>12</b> from the image recording drum <b>14</b> in a synchronized fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The four inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are constituted of line heads having widths corresponding to the width of the medium, and are arranged at uniform intervals apart radially on a circle concentric with the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image recording drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the present embodiment, the four inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are arranged horizontally symmetrically about the image recording drum <b>14</b>. In other words, the cyan inkjet head <b>16</b>C and the black inkjet head <b>16</b>K are disposed symmetrically with respect to the vertical line that passes through the center of the image recording drum <b>14</b>, and the magenta inkjet head <b>16</b>M and the yellow inkjet head <b>16</b>Y are also disposed horizontally symmetrically with respect to the same vertical line.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, which are formed at lower ends of the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K disposed as described above, are positioned so as to face the outer circumferential surface of the image recording drum <b>14</b>, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are disposed at a prescribed height position from the outer circumferential surface of the image recording drum <b>14</b> (a uniform gap is formed between the outer circumferential surface of the image recording drum <b>14</b> and each of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K). Furthermore, inkjet nozzles are formed in the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, and are arranged in rows perpendicular to the conveyance direction of the medium <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Ink droplets are ejected perpendicularly toward the outer circumferential surface of the image recording drum <b>14</b> from the nozzles which are formed on the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y, <b>16</b>K disposed as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view perspective diagram of the nozzle surface of the inkjet head, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view diagram of the lower end region of the inkjet head.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K each have the same composition, and therefore the composition of one inkjet head <b>16</b> and the nozzle surface <b>30</b> (<b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y, <b>30</b>K) thereof are described here.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the nozzle surface <b>30</b> is formed in a rectangular shape and is constituted of a nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A having a fixed width in the central portion of the widthwise direction (media conveyance direction) of the nozzle surface <b>30</b> and nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B formed symmetrically on either side of the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A is a region where the nozzles are formed and a prescribed liquid repelling treatment is applied on the surface of this region (a liquid repelling film is applied thereon).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the inkjet head <b>16</b> in the present embodiment is composed by a so-called matrix head and the nozzles N are arranged in a two-dimensional matrix configuration in the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A. More specifically, the nozzle rows are formed by arranging the nozzles N at a uniform pitch in a direction inclined by a prescribed angle with respect to the direction of conveyance of the medium <b>12</b>, and furthermore a plurality of the nozzle rows are arranged at uniform pitch in the direction (the lengthwise direction of the head) which is perpendicular to the conveyance direction of the medium <b>12</b>. By adopting this arrangement for the nozzles, it is possible to reduce the effective pitch between the nozzles N as projected to the lengthwise direction of the head (namely, a direction perpendicular to the conveyance direction of the medium <b>12</b>), and therefore a high-density configuration of the nozzles N can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the matrix head, the effective nozzle row is a row of nozzles projected to the lengthwise direction of the head.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B disposed on either side of the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A are regions for protecting the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A, and the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A is formed in a recessed shape which is withdrawn by a prescribed amount (approximately 0.2 mm) from the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The inkjet head <b>16</b> in the present embodiment has the liquid repelling treatment applied only on the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A (i.e., no liquid repelling treatment is applied on the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B). In this case, when liquid adheres to the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B, the liquid wets and spreads on the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The inkjet head <b>16</b> in the present embodiment ejects droplets of ink from the nozzles N by a so-called piezoelectric ejection system. The nozzles N formed in the nozzle surface <b>30</b> are respectively connected to pressure chambers P, and the volume of the pressure chambers P are compressed and expanded by causing the side walls of the pressure chambers P to vibrate by means of piezoelectric elements, and thereby causing droplets to be ejected from the nozzles N.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The ink ejection method is not limited to this and may also adopt a composition which performs ejection by a thermal method.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The image recording unit <b>10</b> has the composition described above. In the image recording unit <b>10</b>, the medium <b>12</b> is received onto the image recording drum <b>14</b> from the previous step through the conveyance drum <b>26</b>, and is conveyed in rotation while being held by attraction on the circumferential surface of the image recording drum <b>14</b>. The medium <b>12</b> passes below the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K during this conveyance and ink droplets are ejected and deposited from the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K onto the recording surface of the medium <b>12</b> as the medium <b>12</b> passes, thereby forming a color image on the recording surface of the medium <b>12</b>. The medium <b>12</b> on which the image has been recorded is transferred from the image recording drum <b>14</b> to the conveyance drum <b>28</b> and is conveyed to the subsequent step.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the image recording unit <b>10</b> having the composition described above, the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are installed on a head supporting frame <b>40</b> and are arranged around the image recording drum <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The head supporting frame <b>40</b> is constituted of a pair of side plates <b>42</b>L and <b>42</b>R, which are arranged perpendicularly to the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image recording drum <b>14</b>, and a linking frame <b>44</b>, which links the pair of side plate <b>42</b>L and <b>42</b>R together at the upper end portions thereof.</p>

Installation sections <b>46</b>C, <b>46</b>M, <b>46</b>Y and <b>46</b>K for installing the respective inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are provided on the inner side faces of the pair of side plates <b>42</b>L and <b>42</b>R (only the installation sections <b>46</b>Y and <b>46</b>K are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The installation sections <b>46</b>C, <b>46</b>M, <b>46</b>Y and <b>46</b>K are disposed at a uniform spacing apart radially on a circle concentric with the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image formation drum <b>14</b>. The inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are installed on the head supporting frame <b>40</b> by fixing attachment sections <b>48</b>C, <b>48</b>M, <b>48</b>Y and <b>48</b>K, which are formed on the respective ends of the heads (only the attachment sections <b>48</b>Y and <b>48</b>K are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) onto the installation sections <b>46</b>C, <b>46</b>M, <b>46</b>Y and <b>46</b>K. By installing the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K on the head supporting frame <b>40</b>, the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are disposed at uniform intervals apart radially on a circle concentric with the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image formation drum <b>14</b>.</p>

A moisturizing unit <b>50</b> for moisturizing the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is provided in this maintenance position. When the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are not used for a long time, the head supporting frame <b>40</b> is placed in the maintenance position and the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moisturized by the moisturizing unit <b>50</b>. Thereby, ejection failure due to drying is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The movement of the head supporting frame <b>40</b> is controlled by a controller (not shown).

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A cleaning liquid emission port <b>78</b> is formed in the vicinity of the upper part of the cleaning liquid holding surface <b>74</b>A, and the cleaning liquid flows out from the cleaning liquid emission port <b>78</b>. The cleaning liquid which has flowed out from the cleaning liquid emission port <b>78</b> flows down the inclined cleaning liquid holding surface <b>74</b>A and is recovered in the cleaning liquid recovery tray <b>76</b>. By setting the gap between the cleaning liquid holding surface <b>74</b>A and the nozzle surface <b>30</b> to a uniform value, when the nozzle surface <b>30</b> passes over the cleaning liquid holding surface <b>74</b>A, the cleaning liquid which has flowed down over the cleaning liquid holding surface <b>74</b>A makes contact with the nozzle surface <b>30</b> and the cleaning liquid is thereby deposited on the nozzle surface <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A cleaning liquid supply flow channel <b>80</b> connected to the cleaning liquid emission port <b>78</b> is formed inside the cleaning liquid deposition head <b>74</b>. The cleaning liquid supply flow channel <b>80</b> is connected to a connection flow channel <b>76</b>A formed in the cleaning liquid recovery tray <b>76</b>. A cleaning liquid supply port <b>76</b>B connected to the connection flow channel <b>76</b>A is formed in the cleaning liquid recovery tray <b>76</b>, and the cleaning liquid flows out from the cleaning liquid emission port <b>78</b> due to the cleaning liquid being supplied to the cleaning liquid supply port <b>76</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The cleaning liquid supply port <b>76</b>B is connected to a cleaning liquid supply tank <b>84</b> through a cleaning liquid supply channel <b>82</b>. A cleaning liquid supply pump <b>86</b> is arranged at an intermediate position of the cleaning liquid supply channel <b>82</b>, and by driving the cleaning liquid supply pump <b>86</b>, the cleaning liquid is supplied from the cleaning liquid supply tank <b>84</b> to the cleaning liquid supply port <b>76</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The cleaning liquid recovery tray <b>76</b> is formed in the shape of the rectangular box, the upper portion of which is open, as described above. The bottom face of the cleaning liquid recovery tray <b>76</b> is formed with a cleaning liquid recovery hole <b>88</b>. A cleaning liquid discharge port <b>76</b>D connected to the cleaning liquid recovery hole <b>88</b> through a cleaning liquid recovery flow channel <b>76</b>C is formed in the side face portion of the cleaning liquid recovery tray <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The cleaning liquid discharge port <b>76</b>D is connected to a cleaning liquid recovery tank <b>92</b> through a cleaning liquid recovery channel <b>90</b>. The cleaning liquid recovered by the cleaning liquid recovery tray <b>76</b> is recovered into the cleaning liquid recovery tank <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Each of the cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b> (<b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y, <b>70</b>K) is composed as described above. The cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> is composed by installing the cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y and <b>70</b>K on the cleaning liquid deposition unit installation sections <b>72</b>C, <b>72</b>M, <b>72</b>Y and <b>72</b>K formed in the base <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The operation of the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> is controlled by a controller, which is not illustrated. The controller controls the cleaning liquid deposition operation by the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> by controlling the driving of the elevator device, the cleaning liquid supply pump <b>86</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Examples of the cleaning liquid include liquid that contains diethylene monobutyl ether as a main component. By applying this type of cleaning liquid onto the nozzle surface <b>30</b>, a fixed substance deriving from the ink adhered to the nozzle surface <b>30</b> can be resolved and removed more easily.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Action of Cleaning Liquid Deposition Device&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Next, a cleaning liquid deposition operation by the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> having the composition described above is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> deposits the cleaning liquid onto the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b> (<b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y, <b>30</b>K) of the inkjet heads <b>16</b> (<b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y, <b>16</b>K) while the inkjet heads <b>16</b> (<b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y, <b>16</b>K) move from the image recording position to the maintenance position. More specifically, the cleaning liquid is deposited as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The whole of the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> is arranged raisable and lowerable. When not performing cleaning, the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> is disposed in a prescribed standby position. During cleaning, the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> is raised by a prescribed amount from the standby position to a prescribed operating position.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">When the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> is moved to the operating position, the cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y and <b>70</b>K are set in prescribed cleaning liquid deposition positions. Thereby, it is possible to deposit the cleaning liquid onto the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, by means of the cleaning liquid deposition heads <b>74</b> arranged in the cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y and <b>70</b>K. In other words, when the cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y and <b>70</b>K are set in the cleaning liquid deposition position, they are set in the positions where the cleaning liquid which has flowed over the cleaning liquid holding surfaces <b>74</b>A of the cleaning liquid deposition heads <b>74</b> makes contact with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K (i.e., the positions where the gaps between the cleaning liquid holding surfaces <b>74</b>A and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are in a prescribed range).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">When the cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y and <b>70</b>K are set in the prescribed cleaning liquid deposition position, the controller drives the linear drive mechanism and causes the head supporting frame <b>40</b> to move at a prescribed speed of movement from the image recording position to the maintenance position.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">On the other hand, the controller also drives the cleaning liquid supply pump <b>86</b> in accordance with the timing at which the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K arrive at the cleaning liquid deposition heads <b>74</b> of the cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y and <b>70</b>K. Thereby, the cleaning liquid flows out at a prescribed flow rate from the cleaning liquid emission ports <b>78</b> of the cleaning liquid deposition heads <b>74</b> in the respective cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y and <b>70</b>K. The cleaning liquid which has flowed out from the cleaning liquid emission ports <b>78</b> flows down over the cleaning liquid holding surfaces <b>74</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">When the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K moving toward the maintenance position pass the cleaning liquid deposition heads <b>74</b>, the cleaning liquid which has flowed over the cleaning liquid holding surfaces <b>74</b>A of the cleaning liquid deposition heads <b>74</b> contacts the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, and the cleaning liquid is thereby deposited on the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>

The travel direction of the wiping web <b>110</b> having been wrapped about the second rear-stage guide <b>166</b> described below is changed to a direction perpendicular to the axis of the take-up spindle <b>116</b> by wrapping the wiping web <b>110</b> about the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The second front-stage guide <b>162</b> is formed as a guide roller having flanges <b>162</b>L and <b>162</b>R on the respective end portions thereof The second front-stage guide <b>162</b> is disposed between the first front-stage guide <b>160</b> and the pressing roller <b>118</b>, and guides the wiping web <b>110</b> which has wrapped about the first front-stage guide <b>160</b> so as to be wrapped about the pressing roller <b>118</b>. More specifically, the travel direction of the wiping web <b>110</b> which has been changed to the direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of the pressing roller <b>118</b> by the first front-stage guide <b>160</b> is slightly adjusted so that the wiping web <b>110</b> travels in the direction just perpendicular to the axis of the pressing roller <b>118</b>. Furthermore, skewed travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> is prevented by the flange sections <b>162</b>L and <b>162</b>R on the respective ends of the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The second front-stage guide <b>162</b> is supported at only one end thereof on a bracket <b>168</b>A, and the second front-stage guide <b>162</b> is disposed at a prescribed angular inclination.

<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The second rear-stage guide <b>166</b> is disposed between the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>, and guides the wiping web <b>110</b> which has been wrapped about the pressing roller <b>118</b> so as to be wrapped about the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The second front-stage guide <b>162</b> and the second rear-stage guide <b>166</b> are disposed symmetrically about the pressing roller <b>118</b>. The wiping web <b>110</b> of which the travel direction has been changed to the direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of the pressing roller <b>118</b> by the first front-stage guide <b>160</b> is wrapped about the second front-stage guide <b>162</b>, whereby the travel direction of the wiping web <b>110</b> is slightly adjusted so that the wiping web <b>110</b> travels in the direction just perpendicular to the axis of the pressing roller <b>118</b>. Furthermore, the travel direction of the wiping web <b>110</b> having been wrapped about the pressing roller <b>118</b> is slightly adjusted by the second rear-stage guide <b>166</b> so that the wiping web <b>110</b> can be wrapped about the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>. By wrapping the wiping web <b>110</b> about the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>, the travel direction of the wiping web <b>110</b> is changed to the direction perpendicular to the axis of the take-up spindle <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Thus, the front-stage guide <b>120</b> and the rear-stage guide <b>122</b> guide the wiping web <b>110</b> by gradually changing the travel direction of the wiping web <b>110</b>, so that the wiping web <b>110</b> can be wrapped about the pressing roller <b>118</b> readily.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Consequently, the angle of inclination of the second front-stage guide <b>162</b> is closer to the angle of inclination of the pressing roller <b>118</b> than the angle of inclination of the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, and similarly, the angle of inclination of the second rear-stage guide <b>166</b> is closer to the angle of inclination of the pressing roller <b>118</b> than the angle of inclination of the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As described above, the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> (the first structural body constituted of the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>) are arranged on the elevator stage <b>170</b>. The elevator stage <b>170</b> can be raised and lowered in the direction vertical to the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a guide shaft <b>172</b> is connected integrally with the elevator stage <b>170</b>. The guide shaft <b>172</b> vertically extends downward from the lower face of the elevator stage <b>170</b> and is fitted into a guide bush <b>174</b> disposed inside the case main body <b>126</b>. The guide bush <b>174</b> is fixed to the inner wall face of the case main body <b>126</b> through a supporting member <b>176</b>, and guides the guide shaft <b>172</b> vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In this way, the elevator stage <b>170</b> on which the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> are disposed is arranged raisable and lower ably in the direction vertical to the horizontal plane. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, by raising and lowering the elevator stage <b>170</b>, it is possible to cause the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> to advance and retreat with respect to the second front-stage guide <b>162</b> and the second rear-stage guide <b>166</b> (the second structural body constituted of the second front-stage guide <b>162</b> and the second rear-stage guide <b>166</b>), which are fixedly arranged. By this means, it is possible to simply replace the wiping web <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">More specifically, by lowering the elevator stage <b>170</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the first front-side guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> can be retracted downward with respect to the second front-stage guide <b>162</b> and the second rear-stage guide <b>166</b>, and therefore a large space between same can be ensured. Thereby, it is possible to simply carry out the task of wrapping the wiping web <b>110</b> about the respective sections. Furthermore, the wiping web <b>110</b> can be simply wrapped about the respective sections by wrapping the wiping web <b>110</b> about the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>, with the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> in the downwardly retracted state, and then raising the elevator stage <b>170</b>. In other words, if the wiping web <b>110</b> is wrapped about the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>, whereupon the elevator stage <b>170</b> is raised, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, then the wiping web <b>110</b> is automatically wrapped about the second front-stage guide <b>162</b> and the second rear-stage guide <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In this way, by making the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> capable of advancing and retracting with respect to the second front-stage guide <b>162</b> and the second rear-stage guide <b>166</b>, it is possible to simply carry out the task of replacing the wiping web <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> need to be positioned in the prescribed use position (the position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>) when being used, and the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> are moved to the use position in coordination with the installation of the wiping unit <b>100</b> on the rack <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">This coordinated mechanism will now be described.

The elevator lever <b>178</b> is arranged so as to project from the rear face of the case main body <b>126</b> through a cutaway portion <b>180</b> formed on the rear face of the case main body <b>126</b>. The elevator stage <b>170</b> is raised and lowered by sliding the elevator lever <b>178</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, a pin (engaged section) <b>182</b> is projectingly arranged on the inner side of the installation section <b>104</b> (<b>104</b>C, <b>104</b>M, <b>104</b>Y and <b>104</b>K) of the rack <b>102</b> in which the wiping unit <b>100</b> is set. The pin <b>182</b> is arranged so as to engage with the elevator lever <b>178</b> arranged on the wiping unit <b>100</b> when the wiping unit <b>100</b> is installed on the installation section <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">According to the composition described above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, when the wiping unit <b>100</b> is inserted into the installation section <b>104</b> of the rack <b>102</b>, the elevator lever <b>178</b> engages with the pin <b>182</b> and is forcibly raised up to a prescribed position. Thereby, the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> are registered in the prescribed use position.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In this way, the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> are moved to the use position in coordination with the installation of the wiping unit <b>100</b> on the rack <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The drive roller <b>124</b> is disposed in the vicinity of the base face of the case main body <b>126</b>, in a position below the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>.

<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The drive roller <b>124</b> is arranged in parallel with the take-up spindle <b>116</b> (namely in parallel with the horizontal plane), and the vicinity of the base end portion thereof is rotatably supported on a bearing section <b>184</b>, which is arranged on the case main body <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Furthermore, the drive roller <b>124</b> is arranged in such a manner that the base end portion of the rotating shaft thereof projects to the outer side of the case main body <b>126</b>, and a roller drive gear <b>186</b> is fixed to this projecting base end portion of the rotating shaft. The drive roller <b>124</b> is rotated by driving the roller drive gear <b>186</b> to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Here, the drive system of the wiping unit <b>100</b> including the drive roller <b>124</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In the wiping unit <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, by driving the take-up spindle <b>116</b> to rotate while also driving the drive roller <b>124</b> to rotate, the wiping web <b>110</b> is caused to travel from the supply spindle <b>114</b> toward the take-up spindle <b>116</b>. As described above, the take-up gear <b>158</b> is fixed to the base end portion of the take-up spindle <b>116</b>, and the roller drive gear <b>186</b> is fixed to the base end portion of the rotating shaft of the drive roller <b>124</b>.

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The rotating shaft of the idle gear <b>188</b> is horizontally arranged and is rotatably supported on a bearing section <b>190</b> arranged on the case main body <b>126</b>. The take-up gear <b>158</b> and the roller drive gear <b>186</b> are both caused to rotate in the same direction by driving the idle gear <b>188</b>. The idle gear <b>188</b> meshes with a drive gear <b>192</b> arranged inside the installation section <b>104</b> when the wiping unit <b>100</b> is installed in the installation section <b>104</b> of the rack <b>102</b>. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, a motor <b>194</b> forming a source of drive power is arranged in the base portion of the installation section <b>104</b>, and the idle gear <b>188</b> meshes with the drive gear <b>192</b>, which is fixed to the output shaft of the motor <b>194</b>, when the wiping unit <b>100</b> is installed in the installation section <b>104</b> of the rack <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In this way, the idle gear <b>188</b> meshes with the drive gear <b>192</b> arranged inside the installation section <b>104</b> when the wiping unit <b>100</b> is installed in the installation section <b>104</b> of the rack <b>102</b>. When the drive gear <b>192</b> is caused to rotate by the motor <b>194</b>, the idle gear <b>188</b> rotates and this rotation of the idle gear <b>188</b> is transmitted to the roller drive gear <b>186</b> of the take-up gear <b>158</b>, thereby rotating the take-up spindle <b>116</b> and the drive roller <b>124</b>. Due to the rotation of the take-up spindle <b>116</b> and the driver roller <b>124</b>, the wiping web <b>110</b> is supplied from the supply spindle <b>114</b>, and taken up onto the take-up spindle <b>116</b> after passing along a prescribed path of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">As described above, the sliding member <b>144</b> is installed on the inner circumference of the axle portion of the take-up reel <b>142</b>, which is installed on the take-up spindle <b>116</b>, and the take-up reel <b>142</b> is composed so as to slide with respect to the take-up spindle <b>116</b> when the prescribed load or greater is applied in the direction of rotation. Consequently, the sliding member <b>144</b> slides if a velocity difference occurs between the take-up spindle <b>116</b> and the drive roller <b>124</b>, and therefore allows the wiping web <b>110</b> to be conveyed at a uniform velocity at all times.</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The method of installation the wiping web <b>110</b> on the wiping unit <b>100</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The wiping web <b>110</b> is formed in a band shape having the prescribed width, and the winding cores <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B are attached respectively to either end thereof. The wiping web <b>110</b> is supplied in the form of a roll wound up onto the winding core <b>110</b>A, one of the winding cores.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Firstly, the wiping unit <b>100</b> is taken out from the rack <b>102</b> and the lid <b>128</b> of the case <b>112</b> is opened. Upon opening the lid <b>128</b>, the supply reel <b>138</b> which is installed on the supply spindle <b>114</b> and the take-up reel <b>142</b> which is installed on the take-up spindle <b>116</b> are exposed, and then the winding cores <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B of the wiping web <b>110</b> are installed respectively on the supply reel <b>138</b> and the take-up reel <b>142</b>.

<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The wiping unit <b>100</b> is set in the rack <b>102</b> by vertically inserting the wiping unit <b>100</b> into the installation section <b>104</b> formed in the rack <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">When the wiping unit <b>100</b> has been set in the installation section <b>104</b> of the rack <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the idle gear <b>188</b> of the wiping unit <b>100</b> meshes with the drive gear <b>192</b> arranged on the installation section <b>72</b>, and thus becomes rotatably drivable by the motor <b>194</b>, which is coupled to the drive gear <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Furthermore, when the wiping unit <b>100</b> is set in the installation section <b>104</b> of the rack <b>102</b>, the elevator lever <b>178</b> arranged on the elevator stage <b>170</b> engages with the pin <b>182</b> arranged on the installation section <b>104</b>, and the elevator stage <b>170</b> is forcibly raised up to the prescribed position. Thereby, the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> are registered in the prescribed use position. By registering the first front-stage guide <b>160</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b> in the prescribed use position, the wiping web <b>110</b> becomes wrapped about the second front-stage guide <b>162</b>, which is disposed between the first front-stage guide <b>160</b> and the pressing roller <b>118</b>, and furthermore the wiping web <b>110</b> also becomes wrapped about the second rear-stage guide <b>166</b>, which is disposed between the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the first rear-stage guide <b>164</b>. Thereby, the wiping web <b>110</b> is tautly wrapped about the circumferential surface of the pressing roller <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Thus, the setting of the wiping unit <b>100</b> in the rack <b>102</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In the thus set wiping unit <b>100</b> in the rack <b>102</b>, by driving the motor <b>194</b>, the wiping web <b>110</b> is supplied from the supply spindle <b>114</b> and taken up onto the take-up spindle <b>116</b> after passing along a prescribed path of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the wiping units <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K, which correspond respectively to the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K disposed with their nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K at the inclinations with respect to the horizontal plane, are positioned in parallel with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, respectively. Thus, it is possible to cause the wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped about the respective pressing rollers <b>118</b> to make tight contact with the corresponding nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Since each pressing roller <b>118</b> is formed with a central portion having an enlarged diameter, in accordance with the cross-sectional shape of the nozzle surface <b>30</b>, then it is possible to cause the wiping web <b>110</b> to make tight contact also with the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A, which is formed in the shape recessed from the nozzle holding regions <b>30</b>B.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Wiping Operation&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Similarly to the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b>, the wiping device <b>64</b> wipes and cleans the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b> (<b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y, <b>30</b>K) of the inkjet heads <b>16</b> (<b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y, <b>16</b>K) while the inkjet heads move from the image recording position to the maintenance position. More specifically, the nozzle surfaces are wiped as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The whole of the wiping device <b>64</b> is arranged raisable and lowerable. When not performing cleaning, the wiping device <b>64</b> is disposed in a prescribed standby position. During cleaning, the wiping apparatus <b>64</b> is raised by a prescribed amount from the standby position to a prescribed operating position.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">When the wiping device <b>64</b> is moved to the operating position, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K can be wiped by the wiping units <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K. More specifically, when the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K pass the respective wiping units <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K, it is possible for the wiping webs <b>110</b> wound about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> to abut and press against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In this case, as described above, since the central portion of each pressing roller <b>118</b> which corresponds to the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A is formed with the enlarged diameter, then it is possible to cause the wiping web <b>110</b> to make tight contact with the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A also.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Moreover, when the wiping device <b>64</b> moves to the operating position, it is possible to wipe the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B disposed on the lower sides of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b> in terms of the direction of inclination of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>, by means of the blades <b>200</b> arranged in the respective wiping units <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K. More specifically, when the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K pass the respective wiping units <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K, it is possible for the blades <b>200</b> to abut and press against the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B located on the lower side of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y, <b>30</b>K in the direction of inclination thereof</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">When the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K in which the cleaning liquid has been deposited on the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K by the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> are moved in this state toward the maintenance position, during the course of this movement, the wiping units <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K clean and wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In this, the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B located on the lower side of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K in terms of the direction of inclination are firstly wiped by the blades <b>200</b>, and then the whole of the nozzle surfaces are wiped by the wiping webs <b>110</b>. Thus, it is possible to wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K reliably, without impairing the absorption capability of the wiping web <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">More specifically, since the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are arranged with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K oblique to the horizontal plane, and no liquid repelling treatment is applied to the nozzle protection regions <b>30</b>B located on the lower side in the direction of inclination, then the cleaning liquid deposited by the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> in the previous stage may adhere in large quantities to the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B located on the lower side in the direction of inclination. Therefore, if the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped with the wiping webs <b>110</b> in a state where the large amount of cleaning liquid is adhering in this way, then the cleaning liquid adhering to the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B is absorbed by the wiping webs <b>110</b> and the absorption capability of the wiping webs <b>110</b> declines. On the other hand, in the wiping device <b>64</b> according to the present embodiment, the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B on the lower sides in the direction of inclination are wiped in advance by the blades <b>200</b>, and therefore it is possible to remove the excess cleaning liquid prior to wiping with the wiping webs <b>110</b> and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K can be wiped without imparting the wiping capability of the wiping webs <b>110</b>. Furthermore, since the blades <b>200</b> are not pressed against the nozzle forming regions <b>30</b>A, then it is possible to avoid the occurrence of problems such as soiled ink being pushed inside the nozzles by the blades <b>200</b>, or the liquid repelling treatment surfaces being rubbed by the blades <b>200</b> and caused to wear.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The controller drives the motors <b>194</b> and causes the wiping webs <b>110</b> to travel, in accordance with the timing at which the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K arrive at the wiping units <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K. Thereby, the traveling wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, thus wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. Furthermore, it is also possible to perform wiping by pressing a new surface of web against each of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, at all times.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">&#x3c;Action of Nozzle Surface Cleaning Apparatus&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The nozzle surface cleaning apparatus <b>60</b> according to the present embodiment is composed as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Next, a nozzle surface cleaning operation performed by the nozzle surface cleaning apparatus <b>60</b> in the present embodiment is described.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The cleaning of the nozzle surfaces is performed while the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved from the image recording position to the maintenance position.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">When a nozzle surface cleaning instruction is input to the controller, the controller moves the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> and the wiping device <b>64</b> to the prescribed operating positions. By this means, it becomes possible for the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> to deposit the cleaning liquid and for the wiping device <b>64</b> to perform wiping.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">After the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> and the wiping device <b>64</b> are moved to the prescribed operating positions, the controller causes the head supporting frame <b>40</b> to move from the image recording position to the maintenance position at a prescribed movement speed.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">On the other hand, the controller also drives the cleaning liquid supply pump <b>86</b> in accordance with the timing at which the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K arrive at the cleaning liquid deposition heads <b>74</b> of the cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y and <b>70</b>K. Thereby, the cleaning liquid flows out at a prescribed flow rate from the cleaning liquid emission ports <b>78</b> of the cleaning liquid deposition heads <b>74</b> in the respective cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y and <b>70</b>K. The cleaning liquid which has flowed out from the cleaning liquid emission ports <b>78</b> flows down over the cleaning liquid holding surfaces <b>74</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">When the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K moving toward the maintenance position pass the cleaning liquid deposition heads <b>74</b>, the cleaning liquid which has flowed over the cleaning liquid holding surfaces <b>74</b>A of the cleaning liquid deposition heads <b>74</b> contacts the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, and the cleaning liquid is thereby deposited on the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K on which the cleaning liquid has been deposited are moved in this state toward the maintenance position. In passing the wiping units <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are cleaned by wiping.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">In this case, firstly, the blades <b>200</b> are pressed against the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B which are located to the lower sides in the direction of inclination, and the excess liquid (cleaning liquid, ink, etc.) adhering to the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B on the lower sides is swept with the blades <b>200</b>. Thereupon, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed against the whole surface of each of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the whole of each surface is thereby wiped and cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The controller drives the motors <b>194</b> and causes the wiping webs <b>110</b> to travel, in accordance with the timing at which the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K arrive at the wiping units <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K. Thereby, the traveling wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, thus wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">When the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K have completely passed the cleaning liquid deposition units <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>Y and <b>70</b>K, the driving of the cleaning liquid supply pump <b>86</b> is halted and the supply of cleaning liquid is halted. Thereupon, the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> is withdrawn to the standby position.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">When the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K have completely passed the wiping units <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K, the driving of the motors <b>194</b> is halted and the travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> is halted. Thereupon, the wiping device <b>64</b> is withdrawn to the standby position.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The cleaning of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the inkjet heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is completed by the series of steps described above.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">As described above, in the nozzle surface cleaning apparatus <b>60</b> according to the present embodiment, when wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with the wiping webs <b>110</b>, the liquid which has adhered to the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B located on the lower sides in the direction of inclination is previously swept with the blades <b>200</b>, whereupon the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped by the wiping webs <b>110</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the wiping capability of the wiping webs <b>110</b> declining with the wiping step in the latter stage and giving rise to insufficient wiping. Furthermore, since the blades <b>200</b> wipe only the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B on the lower sides in the direction of inclination, and the blades <b>200</b> do not wipe the nozzle forming regions <b>30</b>A, then the blades <b>200</b> never press the soiled ink into the nozzles. Consequently, it is not necessary to carry out preliminary ejection. Furthermore, since the liquid repelling treatment surfaces are not rubbed and worn by the blades <b>200</b>, then it is possible to extend the lifespan of the heads.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Other Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In the embodiments described above, the composition is adopted in which the liquid adhering to the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B is swept with the blades <b>200</b>; however, the device for sweeping the liquid adhering to the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B is not limited to this. Besides this, it is also possible to press a roller against the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B so as to sweep the excess liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In the embodiments described above, an extremely fine knitted or woven wiping web <b>110</b> made of PET is used, but the composition of the wiping web is not limited to this. It is also possible to use wiping webs having other compositions, provided that they have absorbency. By using a wiping web made of extremely fine knitted or woven material, it is possible to remove adhering material effectively by the undulation of the web surface. Furthermore, by using a wiping web having absorbency as in the present embodiment, it is possible to draw out the cleaning liquid that has entered into the nozzles or ink of increased viscosity on the mouths of the nozzle apertures from the nozzle apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Moreover, although there are no particular restrictions on the direction of travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> with respect to the nozzle surface <b>30</b> (the direction of travel at the position where the web makes contact with the nozzle surface <b>30</b>), it is more desirable to cause the web to travel in the opposite direction to the direction of travel of the nozzle surface <b>30</b> (the direction of movement of the inkjet head).</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In the embodiments described above, the composition is adopted in which the inkjet heads are moved and the cleaning liquid is deposited onto the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b> of the moving heads, but it is also possible to adopt a composition in which the cleaning liquid is deposited onto the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b> of by moving the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> without moving the inkjet heads. Moreover, it is also possible to adopt a composition in which the cleaning liquid is deposited onto the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b> by moving both the inkjet heads <b>16</b> and the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b>. Similarly, it is also possible to wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b> by moving the wiping device <b>64</b> without moving the inkjet heads. Furthermore, it is also possible to adopt a composition in which the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b> are wiped by moving both the inkjet heads <b>16</b> and the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">In the embodiments described above, the composition is adopted in which the blade that removes excess liquid on the nozzle surface is installed on the case main body of the wiping unit, but it is also possible to compose the blade separately from the wiping unit. More specifically, the blade should be capable of wiping the nozzle surface <b>30</b> before the wiping web <b>110</b> wipes the nozzle surface <b>30</b>, and therefore it is sufficient that the blade is disposed in a position before the wiping unit (a position where the blade can wipe the nozzle surface <b>30</b> before the wiping web <b>110</b> wipes the nozzle surface <b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In the embodiments described above, the nozzle surfaces are cleaned in the process of moving the inkjet heads <b>16</b> from the image recording position to the maintenance position, but it is also possible to adopt a composition in which the nozzle surfaces are cleaned in the process of moving the inkjet heads <b>16</b> from the maintenance position to the image recording position. In this case, the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b> is disposed to the maintenance position side of the wiping device <b>64</b>. Furthermore, the blades are disposed toward the side of the cleaning liquid deposition device with respect to the abutment position of the wiping webs <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In the embodiments described above, the cleaning liquid is deposited on the nozzle surfaces by the cleaning liquid deposition device <b>62</b>, but the composition for depositing the cleaning liquid onto the nozzle surfaces (the composition for wetting the nozzle surfaces) is not limited to this. For example, it is also possible to adopt various methods, such as a method of deposition by spraying, a method of deposition by roller application, a method of depositing cleaning liquid in the form of a mist directed toward the nozzle surfaces, or the like. Moreover, it is also possible to place a cap on the nozzle surface and wet the nozzle surface by suctioning. Furthermore, a composition can be adopted in which wiping is performed by a wiping web, without depositing cleaning liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The embodiments described above relate to the case of cleaning the inclined nozzle surface, but the application of the present invention is not limited to this. It can also be applied similarly to a case of cleaning a horizontal nozzle surface. In this case, a composition is adopted in which the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B situated on either side of the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A are wiped with blades. More specifically, a pair of blades are arranged so as to abut and press against both of the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B, and the liquid adhering to the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B is swept with the pair of blades. In a composition where a nozzle protecting region <b>30</b>B is arranged on only one side, a blade is arranged so as to abut and press against the nozzle protecting region <b>30</b>B on that one side. The embodiments described above related to the case where the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A is formed in the withdrawn recessed shape, but the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A may also be formed to the same height as the nozzle protection regions <b>30</b>B. In other words, the nozzle surface may be formed in a flat shape.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The embodiments described above relate to the case where the liquid repelling treatment is applied only on the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A, but it is also possible to apply the liquid repelling treatment on the nozzle protecting regions <b>30</b>B as well.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The embodiments described above relate to the case of cleaning the head in which the nozzles N are arranged in the two-dimensional matrix configuration in the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A (a so-called matrix head), but the arrangement of the nozzles N is not limited to this. For example, the present invention can also be used similarly in a case of cleaning a normal head in which nozzles are arranged in a single straight row in the nozzle forming region <b>30</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Furthermore, in the embodiments described above, the case is described in which the present invention is applied to the inkjet recording apparatus which records images on cut sheets of paper, but the application of the present invention is not limited to this. The present invention can be applied similarly to any droplet ejection apparatus which has a nozzle surface cleaning apparatus that cleans a nozzle surface by wiping with a wiping member having absorbency, and similar actions and beneficial effects can be achieved in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">It should be understood that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the invention is to cover all modifications, alternate constructions and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.</p>
