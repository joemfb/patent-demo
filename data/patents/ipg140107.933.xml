<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a retractable system for protecting penetrations in buildings, and particularly to a retractable, flexible, low-profile, solar, insect, thermal, and storm protection system for windows and doors. The present invention enables a storage and deployment mechanism for roll-up storm protection screens that is approximately 70% smaller than conventional systems while containing approximately 50% greater vertical length of material. This smaller size eases installation and reduces the aesthetic impact of the system on the installation site. Space savings are maintained or improved as the size of the system increases, e.g., to protect larger openings.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Systems exist that attempt to mitigate damage to structures during inclement weather such as hurricanes, cyclones, nor'easters, and thunderstorms. These types of weather systems can carry with them high winds, hail, sleet, and driving rain. High winds can damage structures not only by creating high pressure forces and, for example, blowing windows out, but also by causing loose material and debris to become missiles impacting the structure. In addition, high winds can create driving rain that can penetrate, among other things, window and door seals causing flooding and water damage to the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">&#x201c;Bahama,&#x201d; or colonial-type, conventional storm shutters have been used in an attempt to protect windows and doors during storms. These shutters are typically constructed of a rigid material such as, for example, wood, plastic, or metal, and are sized to cover the opening they protect. These types of shutters typically use a heavy and awkward safety bar to secure the shutters for use. Due in part to their custom construction, however, Bahama storm shutters tend to be expensive, heavy, and can be difficult to deploy.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aluminum roll-up shutter systems are also available. These systems use multiple aluminum panels joined by hinges or pins to form a substantially solid but flexible curtain, similar to a roll-up garage door. These systems are generally available with electric or manual crank deployment. Due to the thickness of the aluminum panels, however, the systems tend to be heavy. Additionally, due to the limited range of motion of the hinges that join the panels, the take-up rolls that store aluminum shutters when not in use are large. As a result, the enclosures for these systems are necessarily large and cumbersome. This makes installation difficult and detracts from the aesthetics of the building on which they are installed. In addition, aluminum roll-up systems are opaque and block most, if not all, of the natural light from the building when deployed. This provides a dark and unpleasant experience to the user, especially given that the power to the building is likely out.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an attempt to reduce cost and increase protection, retractable storm protection systems have been developed. These systems typically use a strong, flexible, fabric curtain or screen made of, for example, polypropylene, PVC, Kevlar&#xae;, Mylar&#xae;, or hybrids thereof. The systems can further comprise a retracting mechanism and a housing in which to store the screen when not in use. The screen is deployed to cover the window and is generally retained in vertical tracks installed in, or on, the window opening. Conventionally, the screen is retained in the track either by sewing a hem cord to the vertical sides of the curtain (as used herein, the &#x201c;hem cord method&#x201d;), or simply by folding the curtain over on itself to form a hem (as used herein, the &#x201c;hem-only method&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">At one end of the spectrum, a hem cord sewn to the edges of the curtain enables the curtain to be retained in a slotted track because the slot is considerably smaller than the diameter of the hem cord. This method retains the curtain in the track at fairly high forces because the diameter of the hem cord is sufficiently large when compared to the slot in the track. Unfortunately, the thick, stiff hem cord requires a large diameter take-up roll on which to retract the curtain (i.e., when the curtain is not deployed). This, in turn, necessitates a large housing, increasing installation difficulty and detracting from the aesthetics of the building, among other things.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">At the other end of the spectrum, the hem-only method involves a hem sewn into the edge of the curtain that can enable it to be retained in a sufficiently small slot in the track. Because the hem is generally only approximately twice the thickness of the fabric itself, this method has a limited ability to retain the curtain in the track. As a result, the application of such systems is limited to smaller openings to minimize pressure forces on the curtain. In other words, at larger opening sizes, such as a large door, the force created by high winds can exceed the ability of the system to retain the curtain. Additionally, the necessarily tight slot in the retaining track can cause jams and hinder operation when deploying or retracting the curtain.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">What is needed, therefore, is a system that combines the retention strength of the conventional hem cord system, with the reduced storage requirements of the hem-only method. It is to such a system that embodiments of the present invention are primarily directed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to storm protection systems and more specifically to a flexible, retractable storm protection system with a reduced volume and increased protection. The system can comprise a curtain or screen made of a strong flexible material, or a composite of such materials. The screen material can comprise, for example and not limitation, Kevlar&#xae;, Mylar&#xae;, vinyl, PVC, nylon, or fiberglass, or combinations thereof. The screen can comprise a loop sewn into both vertical edges.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present system can further comprise vertical channels for securing the vertical edges of the screen. The vertical channels can be substantially C-shaped with a hem rod located inside the channel. The loops in the vertical sides of the screen can encircle the hem rod such that the screen is both guided inside the channel, when being deployed or retracted, and retained in the channel when the screen encounters wind pressure or other forces. The hem rod acts to locate and secure the screen in substantially the same manner as a conventional hem cord, while significantly reducing storage requirements for the screen when retracted.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the system can be installed on the outside of a building penetration, such as for example and not limitation, a door or a window. In this configuration, the system can also protect the door or window from solar heat gain, insect or pest infiltration, and thermal loss, in addition to storm and water damage. In some embodiments, the system can be installed on the inside of a building penetration. In this configuration, the system can provide the same protections for the building, and limited protection for the door or window, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the system can be mounted in the upper portion of a penetration and deployed from the top down (as used herein, the &#x201c;top-down configuration&#x201d;) and can be manually or electrically deployed. In other embodiments, the system can be mounted in the bottom end of a penetration and deployed from the bottom up (as used herein, the &#x201c;bottom-up configuration&#x201d;) and can be electrically or manually deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The system can further comprise a horizontal support unit. The horizontal support unit can span all, or substantially all, of the free horizontal edge of the screen (i.e., the end of the screen not attached to the take-up roll). In some embodiments, such as when the top-down configuration is used, the horizontal support unit can be weighted and can facilitate the deployment of the screen. In other embodiments, such as when the bottom-up configuration is installed, the horizontal support unit can comprise a lightweight, rigid material. In some embodiments, the horizontal support unit can further comprise, for example and not limitation, latches, catches, or pins for securing the screen in the deployed, or partially deployed, position.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present invention can also comprise a method for installing the system on a penetration. The method can comprise affixing one or more C-shaped channels on the sides of the building penetration. An enclosure can then be installed in the top or bottom of the penetration. A screen comprising a horizontal support bar can then be installed to protect the penetration. The system can be installed in a bottom-up configuration. The system can also be installed in a top-down configuration. The method can further comprise installing a manual or electric drive system.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading the following specification in conjunction with the accompanying drawing figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to storm protection systems and more specifically to a flexible, retractable storm protection system with a reduced storage volume and increased protection than that conventionally provided. The system replaces a conventional hem cord design with a stationary hem rod located in a retention channel to provide the security of the hem cord system with the compact size of a hem-only system. The system can employ a retention channel with a hem rod disposed therein. The screen can have a loop sewn into each vertical edge sized to easily slip over the hem rod. The hem rod can retain the curtain in the retention track even when exposed to, for example, high wind, driving rain, and/or impacts from flying objects.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">To simplify and clarify explanation, the system is described below as a system for protecting the windows and doors of residential and commercial buildings. One skilled in the art will recognize, however, that the invention is not so limited. The system can also be deployed to protect other penetrations in most structures during inclement weather or other environmental or man-made threats. Embodiments of the present invention can also be used, for example, to provide protection for residential and commercial properties against vandalism and break-ins.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The materials described hereinafter as making up the various elements of the present invention are intended to be illustrative and not restrictive. Many suitable materials that would perform the same or a similar function as the materials described herein are intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention. Such other materials not described herein can include, but are not limited to, materials that are developed after the time of the development of the invention, for example. The dimensions listed in the various drawings are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to be limiting. Other dimensions and proportions are contemplated and intended to be included within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A problem with conventional storm protection systems has been that the housings required to store the screens for these systems are undesirably large. The relatively large enclosure for the Armor Screen&#xae; Hurricane Protection System by the Armor Screen Corporation, for example, is dictated by the fact that the hem cord product sewn into the edges of the screen requires that a material be wound on approximately a 6&#x2033; diameter take-up device. The large size of the take-up device is due predominantly to the stiff nature of the hem cord installed in the polypropylene screen material used by Armor Screen&#xae;. This hem cord is what guides the screen down each side of the door or window opening and secures the screen in a retention channel on both sides.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In response, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, embodiments of the present invention relate to a system <b>100</b> in which the traditional rope bolt, or hem cord, can be replaced by inserting a side support unit <b>107</b> comprising a fixed rod <b>105</b> inside a C-channel extrusion <b>110</b>. A loop <b>115</b> can then be sewn into the vertical sides of the screen <b>120</b> to slide down the rod <b>105</b> and can secure the fabric inside the extrusions <b>110</b>. With the hem cord removed from the screen <b>120</b>, the material can be flexible enough to be wound onto, for example and not limitation, a 2&#x2033; diameter take-up device.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The hem rod <b>105</b> (as opposed to a hem cord) can enable a storage and deployment mechanism <b>200</b> that is approximately 70% smaller than conventional systems while containing approximately 50% greater vertical length of material. The result is a compact enclosure <b>130</b> that can, for example, contain approximately 90 vertical inches of screen in a box <b>130</b> that is smaller than 4&#x2033;&#xd7;4&#x2033;. For comparison, the smallest Armor Screen&#xae; box is 7&#x2033;&#xd7;7&#x2033; and accommodates a maximum of 60 vertical inches of screen. The smaller enclosure <b>130</b> can ease installation and reduce the aesthetic impact of the system <b>100</b> on the installation site. Space savings are maintained or improved as the size of the system increases, e.g., to protect larger openings.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Various materials, and combinations of materials, can be used to construct the protection screen <b>120</b>. The screen <b>120</b> can provide, for example and not limitation, solar, insect, thermal, and storm (&#x201c;SITS&#x201d;) mitigation attributes. The screen <b>120</b> can comprise a material that meets local, national, or international hurricane, building, and safety codes.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the screen <b>120</b> can be deployed using an extrusion <b>110</b>, e.g., an extruded C-channel <b>110</b>, such that the loop <b>115</b> sewn into, or attached to, the screen <b>120</b> can be slid down a hem rod <b>105</b> mounted inside the channel <b>110</b>. In this configuration, the loop <b>115</b> in the screen <b>120</b> can slide down over the hem rod <b>105</b> and can be retained in the slot <b>125</b> of the channel <b>110</b> by the hem rod <b>105</b>. In other words, the present hem rod <b>105</b> replaces the hem cord or similar material used in commercially-available hem cord-type products. The channel <b>110</b> can be extruded, formed, machined, or fabricated as a single or multi-piece device. The hem rod <b>105</b> can be retained at a first end <b>150</b> of the channel, e.g., the end <b>150</b> in which the screen is considered fully deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the box <b>130</b> is mounted in the top of an opening <b>135</b> and the screen <b>120</b> is vertically deployed downwardly, for example, the hem rod <b>105</b> can be anchored at the bottom end <b>130</b> of the channel <b>110</b>. The hem rod <b>105</b> can be made from many materials that enable it to stand vertically without support. The rod <b>105</b> can be made from, for example and not limitation, metal, plastic, fiberglass, composite material, wood, or combinations thereof. The diameter of the rod can be sufficiently larger than the slot in the channel such that the material cannot be pulled through the slot.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the screen <b>120</b> can be wound onto a take-up cylinder <b>210</b> for storage. The take-up cylinder <b>210</b> can be rotated by, for example and not limitation, an electric motor inside the cylinder, a powered or manual end-mounted gear drive, or by a spring type device. A combination of one or more of these devices can also be utilized within a single operating unit to facilitate both powered and manual operation. This feature can be useful if, for example, the power to the building is interrupted. A spring, such as a torsional spring for example, can be added to provide assistance to the electric motor or manual gear drive. These driving mechanisms can be utilized when the screen <b>120</b> is deployed in the top-down configuration or the bottom-up configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the deployment mechanism <b>205</b> can comprise a deflector <b>215</b>. The deflector <b>215</b> can enable the material of the screen <b>120</b> to be deployed or retracted vertically such that the angle of the screen <b>120</b> is substantially constant, regardless of the length of screen <b>120</b> on the take-up roll <b>210</b> (i.e., the diameter of the take-up roll <b>210</b> increases as the screen <b>120</b> is retracted). In other words, the material <b>120</b> is always deployed such that the angle of entry or exit from the enclosure <b>130</b> is vertical. The deflector <b>215</b> can comprise many appropriate systems including, but not limited to, one or more rollers <b>220</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or a smooth, rounded surface or profile <b>320</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In some embodiments, the deflector <b>215</b> can further comprise non-friction or other coatings to facilitate screen <b>120</b> deployment. The deflector <b>215</b> enables the size of the box <b>130</b> to be further reduced by smoothly, but sharply, turning the screen <b>120</b> fabric from the roll <b>210</b> to a vertical position. This enables the screen <b>120</b> fabric to turn through a much larger angle than would otherwise be possible without damaging or tangling the fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the system <b>400</b>, <b>500</b> can be utilized in both a trapped configuration <b>400</b> face-mounted configuration <b>500</b>. A trapped configuration <b>400</b> can be installed inside a window or door opening <b>405</b> with the take up mechanism <b>410</b> and retention mechanisms <b>105</b>, <b>110</b> all being located within the opening <b>405</b>. The face-mounted installation <b>500</b>, on the other hand, can be attached to the outside surface, or trim <b>505</b>, of the opening <b>610</b>. Both the trapped <b>400</b> and face-mounted <b>500</b> units can be operated either with the box <b>130</b> on the top with the screen <b>120</b> going down (the &#x201c;top-down configuration&#x201d;) or the box <b>130</b> mounted on the bottom with the screen <b>120</b> going up (the &#x201c;bottom-up configuration&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a trap-mounted unit <b>400</b> is installed inside and at the top or bottom of a window or door opening <b>405</b>, for example, with the vertical extrusions <b>110</b> containing the hem rod <b>105</b> mounted inside the opening <b>405</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a face-mounted unit <b>500</b> is attached on the trim <b>505</b> above or below and outside the opening <b>510</b> with the extrusions <b>110</b> containing the fixed hem rod <b>105</b> mounted on the vertical trim <b>505</b> outside the opening <b>510</b>. Both of these installations can be made architecturally discreet and installed in a variety of ways that reduce, or eliminate, their visual impact on the structure. In the case of the new construction, the trap-mounted system <b>400</b> allows for the box <b>205</b> and extrusions <b>110</b> to be built into the window or door opening <b>405</b> in such a way that they are virtually indistinguishable from a regular opening.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The system <b>400</b>, <b>500</b> can also be installed on the inside or the outside of the opening. In other words, it can be installed in front of, or behind, the window or door. When installed on the outside of the window or door, the system <b>400</b>, <b>500</b> can provide additional protection against, among other things, storm damage caused by wind, wind driven missiles, and driving rain. The system <b>400</b>, <b>500</b> can also help reduce solar heat gain, thermal losses, and insect and pest infiltration. In some embodiments, the system <b>400</b>, <b>500</b> can also provide additional insulation value to the structure thereby reducing energy costs.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the system <b>400</b>, <b>500</b> can be installed inside of the window or door (i.e., inside the building). The system <b>400</b>, <b>500</b> can provide the benefits listed above in this configuration, with the obvious exception of storm protection for the outside of the window or door itself. However, this configuration may be useful, for example and not limitation, with certain windows (e.g., casement windows) or out swinging doors. In addition, this configuration enables the screens to be easily deployed from inside the building.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the system can further comprise a horizontal support unit <b>605</b>. The horizontal support unit <b>605</b> can be attached to the free end of the screen <b>120</b> (i.e., opposite the end of the screen <b>120</b> that is attached to the take-up cylinder <b>410</b>). When the screen <b>120</b> is fully retracted into the enclosure <b>130</b>, the horizontal support unit <b>605</b> can either be fully retracted into the enclosure <b>130</b> or exposed just outside the enclosure <b>130</b>. See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. This horizontal support unit <b>605</b> can be made of rigid materials such as, but not limited to, metal, plastic, fiberglass, composite material, wood or other compressed materials.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The horizontal support unit <b>605</b> can contain weight to assist in the deployment of the screen <b>120</b> and/or latching mechanisms <b>610</b>, <b>615</b> to assist in securing the screen <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the horizontal support unit <b>605</b> can comprise locking latches <b>610</b> or pins <b>615</b> that enable the screen <b>120</b> to be secured in many positions between the fully deployed and the fully retracted position. In some embodiments, the latches <b>610</b> can, for example, engage a catch in the sill <b>630</b> of the opening. In other embodiments, pins <b>615</b> can be used to engage holes in the jambs <b>735</b> of the opening. Of course, other configurations are contemplated as other mechanisms could be used to secure the horizontal support unit <b>605</b> to the opening or the channels <b>110</b>, for example. The ability to secure the horizontal support unit <b>605</b> can be useful, for example, to let fresh air in through a partially open window, while maintaining substantial protection for the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the system <b>400</b>, <b>500</b> can further comprise a cable drive to positively deploy the screen <b>120</b>. The cable system can comprise, for example, a system of cables and pulleys to move the screen <b>120</b> and/or the horizontal support unit <b>605</b> up and down rather than relying solely on gravity. This can be useful, for example, during high winds, which tend to create side forces on the screen <b>120</b>, which can increase friction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the cable can be wound around the take-up cylinder <b>410</b> in the opposite direction of the screen <b>120</b>. The cable can then run to a pulley located in the bottom of the extrusion <b>110</b> and back up to the screen <b>120</b>. In this manner, when the take-up cylinder <b>410</b> is rotated to unfurl the screen <b>120</b> (either manually or with an electric motor, for example); the cable is wound onto the take-up cylinder <b>410</b> pulling the screen down. In some embodiments, two or more cables can be used, wound in opposite directions, to provide positive movement of the screen <b>120</b> in both directions. Of course, other cable and pulley configurations are possible and are contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the side support unit <b>107</b> can further define a compartment <b>805</b> sized and shaped to house remote control receivers and/or electrical connections for an electric motor. A cap, or cover, <b>810</b> can be clipped over the compartment <b>805</b> to cover the device and wires. In some embodiments, the cover <b>810</b> can be non-metallic to enable RF transmission to and from remote control receiver/transmitters. In other embodiments, the cover <b>810</b> can be transparent or translucent to enable the use of infrared remote transmitters. The cover <b>810</b> can have various profiles to meet various functional, aesthetic, or architectural needs. The cover <b>810</b> can also have various finishes to, for example and not limitation, match wall or trim colors or to simulate various finishes. The cover <b>810</b> can comprise, for example, plastic, aluminum, or pot metal, and can comprise the same material as the side support unit <b>107</b>, or a different material.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The material used for the screen <b>120</b> preferably has high strength and high light transfer with reasonable visibility and clarity, while still protecting the opening from wind driven rain and missiles, among other things. In some embodiments, the screen <b>120</b> can comprise a sandwich, or bonded layers, of materials comprising, for example and not limitation, clear vinyl, Mylar&#xae;, PVC, fiberglass, or Dynema&#xae;. In some embodiments, one or more layers of the screen <b>120</b> can include a scrim comprising, for example, square, rectangle, or diamond shapes. In one preferred embodiment, the following components can be layered in the following sequence to form the screen <b>120</b> material: Clear vinyl; Mylar; a fiberglass carrier grid supporting a Dynema&#xae; scrim forming square, rectangle, or diamond shapes; and clear vinyl. This sandwich of materials can be, for example, chemically bonded (glued) or mechanically bonded using pressure, with or without heat, during the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A second preferred embodiment of the screen <b>120</b> comprises a woven material comprising high-tenacity polyester threads with a PVC coating in the warp direction and a Kevlar&#xae; (or generic equivalent) with a PVC coating in the fill direction. The diameter of the vinyl and Kevlar coated yarns can vary as well as the warp and fill construction (number of threads per inch) depending on intended use. The material can be thermally set to, among other things, prevent the threads from unraveling when cut. The PVC coating can be colored. This material can provide all four capabilities, i.e., solar, insect, thermal, and storm (or, &#x201c;SITS&#x201d;) in one material. The screen <b>120</b> can further comprise other commercially available fabric materials and can use the base material to establish the loop required for the side retention system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In other embodiments, the vertical sides of the screens <b>120</b> can further comprise a band or edging <b>815</b> sewn vertical edges of the screen <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the edging <b>815</b> can form the loops <b>115</b>. In other embodiments, the edging can be sewn over the loops <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, a fabric system such as, but not limited to, Dacron&#xae; luff tape can be used to reduce friction between the loop <b>115</b>, the hem rod <b>105</b>, and the retention channel <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the luff tape can further comprise Teflon&#xae; thread, or other low friction materials, woven into, or adhered to, the banding for added lubricity.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the side support unit <b>107</b> can further comprise closed cell foam or rubber backing <b>820</b> disposed between the side support unit <b>107</b> and the mounting surface <b>135</b> to prevent air and water leakage between side support unit <b>107</b> and the surface <b>135</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the side support unit <b>107</b> can be affixed to the structure <b>135</b> using a fastener <b>140</b> with a sealing washer <b>145</b>. The sealing washer <b>145</b> can comprise rubber, plastic, or other material suitable for forming a water tight seal between the fastener <b>140</b> and the side support unit <b>107</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the fastener <b>140</b> can comprise a stainless steel and EPDM rubber bonded washer <b>145</b> between the head of the fastener <b>140</b> and the side support unit <b>107</b>. The washer <b>145</b> can prevent both leaking and galvanic corrosion where the fastener <b>140</b> penetrates the side support unit <b>107</b> and the mounting surface <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the ability to deploy the system from the inside of the building can also be provided on an external mount installation with the proper hardware. The system can comprise a remote drive system <b>1000</b> comprising one or more driveshafts <b>1005</b> coupled to a drive mechanism <b>1020</b>. In some embodiments, the driveshafts <b>1005</b> can be coupled to the drive mechanism <b>1020</b>, and each other, by one or more universal joints <b>1025</b>. This can enable the drive handle for the screen <b>120</b> to be remotely located. This can be useful, for example, for a very tall window to enable the drive handle to be located at a lower, safer, more convenient location. This drive system <b>1000</b> can also enable a drive motor to be located remotely from the enclosure, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the screen <b>120</b> is wound around the take-up cylinder <b>410</b>, the loop <b>115</b> sewn into the sides of the screen <b>120</b> tends to flatten. This is advantageous in that it minimizes the storage space required to store the screen <b>120</b> when not in use. When the screen <b>120</b> is deployed, however, it is desirable to open the loop <b>115</b> in the screen <b>120</b> to enable it to slide easily over the end <b>1105</b> of the hem rod <b>105</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>a</i>, therefore, in some embodiments the system can further comprise a loop opener <b>1110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The loop opener <b>1110</b> can comprise a projection, or roller, disposed in one or both retention channels, proximate the upper ends <b>1105</b> of the hem rods <b>105</b>.<sup>1 </sup>As the screen <b>120</b> is deployed past the loop opener <b>1110</b>, the edge of the screen <b>120</b> is pushed inward by the loop opener <b>1110</b>, causing the loop <b>115</b> to open as is comes off the roll <b>410</b>. This can enable the loop <b>115</b> to start over the top <b>1105</b> of the hem rod <b>105</b> and can prevent jams and bunching during initial deployment. <sup>1 </sup>Of course, the loop opener would be positioned in the bottom of the retention channel in the bottom-up configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the end of the hem rod <b>105</b> can comprise a tapered upper portion <b>1105</b> to help start the loops <b>115</b> in the screen <b>120</b> over the end <b>1105</b> of the hem rod <b>105</b>. The tapered portion <b>1105</b> can comprise a separate piece, or cap, placed on top, or inserted into the top end of the hem rod <b>105</b>. In other embodiments, the tapered portion <b>1105</b> can be cast, molded, or machined into the end of the hem rod <b>105</b> such that the hem rod and the tapered portion <b>1105</b> are unitary. In some embodiments, the tapered portion <b>1105</b> can be made from the same material as the hem rod <b>105</b>. In other embodiments, the tapered portion <b>1105</b> can comprise a different material than the hem rod <b>105</b> that has desirable properties such as, for example and not limitation, a low coefficient of friction. The tapered portion <b>1105</b> can be made from, for example and not limitation, metal, plastic, fiberglass, composite material, wood, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown, the loop opener <b>1110</b> can be a simple projection, or finger, disposed in the retention channel <b>110</b> near the top <b>1105</b> of the hem rod <b>105</b>. The loop opener <b>1110</b> can be part of the retention channel <b>110</b> or can be a separate part affixed to the retention channel <b>110</b> during manufacture. In some embodiments, the loop opener <b>1110</b> can comprise a low-friction material or can be coated in a low-friction material to reduce wear the screen <b>120</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>b</i>, in other embodiments, the loop opener <b>1110</b> can further comprise a wheel or ball on the end of the projection to further reduce wear on the screen <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Embodiments of the present invention can further comprise a method of installing the system <b>400</b> for a trapped configuration. In this configuration, the enclosure <b>130</b> can be mounted inside the window or door opening. In some embodiments, the enclosure <b>130</b> can comprise a rubber, or high-density foam, backing <b>420</b> to seal adjacent surfaces of the enclosure <b>130</b> to the mounting surface <b>505</b>. The retention channels <b>110</b> can be installed on the vertical sides of the opening <b>405</b>. In some embodiments, the retention channels <b>110</b> can comprise a rubber, or high-density foam, backing <b>425</b> to seal adjacent surfaces of the channels <b>110</b> to the mounting surface <b>405</b>. In some embodiments, installation may further comprise installing and/or connecting remote control electronics, remote drive systems, and/or additional trim pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The retention channels <b>110</b> and/or the enclosure <b>130</b> can be affixed to the structure using, for example and not limitation, screws, bolts, or rivets. In some embodiment, the fasteners <b>140</b> can further comprise a sealing washer <b>145</b> to prevent air and water leaks and galvanic corrosion between the fastener <b>140</b>, channels <b>110</b>, enclosure <b>130</b>, and structure <b>505</b>. Installation for the face-mounted configuration <b>500</b> is substantially similar with the exceptions that the enclosure <b>130</b> and channels <b>110</b> are mounted on the outside of the window or door opening, e.g., on the window trim <b>505</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the system can be installed with the enclosure <b>130</b> on the left or right side of an opening and the retention channels <b>110</b> on the top and bottom of the opening. This may be necessary due to the type of opening or the type of window or door in the opening. The installation procedure can be substantially the same, though rotated 90 degrees in all respects. A system installed in this manner would not have the benefit of gravity, as in the top-down system, and thus may need to be manually deployed. The system would nonetheless function as intended.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in still other embodiments, the system <b>1200</b> can be completely manually deployed. In other words, the system <b>1200</b> can comprise retention channels <b>110</b> and the screen <b>120</b> with no enclosure <b>130</b> or deployment mechanisms <b>1020</b>. In this configuration, the user can simply install the retention channels <b>110</b> on either side of the penetration <b>1205</b>, and then slide the screen <b>120</b> down over the hem rods <b>105</b> and into the retention channels <b>110</b>. The screen <b>120</b> can then be secured at the bottom and/or the top of the penetration <b>1205</b> as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">This configuration can be useful if the subject building is, for example, a summer home. The user can deploy screen <b>120</b> over some or all of the external building penetrations at the end of the season. The user can then remove the screens <b>120</b> at the beginning of the season when reopening the house. Because there is no hem cord, the screens <b>120</b> can be stacked and stored flat, or rolled up, for storage in minimal space. In addition, because the system is somewhat simplified (e.g., there is no enclosure <b>130</b> or deployment mechanisms <b>1020</b>), the cost of purchasing, installing, and maintaining the system <b>1200</b> is reduced. Finally, the aesthetic impact to the structure is minimized because, when removed, only the retention channels <b>110</b> remain on the building. In some embodiments, the retention channels <b>110</b> can also be removable, further reducing aesthetic impact.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While several possible embodiments are disclosed above, embodiments of the present invention are not so limited. For instance, while several possible configurations of materials for the screen have been disclosed, other suitable materials and combinations of materials could be selected without departing from the spirit of embodiments of the invention. In addition, the location and configuration used for various features of embodiments of the present invention can be varied according to a particular opening or building design that requires a slight variation due to, for example, the materials used and/or space or power constraints. Such changes are intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The specific configurations, choice of materials, and the size and shape of various elements can be varied according to particular design specifications or constraints requiring a device, system, or method constructed according to the principles of the invention. Such changes are intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention. The presently disclosed embodiments, therefore, are considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description, and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalents thereof are intended to be embraced therein.</p>
