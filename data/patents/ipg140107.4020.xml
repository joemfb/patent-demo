<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A foreign-matter inspection apparatus is implemented which allows the stable detection sensitivity to be maintained. A laser beam emitted from a laser apparatus is applied to a beam irradiation sample via an irradiation unit and a mirror. Then, the laser beam is captured into a beam-capturing camera via an image-forming lens and a beam-direction switching mirror. Based on the captured beam image, an image computational processing unit judges inclination of the laser beam, then adjusting the irradiation unit thereby to correct the inclination of the laser beam. Also, the beam is captured into the beam-capturing camera in specified number-of-times while focus of the laser beam is being changed by an arbitrary amount by the irradiation unit. Based on the captured beam, the focus of the laser beam is corrected by adjusting the irradiation unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a foreign-matter inspection apparatus for detecting a foreign matter, scratch, defect, dirt, and the like existing on the surface of a inspection target such as a semiconductor wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As disclosed in JP-A-2005-283190, in an apparatus for detecting a foreign matter (including scratch, defect, dirt, and the like) existing on the surface of a inspection target, a semiconductor wafer, the foreign matter is detected as follows: The surface of the semiconductor wafer is irradiated with laser light. Next, reflected light or scattered light is detected from the surface of the semiconductor wafer, thereby detecting the foreign matter existing on the surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The laser beam, with which the surface of the semiconductor wafer is irradiated, is of a transversely-long elliptic shape. Moreover, the beam is emitted and applied thereto in a manner of being parallel to a camera. By maintaining this parallel state, i.e., by executing the beam irradiation in the same state always, it becomes possible to stabilize foreign-matter detection sensitivity of the foreign-matter inspection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described above, in the foreign-matter inspection apparatus, the foreign-matter detection sensitivity is stabilized by irradiating the surface of a inspection target with the laser light in the same state always.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some cases, however, an assembly error occurs in the structure inside the foreign-matter inspection apparatus due to a reason such as time-lapse change. In this case, the beam with which the surface of the semiconductor wafer is irradiated cannot maintain the parallel state with respect to the camera. As a result, it turns out that the beam is emitted and applied to the semiconductor wafer in a state where the beam becomes oblique to the camera or the beam is not focused. When the beam cannot maintain the parallel state or the like with respect to the camera, the foreign-matter detection accuracy is dropped, and thus the sensitivity becomes lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the conventional technology, no consideration has been given to this point. Accordingly, there has existed a possibility that the foreign-matter detection sensitivity becomes unstable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a foreign-matter inspection apparatus and foreign-matter inspection method which allows the stable detection sensitivity to be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is provided a foreign-matter inspection method of the present invention for detecting a foreign matter by irradiating surface of a flat-plane-shaped inspection target with an ellipse-shaped laser beam, the foreign matter including scratch, defect, and dirt, and existing on the surface of the inspection target, the foreign-matter inspection method including the steps of irradiating the surface of a flat-plane portion of the beam irradiation sample with the generated laser beam, the beam irradiation sample being fixed to an inspection stage for the inspection target, photographing the laser beam by using a photographing unit, the laser beam being reflected from the beam irradiation sample, forming a beam image based on the laser beam photographed, calculating, from the beam image, an inclination angle of the laser beam's major axis or minor axis relative to a constant reference line, and correcting the inclination angle of the laser beam.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Hereinafter, referring to the accompanying drawings, the explanation will be given below concerning embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic configuration diagram of a foreign-matter inspection apparatus which is an embodiment of the present invention. This is the diagram where the present invention is applied to the foreign-matter inspection apparatus for inspecting a foreign matter existing on the surface of a semiconductor wafer. Incidentally, excluding components such as cover for covering the foreign-matter inspection apparatus, base, and operating table, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the schematic configuration extending from a laser apparatus to a stage of capturing a beam image. Additionally, a foreign matter, scratch, defect, dirt, and the like are generically referred to and defined as &#x201c;foreign matter&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the foreign-matter inspection apparatus includes the laser apparatus <b>10</b>, an irradiation unit <b>20</b>, a beam-irradiation-angle switching mirror <b>30</b>, a beam irradiation sample <b>40</b>, an image-forming lens <b>50</b>, a beam-direction switching mirror <b>60</b>, a beam-capturing camera <b>70</b>, and a flat-plane-shaped inspection stage <b>80</b>. A semiconductor wafer <b>90</b>, i.e., a flat-plane-shaped inspection target, is disposed on the inspection stage <b>80</b>. A foreign matter or the like existing on the surface of this semiconductor wafer <b>90</b> is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Here, the beam irradiation sample <b>40</b> is fixed to the inspection stage <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A foreign-matter inspection operation is performed as follows: The inspection stage <b>80</b> is scanned in the X and Y directions while irradiating the semiconductor wafer <b>90</b> on the inspection stage <b>80</b> with a light beam emitted from the laser apparatus <b>10</b>. Then, the light beam emitted from the laser apparatus <b>10</b> passes through the irradiation unit <b>20</b>. Moreover, the light beam is changed in its angle by the beam-irradiation-angle switching mirror <b>30</b>, thereby being applied from an oblique direction to the semiconductor wafer <b>90</b> disposed on the inspection stage <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A scattered light of the light beam applied to the semiconductor wafer <b>90</b> is captured into the beam-capturing camera <b>70</b> via the image-forming lens <b>50</b> and the beam-direction switching mirror <b>60</b>, thereby being recognized as a foreign matter.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An automatic adjustment operation of the foreign-matter detection sensitivity is automatically carried out immediately before carrying out the above-described foreign-matter inspection operation. Hereinafter, the explanation will be given below concerning the automatic adjustment operation of the foreign-matter detection sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram for illustrating an optical portion of the irradiation unit <b>20</b>. The diagram (A) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a flat plane thereof, (B) illustrates a side plane thereof, (C) illustrates a flat plane of a state where the optical portion is rotated from the state in (A), and (D) illustrates a side plane of the state in (C). The optical portion includes two cylindrical lenses <b>20</b><i>c </i>and <b>20</b><i>d </i>and one raw glass <b>20</b><i>e</i>. The cylindrical lenses <b>20</b><i>c </i>and <b>20</b><i>d </i>are combined with each other in a folding-fan shapes with the raw glass <b>20</b><i>e </i>positioned therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The optical portion is not only rotatable as is indicated by an arrow <b>1</b>, but also is movable in the up-and-down direction as is indicated by an arrow <b>2</b>. The light beam emitted from the laser apparatus <b>10</b> passes through the optical portion as is indicated by an arrow <b>3</b>. On account of this, rotating the optical portion as is indicated by the arrow <b>1</b> makes it possible to correct the inclination of the laser beam (i.e., inclination of the ellipse-shaped beam's major axis or minor axis relative to a constant reference line). Also, moving the optical portion in the up-and-down direction as is indicated by the arrow <b>2</b> makes it possible to focus width of the laser beam. Here, the constant reference line can be defined as a constant reference line on an image plane photographed by the beam-capturing camera <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an explanatory diagram for explaining the beam irradiation sample <b>40</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the raw material of which the beam irradiation sample <b>40</b> is composed is alumina ceramic (aluminum-oxide ceramic), which is low-cost, and is superior in abrasion-resistant property, heat-resistant property, and impact-resistant property. Moreover, beam irradiation surface of the beam irradiation sample <b>40</b> is polished so that the surface diffusely reflects the laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The beam irradiation sample <b>40</b> is mounted to the inspection stage <b>80</b>. The dimension of the beam irradiation sample <b>40</b> is, e.g., about 40 mm in transverse dimension Y, about 10 mm in longitudinal dimension X, and about 10 mm in height dimension Z.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an operation-control functional block diagram of inclination correction and focus correction for the laser beam. Incidentally, in this operation-control functional block diagram, the mirrors <b>30</b> and <b>60</b> and the inspection stage <b>80</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the laser beam emitted from the laser apparatus <b>10</b> passes through the irradiation unit <b>20</b>, then being applied to the beam irradiation sample <b>40</b>. Moreover, the beam applied to the beam irradiation sample <b>40</b> is reflected by this beam irradiation sample <b>40</b>, thereby being captured into the beam-capturing camera <b>70</b> via the image-forming lens <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The beam image captured by the beam-capturing camera <b>70</b> is converted into an image file by an image-capturing board <b>71</b>. Next, an image computational processing unit (i.e., computational control unit) <b>72</b> computes inclination correction amount and focus correction amount for the laser beam. The inclination correction amount and focus correction amount computed by the image computational processing unit <b>72</b> are respectively supplied to a beam-inclination correcting motor driver <b>75</b><i>a </i>and a beam-focus correcting motor driver <b>75</b><i>b </i>via a motor-driver interface <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The beam-inclination correcting motor driver <b>75</b><i>a </i>activates a beam-inclination correction mechanism <b>20</b><i>a</i>, thereby rotating the optical portion illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and correcting the inclination of the laser beam as was described above. Also, the beam-focus correcting motor driver <b>75</b><i>b </i>activates a beam-focus correction mechanism <b>20</b><i>b</i>, thereby moving the optical portion illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in the up-and-down direction, and correcting the focus of the laser beam as was described above.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The laser beam whose inclination and focus have been corrected passes through the same route as the above-described one, then being supplied into the image-capturing board <b>71</b>. Moreover, the laser beam is converted into the image file, then being image-displayed on a display <b>73</b> by the image computational processing unit <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Incidentally, the image computational processing unit <b>72</b> is configured with a computer. In accordance with computer programs, the unit <b>72</b> performs the laser-beam inclination correction and width correction of the irradiation unit <b>20</b>. Also, the unit <b>72</b> performs operation controls over the mirrors <b>30</b> and <b>60</b> and the inspection stage <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart (which is also available for flowchart for computer program) ranging from the beam irradiation to adjusting and setting the beam inclination at an optimum value.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at the time of the detection-sensitivity automatic adjustment, the laser beam emitted from the laser apparatus <b>10</b> passes through the above-described route, then being applied to the beam irradiation sample <b>40</b>. Next, the light beam is captured into the beam-capturing camera <b>70</b> via the image-forming lens <b>50</b> and the beam-direction switching mirror <b>60</b> (steps <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>). Moreover, the captured beam image is stored into the file, and then the stored image file is divided in the X direction and is read by the image computational processing unit <b>72</b> (steps <b>203</b> and <b>204</b>). The divided and read data, which are luminance data, are quantified into numerical values. Furthermore, the image computational processing unit <b>72</b> integrates the quantified data in the Y direction (step <b>205</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, the image computational processing unit <b>72</b> applies a smoothing processing to the integrated data in order to eliminate noise components from the integrated data (step <b>206</b>). Then, the unit <b>72</b> acquires Y coordinates each of which corresponds to a maximum value of the numerical values of the divided and smoothed data (step <b>207</b>). Finally, the unit <b>72</b> plots, into a graph, the Y coordinates each of which corresponds to the maximum value, then determining the inclination from this graph (step <b>208</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a diagram for illustrating the beam image in the case where the transversely-long-ellipse-shaped laser beam is inclined. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a diagram for illustrating the data on the Y coordinates of the maximum values of the divided and smoothed luminance values. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a reference numeral <b>301</b> denotes the beam irradiation portion, and <b>300</b> denotes a portion which is not irradiated with the beam. Also, <b>302</b> denotes the Y axis (longitudinal axis) of the beam image, <b>303</b> denotes the X axis (transverse axis) of the beam image, and <b>304</b> denotes the Y coordinates of the maximum values at the time when the luminance values within the width divided in the X direction are integrated in the Y direction. A linear straight-line expression y=ax+b is determined from the graph illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, thereby calculating the inclination a (step <b>208</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At this time, if the inclination a falls within an apparatus-sensitivity tolerance range, no correction operation is executed, then terminating the operation flow (steps <b>209</b> and <b>211</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Meanwhile, if, at the step <b>209</b>, the inclination a falls outside the apparatus-sensitivity tolerance range, the beam-inclination correction mechanism <b>20</b><i>a </i>is activated, then getting back to the step <b>202</b> (steps <b>209</b> and <b>210</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a diagram for illustrating the beam after the beam inclination has been adjusted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is a diagram for illustrating a graph of the maximum data on the luminance values after the beam inclination has been adjusted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a reference numeral <b>401</b> denotes the beam irradiation portion, and <b>400</b> denotes a portion which is not irradiated with the beam. Also, <b>402</b> denotes the Y axis of the beam image, <b>403</b> denotes the X axis of the beam image, and <b>404</b> denotes the Y coordinates of the maximum values at the time when the luminance values within the width divided in the X direction are integrated in the Y direction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, it can be judged that the beam inclination has been corrected. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> may be displayed on the display <b>73</b> at the time of the detection-sensitivity adjustment. Otherwise, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> may be displayed on the display <b>73</b> at the time of the maintenance alone for confirming the beam inclination.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, the explanation will be given below concerning the focus correction for the laser beam. In this beam focus correction, the focus of the beam is automatically recognized, and is adjusted at a position at which the beam is focused most. The position at which the beam is focused most is a position at which the width of the beam is the narrowest.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an operation flowchart for adjusting and setting the focus position of the laser beam at an optimum value, i.e., the focus-correction operation flowchart (which is also available for flowchart for computer program).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Steps <b>501</b> to <b>503</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are basically the same operations as the ones at the steps <b>201</b> to <b>203</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. At a step <b>504</b>, it is judged whether or not the beam-image-captured number-of-times has attained to a predetermined value. If the beam-image-captured number-of-times has not attained to the predetermined value, the processing proceeds to a step <b>505</b>. At this step <b>505</b>, the beam-focus correction mechanism <b>20</b><i>b </i>is activated by an arbitrary displacement amount, then getting back to the step <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Meanwhile, if, at the step <b>504</b>, the beam-image-captured number-of-times has attained to the predetermined value, the processing proceeds to a step <b>506</b>, where the data are read from the stored image file. The read data, which are luminance data, are quantified into numerical values (step <b>507</b>). Moreover, the quantified data are integrated in the Y direction, then being smoothed (step <b>508</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The maximum value of the integrated and smoothed data is determined (step <b>509</b>). A value is determined which is equal to the one-half of the maximum value determined, then defining and employing this value as a threshold value (step <b>510</b>). Furthermore, the distance between both ends of the luminance data attaining to the threshold value is defined as the width of the beam (step <b>511</b>). The steps <b>506</b> to <b>511</b> are repeated until all of the captured beam images have been processed (step <b>512</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A diagram (A) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the beam width at the time of determining the width of the beam. A diagram (B) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a graph indicating numerical value data on the beam width. A reference numeral <b>601</b> denotes the beam irradiation portion, and <b>600</b> denotes a portion which is not irradiated with the beam. Also, <b>602</b> denotes the Y axis of the beam images, <b>603</b> denotes the X axis of the beam images, <b>604</b> denotes the luminance value resulting from integrating the beam images in the Y direction, and <b>605</b> denotes the one-half of the maximum luminance value.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">From all of the captured beam images, a position of the beam-focus correction mechanism <b>20</b><i>b </i>at which the beam width is the narrowest is calculated. Then, the beam-focus correction mechanism <b>20</b><i>b </i>is adjusted and set at the beam-focus correction mechanism coordinate at which the beam width is the narrowest (steps <b>513</b> and <b>514</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a diagram for illustrating a screen <b>700</b> of a message character string <b>701</b> displayed on the display while carry-out of the sensitivity automatic adjustment is underway in the embodiment of the present invention. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a diagram for illustrating a screen <b>800</b> of a message character string <b>801</b> displayed on the display when the sensitivity automatic adjustment is over in the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the message <b>701</b> of &#x201c;Now Adjusting a sensitivity automatically&#x201d; is displayed while execution of the sensitivity automatic adjustment is underway. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the message <b>801</b> of &#x201c;Apparatus sensitivity is normal&#x201d; is displayed when the sensitivity automatic adjustment is over normally. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a message of &#x201c;Apparatus sensitivity is abnormal&#x201d; is displayed at the time of abnormality.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a diagram for illustrating a log file for recording the history which remains when the sensitivity automatic adjustment is carried out in the embodiment of the present invention. Requirements to be recorded in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> are date <b>901</b>, time <b>902</b>, and a message <b>903</b> indicating whether the termination when the sensitivity automatic adjustment is carried out is a normal termination or an abnormal termination.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the above-described example, either of the laser-beam inclination correction and the laser-beam focus correction may be executed. Otherwise, both of them may be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram for illustrating a flowchart in the case where both of the laser-beam inclination correction and the laser-beam focus correction are executed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the laser-beam inclination correction illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is executed at a step <b>1000</b>. After that, the laser-beam focus correction illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is executed at a step <b>1001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When both of the laser-beam inclination correction and the laser-beam focus correction are executed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the laser-beam focus correction (step <b>1001</b>) is executed, and the laser-beam inclination correction (step <b>1000</b>) is executed. After that, the laser-beam focus correction (step <b>1002</b>) may be executed once again in order to implement an enhancement in the accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As having been explained so far, according to the present invention, it becomes possible to implement the foreign-matter inspection apparatus, foreign-matter inspection method, and computer program for the foreign-matter inspection apparatus which allows the stable detection sensitivity to be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Namely, even if an imposition error occurs in the structure inside the foreign-matter inspection apparatus due to a reason such as time-lapse change, the inclination and focus of the laser beam can be automatically adjusted and set into a constant state before the foreign-matter inspection operation. This feature makes it possible to prevent a lowering in the foreign-matter detection sensitivity, thereby allowing the stable detection sensitivity to be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Incidentally, the above-described embodiment is an embodiment in the case where the present invention is applied to the foreign-matter inspection apparatus for detecting a foreign matter existing on a semiconductor-wafer surface. Not being limited to the semiconductor wafer, however, the present invention is also applicable to surface foreign-matter inspections in the other flat-plane-shaped inspection targets.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It should be further understood by those skilled in the art that although the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention, the invention is not limited thereto and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.</p>
