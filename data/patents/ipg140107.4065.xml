<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-198907 filed with Japanese Patent Office on Aug. 28, 2009, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus and an image forming method for forming an image on a recording sheet. In details, it relates to the apparatus and method that, in cases where a display scale of a display screen is reduced, display job images of two or more jobs having been displayed on a display screen, as overlapped images at a same display area, and enable to select each of the overlapped images of the jobs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, image forming apparatuses such as a digital multifunctional peripheral provided with a copier function, scanner function, printer function and a facsimile function are commonly used. The operation of the image forming apparatus is conducted by the use of a display device having a touch panel type operation function provided on the image forming apparatus main-body, or a key board or a mouse of a computer connected via LAN, to the image forming apparatus and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, in cases where a user operates the image forming apparatus by operating the touch panel, information is inputted by touching a finger or a touch pen on the display screen. In this case, since the touch panel does not have a left button or a right button unlike the mouse, left click operation, right click operation or drug operation cannot be conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2007-226571 (Patent Document 1), disclosed is an electronic apparatus which, in the case of executing the touch panel operation, displays a pointer at the touched position of operation items (button, etc.) displayed on the screen, and displays a selection menu for executing the operations of left click, right click or drug and the like. According to this apparatus, the similar operational movement as the left click, right click or drug operation by the mouse can be performed by the selection from the selection menu.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, in the electronic apparatus described in the Patent Document 1, sizes of buttons and the like which are operation objects on the screen of display are usually determined by considering the operation of touch panel and the operation of mouse. However, regarding the object whose size and position cannot be unambiguously determined due to scale change and the like on the screen, the above-described configuration cannot be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, in the screen configuration to display, on a horizontal axis taken as a time axis, a reserved job (job bar) in a size corresponding to a time scale, the job (job bar) itself may become invisibly small size on the screen when the scale of horizontal time axis is change to be a scale of large unit. Further, in cases where these kinds of jobs exist in succession, a status arises where a plurality of jobs exist in a size of one dot which being the minimum unit on the screen. In such cases, a user needs operations to change the display scale in order to make the jobs visible and selectable size.</p>

On this job control screen <b>600</b>, for example, when scheduling button <b>312</b> is selected, schedule screen <b>300</b> is displayed in job control screen <b>600</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Job schedule screen <b>300</b> is a screen for making predictable of user's action beforehand, such as sheet supplying and/or changing by visually notifying a residual time of each job, used sheet tray, residual amount of transfer sheet, machine stop timing, and the like. On the vertical axis of job schedule screen, connected sheet trays are arranged, and on the horizontal axis a time axis is arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">On the vertical axis indicating connected sheet trays of job schedule screen <b>300</b>, pieces of sheet tray information (tray <b>1</b>-tray <b>6</b>) for sheet tray <b>9</b>, etc, of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> and pieces of sheet tray information of post processing apparatus <b>200</b> connected to image forming apparatus <b>100</b> are displayed in order from the upper left side of job schedule screen <b>300</b>. For example, at the column of tray <b>1</b> the sheet tray information of &#x201c;infinite form&#x201d; is displayed, at the column of tray <b>2</b> the sheet tray information of &#x201c;B4 (lateral) plain paper&#x201d; is displayed, at the columns of tray <b>3</b> the sheet tray information of &#x201c;A4 (longitudinal) plain paper&#x201d; is displayed. By these sheet tray information, such as a reserved job which requires plural sheet trays can be recognized, and sheet tray information of jobs including the job under outputting prints can be recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">On the horizontal axis representing time axis of job schedule screen <b>300</b>, numerical numbers are displayed corresponding to the display scale having been set, which enables to visually recognize the required time for each job. For example in the case where full display scale is 30 minutes, numeric characters of 0, 10, 20, and 30 are displayed. At bottom center portion of job schedule screen <b>300</b>, zoom buttons to change the display scale are indicated. Zoom buttons are configured with a reduction button <b>320</b> for reducing the display scale and an enlargement button <b>322</b> for enlarging the display scale. Users can freely change the display scale by selectively operating reduction button <b>320</b> or enlargement button <b>322</b>. The range of switching the display scale is, for example, 23 steps from minimum 30 minutes to maximum 24 hours in full scale.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Time information corresponding to the display scale of job schedule screen <b>300</b> is stored in nonvolatile memory <b>46</b> every time of switching the display scale. For example, at the time of power ON, at the time of mode transition, and at the time of screen transition from other screen, the time information stored in nonvolatile memory <b>46</b> is read out, and based on this time information the numerical numbers on the time axis of job schedule screen <b>300</b> are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In job schedule screen <b>300</b>, a reserved job and a job on outputting are displayed by job bars (job images) JB based on used sheet tray, execution order of the job, and residual time. In the present example, job bars JB<b>1</b>-JB<b>7</b> respectively corresponding to seven reserved jobs <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> are displayed on job schedule screen <b>300</b>, in ascending execution order along the time axis from left end of the screen. The borders of adjoining jobs (job bar JB) are indicated by dotted separation lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref>, however adjoining jobs may be discriminated by alternately displaying with dark and light background colors. For example, job <b>5</b> is displayed on the position of tray <b>2</b> in the vertical axis and in the fifth job display area separated by dotted lines.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Length of job bar JB in the direction of time axis indicates a job execution time (residual time). For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the case of job <b>5</b> the execution time is approximately 1 minute 40 seconds. Wherein, by adding up the other job bars JB, an clock time of execution for a selected job can be known. For example, by adding up the execution times of jobs <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>, the clock time of execution for job <b>5</b> is known to be approximately 3 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, in order to display residual number of sheet S in the connected sheet trays, job bars JB are displayed with separate colors. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref>, blue job bar JB is indicated by shaded bar and red job bar JB is indicated by void bar. In the drawings, shaded job bars JB (JB<b>1</b>, JB<b>2</b>, JB<b>3</b>, JB<b>4</b>, JB<b>5</b>, and JB<b>6</b>) indicate that sufficient sheet S are accommodated in the sheet trays, and printing is capable. Further, void job bars JB (JB<b>3</b> and JB<b>7</b>) indicate the status that no sheet S is available in the sheet tray, or print outputting will be stopped due to shortage of sheet S. Thus, users can visually recognize the status of sheet trays and can recognize beforehand the necessity of sheet supply. Two colors are used for color discrimination in the example however, three or more colors may be used.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Next, a configuration example of job schedule screen <b>300</b> after the change of display screen will be explained. When reduction button <b>320</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is selected, the display scale is reduced sequentially or in stepwise. When reduction button becomes in un-operated state, the reducing of the display scale is stopped. In this example, a case where the display scale is changed from &#x201c;30 minutes&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to &#x201c;4 hours&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is explained. On the horizontal axis indicating the time axis of job schedule screen <b>300</b>, numerical numbers of 0, 0.5, 1.0, . . . 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 are displayed. Meanwhile, by reducing the display scale, job <b>8</b> which was not shown in &#x201c;30 minutes&#x201d; display scale is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In cases where the display sizes of each of adjoining two job bars JB becomes not larger than the minimum display unit when the display scale is changed to a large scale (when display size is reduced), said two job bars are displayed as the overlapped images in one and the same area. Here, the one and the same area is an area for displaying the adjoining job bars that became not larger than the minimum display unit, and said area can be arbitrarily set by a user. For example, in cases where the minimum display unit is set to be one pixel, the consecutive two job bars JB are displayed by the minimum display unit of one pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">To be more specific, in cases where each of the two consecutive job bars JB<b>2</b> and JB<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> becomes not larger than the minimum display unit by reduction, job bar JB<b>2</b> and job bar JB<b>3</b> are displayed as a single bar JBcom in appearance as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in the display area arranged at a boundary area between job <b>1</b> and job <b>4</b>. Although, job bar JB<b>2</b> is overlapped upon job bar JB<b>3</b> in this example, job bar JB<b>3</b> may be overlapped upon job bar JB<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When job bar JBcom where a plurality of jobs are overlapped is selected, popup screen <b>400</b> is displayed, which corresponds to any of the job bars JB among the plurality of ovelapped job bars a For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in cases where job bar JBcom in which job bar JB<b>2</b> and job bar JB<b>3</b> are overlapped is selected, for example, popup screen <b>400</b>A corresponding to job bar JB<b>2</b> is displayed out of the two job bars.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, an example of behavior of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> relating to the present invention will be described with referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Firstly, in a case where displaying job schedule screen <b>300</b> is requested, a behavior example of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in step S<b>100</b> image control section <b>42</b> draws a background of job schedule screen <b>300</b> excepting job bars JB, when scheduling button <b>312</b> is selected by an operation of operation section <b>64</b>. The background includes displays of sheet size in the connected sheet tray, numeric numbers corresponding to the display scale, reduction button <b>320</b>, enlarge button <b>322</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In step S<b>110</b>, image control section <b>42</b> reads out and obtains job setting information <b>410</b> for each job including order number of execution, sheet tray to be used, and execution time period, from HDD<b>58</b>. For example, in the case of job <b>5</b>, image control section <b>42</b> obtains information including order number of job execution: 5th, sheet tray to be used: tray <b>2</b>, and execution time period: 1 minute and 40 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In step S<b>120</b>, image control section <b>42</b> converts the obtained execution time period to a display size corresponding to the display scale. Namely, image control section <b>42</b> calculates a length of job bar JB corresponding to each job in the time axis direction based on the display scale having been set and the execution time period of the job.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In step S<b>130</b>, image control section <b>42</b> adds up execution time periods of all jobs prior to each job, and calculates an execution clock time of the each job (starting time of the job). For example, in a case of job <b>5</b>, by adding up the execution time periods of job <b>1</b> to job <b>4</b> whose execution orders are arranged prior to the execution order of job <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the execution clock time of the job <b>5</b> is calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In step S<b>140</b>, image control section <b>42</b> calculates a drawing position of each job in job schedule screen <b>300</b> based on job setting information <b>410</b> including order of the job execution, sheet tray to be used, and execution time period, and execution clock time. For example, in the case of job <b>5</b>, based on job setting information <b>410</b> including order of job execution: 5th, sheet tray to be used: tray <b>2</b>, and execution time period: 1 minute and 40 seconds, calculates the drawing position of job <b>5</b> in job schedule screen <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In step S<b>150</b>, image control section <b>42</b> draws job bar JB of each job at the drawing position with the display size of each job converted corresponding to the display scale. Regarding job <b>5</b>, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, image control section <b>42</b> draws job bar JB<b>5</b> on a column of sheet tray to be used &#x201c;tray <b>2</b>&#x201d;, with writing start position at order number of job execution &#x201c;5th&#x201d;, and with the length (display size) of job bar JB<b>5</b> corresponding to the job execution time period &#x201c;1 minute and 40 seconds&#x201d;, on job schedule screen <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">[Example of Behavior at Display Scale Change]</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Next, in job schedule screen <b>300</b>, an example behavior of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> in cases where the display scale is changed is described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this example, a case is described where changing operation of reducing the display scale is conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in step S<b>200</b>, image control section <b>42</b> determines whether operation of display scale change is conducted or not. Image control section <b>42</b> determines whether operation of display scale change is conducted or not based on whether an operation signal is supplied or not from operation section <b>64</b> by an operation of zoom button (reduction button <b>320</b> or enlargement button <b>322</b>), In a case where image control section <b>42</b> determines that operation of display scale change is conducted, image control section <b>42</b> proceeds to the step S<b>210</b>, and in a case where operation of display scale change is not conducted, waits until the display scale change is conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In step S<b>210</b>, image control section <b>42</b> confirms the display scale having been set with change. After confirming the display scale having been set based on the operation signal supplied from operation section <b>64</b>, image control section <b>42</b> calculates a conversion ratio of the display scale based on the display scale before changed and the display scale ager changed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In step S<b>220</b>, display section <b>62</b> draws again the background excepting job bar JB with the display scale having been changed. Since the display sizes of such as the connected sheet tray, reduction button <b>320</b> and enlargement button <b>322</b> are not changed by before and after the scale change, objects of re-drawing in the background are such as numerical numbers indicating the display scale. For example, in cases where display scale is changed from &#x201c;30 minutes&#x201d; to &#x201c;4 hours&#x201d;, the horizontal axis indicating the time is changed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, from &#x201c;0, 10, 20, 30&#x201d; to &#x201c;0, 0.5, 1.0, . . . 3.5, 4.0&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In step S<b>220</b>, image control section <b>42</b> re-calculates a display size and a drawing position of each job based on the changed display scale. For example, image control section <b>42</b> re-calculates the display size (length in time axis direction) and drawing position of the job bars JB by utilizing the conversion ratio calculated based on the display scale before change and the display scale after change.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further image control section <b>42</b> determines whether or not the re-calculated display size of the job bar JB is not larger than the predetermined minimum display unit. In cases where image control section <b>42</b> determines that the re-calculated display size of the job bar JB is larger than the predetermined minimum display unit, image control section <b>42</b> supply image information based on the re-calculated display size of the job bar JB to display section <b>62</b>. While, in cases where image control section <b>42</b> determines that the re-calculated display size of the job bar JB is not larger than the predetermined minimum display unit, image control section <b>42</b> successively determines whether or not a job bar JB determined to be not larger than the minimum display unit exists in succession. Namely, image control section <b>42</b> determines whether or not two or more adjacent job bars JB, determined to be not larger than the minimum display unit, exist.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In cases where image control section <b>42</b> determines that successive job bars TB determined to be not larger than the minimum display unit exist, in order to display the successive job bars JB at a same display area with overlapping, in addition to re-calculating the display size and drawing position of the job bars TB, adds for example overlapping display information to job setting information <b>410</b>. While, in cases where image control section <b>42</b> determines that a job bar JB not larger than the minimum display unit does not exist adjacent to a certain job bar JB not larger than the minimum display unit, image control section <b>42</b> changes the display size and position of the job bar JB in order to display the certain job bar JB in the minimum display unit.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In step S<b>240</b>, display section <b>62</b> draws job bar JB of each job sequentially in order from the first job at calculated drawing position with calculated display size. In cases where each of a plurality of consecutive job bars becomes not larger than the minimum display unit due to the reduction of display scale, the plurality of consecutive job bars JB are drawn as overlapped images in a same display area. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the case where each of job bar JB<b>2</b> and job bar JB<b>3</b> becomes not larger than the minimum display unit, job bar JBcom which is composed of overlapped JB<b>2</b> and JB<b>3</b> is displayed on a column of sheet tray position &#x201c;tray <b>2</b>&#x201d;, and at a boundary portion between the positions of job <b>1</b> and job <b>4</b> on the time axis.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Next, the behavior of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> after the scale change (reduction) of job schedule screen <b>300</b> will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, image control section <b>42</b> determines, in step <b>300</b>, whether or not a selection operation of a specific job bar JB is executed on job schedule screen <b>300</b>. Here, image control section <b>42</b> controls such that each of job bar JB indicating a single job and job bar JBcom indicating overlapped multiple job bars is selectable. In a case where a selection operation for a specific job bar JB is executed the flow moves to step S<b>310</b>. On the other hand in a case where any specific job bar JB is not determined to be selected, the flow waits until a selection operation is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In step <b>310</b>, image control section <b>42</b> determines whether or not a plurality of jobs exist in the display area of selected job bar JB. Namely, image control section <b>42</b> determines whether or not the selected job bar is job bar JBcom indicating overlapped plurality of jobs, based on overlapping display information (job setting information <b>410</b>) included in each job. Image control section <b>42</b> proceeds to step S<b>320</b> in a case where determined is that a plurality of jobs exist in the selected display area, and proceeds to step S<b>330</b> in a case where determined is that a plurality of jobs do not exist in the selected display area.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In step S<b>320</b>, display section <b>62</b> popup-displays job setting information <b>411</b> of a job of the first order in the plurality of overlapped jobs. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, image control section <b>42</b> reads out job setting information <b>410</b> (including execution order number) included in job <b>2</b> and job <b>3</b> from HDD<b>58</b>, and allows to display the job <b>2</b> which has prior execution order in job <b>2</b> and job <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In step S<b>340</b>, display section popup-displays reselection screen <b>500</b> for re-selecting the job. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, job reselection screen <b>500</b> is displayed on job schedule screen <b>300</b>, by being read out from image memory <b>48</b> through the control of image control section <b>42</b>, at the same time when popup screen <b>400</b>A of the selected job bar JB<b>2</b> is displayed. By operation of this job reselection screen <b>500</b>, each job of the plurality of jobs overlap displayed in job bar JBcom can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In step S<b>350</b>, image control section <b>42</b> determines whether or not reselection operation of jobs is executed on job reselection screen <b>500</b>. Specifically, image control section <b>42</b> determines whether previous job selection button <b>510</b> is selected or next job selection button <b>520</b> is selected in job reselection screen <b>500</b>. In a case where the job reselection operation is determined to be executed, proceeds to step S<b>370</b>, and in a case where the job reselection operation is determined not to be executed, proceeds to step S<b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In step S<b>370</b>, display section <b>62</b> displays popup screen <b>410</b> corresponding to the previous job or the next job, based on the selection operation on job reselection screen <b>500</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in a case where next job selection button <b>520</b> is selected, display section displays popup screen <b>400</b>B corresponding to job <b>3</b> which has a later execution order next to that of job <b>2</b> whose job setting information <b>410</b> is presently displayed. At this time, since job bar JB<b>1</b> which has a prior execution order is not displayed being overlapped in JBcom, previous job selection button <b>510</b> may be displayed with shading so as not be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In step S<b>360</b>, image control section <b>42</b> determines whether or not close button <b>420</b> of presently displayed popup screen <b>400</b> in job schedule screen <b>300</b> is selected (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In cases where image control section <b>42</b> determined that close button <b>420</b> is not selected, returns to step S<b>350</b> and waits in a condition where the presently displaying screen, for example, popup screen <b>400</b>A (or <b>400</b>B) and job reselection screen <b>500</b> are displayed. On the other hand, in cases where determine is that close button <b>420</b> is selected, erases popup screen <b>400</b>A (or <b>400</b>B) and job reselection screen <b>500</b> from job schedule screen <b>300</b> and returns to job schedule screen <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In step S<b>310</b>, in cases where image control section <b>42</b> determined that multiple jobs are not exist in the selected display area, job setting information <b>410</b> of the selected job is popup displayed as usual in step S<b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In step S<b>380</b>, image control section <b>42</b> determines whether or not close button <b>420</b> of popup screen <b>400</b> presently displayed in job schedule screen <b>300</b> is selected. In cases where image control section <b>42</b> determined that close button <b>420</b> is not selected, waits in a condition of displaying the presently displayed popup screen <b>400</b> and job reselection screen <b>500</b>. On the other hand, in cases where image control section <b>42</b> determined that close button <b>420</b> is selected, erases popup screen <b>400</b> and job reselection screen <b>500</b> and return to job schedule screen <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As described above, according to the present embodiment, even in cases where two or more job bars are displayed as overlapped in one and the same display area due to the reduction of display scale, a selection operation of each job from the plurality of job bars overlap displayed in JBcom is enabled by the operation of job reselection screen <b>500</b>. By this, operations such as changing the display scale of each job bar JB up to visible size can be eliminated. Due to this, even incases where the display scale is set in large unit, the selection operation of each job is enabled and a total view of the jobs can be also visually confirmed, thus improvement of operability is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to the present embodiment, by a reselecting operation of the job image displayed with overlapping in the same display area, job setting information of the job different from that displayed in the present screen can be displayed. Thus, operation of changing the display scale of each of the job images displayed with overlapping up to visible size can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Further, according to the present embodiment, such as residual time of each job and the sheet tray to be used can be visually confirmed, and user's action such as supply or exchange of recording sheets is enabled to be predictable beforehand.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, according to the present embodiment, in cases where the display sizes of job images after changing the display scale become not larger than the minimum display unit, the job images are displayed with overlapping, therefore, the disappearing problem of two or more job images from the screen can be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Technical scope of the present invention is not limited to the above described embodiment, but includes various modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. In the above described embodiment, the selection of other overlap displayed job bar JB is enabled by operating job reselection screen <b>500</b>, but not necessarily restricted to this. For example, job setting information <b>410</b> of any of the jobs is displayed at the time of firstly selecting job bar JBcom, and at the time of second selection of job bar JBcom job setting information <b>410</b> of other job different from the presently popup displayed job may be displayed. According to this method, each of the overlapped displayed jobs can be selected without using job reselection screen <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Further, in the above embodiment, when job bar JBcom is selected job setting information of the first ordered job among the overlap displayed jobs is popup displayed, however it is not necessary to restrict to this case. For example, job setting information <b>410</b> of the last execution order job or an arbitrary job among the overlap displayed jobs may be displayed.</p>
