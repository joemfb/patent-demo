<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an archery release, and more particularly to a back-tension type archery release for a bowstring.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Release devices are used in archery to assist the archer in pulling a bowstring to a fully drawn position and then releasing the bowstring to fire an arrow. Some release devices use grippers for engaging the bowstring or a hock mounted on the bowstring. Other release devices use a rope looped about the bowstring. In the looped rope release devices, the rope is often twisted or torqued as the archer draws the bowstring to a fully drawn position due to cocking or turning of the archer's wrist. The twist applied to the release rope results in reduced arrow speed and accuracy. The present invention relates to a release device which eliminates torque in the looped rope at full draw.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Back-tension release devices which reduce torque are well-known in the prior art as evidenced by U.S. Pat. No. 5,694,915. This patent discloses a back-tension rope release in which a catch for a rope loop is connected with a fork which in turn is connected with a handle. The orientation of the fork relative to the handle is adjustable in order to remove torque or twist from a rope loop. The catch is also adjustable relative to the fork in order to adjust the back-tension on the rope loop. Set screws are used to hold the fork and the catch in the desired positions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While to prior devices normally operate satisfactorily, they are somewhat cumbersome to operate and often require re-adjustment because the set screws loosen during repeated firing of the release.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention was developed in order to overcome these and other drawbacks of prior archery releases by providing a back-tension archery release with improved mechanisms for eliminating torque in a bowstring loop and for adjusting the speed of the release. The release includes a handle having a longitudinal axis and a sear assembly connected with the handle for rotation about an axis normal to the handle axis. By adjusting the position of the sear assembly relative to the handle, twist or torque in the bowstring loop resulting from full draw on the bowstring by an archer is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to fix the sear assembly in the adjusted position relative to the handle, a locking mechanism is provided. The housing contains a central recess in a rear surface thereof which receives a post on the handle, so that the housing is rotatable relative to the handle. The post contains a threaded opening for receiving a screw which passes through the opening in the handle to lock the sear housing in a selected position. In addition, the locking mechanism includes a detent provided on the handle which engages one of a plurality of spaced openings in the rear surface of the sear housing when the sear assembly is adjusted to a selected position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A sear is removably connected with the sear housing and a sear cage is rotatably connected with the sear housing about an axis parallel to the handle axis. The sear contains a groove in an upper surface at one end for engaging the sear cage. The groove cooperates with the sear cage to generate an audible sound when the release is actuated. Where the archer prefers that no sound be generated upon actuation of the release, the sear may be removed and re-oriented with an end of the sear which does not contain a groove engaging the sear cage.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The archery release further includes a finger removably connected with the handle and extending radially outwardly therefrom. The finger is adjustable about the handle axis to increase or decrease the speed of the release. More particularly, the handle contains an elongated slot in an outer surface and the finger contains a stem arranged within the slot for adjusting the finger relative to the handle axis. A pinch plate is provided between the finger step and the handle to fix the finger in a selected position. The handle and pinch plate contain at least one aligned opening and a screw engages the aligned openings to lock the finger in the selected position.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the back-tension archery release according to the invention comprises a number of components which are shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-13</figref>. More particularly, the release includes a handle <b>2</b> with which a sear housing <b>4</b> is rotatably connected. A sear <b>6</b> and sear cage <b>8</b> are connected with the sear housing and a hook <b>10</b> is connected with the sear housing. A finger <b>12</b> is connected with the handle and extends radially therefrom. In use, hook engages the loop of a bowstring (not shown) and the release is operable to release the bowstring from the hook to fire an arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The handle is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. It contains a central opening <b>14</b> for receiving the index finger of an archer. The longitudinal axis A of the handle passes through the center of the opening as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At one side of the handle, the exterior surface contains a recess <b>16</b> defined by overhanging lip portions <b>18</b> at the upper and lower edges of the recess. A post <b>20</b> extends from the handle in the central portion of the recess. The post contains a threaded opening <b>22</b>. Above the post is an upper arcuate recess <b>24</b> and below the post is a lower arcuate recess <b>26</b>. A detent <b>28</b> extends outwardly from a central portion of the upper lip portion as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As will be developed below, the handle recess <b>16</b> is adapted to receive the sear housing <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The outer surface of the handle further contains a slot <b>30</b> in a lower portion of the handle relative to the recess <b>16</b>. The slot is shown more particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Communicating with the slot are aligned openings <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. The openings <b>34</b> are preferably clearance openings. The slot accommodates the finger <b>12</b>. More particularly, the finger, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, contains a stem <b>36</b> at one end which is contoured to fit within the slot <b>30</b>. A pinch plate <b>38</b> fits within a slot of the finger stem and within a matching contoured portion <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the slot <b>30</b> to adjustably connect the finger with the handle. The pinch plate contains a pair of threaded openings <b>40</b>. A pair of screws <b>42</b> are provided to secure the finger stem <b>36</b> and pinch plate <b>38</b> within the slot. The screws pass through the openings <b>32</b> in the handle and engage the threaded openings <b>40</b> in the pin plate via a slot <b>44</b> in the finger stem <b>36</b>. When the screws are loosened, the finger stem can be shifted or moved within the slot about the axis of the handle to displace the finger toward or away from the portion of the handle containing the recess. When the screws are tightened, the pinch plate within the finger stem slot draws the stem against the handle to lock the finger in position. Positioning the finger toward the recess will increase the speed of the release. Positioning the finger away from the recess will decrease the speed of the release. The finger can also be positioned in accordance with the preferred ergonomic position of the user. The finger contains markings <b>46</b> such as engraved marks to provide an indication of the position of the finger to the user for proper adjustment of the finger relative to an indicator <b>48</b> on the handle so that the user can consistently adjust the finger to a desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a preferred embodiment, the finger <b>12</b> is contoured to accommodate the other fingers of the archer's hand. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>6</b>, the finger <b>12</b> accommodates two additional fingers. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a non-contoured finger <b>112</b> is provided to accommodate any number of fingers. Other contoured finger shapes may be provided if desired. Because the finger is removably connected with the handle, it is a simple matter to replace a finger of one contour with a finger of a different contour. Whatever finger contour is selected, the finger is still adjustable relative to the handle to adjust the speed of the release.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, the sear housing <b>4</b> will be described. The housing is elongated and contains a recess <b>50</b> in the central region of the bottom surface thereof. The recess contains a through-opening <b>52</b> and is adapted to receive the post <b>20</b> of the handle so that the housing can rotate relative to the handle about an axis normal to the handle axis A. A screw <b>54</b> connects the housing with the handle by passing through the through-opening <b>52</b> into the threaded opening <b>22</b>. The rear surface of the housing further contains a plurality of openings <b>56</b> arranged in an arc between an edge of the housing and the central recess <b>50</b>. The openings receive the detent <b>28</b> on the handle to hold the housing in a selected position relative to the handle. Thus, when the screw <b>54</b> is loosened, the housing may be rotated in either direction relative to the handle. When the housing in the desired position, which is selected by the user to eliminate torque or twist in a bowstring loop, the detent <b>28</b> engages one of the openings <b>56</b> opposite the detent and the screw <b>54</b> is tightened to lock the housing in place. The openings are preferably spaced at ten degree increments relative to a vertical orientation of the release as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, thereby affording adjustment of between 0&#xb0; and 40&#xb0; on either side of vertical. This allows the housing to be rotated in either direction for adjustment for both left and right-handed users. Indicia <b>58</b> are provided on the upper surface of the housing to indicate the degree of orientation of the housing relative to the handle. If desired, a guide pin <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is provided for the housing. It passes through an opening <b>62</b> in the housing adjacent to the indicia and extends into the upper arcuate recess <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The sear housing <b>4</b> include a pair of spaced flanges <b>64</b> extending from the top surface on opposite sides of the central opening <b>52</b>. The flanges contain aligned openings <b>66</b>. The sear cage <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is pivotally connected with the sear housing, and specifically with the flanges of the sear housing, via a pivot pin <b>68</b> which passes through a first pair of aligned openings <b>70</b> in the cage and the aligned openings <b>66</b> in the housing flanges. The sear cage thus rotates relative to the housing about an axis parallel to the handle axis.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The hook <b>10</b> contains an opening <b>74</b> for receiving a pivot pin <b>76</b> which also passes through a second pair of aligned openings <b>78</b> in the sear cage to pivotally connect the hook with the cage. The hook thus rotates relative to the cage about an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the handle. A pan lead screw <b>80</b> passes through a threaded opening <b>82</b> in the sear cage <b>8</b> to retain the pivot pin within the aligned openings <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sear <b>6</b> is connected with the sear housing <b>4</b> via the screw <b>54</b> which passes through an opening <b>84</b> in the sear <b>6</b> and into the threaded opening <b>22</b> of the handle. A second screw <b>86</b> passes through an opening <b>88</b> in the sear and into a threaded opening <b>90</b> in the housing to further connect the sear <b>6</b> with the housing <b>4</b>. If the screw is too long, it enters the lower arcuate clearance recess <b>26</b> of the handle, thereby insuring that the housing rotates freely relative to the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the sear <b>6</b> is shown in greater detail. As described above, the sear contains openings <b>84</b> and <b>88</b>. It also contains a groove <b>92</b> in the bottom surface thereof to straddle, locate and lock in place the pivot pin <b>68</b> for the sear cage. In addition, at one end of the sear, the upper surface contains a laterally extending groove <b>94</b>. When the sear is arranged with the lateral groove toward the bottom as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the edge <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the hook between the flat and curved surfaces engages the groove. The groove <b>94</b> cooperates with the edge of the hook to generate an audible sound when the release is actuated to release the bowstring from the hook. When the sear is arranged with the lateral groove toward the top (not shown), the hook edge engages a smooth end of the sear so that no audible sound is generated when the release is actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In use, the bowstring loop is place on the hook and the user draws the bow to a full draw position. If this results in a twist of the bowstring loop, the user loosens the screw <b>54</b> and rotates the sear housing in the appropriate direction and to the appropriate degree to eliminate the twist. The detent of the handle engages the appropriate opening in the rear surface of the sear housing and the screw <b>54</b> is tightened to lock the housing in position. On subsequent draws of the bow by the user, there is no twist of the bowstring. Of course, if a different user uses the release, he or she can re-adjust the sear housing to eliminate twist based on that produced at full draw by the different user.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, the user can adjust the finger to advance or retard the speed of the release as a matter of personal preference, by loosening the screws <b>42</b>, moving the finger forwardly or rearwardly about the handle axis, and then tightening the screws.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The indicia on the housing and finger enable the user to quickly and accurately adjust the release to his or her preferred settings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the invention has been described as including both adjustable sear housing and an adjustable finger, either feature may be provided independently in an archery release without the other feature.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the preferred forms and embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without deviating from the inventive concepts set forth above.</p>
