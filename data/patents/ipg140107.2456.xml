<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates generally to the field of cancer diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the invention relates to novel methods of assessing the level of severity of cancer or the progression of cancer. The novel methods relate to measuring the level of SET expression in biological samples.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cancer is a class of diseases in which a group of cells exhibit uncontrolled growth, invasion and destruction of adjacent tissues, and metastasis (the spread of aberrant cells to other locations in the body), or in which cells fail to undergo programmed cell death (e.g. apoptosis) at the appropriate time. Cancer causes about 13% of all deaths worldwide. Current treatments for cancer depend upon the specific type of cancer and tissue involved, but include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and monoclonal antibody therapy among other methods. Although these treatment methods have been successful in some cases, they are hindered by adverse side effects or limited efficacy. For example, the efficacy of eliminating cancerous tissue by surgical removal of tumors is often limited by the tendency of cancers to invade adjacent tissue and metastasize to other sites in the body. Chemotherapy, as well as radiation treatment, is often limited by toxicity or damage to other tissues in the body. Thus, cancer remains a major health concern and there is a need for improved methods of diagnosing and treating cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Diagnosis of cancer can occur at any stage of disease. In many cases, determination of an appropriate course of treatment, which may include invasive surgery or administration of toxic drugs, is postponed until disease progression is observed so that the severity of disease can be determined and the appropriate therapeutic course can be selected. Systems that would allow clinicians to rapidly determine whether a patient would benefit from aggressive treatment or whether a less aggressive form of treatment is appropriate would drastically improve the treatment of individuals with cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Of the nearly 84,000 annual cases of leukemia in the Western world, B-cell CLL is the most common, accounting for &#x2dc;30% of adult leukemia cases. (Ishibe el al. 2001) Characterized by accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells (Rozman et al. 1995), the CLL clinical course is heterogeneous, with some patients experiencing an aggressive course that demands early treatment, and others experiencing long survival without disease-related symptoms or ever requiring treatment. (Rozman et al. 1995) Aberrant apoptosis in CLL cells correlates with arrest either in the G0 or early G1 phases of the cell cycle. (Cordone et al. 1992) (Caligaris-Cappio et al. 1999) This defective apoptosis in CLL cells is partly due to aberrant signaling through the Akt kinase and the ERK mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, in which phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt) is necessary for survival of the leukemia cells. (Cuni et al. 2004) (Longo et al. 2008) The observation of aberrantly activated Akt and downstream pathways in CLL cells also suggests that the normal regulator of these pathways, PP2A, is unable to perform its normal role.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a lymphoma characterized by malignant growth of B lymphocytes. Many non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients have intermediate- or high-grade disease, which are much more aggressive at the time of diagnosis than low-grade disease. The distinction among the grades of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is important and can have a strong impact on the treatment regimen selected for the patient. Patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may survive an average of 5-7 years with conventional therapies, whereas patients with intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkins lymphoma have an average survival rate of 2-5 years or 6 months to 2 years, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is a need in the art for methods of predicting the level of severity of cancers or linking the progression of cancers with particular markers.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>: SET is overexpressed in CLL and NHL. (A) mRNA was isolated from 15 CLL patients and 6 normal B-cell samples and SET mRNA was quantified by qPCR. (B) Representative immunoblot of two normal B-cell (N37 and N42) and two CLL cell extracts showing overexpression of both the &#x3b1;- and &#x3b2;-isoforms of SET as indicated in the CLL cells. (C) SET/GAPDH protein ratios measured for 16 CLL patients and 6 normal B-cell samples used in A, showing a significant increase in expression of SET mRNA in B-CLL cells relative to normal B-cells. (D) SET mRNA levels from two normal B-cell samples and Raji and Ramos cells quantified by qPCR. (E) Immunoblotting of two normal B-cell (N4 and N7) and Raji and Ramos cell extracts. While SET levels appear higher in the normal samples, it is due to higher intensity settings for this blot than normal shown compared to the CLL samples in B. (F) Quantitation of the &#x3b1;- and (&#x3b2;-isoforms of the SET protein (normalized to GAPDH) for Raji and Ramos NHL cell lines showing that the major increase in SET levels is due to increased &#x3b1;-isoform expression.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>: Cellular SET protein levels correlate with parameters of CLL progression. The time from diagnosis to first needed treatment (the time to treatment; TTT) was assessed relative to SET protein levels in CLL cells as determined by quantitative immunoblotting. Patients with high levels of SET were compared to those with low levels of SET for (A) the &#x3b2;-isoform, (B) the &#x3b1;-isoform, (C) total (&#x3b1;+&#x3b2;) SET, and (D) the numerical ratio of the &#x3b1;-isoform and &#x3b2;-isoform (&#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratio) (n=285). Those with high SET&#x3b1;, high total SET (&#x3b1;+&#x3b2;, and high &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratios had statistically significantly shorter TTT. The overall survival (OS) for patients with high levels of SET were compared to those with low levels of SET for (E) SET&#x3b2;, (F) SET&#x3b1;, (G) total SET (&#x3b1;+&#x3b2;), and (H) the numerical ratio of the &#x3b1;-isoform and &#x3b2;-isoform (&#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratio) (n=285).

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>: COG peptides binds to both SET isoforms from primary human CLL cells. A lysate CLL cells from a patient was prepared and mixed with or without biotin-COG112 or biotin-COG133. Complexes bound to Neutravidin-Agarose (NA) beads were then detected by Western blotting. Lane 1 contains 20 &#x3bc;g of cell lysate as a loading control. Lanes 2-5 contain extract from 300 &#x3bc;g of lysate incubated with either buffer (lane 2), 10 &#x3bc;M biotin (lane 3), 10 &#x3bc;M Biotin-labeled COG133 (lane 4) or 10 &#x3bc;m Biotin-labeled COG112 (lane 5). Lysates were incubated with biotin reagents for 1 hr before addition of NA beads and then incubated for an additional hour. After rigorous washing, the beads were boiled in SDS PAGE buffer, separated by PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose. SET appears as bands at &#x2dc;39 (&#x3b2;) and 41 kDa (&#x3b1;) that bound to the biotin-labeled COG112/133 (lanes 4 &#x26;5), but not in buffer alone (lane 2) or biotin only lanes (lane 3).</p>

(A) SET was knocked down by shRNA to SET following lentiviral transduction in 32D:BCR/Abl cell cultures or treatment with 1 &#x3bc;M COG449 followed by lysis with NP40 lysis buffer. PP2A was immunoprecipitated and assayed with the PP2A immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate), with the exception of using DiFMUP as a fluorescent substrate. The line for each sample represents the phosphate release from a given sample following subtraction of the OA inhibited control reactions (p&#x3c;0.05) (B) 32D:BCR/Abl cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 30 minutes followed by lysis with NP40 lysis buffer. PP2A was immunoprecipitated and assayed as in panel A (p&#x3c;0.01). (C) CLL cells were treated with COG449 followed by annexin-V and propidium iodide staining to assess apoptosis and death. (D) Freshly-isolated human CLL cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of COG449 for 24 hrs. Cells were lysed, protein lysates subjected to PAGE, and immunoblotted to quantify the Mcl-1 and &#x3b2;-Actin ratio (*indicates p&#x3c;0.01, **indicates p&#x3c;0.001 relative to control).</p>

(C) Raji NHL cells were transduced with SET shRNA or control lentivirus and knockdown was assessed by Western blotting from two samples of each. (D) Growth of Raji cells from Panel C was assessed 72 hr after knockdown using a tetrazolium assay, and demonstrated that SET antagonism inhibited growth (**=p&#x3c;0.01). (E) Growth inhibition of Raji cells treated with the indicated levels of COG449 for 72 hr. (F) Growth inhibition of Ramos cells treated with the indicated levels of COG449 for 72 hr.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>: Cytotoxicity of COG449 can be modulated by a PP2A inhibitor in Ramos cells. Ramos cells were pretreated for 5 minutes with or without 1 nM OA before treatment with 1 &#x3bc;M COG449. After 24 hours, cytotoxicity was assessed using the MIT assay reagent to detect viable cells. Treatment with OA alone was not significantly cytotoxic while COG449 robustly inhibited growth. When COG449 treatment was preceded by OA treatment the cytotoxicity was significantly reduced indicating that PP2A plays a role in the cytotoxicity of COG449.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The present invention is based on the discovery that the levels of SET present in a biological sample and the ratio of SET protein isoforms SET &#x3b1; and SET &#x3b2; in the biological sample can be measured and are prognostic indicators of cancer severity or progression. Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of combining steps to measure levels of total SET, SET &#x3b1;, and/or SET &#x3b2; and use the measurements to predict the level of severity of cancer or cancer progression in the patient. The present invention also provides methods of combining steps to measure the ratio of the SET &#x3b1; to SET &#x3b2; isoforms, and use the measurements to predict the level of severity of cancer or cancer progression in the patient. The disclosed methods can be performed, using the disclosed techniques, to measure total SET, SET &#x3b1;, SET &#x3b2;, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The SET protein is a potent physiological inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Li et al. 1996) that was isolated from a chromosomal rearrangement at 9q34 in a patient with acute undifferentiated leukemia (Adachi et al. 1994). The two isoforms of SET arise from differential splicing, and their expression is driven by distinct promoters for the &#x3b1;- and &#x3b2;-isoforms. The isoforms differ only in the N-terminal portion of the protein in which the &#x3b1;-isoform has a 37 amino acid N-terminal region that arises from Exon 1 of the SET gene while the &#x3b2;-isoform has a 24 amino acid N-terminal region that arises from Exon 2 of the SET gene. The remaining 253 amino acids are identical in each isoform and arise from Exons 3-9. (Asaka et al. 2008) The mechanisms that regulate expression of each of these isoforms has not been fully elucidated.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, a method of predicting or assessing the level of severity of dancer or cancer progression in a patient is provided. In some embodiments, the cancer is selected from the group consisting of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, leukemias, lymphomas, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, myelodysplastic disease, heavy chain disease, neuroendocrine tumors, and Schwanoma.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the level of SET expression is measured by contacting the biological sample with a SET-specific antibody. A SET-specific antibody may be for example a polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody, a chimeric antibody, a human antibody, an affinity maturated antibody or an antibody fragment. While monoclonal antibodies are highly specific to a marker/antigen, a polyclonal antibody can preferably be used as a capture antibody to immobilize as much of the marker/antigen as possible. A monoclonal antibody with inherently higher binding specificity for the marker/antigen may be used as a detection antibody for each specific isoform of SET.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Polyclonal antibodies are raised by injecting (e.g., subcutaneous or intramuscular injection) an immunogen into a suitable non-human mammal (e.g., a mouse or a rabbit). Generally, the immunogen should induce production of high titers of antibody with relatively high affinity for the target antigen. If desired, the marker may be conjugated to a carrier protein by conjugation techniques that are well known in the art. Commonly used carriers include keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), thyroglobulin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and tetanus toxoid. The conjugate is then used to immunize the animal. The antibodies are then obtained from blood samples taken from the animal. The techniques used to produce polyclonal antibodies are extensively described in the literature (see, e.g., Methods of Enzymology, &#x201c;Production of Antisera with Small Doses of Immunogen: Multiple Intradermal Injections,&#x201d; Langone, et al. eds. (Acad. Press, 1981)). Polyclonal antibodies produced by the animals can be further purified, for example, by binding to and elution from a matrix to which the target antigen is bound. Those of skill in the art will know of various techniques common in the immunology arts for purification and/or concentration of polyclonal, as well as monoclonal, antibodies (see, e.g., Coligan, et al. (1991) Unit 9, Current Protocols in Immunology, Wiley Interscience).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may be readily prepared through use of well-known techniques, such as those exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 4,196,265, incorporated herein by reference. Typically, this technique involves immunizing a suitable animal with a selected immunogen composition, e.g., a purified or partially purified antifungal protein, polypeptide or peptide. The immunizing composition is administered in a manner effective to stimulate antibody producing cells. Rodents such as mice and rats are preferred animals, however, the use of rabbit, sheep, or frog cells is also possible. The use of rats may provide certain advantages but mice are preferred, with the BALB/c mouse being most preferred as this is most routinely used and generally gives a higher percentage of stable fusions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the SET-specific antibody recognizes a holoprotein or an antigen of both the &#x3b1; and the &#x3b2; isoform of SET. In these embodiments, the SET-specific antibody detects both isoforms of SET. In other embodiments, the SET-specific antibody of the invention recognizes a holoprotein or an antigen derived from the SET &#x3b1; isoform or the SET &#x3b2; isoform. SET &#x3b1; isoform-specific antibodies recognize a holoprotein or an antigen of the SET &#x3b1; isoform and do not recognize or bind to a holoprotein or an antigen of the SET &#x3b2; isoform. SET &#x3b2; isoform-specific antibodies recognize a holoprotein or an antigen of the SET &#x3b2; isoform and do not recognize or bind to a holoprotein or an antigen of the SET &#x3b1; isoform. The holoprotein or antigen derived from the SET&#x3b1; isoform or the SET&#x3b2; isoform may be of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, or SEQ ID NO: 4.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, SET expression is measured by contacting a biological sample from a patient with an antibody that binds the SET protein (i.e., a SET-specific antibody that detects both the &#x3b1; and the &#x3b2; isoform), the SET &#x3b1; isoform (i.e., a SET &#x3b1; isoform-specific antibody), and/or the SET &#x3b2; isoform (i.e., a SET &#x3b1; isoform-specific antibody) and then detecting the presence or absence of a reaction product. The antibody may be monoclonal, polyclonal, chimeric, or a fragment of the foregoing and the step of detecting the reaction product may be carried out with any suitable immunoassay.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, SET expression levels are measured in an immunoassay with a biological sample, an antibody, and means for producing a detectable signal. The antibody can be immobilized on a support, such as a bead (such as protein A and protein G agarose beads), plate or slide, and contacted with the specimen suspected of containing the antigen in a liquid phase. The support is then separated from the liquid phase and either the support phase or the liquid phase is examined for a detectable signal employing means for producing such signal. The signal is related to the presence of the analyte in the sample. Means for producing a detectable signal include the use of radioactive labels, fluorescent labels, or enzyme labels. For example, if the antigen to be detected contains a second binding site, an antibody which binds to that site can be conjugated to a detectable group and added to the liquid phase reaction solution before the separation step. The presence of the detectable group on the solid support indicates the presence of the antigen in the test sample. Examples of suitable immunoassays include, but are not limited to oligonucleotides, immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence methods, chemiluminescence methods, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) or enzyme-linked immunoassays.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the level of SET expression is measured by quantifying SET mRNA. In some embodiments, the total SET mRNA is measured using PCR primers and probes that target SET mRNA that is common to both the &#x3b1; and the &#x3b2; isoforms of SET. In other embodiments, SET &#x3b1; isoform mRNA is detected using PCR primers and probes specific to the SET &#x3b1; isoform. In other embodiments, SET &#x3b2; isoform mRNA is detected using primers and probes specific to the SET &#x3b2; isoform. In some embodiments, one primer may be outside of the exon sequence. In some embodiments, the primer pair will amplify SET &#x3b1; isoform, even if only one primer is specific to the SET &#x3b1; isoform. In other embodiments, the primer pair will amplify SET &#x3b2; isoform, even if only one primer is specific to the SET &#x3b2; isoform. In some embodiments, SET &#x3b1; isoform mRNA is detected using PCR where one or both primers bind within an exon specific to the SET &#x3b1; isoform. In other embodiments, SET &#x3b2; isoform mRNA is detected using PCR where one or both primers bind within an exon specific to the SET &#x3b2; isoform. mRNA can be quantified by a variety of experimental techniques including quantitative PCR using primers to amplify SET mRNA and a nucleic acid probe targeting SET mRNA. Nucleic acid primers suitable for use in the invention may be from about 15 to about 30 bases in length. Nucleic acid probes suitable for use in the invention may be from about 20 to about 30 bases in length. Examples of nucleic acid primers and probes targeting SET mRNA are shown in Table 6 and include SET &#x3b1; isoform primers (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6), SET &#x3b1; isoform probes (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 7), SET &#x3b2; isoform primers (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 8 and 9), SET &#x3b2; isoform probes (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 10), and SET primers that recognize both &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; SET isoforms (common SET primers, e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 11 and 12), and and SET probes that recognize both &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; SET isoforms (common SET probes, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 13).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The most sensitive and most flexible quantitative method to measure SET mRNA is RT-PCR, which can be used to compare mRNA levels in different sample populations, in normal and tumor tissues, with or without drug treatment, to characterize patterns of gene expression, to discriminate between closely related mRNAs, and to analyze RNA structure.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first step is the isolation of mRNA from a target sample. The starting material is typically total RNA isolated from human tumors or tumor cell lines, and corresponding normal tissues or cell lines, respectively. Thus RNA can be isolated from a variety of primary tumors, including breast, lung, colon, prostate, brain, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, testis, ovary, uterus, head and neck, etc., tumor, or tumor cell lines, with pooled DNA from healthy donors. Additional examples of cancer cell lines include those associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and melanoma. If the source of mRNA is a primary tumor, mRNA can be extracted, for example, from frozen or archived paraffin-embedded and fixed (e.g. formalin-fixed) tissue samples.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">General methods for mRNA extraction are well known in the art and are disclosed in standard textbooks of molecular biology, including Ausubel et al., Current Protocols of Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons (1997). Methods for RNA extraction from paraffin embedded tissues are disclosed, for example, in Rupp and Locker, Lab Invest. 56:A67 (1987), and De Andres et al., BioTechniques 18:42044 (1995). In particular, RNA isolation can be performed using purification kit, buffer set and protease from commercial manufacturers, such as Qiagen, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For example, total RNA from cells in culture can be isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini-columns. Other commercially available RNA isolation kits include MasterPure&#x2122; Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (EPICENTRE&#xae;, Madison, Wis.); and Paraffin Block RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Inc.). Total RNA from tissue samples can be isolated using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test). RNA prepared from tumor can be isolated, for example, by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As RNA cannot serve as a template for PCR, the first step in gene expression profiling by RT-PCR is the reverse transcription of the RNA template into cDNA, followed by its exponential amplification in a PCR reaction. The two most commonly used reverse transcriptases are avilo myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT). The reverse transcription step is typically primed using specific primers, random hexamers, or oligo-dT primers, depending on the circumstances and the goal of expression profiling. For example, extracted RNA can be reverse-transcribed using a GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin Elmer, Calif., USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. The derived cDNA can then be used as a template in the subsequent PCR reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although the PCR step can use a variety of thermostable DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, it typically employs the Taq DNA polymerase, which has a 5&#x2032;-3&#x2032; nuclease activity but lacks a 3&#x2032;-5&#x2032; proofreading endonuclease activity. Thus, TaqMan&#xae; PCR typically utilizes the 5&#x2032;-nuclease activity of Taq or Tth polymerase to hydrolyze a hybridization probe bound to its target amplicon, but any enzyme with equivalent 5&#x2032; nuclease activity can be used. Two oligonucleotide primers are used to generate an amplicon typical of a PCR reaction. A third oligonucleotide, or probe, is designed to detect nucleotide sequence located between the two PCR primers. The probe is non-extendible by Taq DNA polymerase enzyme, and is labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye and a quencher fluorescent dye. Any laser-induced emission from the reporter dye is quenched by the quenching dye when the two dyes are located close together as they are on the probe. During the amplification reaction, the Taq DNA polymerase enzyme cleaves the probe in a template-dependent manner. The resultant probe fragments disassociate in solution, and signal from the released reporter dye is free from the quenching effect of the second fluorophore. One molecule of reporter dye is liberated for each new molecule synthesized, and detection of the unquenched reporter dye provides the basis for quantitative interpretation of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">TaqMan&#xae; RT-PCR can be performed using commercially available equipment, such as, for example, ABI PRISM 7700&#x2122; Sequence Detection System&#x2122; (Perkin-Elmer-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA), or Lightcycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). In a preferred embodiment, the 5&#x2032; nuclease procedure is run on a real-time quantitative PCR device such as the ABI PRISM 7700&#x2122; Sequence Detection System&#x2122;. The system consists of a thermocycler, laser, charge-coupled device (CCD), camera and computer. The system amplifies samples in a 96-well format on a thermocycler. During amplification, laser-induced fluorescent signal is collected in real-time through fiber optics cables for all 96 wells, and detected at the CCD. The system includes software for running the instrument and for analyzing the data.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">5&#x2032;-Nuclease assay data are initially expressed as Ct, or the threshold cycle. As discussed above, fluorescence values are recorded during every cycle and represent the amount of product amplified to that point in the amplification reaction. The point when the fluorescent signal is first recorded as statistically significant is the threshold cycle (Ct).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">To minimize errors and the effect of sample-to-sample variation, RT-PCR is usually performed using an internal standard. The ideal internal standard is expressed at a constant level among different tissues, and is unaffected by the experimental treatment. RNAs most frequently used to normalize patterns of gene expression are mRNAs for the housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and 13-actin.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A more recent variation of the RT-PCR technique is the real time quantitative PCR, which measures PCR product accumulation through a dual-labeled fluorigenic probe (i.e., TaqMan&#xae; probe). Real time PCR is compatible both with quantitative competitive PCR, where internal competitor for each target sequence is used for normalization, and with quantitative comparative PCR using a normalization gene contained within the sample, or a housekeeping gene for RT-PCR. For further details see, e.g. Held et al., Genome Research 6:986-994 (1996).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to one aspect of the present invention, PCR primers and probes are designed based upon intron sequences present in the gene to be amplified. In this embodiment, the first step in the primer/probe design is the delineation of intron sequences within the genes. This can be done by publicly available software, such as the DNA BLAT software developed by Kent, W. J., Genome Res. 12(4):656-64 (2002), or by the BLAST software including its variations. Subsequent steps follow well established methods of PCR primer and probe design.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In order to avoid non-specific signals, it is important to mask repetitive sequences within the introns when designing the primers and probes. This can be easily accomplished by using the Repeat Masker program available on-line through the Baylor College of Medicine, which screens DNA sequences against a library of repetitive elements and returns a query sequence in which the repetitive elements are masked. The masked intron sequences can then be used to design primer and probe sequences using any commercially or otherwise publicly available primer/probe design packages, such as Primer Express (Applied Biosystems); MGB assay-by-design (Applied Biosystems); Primer3 (Steve Rozen and Helen J. Skaletsky (2000) Primer3 on the WWW for general users and for biologist programmers. In: Krawetz S, Misener S (eds) Bioinformatics Methods and Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., pp 365-386).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The most important factors considered in PCR primer design include primer length, melting temperature (Tm), and G/C content, specificity, complementary primer sequences, and 3&#x2032;-end sequence. In general, optimal PCR primers are generally 17-30 bases in length, and contain about 20-80%, such as, for example, about 50-60% G+C bases. Tm's between 50 and 80&#xb0; C., e.g. about 50 to 70&#xb0; C. are typically preferred.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Studies of a limited number of samples from CML patients and patients with other tumors have reported increased SET levels in isolated malignant cells. (Adachi et al. 1994) (Neviani et al. 2005) We sought to determine if the SET oncoprotein was overexpressed in CLL cells relative to normal B-cells and to quantify the effect of SET overexpression on parameters of disease. SET was significantly overexpressed in CLL cells and related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell line cells. In freshly-isolated CLL patient samples, higher cellular levels of the SET correlated with more aggressive disease requiring earlier treatment. Antagonism of SET using shRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacological antagonism with novel cell permeable SET antagonist peptides induced apoptosis, reduced cellular levels of Mcl-1, and caused death of CLL and NHL cells, but normal B-cells were scarcely affected by SET antagonism. In addition, pharmacological SET antagonism in vivo inhibited growth of B-cell NHL tumor xenografts in SCID mice.</p>

Medical Centers were enrolled in IRB-approved research protocols to collect clinical data and blood. Subjects gave signed informed consent prior to phlebotomy, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Blood was collected from participants into heparin-tubes, and CLL cells were purified as noted before (Weinberg et al. 2007). Briefly, CLL cells were isolated using the RosetteSep&#xae; B cell enrichment cocktail (catalog #15024/15064; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) according to the manufacturer's directions. This method yielded CLL cell purity of greater than 95% CD5+CD19+ B-cells as determined by flow cytometry. Normal B-lymphocytes were isolated using the EasySep&#xae; B-cell enrichment cocktail (catalog #15024/15064; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) according to the manufacturer's directions, with a purity of &#x3e;94% CD 19+ lymphocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">IGVH mutation status, CD38 and ZAP70 expression, and interphase cytogenetics were determined as before (Weinberg et al. 2007).

The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 3 hours, washed with TBST. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. in the primary antibody of one species and a loading control (usually GAPDH) antibody of a second species diluted in SuperBlock.

Frozen patient cells were lysed by freeze-thaw in Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) with a protease inhibitor. We used lysates from a single stock of Ramos cells in each individual gel as a control for quantitation across all samples. Fifty &#x3bc;g lysate per lane was electrophoresed and blotted onto PVDF membranes. We used the reversible Ponceau protein staining method as a loading control across lanes.

Membranes were imaged using a standard scanner and then rinsed further in distilled water and then in TBS-Tween 20 (0.1%) to eliminate the Ponceau stain. After blocking the membranes, we incubated them with antibodies. We processed the blots with an anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz) and SuperSignal&#xae; West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.). Band densities were quantified and expressed as a ratio of SET band density/Ponceau band density (total proteins) and calculated relative to Ramos lysate SET (arbitrarily established as 100). We dichotomized SET &#x201c;high&#x201d; and &#x201c;low&#x201d; values using the following cutoffs: SET&#x3b1; 70.3 units, SET &#x3b2; 115 units, total SET (&#x3b1;+&#x3b2;) 74.5 units, and SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratio of 0.78 units relative to the Ramos cell control.</p>

The plate was then placed at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. Cells were then seeded into 6 well plates, and 2 mL normal growth media was added per well. We treated cells 48 hours after transduction and then harvested 72 hours after transduction for assays and Western blotting.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Cultured 32D:BCR/Abl CML cells were grown in standard media, treated as indicated, and lysed in NP40 buffer. The protein concentration (Hoane et al. 2007) was adjusted to 2 mg/mL protein, and 500 &#x3bc;g of protein was combined with 4 &#x3bc;L of anti-PP2A antibody (1D6, Upstate) and 50 &#x3bc;L of protein-A-agarose beads in 500 &#x3bc;L. The mixture was shaken for 2 hr at 4&#xb0; C. and then beads were collected by centrifugation. Following four washes, 50 &#x3bc;L of phosphatase assay buffer (Upstate) was added to the beads, vortexed, and 50 &#x3bc;L of the bead slurry was added to one well of a 96 well plate. A 10 mM stock of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP, Invitrogen) was diluted to 100 &#x3bc;M in assay buffer, and 50 &#x3bc;L was added to each well. Fluorescence intensity of the product of cleavage of phosphate from DiFMUP (a synthetic phosphatase substrate) was measured using a plate reader every 3 minutes, with shaking every 30 seconds over a 30 minute period. Specificity of the phosphatase assay for PP2A was assessed by incubating the immunoprecipitated protein with 25 nM oakadaic acid (OA), a concentration that selectively inhibits PP2A. Data presented represent the phosphate release of a sample with the background level of phosphate release of the OA-inhibited control subtracted.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">CLL cells were lysed in NP40 buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.2% NP40, 150 mM NaCl) by a single freeze thaw cycle. Lysate protein concentration was adjusted to 5 mg/mL. Streptavidin agarose beads (1 mL) were washed with 10 mL of NP40 buffer, and 0.5 mL of beads was added to 1 mL of extract. ABeads were then collected by filtration through a disposable mini-column (Bio-Rad), and the flow-through extract was collected for analysis. Following washing with 100 mL of chilled NP40 buffer, the beads were removed from the column, collected by centrifugation, and 75 &#x3bc;L of 4&#xd7; Laemmli buffer was added. Beads were vortexed and heated to 90&#xb0; C. for 10 min to ensure that all proteins were released from the beads. Proteins were separated by SDS PAGE and Western blotting was used to determine if the COG133 and COG112 peptides bound to both isoforms of SET from a CLL patient sample.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Xenograft Model of Tumor Growth Suppression.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Female SCID mice (6-8 weeks old) were injected subcutaneously on left flank with 10<sup>7 </sup>Ramos cells in 200 &#x3bc;L PBS. Mice were monitored daily for tumor growth by palpation. When tumors became large enough for caliper measurement, tumor volumes were calculated as (length times width<sup>3</sup>)&#xd7;0.5 as described by Schliemann et al. (Schliemann et al. 2009) Once tumors reached 50-100 mm<sup>3</sup>, we randomly assigned mice to two groups, with approximate equalization of tumor volumes between groups. COG449 (5 mg/kg) or a vehicle control was administered by daily subcutaneous injection (5 mL/kg injection volume). At the end of experiment, tumors were dissected, photographed, and wet weights of each tumor were measured.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Statistical Analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">If quantitative data were normally distributed, single comparisons between groups were made by Student's t test; if not, log transformation or non-parametric Mann-Whitney testing was used. When multiple comparisons were made between groups, the data were analyzed using two way ANOVA with the Newman-Keuls post-test. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to graphically display overall survival and time to treatment relative to SET levels. Statistical significance for time to treatment and overall survival was analyzed using the proportional hazards regression and chi square tests, using an alpha of 0.05.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Results</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">We isolated mRNA from freshly prepared B-CLL cells from patients and normal B-cells from healthy volunteers, and determined SET mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). SET mRNA levels were 11.2&#xb1;2.7 fold higher in CLL cells than the mean of the normal B-cells (p=0.03) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Immunoblots from these same samples using an anti-SET antibody demonstrated that both the 290 amino acid &#x3b1;-isoform (accession #NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>001116293) and the 277 amino acid &#x3b2;-isoform (accession #NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>003002) that arise from alternative splicing were higher in the CLL cells than in normal B-cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The total SET (&#x3b1;+&#x3b2;) values were higher in CLL cells (0.048&#xb1;0.004) than in normal B cells (0.010&#xb1;0.003) (p=0.014) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). We also evaluated SET expression in the Raji and Ramos cell lines of human B-cell NHL. Unlike CLL cells, these cells proliferate rapidly in vitro and can be more easily genetically manipulated by lentiviral transduction. SET mRNA in Raji cells was 10.5&#xb1;0.7 fold higher than in normal B-cells, and 8.2&#xb1;0.4 fold higher in Ramos cells (p=0.0002) than in normal B-cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), which was similar to the overexpression levels observed in the CLL samples. Immunoblot analysis revealed elevated levels of SET protein in both Raji and Ramos cells relative to normal B-cell extracts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>). Similar to the CLL cells, both the &#x3b1;- and &#x3b2;-isoforms of SET were overexpressed in the NHL cell lines to comparable degrees, while the 277 amino acid &#x3b2;-isoform was more prominent than the &#x3b1;-isoform in normal B-cell samples (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">To determine if SET levels were indicative of more rapid CLL disease progression, we used Western blotting to quantify the levels of each isoform of the SET protein in cell extracts from 285 patients. Patients were selected for this study based on the availability of stored samples from first diagnosis and patient history. Detailed patient information is given in Table 1.</p>

We found that elevated SET&#x3b1; and total SET (&#x3b1;+&#x3b2;) levels correlated with increasing Rai stage (p values given in Table 2). Elevated SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratios correlated significantly with CD38 expression and elevated SET&#x3b1;, total SET (&#x3b1;+&#x3b2;), and &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratios correlated significantly with IGVH mutational status. No significant correlations were observed between SET expression levels and Zap-70 expression or cytogenetic abnormalities. Lack of correlation with cytogenetic abnormalities could relate in part to low numbers of patients in the cytogenetic abnormality subgroups.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">We have previously described peptide antagonists of SET that activate PP2A and lead to dephosphorylation of Akt and the p38 MAPK (Christensen et al. 2011). We confirmed that these peptides bound to both isoforms of SET in cell lysates from CLL samples (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). CLL cells generally do not proliferate in vitro, and they are difficult to transfect. Therefore, we measured PP2A activity in 32D:BCR/Abl, cells with elevated SET levels and suppressed PP2A activity. (Neviani et al. 2005) We infected these cells with lentivirus encoding a SET-specific shRNA or a control non-coding lentivirus and confirmed reduction of SET by Western blotting (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Cells infected with a control lentivirus were treated with COG449 (a dimerized derivative of COG112 (Li et al. 2006) (Singh et al. 2008)) or a vehicle control and PP2A activity was measured. SET antagonism with either SET-shRNA or COG449 increased the activity of PP2A relative to controls (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). Furthermore, we found that COG449 treatment at 1 &#x3bc;M increased the activity of PP2A in these cells to a greater level than did 5 &#x3bc;M FTY720 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>), a PP2A activator reported by Neviani et al. (Neviani et al. 2007).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Based on the increased activity of PP2A following SET antagonism using COG449, we evaluated the induction of apoptosis in primary CLL cells following treatment with COG449. CLL cells from seven patients were treated with COG449 or medium control for 2 hours. After treatment, cells were stained with Annexin-V and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. We observed a dose dependent increase in Annexin-V/propidium iodide staining with an ED50 of 330 nM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>). To analyze the modulation of anti-apoptotic proteins in CLL cells, we measured the effect of COG449 treatment on the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 and observed a dose dependent decrease in the cellular level of Mcl-1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Based on the induction of apoptosis in CLL cells, we tested several analogs of COG449 for cytotoxicity against CLL cells freshly isolated from a number of patients and against normal B-cells from healthy volunteers (Table 4). Cells were cultured with the agents for 72 hours, and the viable cells were assessed for cytotoxicity using the MTS assay. COG445 was cytotoxic to CLL cells isolated from patients with an ED50 of 110 nM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). In stark contrast, the EC50 for cytotoxicity in the B-cells from normal volunteers was found to be nearly 2-log units higher at &#x2267;10,000 nM. Similarly, COG449 was cytotoxic with an ED50 of 103 nM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). We also analyzed the effect of shRNA-mediated knockdown of SET on the growth of B-cell lymphoma cell lines. Knockdown of SET in Raji cells following infection with a SET-specific shRNA lentivirus resulted in a reduction of SET levels by approximately 50% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>). This SET knockdown reduced the growth after 72 hours (p=0.009) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>). Antagonism of SET with COG449 also inhibited growth of Raji and Ramos NHL cells in vitro (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6E</figref>, F). To determine if this cytotoxicity was modulated by PP2A, we treated Ramos cells with 1 nM OA (PP2A inhibitor) and found that this concentration of OA was not cytotoxic. However, treatment of the Ramos cells with 1 &#x3bc;M COG449 produced a robust cytotoxic effect that could be partially counteracted by treatment with OA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Based on the cytotoxicity of SET antagonism in vitro, we sought to determine if pharmacological antagonism of SET with COG449 could reduce growth of cancerous B-cells in vivo using a murine model. To determine if the transgenic TCL-1 model (Johnson et al. 2006) was a good candidate for testing of SET antagonist peptides, we isolated malignant CD5+ cells from the spleen of a TCL-1 mouse and performed Western blotting to determine if SET was overexpressed in these mice. We found that unlike human CLL cells, SET was not overexpressed in the TCL-1 mouse leukemia-like cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Therefore, we used a murine xenograft model with human Ramos NHL cells that overexpress SET. Female SCID mice were subcutaneously injected with 10<sup>7 </sup>cells into the left flank, and tumor growth was monitored daily by palpation and caliper measurement until tumors reached approximately 150 mm<sup>3 </sup>on day 11. Mice were randomly assigned to two groups so that initial tumor size was approximately equal between groups. Daily treatment with COG449 (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection into the right shoulder area) or a vehicle control was initiated and measurements were performed by an experimenter who was blinded to the treatment agents (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). At day 19 (a time when control tumor volume reached maximum volume allowed for humane reasons) mice were euthanized. Tumors were dissected, weighed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>), photographed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>), and segmented for pathological examination. Statistical analysis by two way ANOVA indicated that tumor growth was significantly inhibited by COG449 (p=0.0008) and final tumor mass was significantly lower in COG449 treated animals (p=0.0009, t-test). Disaggregated cells from one portion of the tumors were analyzed by flow cytometry, and shown to be human B-cells.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">SET overexpression was also observed in tumor samples from patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and melanoma (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The Prognostic Power for CLL Patients is Enhanced by Combining SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; Ratios with Other Prognostic Factors.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Based on the data showing that high ratios of &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; SET correlated with poorer overall survival and shorter time to treatment, we performed additional analysis of our patient cohort to determine if SET levels can also be used in conjunction with additional prognostic factors to identify patients with more aggressive disease.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Among the patients carrying mutated immunoglobulin-VH (IGVH) gene, there was significantly longer overall survival and TTT than patients with unmutated IGVH (p&#x3c;0.0001; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A</figref>, B). This is consistent with other reports of mutated IGVH patients having a better prognosis than those with unmutated IGVH [Damle, 1999, Mamblin, 1999]. Importantly, we found that among patients with mutated IGVH, patients with high &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratios had significantly different TTT than patients with low ratios of the two isoforms (p.&#x3c;0.0001; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>). Significant results were also obtained when analyzing overall survival in the IGVH mutated group with high and low SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratio groups (p&#x3c;0.0001; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>). In addition to mutational status, we analyzed patients with low CD38 expression, another group with a good prognosis [Ibrahim, 2001]. In this patient group, patients with a high SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratio had significantly different median TTT (3.9 years) than patients with a low SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratio (12.3 years, p&#x3c;0.0001). Similarly, patients with a high SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratio had significantly different overall survival (median time to death 16.9 years) than patients with a low SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratio (median time to death unreached; p&#x3c;0.005; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) A similar finding was also obtained for patients with high zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) expression [Rassenti, 2004]. Taken together, these data demonstrated that 1) the oncoprotein SET was overexpressed in CLL patient samples, 2) patients with higher SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratios had a shorter TTT and shorter overall survival than patients with lower SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratios, and 3) the prognostic power for CLL patients is enhanced by combining SET &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratios with other prognostic factors. However, no rapid method for determination of the &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; ratio exists in current clinical diagnostic labs.</p>

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">SET Isoform-Specific Antibodies and SET Isoform-Specific PCR Primers</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">We completed a test to determine if it was feasible to generate isoform specific antibodies. This was accomplished by synthesizing a peptide corresponding to the unique N-terminal region of SET&#x3b1; (sequence=MAPKRQSPLPPQKKKPRP-C; SEQ ID NO: 2) with a cysteine incorporated at the C-terminus of this peptide. The peptide was then coupled by maleimide chemistry to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and used to inoculate two rabbits that had been prescreened in dot blots for immunoreactivity to the peptide antigen. The rabbits were boosted with the KLH-antigen at 4 weeks and serum was obtained at 6 weeks. Dot blots performed with the peptide antigen immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane followed by Dot-blotting as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">We found that the anti-SET&#x3b1; immunized rabbits produced positive sera that did not react with a control peptide immobilized on the membrane (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The antibodies from each of the two rabbits were designated COG16 and COG17. Final confirmation of selectivity of the antibodies from the SET&#x3b1; immunized rabbits was demonstrated by completing Western blotting with a Ramos cell lysate. We used the Ramos cell line lysate because it expresses high levels of both the SET&#x3b1; and SET&#x3b2; isoforms and was used as our control in quantification of SET levels in the CLL patient samples [Longo, 2008]. When compared with a commercial goat antibody that recognizes both isoforms of SET, we found that the SET&#x3b1; selective sera recognized only the band that corresponded to the higher molecular weight SET&#x3b1; isoform (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>). Further confirmation of the selectivity was obtained by repeating Western blots with Ramos lysate using either the selective SET&#x3b1; sera alone or sera that had been preincubated with the peptide that was used for the immunization as the detection antibody. This showed that the preincubation of the sera with the antigen peptide could eliminate the ability of the antibody to recognize the SET&#x3b1; protein on the blot (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>). These results demonstrated the development of isoform selective antibodies that recognized unique isoforms of SET.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">To develop the polyclonal SET&#x3b1; specific antibodies, we used the 19 amino acid peptide MAPKRQSPLPPQKKKPRP-C (SEQ ID NO: 2) that matched the N-terminal 18 residues of the SET&#x3b1; isoform from the total unique sequence of the SET as shown in Table 5. This antigen was selected based on the Kyte-Doolittle Hydrophobicity scale [Liu, 2004], which has been used to design the SET&#x3b2; antigen listed in Table 5.</p>

The primers and probes used for SET alpha, SET beta and SET common (which is designed to detect both alpha and beta isoforms) are shown in Table 6. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, SET-1 alpha was specifically detected in the SET alpha control plasmid, whereas SET beta was specifically detected in the SET beta control plasmid. These data verified that the isoforms could be differentially detected by quantitative PCR.</p>
