<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A certificate of deposit (CD) is a time deposit, a financial product commonly offered to consumers by banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions. Such CDs are similar to savings accounts in that they are insured and thus virtually risk-free. A CD has a specific, fixed term (often three months, six months, or one to five years), and, usually, a fixed interest rate. It is intended that the CD be held until maturity, at which time the money may be withdrawn together with the accrued interest.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Commonly, institutions mail a notice to the CD holder shortly before the CD matures requesting directions. The notice usually offers the choice of withdrawing the principal and accumulated interest or &#x201c;rolling it over&#x201d; (depositing it into a new CD). Generally, a window is allowed after maturity where the CD holder can cash in the CD without penalty. In the absence of such directions, it is common for the institution to &#x201c;roll over&#x201d; the CD automatically, once again tying up the money for a period of time (though the CD holder may be able to specify at the time the CD is opened to not roll over the CD).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some people have a lot of CDs at a lot of institutions. Managing the CDs may be complex and time consuming. Additionally, people may have difficulty determining what to do with a CD's proceeds when the CD matures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A user may schedule certificates of deposit to be consolidated at maturity into an annuity, long term care insurance, or life insurance by an institution. A consolidation button or icon may be provided on a web page that is accessible to a user. The user may select the consolidation button or icon to schedule their CDs for consolidation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an implementation, a questionnaire may be provided to a user to determine whether the user is eligible for CD consolidation and to gather information pertaining to the user's CDs. A user may confer with a representative of the institution to ensure compliance and/or accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an implementation, the user may provide information pertaining to their certificates of deposit, such as amount and maturity dates to the institution. In response, the institution may provide recommendations to the user regarding consolidation of the CDs by rolling them into annuities or insurance.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an implementation of a system that may be used to provide certificate of deposit consolidation. By consolidation, it is meant that a user may schedule certificates of deposit to be consolidated or rolled over at maturity into an annuity, long term care insurance, or life insurance by an institution.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An institution system <b>5</b>, associated with or otherwise maintained by an institution such as a financial services institution, may include a consolidation processor <b>20</b> that may process a request to consolidate one or more CDs from a user computing device <b>95</b> associated with a user <b>90</b>. The consolidation processor <b>20</b> may retrieve information from storage, such as information storage <b>22</b> and user storage <b>24</b>, and use the information in processing the request to consolidate the user's CDs. The consolidation processor <b>20</b> may also store information pertaining to the user's CDs in storage, such as information storage <b>22</b> and user storage <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A consolidation plan generator <b>25</b> may generate a CD consolidation plan pertaining to the user's CDs and provide the consolidation plan to the user <b>90</b> via the user computing device <b>95</b>. The consolidation plan generator <b>25</b> may receive information from the user <b>90</b> via the user computing device <b>85</b>, the consolidation processor <b>20</b>, and from information storage <b>22</b> and user storage <b>24</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The consolidation plan generator <b>25</b> may use tools, calculators, applications, and aggregators, for example to generate a consolidation plan. In an implementation, the consolidation plan generator <b>25</b> may include one or more of a portfolio planner, a financial assessment tool, a budget generating tool, an asset allocation tool, a life insurance determination calculator, a retirement advice generator, bank calculators, debt analyzers, retirement income planners, etc. The consolidation plan generator <b>25</b> may evaluate user information (e.g., the personal information and the financial information pertaining to the user) and consolidation plan that may comprise financial advice and/or recommendations for the user <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Information storage <b>22</b> may contain information pertaining to users who have accounts or products hosted by the institution system, for example. Information storage <b>22</b> may include data that may be used in the generation of a consolidation plan for the user's CDs and may be used to process CDs for consolidation. User storage <b>24</b> may contain information directed to users, such as name, address, marital status, account information, products owned, etc., for example.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The institution system <b>5</b> may generate and provide a questionnaire to the user <b>90</b> that requests information from the user <b>90</b> such as financial objectives, information pertaining to the user's CDs, other financial products owned by the user, current income, investments, risk tolerance, expenses, tax returns, insurance coverage, retirement programs, estate plans, and other pertinent information that may be used in the consolidation of the user's CDs and/or to generate a consolidation plan that meets the user's overall or specific financial agenda. The questionnaire may be pre-filled or personalized with data already known to the institution system <b>5</b> pertaining to the user <b>90</b>, perhaps from existing accounts that the user has with the institution system <b>5</b>. The institution system <b>5</b> may generate a consolidation plan based at least in part on the questionnaire.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Information directed to CDs and CD consolidation may be provided via a website <b>10</b> to the user computing device <b>95</b> associated with a user <b>90</b>. For purposes of clarity and simplicity, an applicant for CD consolidation may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;user.&#x201d; Thus, any reference to a user herein also includes any type of applicant, institution member or prospective member, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an implementation, instead of hosting the website <b>10</b>, the institution system <b>5</b> may comprise a conventional application server hosting a proprietary online service accessible only by a private network. In any event, the institution system <b>5</b> may have appropriate security mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized third parties from intercepting the user's information.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The user <b>90</b> may provide data to the institution system <b>5</b> via the user computing device <b>95</b>. The user computing device may be a handheld computing device such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a mobile phone, for example, or any type of personal computer (PC). The user computing device and the institution system <b>5</b> may be connected over a network <b>88</b>. It is contemplated that the network <b>88</b> may be any type of private or public communication network such as, for example, an intranet, Internet, local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), wireless fidelity (WiFi) network, cellular connection, plain old telephone service (POTS), and the like. An example user computing device is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>

Selecting the consolidation button or icon <b>220</b> allows the user to consolidate their CDs at maturity into an annuity, long term care insurance, or life insurance, for example, as described further herein. A user may select the consolidation button or icon <b>220</b> by highlighting it and/or clicking on it for example.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is contemplated that the consolidation button or icon <b>220</b> may be provided and displayed on multiple web pages of a website. In an implementation, the consolidation button or icon <b>220</b> is only displayed for certain users, based on criteria pertaining to each user, for example. Example criteria may be based on whether the user already has an annuity, long term care insurance, and/or life insurance, or whether the user has a certain amount of debt, etc. After a user logs in to the institution system, or a website associated with the institution system, for example, the consolidation processor <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, may assist in determining whether or not the consolidation button or icon <b>220</b> is to be displayed for a certain user, based on information pertaining to the user. The information pertaining to the user may be retrieved from storage and/or provided by the user, e.g., in response to questions provided by the institution system.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another implementation, the consolidation button or icon <b>220</b> may be displayed to all users. It may then be determined, after the user has selected the consolidation button or icon <b>220</b>, whether or not CD consolidation is appropriate for that user. Such a determination may be made by the consolidation processor <b>20</b> and/or a service representative <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, for example, in conjunction with information pertaining to the user. The example information, data, and items shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are examples only and are not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an operational flow of an implementation of a method <b>300</b> that may be used to provide certificate of deposit consolidation. At operation <b>305</b>, a user may log into a website associated with the institution system and may be identified and authenticated using any known techniques. A web page may then be provided to the user at operation <b>310</b>. An example screen shot of such a web page is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Assuming that a consolidation button or icon is to be displayed on the web page (e.g., based on criteria pertaining to the user, displayed to ail users, etc.), the consolidation button or icon is displayed at operation <b>320</b>. The user may then select the consolidation button or icon at operation <b>330</b>. Such a selection may take the form of highlighting the button or icon, clicking on the button or icon, or any other known form of selection. At operation <b>340</b>, the user's CDs may be scheduled for consolidation, examples of which are described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an operational flow of another implementation of a method <b>400</b> that may be used to provide certificate of deposit consolidation. After being presented with a consolidation button or icon, the user may choose to consolidate their CDs by selecting the consolidation button or icon at operation <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an implementation, at operation <b>410</b>, it may be determined whether the user is eligible for CD consolidation. For example, the institution system may receive information pertaining to the user's personal and financial situations from storage and/or from the user, and based on this information determine whether the user is eligible for CD consolidation. A CD may be consolidated into an annuity (e.g., an immediate annuity, a fixed annuity, or a variable annuity), long term care insurance, and/or life insurance by rolling the proceeds of a matured CD into the purchase of an annuity or insurance, for example. In an implementation, if the user already has these products, then the system may determine that the user is not eligible for CD consolidation. Alternatively or additionally, if the user has a certain amount of debt, or meets other predetermined personal and/or financial criteria, the system may determine that the user is not eligible for CD consolidation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If it is determined that the user is not eligible for CD consolidation, the user may be notified via the website or email, for example, and/or a service representative may contact the user, at operation <b>415</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the user is eligible for CD consolidation as determined at operation <b>410</b>, or if operation <b>410</b> is not implemented (as it may be optional), processing continues at operation <b>20</b>. A questionnaire may be provided to the user at operation <b>420</b>. The questionnaire may request information from the user that may be analyzed and used to further determine whether the user is eligible for CD consolidation (e.g., the questionnaire may ask questions to determine if the user has adequate emergency funds, etc.), may be used to schedule CDs for consolidation into certain products upon maturity, may be used to docket maturity dates into a calendaring system so that the user may be advised when each CD is about to mature (e.g., 2 months priority to maturity, 1 month prior to maturity, 10 days prior to maturity, etc.) or has matured (on the day of maturity or shortly thereafter), etc. Prior to providing the questionnaire to the user, the questionnaire may be pre-filled or personalized with financial and/or personal data that is known to the institution system about the user, such as the user's name and known CDs for example. This information may be retrieved from storage associated with the institution system.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The questionnaire may be electronically provided to the user via the website or email, for example. The user may then fill out the questionnaire, responding to any questions or requests for information contained in the questionnaire, and electronically provide the filled out questionnaire back to the institution system, at operation <b>430</b>. The user may provide responses to the questionnaire that contain information about the user's CDs, such as the CD account number, name of the financial institution that issued the CD, routing (ABA) number, and date of maturity. The user may provide the questionnaire via the website, email, or any other electronic means.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an implementation, at operation <b>440</b>, it may be determined whether the user is still eligible for CD consolidation. This operation may be similar to operation <b>410</b>, and may be based on the information in the user's response to the questionnaire. If it is determined that the user is not eligible for CD consolidation (e.g., the user does not have adequate emergency funds, etc.), the user may be notified via the website or email, for example, and/or a service representative may contact the user, at operation <b>445</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an implementation, if the user is eligible for CD consolidation as determined at operation <b>440</b>, or if operation <b>440</b> is not implemented (as it may be optional), processing continues at operation <b>450</b>. At operation <b>450</b>, the user and a service representative may confer to discuss the CD consolidation, to provide a confirmation number, to confirm accuracy of the CDs and their related information, and to ensure compliance with any applicable disclosure laws, for example. Such a conference may take place by telephone or via an Internet chat session, for example, and may be initiated by the user or the service representative. It is contemplated that such a conference may be optional.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At operation <b>460</b>, CDs may be scheduled for consolidation and/or CDs may be monitored for maturity. Regarding consolidation, the CDs may, upon maturity, be scheduled to roll over or otherwise have their assets transferred into a previously selected annuity, such as an immediate annuity, a fixed annuity, or a variable annuity, or an insurance policy, such as long term care insurance or single premium life insurance.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">CDs may also be monitored by the institution system and as they reach maturity, the user may be advised or reminded that the CDs are reaching maturity or have matured. The institution system may send such an advisory or reminder by email, telephone, or other means, for example. The institution system may also provide one or more recommendations or options to the user for rolling over or otherwise transferring the assets from the maturing CD. The recommendations or options may include purchasing one or more annuities and/or types of insurance. The recommendations or options may contain general information and/or may be tailored to the user based on the personal and financial information pertaining to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an operational flow of another implementation of a method <b>500</b> that may be used to provide certificate of deposit consolidation. At operation <b>505</b>, the user provides CD information to the institution system, such as the amount, account number, maturity date, institution that issued the CD, and the routing (ABA) number, for each CD.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At operation <b>510</b>, the institution system retrieves user information from storage. The user information may comprise personal information and/or financial information. The institution system may request additional information from the user at operation <b>520</b>. Such additional information may be personal and/or financial information that the institution system does not have in storage and that may be useful to the consolidation plan generator in the generation of a consolidation plan. At operation <b>530</b>, the user may provide the additional information to the institution system. The additional information may be used by the consolidation plan generator in conjunction with the retrieved user information to generate a consolidation plan at operation <b>540</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A consolidation plan may contain information, recommendations, advice, and/or reminders, for example, regarding consolidating or rolling over some or all of the user's CDs as they mature. Consolidation or roll over may take the form of using the assets of the CD when mature to purchase one or more annuities and/or one or more types of insurance. A consolidation plan may provide recommendations as to how much insurance the user should consider purchasing and what type of annuities the user should consider purchasing. The consolidation plan may then be provided to the user, via a website or email, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The user may review the consolidation plan and sign an authorization form to authorize the financial institution to proceeds with the consolidation plan. The authorization form may be presented to the user via a website, email, facsimile, etc. In an implementation, the user may electronically sign the authorization form using any known electronic signature technique. The user may send the signed authorization form to the institution system where it is received at operation <b>550</b>. The institution system may then implement the consolidation plan, e.g., by sending a transfer form, at maturity, to the institution that issued a CD with instructions to forward the account to the institution system.</p>
