<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a control device for an internal combustion engine, which controls a plasma ignition operation for causing volume ignition of air fuel mixture by plasma in a combustion chamber of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, there is known an ignition technology for causing volume ignition of air fuel mixture by plasma in a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses an internal combustion engine to which a technology of this kind is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">More particularly, in the internal combustion engine of Patent Document 1, a spark discharge is generated in a discharge gap of a spark plug, and a microwave is radiated toward the discharge gap. The microwave pulses supply energy to plasma generated at the discharge gap. As a result thereof, electrons in the plasma region are accelerated, the plasma expands, and air fuel mixture is ignited in volume.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">PATENT DOCUMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. 2009-38025</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a plasma ignition operation for causing volume ignition of air fuel mixture by plasma in a combustion chamber, an air fuel ratio of flammability limit (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;lean limit&#x201d;) of the air fuel mixture increases, compared to a case in which air fuel mixture is ignited by, for example, spark discharge alone. In the plasma ignition, stronger plasma is generated compared to discharge plasma generated accompanied with the spark discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inventor of the present invention has found that, in the plasma ignition operation, improvement of the lean limit differs depending on fuel type. This means that variation in lean limit differs depending on fuel type in a case of volume ignition of air fuel mixture by plasma, contrary to a case of point ignition of air fuel mixture. Prior art internal combustion engines are not operable with various types of fuel. This means that the prior art internal combustion engines may not be able to maintain an adequate air fuel ratio of air fuel mixture during the plasma ignition operation, depending on the fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the above described problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a control device for an internal combustion engine, which can optimally control the plasma ignition operation independent of fuel type.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a control device for an internal combustion engine, which controls a plasma ignition operation for causing volume ignition of air fuel mixture by plasma in a combustion chamber of the internal combustion engine. The control device for the internal combustion engine is provided with a fuel type detection unit that detects a type of fuel to be supplied to the combustion chamber, and, during the plasma ignition operation, according to the detected fuel type that has been detected by the fuel type detection unit, adjusts a state of the plasma or a state of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the first aspect of the present invention, the type of the fuel to be supplied to the combustion chamber is detected, and, according to the detected fuel type, the state of the plasma or the state of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber is adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, in addition to the feature of the first aspect of the present invention, an air fuel ratio control unit is provided that controls air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber according to the detected fuel type during the plasma ignition operation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the second aspect of the present invention, during the plasma ignition operation, the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber is controlled according to the detected fuel type. By controlling the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber, the state of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber is adjusted. In the case of volume ignition of the air fuel mixture by plasma, as described above, improvement of lean limit differs depending on fuel type. A range of air fuel ratio in which the air fuel mixture can be stably ignited differs depending on fuel type. According to the second aspect of the present invention, based on these findings, the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber is controlled according to fuel type. The lean limit is defined as a value of air fuel ratio when COV (Coefficient Of Variance) becomes a predetermined value (for example, 5%). COV is defined as the standard deviation of IMEP (Indicated Mean Effective Pressure) divided by the mean value of the IMEP for each cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, in addition to the feature of the second aspect of the present invention, a plasma control unit is provided that, during the plasma ignition operation, changes input energy for generating the plasma based on an operation state of the internal combustion engine, and adjusts an air fuel ratio of flammability limit of air fuel mixture to a value that maximizes fuel consumption rate in the operation state. The air fuel ratio control unit controls the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber during the plasma ignition operation to the air fuel ratio of flammability limit of the air fuel mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the third aspect of the present invention, during the plasma ignition operation, the input energy for plasma generation is changed based on the operation state of the internal combustion engine, and the lean limit is adjusted to a value that maximizes the fuel consumption rate in the operation state of the internal combustion engine. Then, the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber during the plasma ignition operation is adjusted to the lean limit that is determined by the input energy for plasma generation. Thus, the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber during the plasma ignition operation is adjusted to a value that maximizes the fuel consumption rate in the operation state of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">There is a certain limit to an extent of expansion of the lean limit by way of plasma. However, until the limit is reached, the lean limit becomes higher as more energy is inputted for plasma generation. Conventionally, it has not been considered as to what criteria should be used to control the input energy for plasma generation during the plasma ignition operation. Therefore, there has been concern that, with intent to expand the lean limit by way of plasma, energy is inputted in excess of that required for plasma generation. In such a case, there is concern that, even if an actual air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture is adjusted to the lean limit, pressure is lowered due to expansion before the fuel burns out, unburned fuel increases, and the fuel consumption rate decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the other hand, according to the third aspect of the present invention, the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber during the plasma ignition operation is adjusted to the lean limit that is adjusted to a value that maximizes the fuel consumption rate in the operation state of the internal combustion engine. Therefore, the fuel consumption rate is optimized, and as well the input energy for plasma generation is prevented from being excessively larger than needed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the feature of the first aspect of the present invention, a plasma control unit is provided that changes input energy for generating the plasma according to the detected fuel type during the plasma ignition operation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, the input energy for plasma generation is changed according to the detected fuel type during the plasma ignition operation. By changing the input energy for plasma generation, states of the plasma such as energy density and size of the plasma region are adjusted. Incidentally, fuel ignitability differs depending on fuel type. If the plasma is generated with no regard to fuel type, there is a concern that the air fuel mixture is not appropriately ignited. According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, the input energy for plasma generation is changed according to the detected fuel type so that the fuel is appropriately ignited.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with a fifth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the feature of the fourth aspect of the present invention, the internal combustion engine repeatedly radiates pulse-like electromagnetic waves at a predetermined duty cycle for each ignition period in the combustion chamber, thereby generating the plasma, while the plasma control unit changes the duty cycle according to the detected fuel type.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the fifth aspect of the present invention, the plasma control unit changes, according to the detected fuel type, the input energy for generating the electromagnetic wave pulses to be repeatedly outputted. As the duty cycle increases, the input energy for plasma generation increases.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with a sixth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the feature of one of the first to fifth aspects of the present invention, the fuel type detection unit detects fuels identical in principal components but different in water content ratio as different types of fuels.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the sixth aspect of the present invention, the fuel type detection unit treats fuels identical in principal components but different in water content ratio as different types of fuels. For example, in a case of hydrous ethanol, the fuel type detection unit detects hydrous ethanol having water content ratio of 10% and hydrous ethanol having water content ratio of 20% as different types of fuels. Therefore, the state of the plasma or the state of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber is adjusted according to the water content ratio of the ethanol during the plasma ignition operation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with a seventh aspect of the present invention, there is provided a control device for an internal combustion engine, which controls a plasma ignition operation for causing volume ignition of air fuel mixture by plasma in a combustion chamber of the internal combustion engine. The control device for the internal combustion engine is provided with a plasma control unit that changes input energy for generating the plasma based on an operation state of the internal combustion engine, thereby adjusting an air fuel ratio of flammability limit of the air fuel mixture to a value that maximizes fuel consumption rate in the operation state, during the plasma ignition operation, and an air fuel ratio control unit that controls an air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber during the plasma ignition operation to the air fuel ratio of flammability limit, which is determined by the input energy for generating the plasma, of the air fuel mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the seventh aspect of the present invention, similar to the third aspect of the present invention, the input energy for plasma generation is controlled so that the lean limit is adjusted to a value that maximizes the fuel consumption rate in the operation state of the internal combustion engine. And then, the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber during the plasma ignition operation is adjusted to the lean limit. Therefore, the fuel consumption rate is optimized, and as well the input energy for plasma generation is prevented from being excessively larger than needed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the present invention, in controlling the state of the plasma or the state of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber, the type of fuel to be supplied to the combustion chamber is taken in consideration. Therefore, it becomes possible to optimally control the plasma ignition operation independent of fuel type.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the second aspect of the present invention, since, in a case of volume ignition of the air fuel mixture by plasma, a range of the air fuel ratio that allows stable ignition of the air fuel mixture differs depending on fuel type, the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber is controlled according to the detected fuel type. Therefore, it becomes possible to control the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture during the plasma ignition operation to an optimal value independent of fuel type.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the third and seventh aspects of the present invention, since the fuel consumption rate is used as a criterion for controlling the input energy for plasma generation, the fuel consumption rate is optimized, and as well the input energy for plasma generation is prevented from being excessively larger than needed. Therefore, it becomes possible to reduce energy consumed in the internal combustion engine. Furthermore, since the actual air fuel ratio is controlled to the lean limit, it becomes possible to suppress nitrogen oxide emission.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the following, a detailed description will be given of the embodiment of the present invention with reference to drawings. It should be noted that the following embodiment is a mere example that is essentially preferable, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, applied field thereof, or application thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present embodiment is directed to a control device <b>30</b> for an internal combustion engine <b>20</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;control device&#x201d;) for causing volume ignition of air fuel mixture by plasma in a combustion chamber <b>10</b>. It is to be noted that the control device <b>30</b> is merely one example of the present invention. Firstly, the internal combustion engine <b>20</b> will be described hereinafter before the control device <b>30</b> is described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Meanwhile, in the present embodiment, the air fuel mixture is ignited in volume by volume plasma (extremely thin plasma) that is stronger than discharge plasma generated by a spark discharge. The volume plasma is generated by supplying high frequency energy to the discharge plasma. In the present embodiment, a microwave in the gigahertz range is supplied to the combustion chamber <b>10</b> in synchronization with a spark discharge. However, in place of the microwave, energy of a high frequency wave in the kilohertz to megahertz range may be supplied to the combustion chamber <b>10</b>. Furthermore, in a case of generating the spark discharge alone, in place of a momentary high voltage pulse, a continuous high voltage may be applied to a discharge gap of a spark plug <b>15</b>, thereby generating the volume plasma. For example, following the spark discharge, electric energy accumulated in a capacitor may be supplied to the spark plug <b>15</b>, thereby generating strong volume plasma. The capacitor is connected to, for example, a transmission line between an ignition coil and the spark plug <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Construction of Internal Combustion Engine</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The internal combustion engine <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment is constituted by a plasma ignition engine, in which a piston <b>23</b> reciprocates. In the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>, the spark discharge by the spark plug <b>15</b> is caused to absorb microwave energy, thereby generating non-equilibrium plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the internal combustion engine <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment is provided with a cylinder block <b>21</b>, a cylinder head <b>22</b>, and pistons <b>23</b>. The cylinder block <b>21</b> is formed with a plurality of cylinders <b>24</b> having circular cross sections. It is to be noted that the number of the cylinders <b>24</b> may be one.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Inside of each cylinder <b>24</b>, the piston <b>23</b> is slidably mounted. The piston <b>23</b> is connected to a crankshaft (not shown) via a conrod (connecting rod, not shown). The crankshaft is rotatably supported by the cylinder block <b>21</b>. While the piston <b>23</b> reciprocates in each cylinder <b>24</b> in an axial direction of the cylinder <b>24</b>, the conrod converts the reciprocation movement of the piston <b>23</b> into rotation movement of the crankshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The cylinder head <b>22</b> is placed on the cylinder block <b>21</b>, and a gasket <b>18</b> intervenes between the cylinder block <b>21</b> and the cylinder head <b>22</b>. The cylinder head <b>22</b> partitions a combustion chamber <b>10</b> along with the cylinder <b>24</b> and the piston <b>23</b>. The cylinder head <b>22</b> is formed with one or more intake ports <b>25</b> and one or more exhaust ports <b>26</b> for each cylinder <b>24</b>. The intake port <b>25</b> is provided with an intake valve <b>27</b> for opening and closing the intake port <b>25</b>, and an injector (fuel injection device) <b>29</b> that injects fuel. On the other hand, the exhaust port <b>26</b> is provided with an exhaust valve <b>28</b> for opening and closing the exhaust port <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the present embodiment, a nozzle <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the injector <b>29</b> is exposed to the intake port <b>25</b>, and the fuel injected from the injector <b>29</b> is supplied to air flowing in the intake port <b>25</b>. To the combustion chamber <b>10</b>, air fuel mixture is introduced, in which the fuel has been mixed with the air in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cylinder head <b>22</b> of each cylinder <b>24</b> is provided with one spark plug <b>15</b>. The spark plug <b>15</b> is fixed to the cylinder head <b>22</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a center conductor <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the spark plug <b>15</b> is electrically connected to a pulse generator <b>36</b> and an electromagnetic wave oscillator <b>37</b> via a mixer circuit <b>38</b> that mixes a high voltage pulse and a microwave. To the spark plug <b>15</b>, the high voltage pulse outputted from the pulse generator <b>36</b> and the microwave outputted from the electromagnetic wave oscillator <b>37</b> are supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The pulse generator <b>36</b> includes an ignition coil for automobiles. The electromagnetic wave oscillator <b>37</b> includes a magnetron (with oscillation frequency of 2.45 GHz) and a pulsed power supply that supplies power to the magnetron. The ignition coil and the pulsed power supply are connected to a battery (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the configuration described above, when a discharge signal that instructs the pulse generator <b>36</b> to output the high voltage pulse is inputted to the pulse generator <b>36</b> from the control device <b>30</b>, the pulse generator <b>36</b> outputs the high voltage pulse to the mixer circuit <b>38</b>. Also, when a radiation signal that instructs the electromagnetic wave oscillator <b>37</b> to oscillate the microwave is inputted to the electromagnetic wave oscillator <b>37</b> from the control device <b>30</b>, the pulsed power supply supplies power to the magnetron, and the magnetron outputs the microwave to the mixer circuit <b>38</b>. The high voltage pulse and the microwave are mixed by the mixer circuit <b>38</b> and supplied to the spark plug <b>15</b>. As a result thereof, in the combustion chamber <b>10</b>, the microwave is radiated from the discharge electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the spark plug <b>15</b>. A spark discharge occurs between a discharge electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>and a ground electrode <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the spark plug <b>15</b> to form small scale plasma. Then, the small scale plasma is irradiated with the microwave from the discharge electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the spark plug <b>15</b>. The discharge electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the spark plug <b>15</b> functions as an antenna for the microwave. The small scale plasma absorbs energy of the microwave and expands. The air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber <b>10</b> is ignited in volume by the expanded plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The pulse generator <b>36</b>, the mixer circuit <b>38</b>, and the spark plug <b>15</b> constitute a discharge unit that generates plasma by way of discharge in the combustion chamber <b>10</b>. The electromagnetic wave oscillator <b>37</b>, the mixer circuit <b>38</b>, and the spark plug <b>15</b> constitute an electromagnetic wave radiation unit that radiates the electromagnetic wave to the plasma generated by the discharge unit. The mixer circuit <b>38</b> and the spark plug <b>15</b> constitute the discharge unit and the electromagnetic wave radiation unit, at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Application of the high voltage pulse and radiation of the microwave may take place at different positions. In this case, an antenna for the microwave is provided apart from the discharge electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the spark plug <b>15</b>. The mixer circuit <b>38</b> is not necessary. The pulse generator <b>36</b> is directly connected to the discharge electrode <b>15</b><i>a</i>, and the electromagnetic wave oscillator <b>37</b> is directly connected to the antenna for the microwave. The antenna for the microwave may be integrated with the spark plug <b>15</b> in such a manner as to penetrate through an insulator of the spark plug <b>15</b>. Also, the antenna for the microwave may be separated from the spark plug <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Construction of Control Device</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The control device <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment includes, for example, an ECU (Electronic Control Unit) for automobiles. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the control device <b>30</b> includes an operation state detection part <b>31</b>, a fuel type detection part <b>40</b>, a plasma control part <b>33</b>, and an air fuel ratio control part <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fuel type detection part <b>40</b> constitutes a fuel type detection unit that detects a type of fuel to be supplied to the combustion chamber <b>10</b>. The air fuel ratio control part <b>32</b> constitutes an air fuel ratio control unit that controls, according to the type of fuel (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;detected fuel type&#x201d;) that has been detected by the fuel type detection part <b>40</b>, the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber <b>10</b> during the plasma ignition operation. The plasma control part <b>33</b> constitutes a plasma control unit that changes input energy for plasma generation (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;plasma input energy&#x201d;) based on an operation state of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>, thereby adjusting the lean limit to a value that maximizes fuel consumption rate in the operation state of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The operation state detection part <b>31</b> performs a detection operation of detecting respective values of a plurality of parameters representing the current operation state of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b> such as a rotation speed, a load, an accelerator opening, an intake air flow rate, and a fuel injection amount of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>. During the detection operation, an output signal of an intake temperature detector <b>41</b> that detects a temperature of intake air in the combustion chamber <b>10</b>, an output signal of an intake flow rate detector <b>42</b> that detects an intake air flow rate, an output signal of an accelerator opening detector <b>43</b> that detects an accelerator opening, an output signal of an in-cylinder pressure detector <b>44</b> that detects an inner pressure of the combustion chamber <b>10</b>, and an output signal of a crank angle detector <b>45</b> that detects a crank angle are used to detect the rotation speed of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>, the load of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>, the accelerator opening, the intake air flow rate, and the fuel injection amount.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The fuel type detection part <b>40</b> is mounted in a fuel tank (not shown) that stores fuel to be supplied to the combustion chamber <b>10</b>. The fuel type detection part <b>40</b> measures physical quantities such as light transmission rate, relative permittivity, RME (Rapeseed Methyl Ester) density, and optical refraction index of the fuel in the fuel tank, thereby detecting the type of the fuel. The detection result of the fuel type detection part <b>40</b> is inputted to the air fuel ratio control part <b>32</b>. This means that information on the type of the fuel stored in the fuel tank is inputted to the air fuel ratio control part <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, an input unit for inputting the fuel type may be provided on a control panel of a vehicle, and the fuel type detection unit detects the fuel type based on an output signal from the input unit.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The plasma control part <b>33</b> is provided with a control map for plasma for determining the plasma input energy based on the operation state of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>. In the control map for plasma, as parameters indicating the operation state of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>, the load and rotation speed of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b> are employed. The control map for plasma can be used for determining the plasma input energy that can adjust the lean limit (lean limit for a predetermined COV) to a value of the air fuel ratio that maximizes the fuel consumption rate with respect to the operation state, which is determined from the two parameters, of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The lean limit increases in accordance with the increase in the plasma input energy. In the control map for plasma, compared to a first operation state, if a second operation state requires a higher air fuel ratio to maximize the fuel consumption rate, the plasma input energy for the second operation state is configured to be higher than that for the first operation state.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">More particularly, in the control map for plasma, as the plasma input energy, input energy for microwave radiation per ignition period (i.e., input energy to be inputted to the magnetron to radiate the microwave for each ignition period) is determined based on the operation state of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>. In the control map for plasma, as a parameter determining the input energy for microwave radiation per ignition period, a pulse width of the microwave is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The plasma control part <b>33</b> may be provided with a plurality of control maps for plasma corresponding to a plurality of fuel types. The plurality of control maps for plasma are provided for the fuel types, for which control maps for air fuel ratio, which will be described later, are provided. In this case, the fuel type detected by the fuel type detection part <b>40</b> is inputted as well to the plasma control part <b>33</b>, as shown by the dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The plasma control part <b>33</b> changes, based on the detected fuel type, the plasma input energy during the plasma ignition operation. Therefore, compared to a case in which the fuel type is not taken in consideration, the lean limit is more precisely adjusted to a value that maximizes the fuel consumption rate in the operation state of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, the air fuel ratio control part <b>32</b> is provided with the control maps for air fuel ratio to be used for determining the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber <b>10</b>. The control maps for air fuel ratio are provided respectively for a plurality of fuel types (for example, the following four fuel types; gasoline, methane, dry ethanol, and wet ethanol). Each control map for air fuel ratio can be used for determining the value of the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture, which is to be controlled to the lean limit (lean limit for a predetermined COV) that is determined by the amount of the plasma input energy. More particularly, a fuel injection amount from the injector <b>29</b>, which serves as a lean limit that is determined by the amount of the plasma input energy, is read from each control map for air fuel ratio.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Operation of Control Device</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The operation of the control device <b>30</b> will be described hereinafter in association with the operation of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>. In the following, a description will be given of the operation of the control device <b>30</b> for one cylinder <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the plasma ignition operation, the plasma control part <b>33</b> determines, for each combustion cycle, the pulse width of the microwave based on the operation state of the internal combustion engine <b>20</b> from the control map for plasma. Also, the air fuel ratio control part <b>32</b> determines, for each combustion cycle, the fuel injection amount from the control map for air fuel ratio so that the actual air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture serves as the lean limit that is determined by the pulse width of the microwave.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the internal combustion engine <b>20</b> during the plasma ignition operation, the intake valve <b>27</b> is open immediately before the piston <b>23</b> reaches the top dead center, and the intake stroke starts. In the plasma ignition operation, immediately after the piston <b>23</b> passes the top dead center, the exhaust valve <b>28</b> is closed, and the exhaust stroke ends. Immediately after the exhaust stroke ends, the air fuel ratio control part <b>32</b> outputs an injection signal to the injector <b>29</b> to cause the injector <b>29</b> to inject fuel. The air fuel ratio control part <b>32</b> outputs to the injector <b>29</b>, along with the injection signal, information indicative of the fuel injection amount that has been read from the control map for air fuel ratio. As a result thereof, the actual air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber <b>10</b> becomes the value of the lean limit in the case of volume ignition of the air fuel mixture by the plasma (the plasma generated in the current combustion cycle).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Immediately after the piston <b>23</b> passes the bottom dead center, the intake valve <b>27</b> is closed, and the intake stroke ends. After the intake stroke ends, a compression stroke of compressing the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber <b>10</b> starts. During the compression stroke, the plasma control unit <b>33</b> outputs a discharge signal to the pulse generator <b>36</b>. As a result thereof, a high voltage pulse that has been boosted in the pulse generator <b>36</b> is outputted to the mixer circuit <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">On the other hand, the plasma control part <b>33</b> outputs a radiation signal to the pulsed power supply of the electromagnetic wave oscillator <b>37</b>. The plasma control part <b>33</b> outputs, along with the radiation signal, information indicative of the pulse width of the microwave to the pulsed power supply. As a result thereof, the pulsed power supply supplies power to the magnetron, and the magnetron outputs the microwave to the mixer circuit <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The mixer circuit <b>38</b> mixes the high voltage pulse outputted from the pulse generator <b>36</b> and the microwave outputted from the magnetron, and the mixed high voltage pulse and microwave are supplied to the discharge electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the spark plug <b>15</b>. As a result thereof, a spark discharge occurs due to the high voltage pulse between the discharge electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>and a ground electrode <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the spark plug <b>15</b>, and small scale plasma is generated. The small scale plasma is irradiated with the microwave from the discharge electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the spark plug <b>15</b>. The small scale plasma absorbs the energy of the microwave and expands. In the combustion chamber <b>10</b>, the expanded plasma causes volume ignition of the air fuel mixture, and a combustion of the air fuel mixture starts. With this plasma, the lean limit of the air fuel mixture is adjusted to the value that maximizes the fuel consumption rate.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After the combustion of the air fuel mixture starts, the piston <b>23</b> is moved toward the bottom dead center by the expansion force of the combustion of the air fuel mixture. After the piston <b>23</b> passes a middle point of the stroke, before the piston <b>23</b> reaches the bottom dead center, the exhaust valve <b>28</b> is open, and the exhaust stroke starts. The exhaust stroke ends immediately after the intake stroke starts.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the present embodiment, a radiation signal is outputted before the spark discharge occurs between the electrodes of the spark plug <b>15</b>, and the microwave is radiated therefrom before the spark discharge occurs. The microwave is continuously radiated until after the spark discharge occurs. The microwave is radiated for an extremely short period of time. Each period of time of the microwave radiation is determined by the pulse width of the high voltage pulse outputted to the magnetron from the pulsed power supply. However, the timing of starting to output the radiation signal is not limited to timing before the spark discharge occurs between the electrodes of the spark plug <b>15</b>. As long as the microwave radiation can start before the small scale plasma disappears, the timing of starting to output the radiation signal may be any timing even after the spark discharge occurs.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Effect of Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the present embodiment, since, in the case of volume ignition of the air fuel mixture by the plasma, the range of air fuel ratio that allows stable ignition of the air fuel mixture differs depending on fuel type, the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber <b>10</b> is controlled according to the detected fuel type. Accordingly, it is possible to control the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture during the plasma ignition operation toward an optimal value independent of the fuel type.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, since the fuel consumption rate is used as a criterion for controlling the plasma input energy, the fuel consumption rate can be optimized, and at the same time, the plasma input energy can be prevented from increasing to the degree of being excessively larger than necessary. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce energy consumed in the internal combustion engine <b>20</b>. Also, since the actual air fuel ratio is controlled to the lean limit, it is possible to suppress nitrogen oxide emission.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">First Modified Example of Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a first modified example, during the plasma ignition operation, the air fuel ratio is not controlled according to the detected fuel type, but only the plasma input energy is controlled according to the detected fuel type. The plasma control part <b>33</b> controls the plasma input energy so that the plasma input energy increases as the fuel becomes less ignitable. Accordingly, it is possible to appropriately ignite the air fuel mixture independent of the fuel type.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The above described embodiment may be configured as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the present embodiment described above, the plasma for volume ignition of the air fuel mixture may be generated by a dielectric barrier discharge or a corona discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, in the present embodiment described above, the nozzle <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the injector <b>29</b> may be open to the combustion chamber <b>10</b>. In this case, fuel is injected into the combustion chamber <b>10</b> from the nozzle <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the injector <b>29</b>, for example, during the intake stroke. As a result thereof, the air fuel mixture is generated in the combustion chamber <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Furthermore, in the present embodiment described above, the fuel type detection part <b>40</b> may determine fuels different in water content ratio as fuels of different types. For example, the fuel type detection part <b>40</b> detects water content ratio of hydrous ethanol and determines hydrous ethanol having water content ratio of X % and hydrous ethanol having water content ratio of Y % (X&#x2260;Y) as different types of fuels. The air fuel ratio control part <b>32</b> controls the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber <b>10</b> according to the detected water content ratio with regard to hydrous ethanol. Meanwhile, the air fuel ratio control part <b>32</b> may control the plasma input energy according to the detected water content ratio with regard to hydrous ethanol.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Furthermore, in the present embodiment described above, the electromagnetic wave oscillator <b>37</b> repeatedly outputs microwave pulses at a predetermined duty cycle for each ignition period. In this case, the plasma control part <b>33</b> may change the duty cycle of the microwave pulses, thereby controlling the plasma input energy. Also, instead of changing the width of the microwave pulses, the plasma control part <b>33</b> may change the amplitude (peak power) of the microwave pulses, thereby controlling the plasma input energy.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
