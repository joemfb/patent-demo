<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of German application no. 10 2008 058 001.5 filed Nov. 19, 2008, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention concerns the production of vias through semiconductor substrates. Electrically conductive connections between the upper side and lower side of the semiconductor substrate are used in the vertical integration of semiconductor devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To connect more than one semiconductor device, a number of semiconductor chips are stacked vertically one on the other and connected together through electrical terminal contacts on the upper sides and lower sides. For this, electrically conductive connections must be made from the relevant upper side of the chip to the lower side through the substrate. This usually is done by etching holes in the substrate and then filling them with an electrically conductive material, usually a metal. If the electrical conductors made in this way do not reach the backside of the substrate, the substrate is thinned from the backside by grinding until the conductive material of the contact hole filling is exposed and in this way the via is produced. Metal layers can be applied to the surfaces of the substrate and structured into electric terminals. When the chips are stacked, the matching terminal contact areas are arranged on top of each other and, electrically connected together permanently, for example by soldering (J. Vardaman, &#x201c;3-D Through-Silicon Vias Become a Reality&#x201d;, Semiconductor International, Jun. 1, 2007).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vias with diameters of typically about 50 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m can be made by etching larger recesses with slanted side walls, for example, using KOH. A metal layer deposited in the recess is exposed from the opposite surface of the wafer and provided with a contact there. Current conventional methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,323,546, U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,923 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,825.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The metal layer of the via is covered with a passivation layer. It was established that cracks can occur in the passivation layer, or the passivation layer can separate from the metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 7,402,515 describes a via in which the contact hole is filled with a metal and a buffer layer is present to compensate for mechanical stresses between the semiconductor material and the metal. Materials mentioned for the buffer layer are silicones, acrylates, especially PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), polyimide, benzocyclobutene (BCB), epoxy resin, polyparaxylene, fluorocarbons, especially PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), organic silicon compounds like PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), polyesters and polyolefins.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to prevent damage to a passivation layer deposited on the metal in the contact hole of a via formed through a semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment of a production process according to the invention, first a substrate of a semiconductor material with a buried terminal pad of electrically conductive material is made ready. Coming from an upper side of the substrate, the semiconductor material over the terminal pad is removed and in this way an opening in the substrate is made. A dielectric layer is deposited, so that the subsequently deposited metal is isolated from the semiconductor material. Within the opening, an upper side of the terminal pad is exposed. A metallization that contacts the terminal pad and is separated from the substrate by the dielectric layer is deposited. The metallization is intended as the electric conductor of the via. A compensation layer that completely covers the metallization within the opening is deposited. A material that is suitable for reducing chemical stress between the metallization and the subsequently deposited passivation layer is chosen for the compensation layer. The compensation layer is preferably structured so that it is present within the opening and on a narrow region of the upper side at the edge of the opening. A passivation layer is deposited so that the passivation layer is separated from the metallization by the compensation layer at least within the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The semiconductor device accordingly has a substrate of semiconductor material that is provided with an opening that forms a bottom and a side wall. At the bottom of the opening there is an electrically conductive terminal pad. At the bottom and at the side wall of the opening there is a metallization, which is electrically connected to the terminal pad and separated from the semiconductor material by a dielectric layer. On the metallization there is a compensation layer, which completely covers the metallization within the opening. On the compensation layer there is a passivation layer, which is separated from the metallization by the compensation layer within the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The compensation layer can be a polymer, especially a polyimide. The passivation layer can be an oxide and/or a nitride of the semiconductor material. To complete the via to the backside of the substrate, a backside via can be arranged on the side of the terminal pad facing away from the opening.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An intermediate product of an example of the production process is shown in cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The substrate <b>1</b> of semiconductor material in this example has an isolation layer <b>2</b>, which divides substrate <b>1</b> into an upper semiconductor layer <b>3</b> and a portion <b>18</b> usually called bulk. Within the isolation layer <b>2</b> there is arranged a terminal pad <b>7</b> of an electrically conductive material, preferably a metal. Terminal pad <b>7</b> can be provided with an electric lead <b>17</b> arranged within the isolation layer <b>2</b> (indicated with a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a further embodiment). Lead <b>17</b> can be provided as the electric connection of the terminal pad with components integrated in the substrate. Terminal pad <b>7</b> enables a particularly easy production of the via.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The arrangement that is shown can be made by the process of wafer bonding, for example, known per se. In this process two semiconductor substrates or wafers are used, with one being for semiconductor layer <b>3</b> and the other for bulk <b>18</b>. A surface of one of the substrates is provided with the isolation layer <b>2</b>, which is then permanently affixed to a surface of the other substrate. This results in the layer sequence shown in cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in which the isolation layer <b>2</b> is embedded at its upper and lower boundary surfaces in the semiconductor material. In this production method the terminal pad <b>7</b> is produced on one of the two surfaces to be assembled and structured so that, after the wafer bonding, terminal pad <b>7</b> is buried as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Wiring that usually comprises one or more metal planes <b>5</b> and an intermetal dielectric <b>4</b> can be present on the upper side of substrate <b>1</b> above semiconductor layer <b>3</b>. For electric connection between the conducting paths of different metal planes, wiring vias <b>19</b> are provided through the intermetal dielectric. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in a schematic example, which can be modified as desired. In the embodiment that is shown, the upper side of the wiring is covered with a liner <b>6</b>, which can be made of Ti/TiN, for example, and can optionally also be used as an etch stop layer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A mask <b>8</b> is deposited and structured on the upper side of the device. This mask is, for example, a photo resist mask, which is preferably made relatively thick. Using mask <b>8</b>, an opening <b>9</b> is etched in the liner <b>6</b> and the intermetal dielectric <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a cross section through another intermediate product after etching the semiconductor material down to the isolation layer <b>2</b>. This etching step can be effected by RIE (reactive ion etching), preferably by DRIE (deep reactive ion etching). The isolation layer <b>2</b> in this case functions as an etch stop layer. In correspondence with the cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, opening <b>9</b> is made down to isolation layer <b>2</b>. The etching can preferably be carried out perpendicular to the upper side of the substrate, thus highly anisotropic, in order to form side walls in the etched opening <b>9</b> that are as steep as possible, and to limit lateral extension of opening <b>9</b> in this way to the diameter necessary for the via.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a cross section in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for another intermediate product after deposition of a dielectric layer <b>10</b>. There is no boundary indicated between isolation layer <b>2</b> and dielectric layer <b>10</b>, in order to point out that both layers can be made of an oxide. The dielectric layer <b>10</b> is deposited over the entire surface and can in particular be silicon dioxide. The method of CVD (chemical vapor deposition), especially SACVD (subatmospheric chemical vapor deposition), is suitable for deposition of dielectric layer <b>10</b>. This method is well known per se from the semiconductor industry.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows another intermediate product in cross section, after removal of dielectric layer <b>10</b> down to residual portions on the side walls of opening <b>9</b>. The terminal pad <b>7</b> is now exposed at the bottom of opening <b>9</b>. The partial removal of dielectric layer <b>10</b> can take place, for example, by means of RIE, where liner <b>6</b> serves as an etch stop layer. This is especially advantageous if an oxide of the semiconductor material is also used as intermetal dielectric <b>4</b>. The anisotropic etching allows dielectric layer <b>10</b> on the horizontal surfaces to be removed completely while dielectric <b>10</b> on the side walls within opening <b>9</b> remains sufficiently thick for isolation. Terminal pad <b>7</b> likewise serves as an etch stop layer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a cross section in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> after deposition of a metallization <b>11</b>. The metallization <b>11</b> can be produced, for example, by isotropic MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapor deposition), and is tungsten, for example. The metallization <b>11</b>, which is initially present over the entire surface, can then be etched back without using a mask. The process is carried out in such a way that the etching rate on the upper side is higher than at the bottom of opening <b>9</b> and at the side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a cross section in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, after the upper side removal of metallization <b>11</b>, of which now only a portion is still present on the bottom and at the side walls within opening <b>9</b>. Since the dielectric layer <b>10</b> was removed from the terminal pad <b>7</b>, at the bottom of opening <b>9</b> there is now an electric contact between metallization <b>11</b> and the terminal pad. Metallization <b>11</b> can then be contacted at the upper side by deposition of an upper side terminal metallization, called top metal in what follows. Any metal that is usually used for conductive paths is suitable for it, in particular, aluminum, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a cross section in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, after deposition of a layer of a top metal <b>12</b>, which forms a bead <b>20</b> at the upper edge formed by the rim of opening <b>9</b>, where the bead can be made larger or smaller than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This ensures that an electrically conductive connection is made between the remaining portion of metallization <b>11</b> and the top metal <b>12</b>. The electric connection between metallization <b>11</b> and top metal <b>12</b> is consequently already formed in situ upon application of top metal <b>12</b>. The top metal <b>12</b> can be structured in correspondence with the intended electric connections.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a cross section in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, after deposition over the entire surface of a compensation layer <b>13</b>, which does not fill opening <b>9</b>. The compensation layer <b>13</b> is made of a material that is suitable for reducing mechanical stress between metallization <b>11</b> and a subsequently applied passivation layer. Suitable materials are in particular polymers, for example a polyimide, which can be deposited, for example, by the substantially known nanospray process.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a cross section in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> after deposition of a passivation layer <b>15</b>. The passivation layer <b>15</b> can be a single layer or a multiple layer and can be formed, for example, with an oxide layer <b>15</b><i>a</i>, in particular a silicon oxide layer, and a nitride layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>deposited thereon, in particular a silicon nitride layer. Passivation layer <b>15</b> can be made, for example, by means of a standard PECVD process (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition). An oxide layer of the passivation layer <b>15</b> can also be deposited by means of an SACVD process (subatmospheric chemical vapor deposition). Layers of a multilayer passivation layer <b>15</b> can also be deposited partly by PECVD and partly by SACVD.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a cross section in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> after deposition of the compensation layer <b>13</b> and preparation of a mask <b>14</b> on compensation layer <b>13</b>. Mask <b>14</b> is preferably a photo resist, which is structured in the usual way by exposure to light, development, and selective removal with a solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a cross section in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> after structuring the compensation layer <b>13</b> using mask <b>14</b> and after removal of mask <b>14</b>. Of the compensation layer <b>13</b> there is now left a residual portion that covers the bottom and side walls of opening <b>9</b>, and a narrow region of the upper side along the rim of opening <b>9</b>. In the embodiment that is shown, in which the metallization <b>11</b> was removed on the upper side and a top metal <b>12</b> was deposited, the remaining portion of the compensation layer covers the metallization <b>11</b> completely. If a photoactive material is used for compensation layer <b>13</b>, for example, a polyimide, the compensation layer <b>13</b> can be structured even without using a special photo resist mask. This takes place, for example, by exposing the portions of the compensation layer <b>13</b> that are supposed to be removed to light and, after developing them, removing them by means of a solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a cross section in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> after deposition of passivation layer <b>15</b> onto the structured compensation layer <b>13</b> and the free surface of top metal <b>12</b>. With that one obtains an alternative arrangement by comparison with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Also, the passivation layer <b>15</b> can possibly be structured with a resist mask.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The via can be completed in an easy way by making a recess <b>21</b> in a backside region <b>16</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> by hatch lines, with which the backside of terminal pad <b>7</b> is exposed. An additional metallization <b>22</b> can be deposited there, which makes a complete electrically conductive connection between top metal <b>12</b> and the backside of substrate <b>1</b>. The same arrangement can be used for the backside region <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
