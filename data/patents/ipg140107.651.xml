<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation patent application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,654, filed on Apr. 21, 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,087,220, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT RE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a film sealing and wrapping machine with a rotary cut and seal jaw for wrapping a product with heat sealable material.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior art shrink wrap machines exist which are used to form a film bag around a product in a high production environment. Extreme Packaging, Inc. located in Orange County, Calif. is a manufacturer of high quality shrink wrap machines and has a philosophy of innovation and continuously improving their machines to increase efficiency. Extreme Packaging, Inc. has been producing high quality shrink wrap machines for the past 10 years.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The film sealing and wrapping machine discussed herein is an improvement of prior art shrink wrap machines.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The film sealing and wrapping machine discussed herein addresses the deficiencies with respect to prior art shrink wrap machines.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A film sealing and wrapping machine generally forms a tube around a plurality of products. In a sealing and cutting section of the film sealing and wrapping machine, cross seals and cuts are made between adjacent products to form individually film wrapped products. To improve the through put of the film sealing and wrapping machine and provide for a stronger seal and tighter bag or film bag, the sealing and cutting section of the film sealing and wrapping machine discussed herein incorporates one or more of the following aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">First, the sealing and cutting section has a rotary head with a sliding mechanism within rotary drums of the rotary head. The sliding mechanism provides for smooth, non-jerky operation as the rotary drums traverse a seal bar and pressure pad along a circular path. The sliding mechanism is enclosed within a lubricated housing that requires less maintenance and is quieter than geared mechanisms. The sliding mechanism has substantially less back lash compared to gearing systems. Since the sliding mechanism holds a tighter tolerance than gearing systems, the sliding mechanism encourages a more consistent positive pressure upon the film which results in consistently stronger seals and positive bag cutoffs thereby producing fewer rejects and higher efficiencies.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Second, the rotational speed of the rotating drums are adjusted as a function of product length and product height. The adjustments to the speed of the rotary drums allow adjacent products to be placed closer to each other and form smaller or tighter bags around each product thereby increasing through put of the film sealing and wrapping machine and also providing a tighter film bag.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Third, both the upper seal bar and the lower pressure pad may be spring loaded such that as the seal bar and pressure pad contact each other, the point of contact between the seal bar and pressure pad traverses in a horizontal plane generally parallel to a path of travel of the product. As such, the film is not pushed, pulled or deformed due to vertical movement of the seal bar and pressure pad during the sealing and cutting process. Rather, the point of contact between the seal bar and pressure pad is maintained parallel to the product's path of travel such that the seal bar and pressure pad forms a cross seal along the tube of film and cuts the tube of film without significantly disturbing the film.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Fourth, the seal bar and pressure pad traverse a circular path associated with the rotation of the rotating drums. During the rotation, the seal bar and pressure pad has a horizontal component of movement (i.e., left to right and right to left). The sealing and cutting section comprises a single belt that is guided by a series of pulleys upstream and downstream of the seal bar and the pressure pad. The belt forms a gap between which the seal bar and the pressure pad meet to perform sealing and cutting steps. During rotation of the seal bar and pressure pad, the gap defined by the belt must track the horizontal location of the seal bar and the pressure pad. To this end, the gap is mechanically linked to the lower pressure pad through a control carriage.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, the seal bar and the pressure pad may both be heated such as when sealing and wrapping cold products.</p>

As product <b>20</b> is propelled into the wrapping section <b>14</b>, a film delivery system <b>22</b> supplies wrapping film <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the wrapping section <b>14</b>. The wrapping film <b>24</b> forms a tube around the plurality of products <b>20</b> being fed into the wrapping section <b>14</b> by the feed unit <b>12</b>. The sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, supports the product <b>20</b> and the wrapping film <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The product <b>20</b> traverses in a left to right direction (i.e., upstream to downstream direction) as shown by arrow <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sealing and cutting section <b>16</b> comprises a rotary head assembly <b>28</b> in which an upper seal bar <b>30</b> and a lower pressure pad <b>32</b> forms a cross seal on the tube of the wrapping film <b>24</b> and cuts the tube of wrapping film <b>24</b>. When the film <b>24</b> on the front (i.e., downstream) side of the product <b>20</b> is sealed and cut and the film <b>24</b> on the rear (i.e., upstream) side of the product <b>20</b> is sealed and cut, an individually wrapped product <b>20</b> is provided downstream of the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The sealing and cutting section <b>16</b> incorporates one or more of four unique aspects which will be discussed in detail below. First, the rotary head assembly <b>28</b> has an internal sliding mechanism <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The sliding mechanism <b>34</b> permits the upper seal bar <b>30</b> and the lower pressure pad <b>32</b> to maintain its angular orientation (preferably, vertical) as upper and lower rotating drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) rotate in the direction shown by arrows <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Additionally, the sliding mechanism <b>34</b> provides quiet operation of the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>. The upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may be sealed and contain lubricants such that lubrication and maintenance do not have to be performed on a frequent basis. The sliding mechanism has substantially less back lash compared to gearing systems. Since the sliding mechanism holds a tighter tolerance than gearing systems, the sliding mechanism encourages a more consistent positive pressure upon the film which results in consistently stronger seals and positive bag cutoffs thereby producing fewer rejects and higher efficiencies.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Second, the rotational speed of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may be continuously varied as a function of product height <b>44</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), product length <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and angular position. By adjusting the rotating speed of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, a wider range of products may be wrapped by the film sealing and wrapping machine <b>10</b> and a tighter bag <b>52</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be formed around the product <b>20</b>. Also, a cleaner seal and cut is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Third, the upper seal bar <b>30</b> and the lower pressure pad <b>32</b> are both spring loaded. Beneficially, the spring forces of the upper seal bar <b>30</b> and the lower pressure pad <b>32</b> may be adjusted such that the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> may self align when in contact with each other such that the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> may apply even pressure on the film <b>24</b> and not distort the film <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Fourth, the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b> may comprise a single belt <b>48</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that is wrapped around a plurality of pulleys <b>50</b> such that the belt <b>48</b> receives the product <b>20</b> and the tube of wrapping film <b>24</b> upstream of the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> as well as receives the individually wrapped product <b>20</b> in film bags <b>52</b> downstream of the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The belt <b>48</b> forms a gap <b>54</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which is mechanically linked to a lateral position of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b>. As the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> rotate in the direction of arrows <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, the lateral position of the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> reciprocates from a left to right direction and a right to left direction. The gap <b>54</b> mechanically tracks the lateral position of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> through a control carriage mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As discussed above, one aspect of the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b> is the internal sliding mechanism <b>34</b> which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The internal sliding mechanism <b>34</b> may comprise a slider <b>56</b> which slides in a lateral direction along horizontal slide <b>58</b>. The sliding mechanism <b>34</b> may additionally include a vertical slide <b>60</b> which slides in a vertical direction with respect to the slider <b>56</b>. A crank throw <b>62</b> may be mounted to the vertical slide <b>60</b> and may also be mounted to the seal bar <b>30</b> or the pressure pad <b>32</b> as the situation dictates. As discussed above, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> maintain an angular orientation (preferably, vertical) as the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> rotate. The angular orientation is maintained because the horizontal slide <b>58</b> does not rotate but is fixed to a yoke <b>64</b> which is attached to a frame <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>) of the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>. The horizontal slide <b>58</b> remains stationary as the drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> rotate. The slider <b>56</b> slides horizontally along a path defined by the horizontal slide <b>58</b>. The vertical slide <b>60</b> is traversed up and down along a groove <b>68</b> of the slider <b>56</b>. The yoke <b>64</b>, horizontal slide <b>58</b>, slider <b>56</b> and the vertical slide <b>60</b> do not rotate but longitudinally slide against each other. This configuration allows the crank throw <b>62</b> to be located off center from a central rotating axis <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> to permit circular motion of the seal bar <b>30</b> or the pressure pad <b>32</b> and maintain angular orientation of the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> throughout the entire rotation of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, one of the upper or lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is shown. The rotation of the drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may rotate in a clockwise direction or a counterclockwise direction depending on whether the drum is the upper drum <b>36</b> or the lower drum <b>38</b>. The upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> rotate in reverse directions, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Accordingly, the concepts discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref> may apply to the upper drum <b>36</b> or the lower drum <b>38</b> but in an opposite manner. Beginning with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the crank throw <b>62</b> is located at the 6 o'clock position. As the drum <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> rotates in a clockwise direction, the vertical slide <b>60</b> is traversed upward in the groove <b>68</b>. Also, the slider <b>56</b> is traversed to the left along the horizontal slide <b>58</b>. Both sliding actions are accomplished in a smooth and non-jerky fashion. Unlike gears with teeth that must have multiple teeth releasing and engaging throughout the rotation, the sliding mechanism <b>34</b> does not have a gear with teeth. Rather, a smooth quiet sliding action is accomplished between lubricated components continuously in contact with each other. The sliding mechanism <b>34</b> is quieter than geared mechanisms and is not jerky because the sliding mechanism <b>34</b> does not engage and release multiple teeth at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The crank throw <b>62</b> is now traversed from the 9 o'clock position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> to the 12 o'clock position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. To this end, the crank throw <b>62</b> is traversed upward as the vertical slide <b>60</b> continues its upward traversal in groove <b>68</b>. Also, the slider <b>56</b> traverses back to the center. The crank throw <b>62</b> is traversed to the 3 o'clock position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> then back to the 6 o'clock position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to complete the cycle. As can be seen from the discussion above, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b>, which may be mounted to the crank throw <b>62</b>, maintains an angular orientation (preferably, vertical orientation) while also traversing along a circular path corresponding to a circular path <b>70</b> (shown in dash lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may additionally include a driven timing belt pulley <b>72</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which may be driven by belt <b>86</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The belt <b>86</b> wraps around the upper drum <b>36</b> as well as the lower drum <b>38</b> so that the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> rotate in reverse directions. The belt <b>86</b> may travel in a direction shown by arrow <b>88</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may additionally include a housing <b>90</b>. The housing <b>90</b> may have a casing <b>92</b>, a backing plate <b>94</b> and a cover plate <b>96</b>. As discussed above, the yoke <b>64</b> is fixedly attached to the frame <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>) of the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>. However, it is also contemplated that the yoke <b>64</b> may be attached to other stationary objects of the film sealing and wrapping machine <b>10</b>. The yoke <b>64</b> may additionally have a post <b>98</b> upon which a bearing <b>100</b> is mounted. The backing plate <b>94</b> is initially pushed onto the yoke <b>64</b>. To this end, the bearing <b>100</b> is disposed on the post <b>98</b> as well as on an interior surface <b>102</b> of the backing plate <b>94</b>. The backing plate <b>94</b> is also attached to the driven timing belt pulley <b>72</b> by bolts <b>104</b>. As the belt <b>86</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) drives the driven timing belt pulley <b>72</b>, the backing plate <b>94</b> rotates the cover plate <b>96</b> but the yoke <b>64</b> does not rotate. The bearing <b>100</b> is retained on the post <b>98</b> by retaining ring <b>106</b> which fits within retaining ring groove <b>108</b>. The horizontal slide <b>58</b> is mounted to the post <b>98</b> with bolts <b>110</b>. The casing <b>92</b> is attached to the backing plate <b>94</b> with bolts <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The slider <b>56</b> may have a groove <b>114</b>. The horizontal slide <b>58</b> is received within the groove <b>114</b>. The engagement of the horizontal slide <b>58</b> and the horizontal groove <b>114</b> of the slider <b>56</b> limits movement of the slider <b>56</b> to horizontal left and right movements. The vertical slide <b>60</b> and the crank throw <b>62</b> may be fixedly attached to each other by bolt <b>118</b>. The crank throw <b>62</b> may have a post <b>120</b> upon which a bearing <b>122</b> is mounted. The bearing <b>122</b> is retained on the post <b>120</b> by retaining ring <b>124</b> fitted within a groove of the post <b>120</b>. The crank throw <b>62</b> is mounted to the cover plate <b>96</b> by mounting bearing <b>122</b> in an aperture <b>126</b> of the cover plate <b>96</b>. The cover plate <b>96</b> is mounted to the casing <b>92</b> via bolts <b>128</b>. When mounted, the vertical slide <b>60</b> is disposed within groove <b>68</b> of the slider <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The belt <b>86</b> drives the driven timing belt pulley <b>72</b> in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction depending on whether the belt <b>86</b> is driving the upper or lower drum <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. Rotational motion is imparted to the bearing <b>122</b> and the crank throw <b>62</b> by the cover plate <b>96</b>. The angular orientation of the corresponding seal bar <b>30</b> or pressure pad <b>32</b> remains constant throughout the entire travel of the corresponding seal bar <b>30</b> or pressure pad <b>32</b> along a circular path corresponding to the circular path <b>70</b>. To this end, the vertical slide <b>60</b> slides within groove <b>68</b> of the slider <b>56</b> and the slider <b>56</b> slides along the horizontal slide <b>58</b> as discussed above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although the sliding mechanism <b>34</b> discussed above shows the horizontal slide <b>58</b> in a generally horizontal orientation and the vertical slide <b>60</b> traversing along a generally vertical path, the slide <b>58</b> may be positioned at any angle (i.e., 360 degrees). Nonetheless, the groove <b>68</b> of the slider <b>56</b> and the groove <b>114</b> of the slider <b>56</b> are generally perpendicular to each other. Accordingly, the slider <b>56</b> and the slide <b>60</b> traverse along paths that are perpendicular to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, two rotating upper drums <b>36</b> confer rotation on the upper seal bar <b>30</b> along its circular path during rotation of the upper drums <b>36</b>. The upper drums <b>36</b> are connected to the seal bar <b>30</b> in the following manner. The post <b>120</b> of the crank throw <b>62</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>) for each upper drum <b>36</b> is attached to opposed distal end portions of a main upper cross bar <b>130</b>. The seal bar <b>30</b> is attached in a spring loaded manner to the main upper cross bar <b>130</b>. The lower pressure pad <b>32</b> may also be attached to the lower rotating drums <b>38</b> in a similar fashion. In particular, the post <b>120</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>) of each lower rotating drum <b>38</b> may be attached to a lower main cross bar <b>132</b> which is subsequently attached to the lower pressure pad <b>32</b> in a spring loaded manner. Note that the yokes <b>64</b> of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are attached to the frame <b>66</b> of the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As discussed above, the spring loaded aspect of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> provides certain benefits as discussed herein. By way of example and not limitation, the spring loaded upper seal bar <b>30</b> and the spring loaded lower pressure pad <b>32</b> are self-aligning. For example, if the left side of the upper seal bar <b>30</b> and the lower pressure pad <b>32</b> contacts before the right side thereof <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, or vice versa, the springs level the upper seal bar <b>30</b> and the lower pressure pad <b>32</b> to each other. It is also contemplated that the stroke of the spring may be adjustably increased or decreased with an adjustment nut or screw to respectively increase or decrease the dwell time (i.e., contact time) of the upper seal bar <b>30</b> and the lower pressure pad <b>32</b>. The stroke adjustment encourages improved sealing and cutting of a greater range of film gauges and formulations (i.e., types).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, before the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> contact each other, the springs <b>134</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) of the seal bar <b>30</b> are preloaded. Springs <b>134</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>are shown as one spring for clarity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Likewise, the springs <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) of the lower pressure pad <b>32</b> are preloaded. Springs <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are shown as one spring for clarity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The springs <b>134</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>are preloaded to have a cumulative spring force about equal to the cumulative spring force of the springs <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. It is contemplated that the preload on the springs <b>134</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>and/or springs <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may be adjusted via a nut. Also, it is contemplated that the spring force of the springs <b>134</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>and/or springs <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may be adjusted via a nut or by replacing the springs with stronger or weaker springs. Also, the spring constant of the springs <b>134</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>as a whole is about equal to the spring constant of the springs <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> rotate, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> make contact (see pt. B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) with each other and the film <b>24</b> (film not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for clarity). As the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> continue to rotate, the seal bar <b>30</b> maintains contact with the pressure pad <b>32</b>. Moreover, the point of contact between the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> is generally maintained within a plane defined by the path of travel <b>138</b> of the product <b>20</b>. Preferably, the point of contact between the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> is located at a midpoint between a rotating axis <b>140</b> of the upper rotating drum <b>36</b> and a rotating axis <b>142</b> of the lower rotating drum <b>38</b>. The point of contact is also preferably aligned to about a vertical midpoint <b>144</b> of the product <b>20</b>. Since the contact point between the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> is maintained at generally the midpoint <b>144</b> of the product <b>20</b> or at a constant point as the film <b>24</b> is being sealed and cut by the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> do not deform the film <b>24</b> during the sealing and cutting process. The seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> maintain contact for a defined angle of rotation <b>146</b> as well as a defined linear length <b>148</b> corresponding to the angle of rotation <b>146</b>. After the upper and lower rotating drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> have proceeded through the angle of rotation <b>146</b>, the seal bar <b>30</b> disengages the pressure pad <b>32</b> after point C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, springs <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are disposed between the lower pressure pad <b>32</b> and the lower main cross bar <b>132</b>. Guide rods <b>156</b><i>a, b </i>are disposed within sleeves <b>158</b><i>a, b </i>and attached to the pressure pad <b>32</b>. In relation to the seal bar <b>30</b>, the same is attached to the main upper cross bar <b>130</b> with guide rods <b>156</b><i>c, d</i>. The guide rods <b>156</b><i>c, d </i>are spring loaded with the springs <b>134</b><i>a, f</i>. Springs <b>134</b><i>b</i>-<i>e </i>also provide a downward spring force to the seal bar <b>30</b>. If the seal bar <b>30</b> is spring loaded and the pressure pad <b>32</b> is not spring loaded, then the springs <b>134</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>must deflect the entire amount to ensure proper sealing and cutting of the film <b>24</b>. Fortunately, in the film sealing and wrapping machine <b>10</b> discussed herein, the upper seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> may both be spring loaded. The springs <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and the springs <b>134</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>each deflect a smaller amount compared to the situation where only the upper seal bar <b>30</b> is spring loaded or only the lower pressure pad <b>32</b> is spring loaded. This allows a higher throughput through the rotary head assembly <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The film sealing and wrapping machine <b>10</b> is capable of forming film bags <b>52</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) around products <b>20</b> of various lengths <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>) and heights <b>44</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>). The products <b>20</b> flow through the machine <b>10</b> along the path of travel <b>138</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) in a sequential manner one after the other. The sealing and cutting section <b>16</b> seals the tube of film <b>24</b> and cuts the same between adjacent products <b>20</b>. In this manner, the product <b>20</b> is enclosed within the bag <b>52</b> of film. The speed of rotation of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is adjusted to the product length <b>46</b> and the product height <b>44</b> to prevent the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> from hitting adjacent products <b>20</b> as the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> enter a gap <b>55</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>). Also, the speed of rotation of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is adjusted to the product length <b>46</b> and the product height <b>44</b> to prevent the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> from hitting adjacent products <b>20</b> as the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> leave the gap <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> must make one revolution from one gap <b>55</b> defined by adjacent products <b>20</b> to the next gap <b>55</b> defined by subsequent adjacent products. The time it takes the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> to make one revolution must generally equal the time it takes two gaps <b>55</b> to pass the same point in the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>. The sealing and cutting section <b>16</b> seals the film <b>24</b> at the frontal (i.e., downstream) end of the product <b>20</b>. When the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> are in contact with each other (i.e., during the angle of rotation) the horizontal speed <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> is generally equal to the speed of the product <b>20</b> or belt <b>48</b>. This prevents the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> from pushing or pulling the film <b>24</b> thereby preventing deformation of the film <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">After the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> rotate through the angle of rotation <b>146</b>, the speed of the rotating drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may be changed (e.g., accelerated) such that the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> moves out of the way of the upstream product <b>20</b> and does not hit the back end of the adjacent downstream product <b>20</b>. For example, after the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> has cleared adjacent products <b>20</b>, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> may be accelerated to its outer most position. For the seal bar <b>30</b>, this is the 12 o'clock position. For the pressure pad <b>32</b>, this is the 6 o'clock position. For long products, the product <b>20</b> passes between the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> while the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> wait (i.e., stop) at this outer most position. As the back end of the product <b>20</b> approaches the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b>, the upper and lower rotating drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> rotate and accelerate the upper seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> between the upcoming gap <b>55</b>. The rotational cycle of the drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is then completed. In this manner, the rotating drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> rotate one revolution for each product or bag length.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For long products (i.e., products that require a bag length greater than a circumference of the circular path <b>70</b>), the horizontal travel speed of the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> during contact is equal to the horizontal speed of the product <b>20</b> but at some point after the angle of rotation <b>146</b>, the rotational speed of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> slows down or stops such that the time for one revolution of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is equal to the time required for one bag length to pass through the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>. Conversely, for products that require a short bag length (i.e., a bag length which is less than a circumference of the circular path <b>70</b>), the rotational speed of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is at some point accelerated after the angle of rotation <b>146</b> such that the time for one revolution of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is equal to the time for one bag length to traverse through the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For thin products, there is little or no risk that the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> will hit the front end of the incoming product <b>20</b> or hit the back end of the outgoing product <b>20</b>. As such, the rotational speed of the upper and lower drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may be adjusted (e.g., accelerated) immediately before and after the angle of rotation <b>146</b>. However, for thicker products, the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> may hit the front end of the incoming product <b>20</b> as the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> approach each other to begin the sealing and cutting process. Also, the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> may hit the back end of the outgoing product <b>20</b> after completion of the sealing and cutting process. To mitigate this risk, the horizontal speed <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> may equal the speed of product <b>20</b> or belt <b>48</b> traveling through the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b> for a greater angle than the angle of rotation <b>146</b>. When the horizontal speed of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> is equal to the belt speed of the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b> or product <b>20</b>, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> is said to have a position lock on the products <b>20</b> or belt <b>48</b>. The amount of position lock varies as a function of product height <b>44</b>. For thin products, the amount of position lock equals the angle of rotation <b>146</b>. For thicker products, the amount of position lock can theoretically occur at the 9 o'clock position to the 3 o'clock position for the upper drum <b>36</b>. By way of example and not limitation, the amount of position lock is approximately 30 degrees on either side when the seal bar <b>30</b> is at the 6 o'clock position and pressure pad <b>32</b> is at the 12 o'clock position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For most lengths and thicknesses of products, the horizontal speed of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> during the angle of rotation <b>146</b> is equal to the linear speed of the belt <b>48</b>. For products <b>20</b> that require a bag length shorter than the circumference of the circular path <b>70</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) of the drum <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, the rotational speed of the drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> must be accelerated at some point after the angle of rotation <b>146</b> such that the time for one revolution of the drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is equal to the time for one bag length to traverse through the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>. For short and thin products, the speed of the drums <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may be accelerated immediately after the angle of rotation <b>146</b>. However, for short but thicker products, the amount of position lock increases to an amount greater than the angle of rotation <b>146</b> to an extent that the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> may be accelerated out of the gap <b>55</b> or into the gap <b>55</b> without hitting adjacent products <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For long but thin products, during the angle of rotation <b>146</b>, the horizontal speed <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> is equal to the linear speed of the belt <b>48</b>. Long products require a bag length greater than the circumference of the circular path <b>70</b> of the drum <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. After the angle of rotation <b>146</b>, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> has additional time to make one revolution since the bag length is greater than a circumference of the circular path of travel <b>70</b>. As such, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> may be accelerated, decelerated, or a combination thereof to the outermost position and stopped to wait for the subsequent gap <b>55</b> between adjacent products <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> may be slowed down or decelerated to synchronize the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> to meet up with the subsequent gap <b>55</b>. As the thickness of the long product <b>20</b> increases, the amount of position lock increases to an amount greater than the angle of rotation <b>146</b> to an extent that the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> may be accelerated out of the gap <b>55</b> or into the gap <b>55</b> without hitting adjacent products <b>20</b>. The seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> may be accelerated to its outermost position and stopped to wait for the subsequent gap <b>55</b> between adjacent products <b>20</b> or the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> may be decelerated to time the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> to meet up with the subsequent gap <b>55</b>. Alternatively, it is contemplated that after the angle of rotation <b>146</b>, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> may be accelerated out of the gap <b>55</b> to clear the product <b>20</b> then decelerated or stopped at its outermost position. As the upcoming gap <b>55</b> approaches, the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> may be accelerated into the upcoming gap <b>55</b>. At some point, the horizontal speed <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> of the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b> may be adjusted to establish position lock.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a perspective view of a lower rotating drum <b>38</b> is shown. The lower rotating drum <b>38</b> is driven by belt <b>86</b> travelling in the direction <b>88</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the belt <b>48</b> upon which the product <b>20</b> rests upon is a single belt that loops through pulleys <b>50</b>. The single belt <b>48</b> is located downstream and upstream of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b> to form the gap <b>54</b> which tracks the horizontal position of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b>. In order for the gap <b>54</b> to track the position of the seal bar <b>30</b> and pressure pad <b>32</b>, the lower main cross bar <b>132</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) may be mechanically connected to an elongate bar <b>160</b>. The elongate bar <b>160</b> may extend downwardly. The elongate bar <b>150</b> may be engaged through a linear bearing box <b>162</b> within which there is a linear bearing that allows the bar <b>160</b> to slide vertically up and down as the lower main cross bar <b>132</b> follows the circular path <b>70</b> and as the lower drum <b>38</b> rotates. The elongate bar <b>160</b> also imposes horizontal forces to push a carriage <b>164</b> left and right. The rollers <b>50</b><i>a, b </i>which define the gap <b>54</b> may be mounted to the carriage <b>164</b>. In this manner, the gap <b>54</b> tracks the horizontal position of the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a further aspect of the sealing and cutting section <b>16</b>, the upper seal bar <b>30</b> and the lower pressure pad <b>32</b> may both be heated. This is especially useful for running cold or frozen products which remove residual heat from the seal pad during the sealing and cutting process. The additional heat from the pressure pad <b>32</b> provides for a stronger seal at higher speeds or through put.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an aspect of the film sealing and wrapping machine, the film may be a shrink wrap film, polyolefin, polyethylene, PVC, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The above description is given by way of example, and not limitation. Given the above disclosure, one skilled in the art could devise variations that are within the scope and spirit of the invention disclosed herein, including various ways of spring loading the seal bar <b>30</b> and the pressure pad <b>32</b>.
