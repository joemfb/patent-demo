<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to data communication and, more particularly, the encryption of data communicated over a wireless network.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Security is a major concern in data communication. One means of securing data communications is encryption, wherein the data is transformed utilizing a cryptographic algorithm (encrypted) into an unrecognizable form before transfer and then transformed using a corresponding cryptographic algorithm (decrypted) back into its original form by the intended recipient by means available only to the recipient or to a limited number of intended parties. The data is thereby rendered undiscoverable by unintended parties.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In securing data communication over an open network that is not confined to a locally secured network, hardware inline encryption devices may be utilized to encrypt the data communicated over the open network. Such devices may include Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) encryption devices which utilize the IPSec protocol suite. These encryption devices may have security associations that require fixed (unchanging) internet protocol (IP) addresses in order to be correctly identified when communicating with other encryption devices. The utilization of such encryption devices provides the potential for an exceptionally high level of security in network communications.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be advantageous to provide such a high level of security in communications involving handheld wireless communication devices such as mobile phones or personal digital assistants (PDAs.) These handheld devices typically utilize wireless networks that are only intermittently connected and require the utilization of dynamic internet protocol (IP) addresses for data communication. For this reason, it has not been possible to utilize in such a network a hardware inline network encryptor such as an IPSec encryption device or any other encryption device that requires the use of fixed IP addresses. A means is therefore desired for employing fixed IP address based encryption devices in a dynamic IP address based communication environment.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment of the invention described herein, a method and system are provided for utilizing fixed internet protocol (IP) address based encryption devices in communicating data between an enclave and a handheld communication device deployed on a dynamic IP address based wireless carrier network. The handheld communication device may be, for example, a mobile phone or personal digital assistant (PDA.) The fixed IP address based encryption devices are, for example, Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) devices. An enclave fixed IP address based encryption device is provided within the enclave and a mobile fixed IP address based encryption device is provided on the handheld communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In data communication from the enclave to the handheld communication device, the enclave fixed IP address based encryption device encrypts the data and provides to an intermediate system (via, for example, the internet) a fixed IP address based data packet containing a fixed source IP address, a fixed destination IP address, and the encrypted data. The intermediate system obtains the fixed IP address based data packet from the enclave and encapsulates the fixed IP address based data packet into a network data packet containing a network source IP address, a network destination IP address, and the encapsulated fixed IP address based data packet. The intermediate system provides the network data packet to the handheld communication device over the dynamic IP address based wireless carrier network. The handheld communication device decapsulates the fixed IP address based data packet from the network data packet and provides the fixed IP address based data packet to the mobile fixed IP address based encryption device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In data communication from the handheld communication device to the enclave, the mobile fixed IP address based encryption device encrypts the data and provides a fixed IP address based data packet containing a fixed source IP address, a fixed destination IP address, and the encrypted data. The handheld communication device encapsulates the fixed IP address based data packet into a network data packet containing a network source IP address, a network destination IP address, and the encapsulated fixed IP address based data packet. The handheld communication device provides the network data packet over the dynamic IP address based wireless carrier network to the intermediate system, which decapsulates the fixed IP address based data packet from the network data packet. The intermediate system provides the decapsulated fixed IP address based data packet (via, for example, the internet) to the enclave, where the enclave fixed IP address based encryption device decrypts the data.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The method and system described above provides the ability to utilize fixed IP address based encryption devices in data communications between and enclave and a handheld communication device that is deployed on a dynamic IP address based wireless carrier network. This allows for the advantages provided by such devices to be extended to popular mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDAs that utilize wireless carrier networks which require dynamic IP addressing. Such advantages may include the high level of security provided by IPSec devices. Sensitive applications such as secure email can thereby be securely extended to wireless handheld devices that communicate via dynamic IP address based wireless carrier networks.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a communication system <b>100</b> in which secure data communication are provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an enclave <b>110</b> is provided which includes a secure enclave domain <b>112</b> and an enclave encryption device <b>114</b> resident in the enclave <b>110</b>. The enclave <b>110</b> can be any commercial or government entity which requires a high degree of data security. The secure enclave domain <b>112</b> may contain a number of computer systems and internal networks that are highly protected from outside access by firewalls and other means. Such computer systems may include servers for email and other applications. When such applications need to send data outside the secure enclave domain <b>112</b>, the data is encrypted by the enclave encryption device <b>114</b> before being sent outside the enclave <b>110</b>. Similarly, when applications receive data from outside the secure enclave domain <b>112</b>, the data is decrypted by the enclave encryption device <b>114</b> before being provided to the secure enclave domain <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The enclave encryption device <b>114</b> can be any fixed internet protocol (IP) address based encryption device appropriate to the system at hand. As defined herein, a fixed IP address based encryption device is an encryption device that requires fixed (unchanging) IP addresses in securely communicating with a corresponding encryption device. The enclave encryption device <b>114</b> is, for example, an inline network encryption device, such as an IPSec encryption device, which has security associations that require fixed IP addresses in order to be correctly identified when communicating with other IPSec encryption devices. Examples of such devices are HAIPE&#xae; devices such as the ViaSat KG-250 IP network encryptor as well as many general purpose network appliances such as Cisco 2801/3855 routers with appropriate encryption options.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The enclave <b>110</b> communicates via the enclave encryption device <b>114</b> over a network such as the internet <b>120</b> with a network operations center <b>130</b>. The network operations center <b>130</b> includes a network operations center (NOC) encapsulator <b>136</b> which performs encapsulation and decapsulation of data packets allowing for the data to be communicated over a dynamic IP address based wireless carrier network <b>140</b> that requires the utilization of dynamic (potentially changing) IP addresses. The wireless carrier network may be, for example, a wireless network provided by AT&#x26;T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, or any of a variety of European carriers. The network operations center <b>130</b> may contain numerous other components (not shown) which facilitate and secure data communication. In one advantageous embodiment, the network operations center <b>130</b> contains a multi-protocol router which provides routing supporting communication over a variety of networks and network types utilizing different data communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The network operations center <b>130</b> provides an intermediate system which sends and receives data over the wireless carrier network <b>140</b> to and from a handheld communication device <b>150</b>. The handheld communication device <b>150</b> is, for example, a personal electronic device (PED) such as a mobile phone or personal digital assistant (PDA) which includes a memory capable of storing software applications, a processor capable of performing software applications and a transceiver capable of sending and receiving data utilized by such applications. The handheld communication device <b>150</b> includes a secure handheld domain <b>152</b> which is protected from outside access such that sensitive applications can be performed such as secure email. When such applications need to send or receive data outside the secure handheld domain <b>152</b>, the data is, before being sent, encrypted by a mobile encryption device <b>154</b> resident on the handheld communication device <b>150</b> and, after being obtained, decrypted by the mobile encryption device <b>154</b> after being obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The mobile encryption device <b>154</b> can be any fixed internet protocol (IP) address based encryption component, such as a hardware and software based inline encryptor suitable to reside on the handheld communication device <b>150</b>. Where the enclave encryption device <b>114</b> is a HAIPE&#xae; device, for example, the mobile encryption device <b>154</b> provides, corresponding HAIPE&#xae; functionality. The mobile encryption device <b>154</b> is, for example, a conventional handset encryptor adapted to perform IPSec encryption and decryption functions.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The handheld communication device <b>150</b> further includes a mobile encapsulator <b>156</b> which encapsulates data packets from the mobile encryption device <b>154</b> before the handheld communication device <b>150</b> sends the data over the wireless carrier network <b>140</b> and decapsulates data packets obtained over the wireless carrier network <b>140</b> before being provided to the mobile encryption device <b>154</b>. This allows for the data to be transferred over the wireless carrier network <b>140</b> with the required capability of dynamic IP addresses while still being processed by the mobile encryption device <b>154</b> utilizing fixed IP addresses as required.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should be understood that the representation of the subcomponents of the handheld communication device <b>150</b> is functional in nature and does not necessarily correspond directly to independent hardware components. The mobile encapsulator <b>156</b>, for example, may be implemented in software stored in a same physical memory and executed by a same processor as other functional elements of the secure handheld domain which are protected by firewalls and/or other well-known means. However, the mobile encapsulator <b>156</b>, which does not handle unencrypted data and is thus does not require the same level of protection as other elements of the secure handheld domain <b>152</b>, is shown separate from the secure handheld domain <b>152</b> to illustrate that its function is performed between that of the mobile encryption device <b>154</b> and communication over the wireless carrier network <b>140</b>.</p>
