The paper cassette generally includes a paper alignment apparatus to align sheets of paper contained in the paper cassette.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The paper alignment apparatus generally includes an alignment apparatus body that is slidable in a paper advancing direction (a lengthwise direction of the paper cassette) and regulates a location of an inner end of paper, thereby aligning sheets of paper, and a locking unit that locks the paper alignment apparatus into a cassette body.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If the locking unit is locked into the cassette body, the paper alignment apparatus is fixed to the cassette body, and, if the locking unit is unlocked from the cassette body, the paper alignment apparatus is placed in a slidable state.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, the locking and the unlocking of the locking unit may be performed by manipulating a lever included in the locking unit. Specifically, if a user pulls the lever, the paper alignment apparatus is locked, and, if the user releases the lever, the paper alignment apparatus is unlocked.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">If such a related-art paper alignment apparatus is applied, an additional space should be guaranteed in the paper cassette for moving and manipulating the lever, which is included in the locking unit of the paper alignment apparatus. This is unfavorable for miniaturization of the paper cassette.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A locking operation of the locking unit <b>200</b> will be explained first.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the state in which the locking unit <b>200</b> is unlocked as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the locking portion <b>274</b> of the locking member <b>270</b> is not inserted into any of the locking recesses <b>22</b><i>a </i>formed on the bottom <b>22</b> of the cassette body <b>20</b>, and accordingly, the paper alignment apparatus <b>100</b> is not restrained by the cassette body <b>20</b> and is free to slide.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In order to fix the paper alignment apparatus <b>100</b> to the cassette body <b>20</b>, the user downwardly presses the button body <b>210</b>A of the button member <b>210</b> in an arrow direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Then, the button member <b>210</b> downwardly moves and downwardly pushes the locking maintaining member <b>250</b>, and simultaneously, the locking maintaining member <b>250</b> downwardly pushes the locking member <b>270</b>. At this time, the locking portion <b>274</b> of the locking member <b>270</b> is locked into any of the locking recesses <b>22</b><i>a </i>formed on the bottom <b>22</b> of the cassette body <b>20</b> so that the paper alignment apparatus <b>100</b> can be fixed to the cassette body <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">More specifically, if the user downwardly presses the button member <b>210</b>, the button member <b>210</b> downwardly moves and simultaneously the rotation prevention ribs <b>212</b> of the button member <b>210</b> move along the guide recesses <b>232</b> of the guide member <b>230</b>. Therefore, the button member <b>210</b> is prevented from being rotated. Also, as the button member <b>210</b> downwardly moves, the locking maintaining member <b>250</b> downwardly moves. At this time, the locking maintaining ribs <b>252</b> of the locking maintaining member <b>250</b> are released from the guide recesses <b>232</b> of the guide member <b>230</b> and are rotated by a predetermined angle due to the action of a downward force exerted by the button member <b>210</b> and an upward force exerted by the elastic member <b>280</b>, so that the locking maintaining ribs <b>252</b> can be engaged with the guide member tooth form <b>234</b> of the guide member <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A process in which the locking maintaining ribs <b>252</b> are released from the guide recesses <b>232</b> of the guide member <b>230</b> and are engaged with the guide member tooth form <b>234</b> will be understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>. If the user presses the button member <b>210</b>, the locking maintaining ribs <b>252</b> of the locking maintaining member <b>250</b> are released from the guide member <b>230</b> and simultaneously the locking maintaining member <b>250</b> is rotated by a predetermined angle (for example, 90&#xb0;) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the locking maintaining ribs <b>252</b> of the locking maintaining member <b>250</b> are engaged with the guide member tooth form <b>234</b> and accordingly the locking state of the locking member <b>270</b> is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, an unlocking operation of the locking unit <b>200</b> will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the state in which the locking unit <b>200</b> is locked as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, if the user downwardly presses the button member <b>210</b> again, the whole locking unit <b>200</b> which is locked further moves downwardly. Then, the locking maintaining ribs <b>252</b> are disengaged from the guide member tooth form <b>234</b> and simultaneously the locking maintaining member <b>250</b> is rotated again by a predetermined angle (for example, 90&#xb0;) so that the locking maintaining ribs <b>252</b> are aligned with the guide recesses <b>232</b> of the guide member <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this state, if the user releases the button member <b>210</b>, the locking member <b>270</b> is upwardly moved by the upward elastic force of the elastic member <b>280</b> so that the locking portion <b>274</b> is released from the selected locking recess <b>22</b><i>a </i>formed on the bottom <b>22</b> of the cassette body <b>20</b> and thus the locking unit <b>200</b> is unlocked, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. At this time, the locking maintaining member <b>250</b> contacting the upper portion of the locking member <b>270</b> is upwardly moved with the locking maintaining ribs <b>252</b> being inserted into the guide recesses <b>232</b> of the guide member <b>230</b>, and the button member <b>210</b> contacting the upper portion of the locking maintaining member <b>250</b> is also upwardly moved.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Hereinafter, a sliding operation of the paper alignment apparatus <b>100</b> will be described. The paper alignment apparatus <b>100</b> is slidable when the locking unit <b>200</b> is unlocked. That is, if the user wishes to align sheets of paper by the sliding movement of the paper alignment apparatus <b>100</b>, the user unlocks the locking unit <b>200</b> first and then places the paper alignment apparatus <b>100</b> at a desirable location by slidably moving the paper alignment apparatus horizontally in the arrow direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Accordingly, if a desirable location of the paper alignment apparatus <b>100</b> is determined, the user presses the button member <b>210</b> of the locking unit <b>200</b> and fixes the paper alignment apparatus <b>100</b> to the cassette body <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the present exemplary embodiment, the sliding movement of the alignment apparatus body <b>110</b> in the paper cassette <b>10</b> may be blocked or allowed by downwardly pressing the locking unit <b>200</b>. Accordingly, since a space of the cassette body <b>20</b> for the locking operation of the user can be minimized, the paper cassette <b>10</b> can be miniaturized.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross sectional view to explain an arrangement relationship between the paper alignment apparatus and an upper frame when the locking unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is unlocked.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the locking unit <b>200</b> is unlocked, an upper portion of the locking unit <b>200</b> protrudes higher than an upper portion of the vertical portion <b>120</b> of the paper alignment apparatus <b>100</b>. The upper portion of the locking unit <b>200</b> protrudes to the extent that the upper portion is caught by an upper frame <b>30</b> formed on an upper portion of the paper cassette <b>10</b> of the image forming apparatus when the paper cassette <b>10</b> is closed. Accordingly, if the paper cassette <b>10</b> is closed when the locking unit <b>200</b> is not locked, the upper portion of the locking unit <b>200</b> is caught by the upper frame <b>30</b> so that the user can easily identify whether the locking is achieved or not. Of course, the user can easily identify whether the locking is achieved or not with user's naked eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Although a few embodiments of the present general inventive concept have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the general inventive concept, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
