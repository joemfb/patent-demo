<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the communication field, and in particular, to a power control method and device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the rapid development of communication technologies, as one of mainstream technologies of the third generation mobile communication system, Wideband Code Division</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Multiple Access (WCDMA) has been widely studied and applied. Current versions of the WCDMA include Release99 (R99), Release4 (R4), Release5 (R5), Release6 (R6) and Release? (R7).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to increase the data transmission rate and satisfy different requirements, High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) technology is introduced into the WCDMA R6, so as to increase the uplink transmission rate. The HSUPA technology is currently carried on a single frequency point, that is, single carrier data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A maximum transmit power of a User Equipment (UE) is specified in relevant protocols of the WCDMA, and the UE needs to keep the actual uplink transmit power equal to or lower than the indicated maximum transmit power.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to control the actual uplink transmit power of the UE, a power control method in the prior art is: calculating a transmit power required by the UE for sending data to be sent on a single carrier; and performing power compression on the carrier if a sum of the calculated transmit power and powers of other uplink channels (that is, the transmit power of the UE) exceeds the maximum transmit power, so as to enable the transmit power of the UE to be lower than or equal to the maximum transmit power.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to further increase the data transmission rate in an HSUPA system, an uplink Dual Cell HSUPA (DC-HSUPA) technology is introduced into WCDMA R9, and two uplink carriers may be used to send data at the same time based on the technology, thereby increasing the transmission rate of uplink data. Definitely, with the development of the technology, more carriers may be introduced into the uplink in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, power control for a plurality of uplink carriers of the UE needs to be configured.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention provide a power control method and device, which can achieve transmit power control of a UE in a multi-carrier mode.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An embodiment of the present invention provides a power control method, including: calculating a transmit power of a UE when the UE sends data through a plurality of carriers; and performing power compression on each carrier either step by step according to property parameters of each carrier or synchronously according to a compression ratio, when the transmit power of the UE exceeds a preset maximum transmit power.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An embodiment of the present invention provides a power control device, where the device includes: a first calculating unit, configured to calculate a transmit power of a UE; and a first checking unit, configured to judge whether the transmit power of the UE calculated by the first calculating unit exceeds a preset maximum transmit power. The power control device further includes: a step-by-step compressing unit, configured to perform power compression on each carrier step by step according to property parameters of each carrier when the transmit power of the UE exceeds the preset maximum transmit power; or a synchronous compressing unit, configured to perform power compression on each carrier synchronously according to a compression ratio when the transmit power of the UE exceeds the preset maximum transmit power.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It can be seen from the above technical solutions that the embodiments of the present invention have the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a technical solution of the embodiments of the present invention, when a UE sends data through a plurality of carriers, if the transmit power of the UE is higher than a preset maximum transmit power, power compression may be performed on each carrier either step by step according to property parameters of each carrier or synchronously according to a compression ratio, thereby achieving the power compression in a multi-carrier situation.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment, the manner of the power compression on each carrier is the same as the manner of the power compression on the first carrier described above, both of which are common sense of persons skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this embodiment, after it is judged that the transmit power of the UE is higher than the preset maximum transmit power, the power compression may be performed on each carrier step by step according to the property parameters of each carrier, that is, the power compression is performed on each carrier one by one according to different property parameters of each carrier. Therefore, according to the solution of this embodiment, the power compression can be performed on each carrier one by one according to the sequence of the property parameters, thereby achieving the power compression in a multi-carrier situation.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment, the E-TFCI may be used as the property parameter, and the power compression may be firstly performed on the carrier on which the data to be sent having the largest E-TFCI locates. Since data having a longer transmission block requires a higher transmit power, the power compression is firstly performed on the carrier on which the data to be sent having the largest E-TFCI locates so that the transmit power after compression easily satisfies the limitation of the maximum transmit power, thereby ensuring the sending performance of data having short transmission blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this embodiment, the E-TFCI may be used as the property parameter, and the power compression may also be firstly performed on the carrier on which the data to be sent having the smallest E-TFCI locates. In this way, it may be ensured that the data to be sent having a longer transmission block obtains a higher transmit power, so that loss of data throughout may be reduced to some extent.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted that if the transmit power still cannot satisfy the limitation of the maximum transmit power after the power compression on the first carrier, the power compression may be performed on a second carrier according to the above sequence. It may be understood that after the power compression on the second carrier, the power compression of the first carrier may be released, that is, the E-DPDCH gain factor of the first carrier may be recovered to a value before the first carrier is compressed, and at this time, the power compression is only performed on the second carrier; and then it is judged whether the transmit power satisfies the limitation of the maximum transmit power; and if the limitation of the maximum transmit power still cannot be satisfied, the power compression may be performed on other carriers according to the manner. Therefore, the use of this solution may reduce the number of carriers that need to be compressed as much as possible, and may reduce the influence of the power compression on data sending as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In order to facilitate understanding, an example is used for description in the following. Assuming that two carriers exist, namely, a first carrier and a second carrier, the E-TFCIs of data to be sent of the two carriers increase in sequence, and in this embodiment, the power compression is performed on each carrier in sequence according to an ascending order of the E-TFCIs of the data to be sent. The maximum transmit power is 30 dBm; the transmit power of the UE is 33 dBm; after the power compression on the first carrier only, the transmit power is 31 dBm; and after the power compression on the second carrier only, the transmit power is 29 dBm. A specific power compression process may be as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The power compression is firstly performed on the first carrier, and the transmit power after compression is 31 dBm which still exceeds the maximum transmit power. In this case, the power compression is performed on the second carrier, and at this time, in order to reduce the number of carriers on which the power compression is performed as much as possible, the power compression of the first carrier may be released. Before performing the power compression on the second carrier, the transmit power of the UE is still 33 dBm, and after the power compression on the second carrier only, the transmit power is 29 dBm, which satisfies the limitation of the maximum transmit power. Therefore, the power compression needs to be performed on the second carrier only.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">It should be noted that, the above example describes a situation that the transmit power can satisfy the limitation of the maximum transmit power after the power compression on the second carrier only; however, in practical applications, if the transmit power still cannot satisfy the limitation of the maximum transmit power after the power compression on the second carrier only, the power compression needs to be performed once again on the first carrier, the power compression of which is already released. For example:</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The maximum transmit power is 30 dBm; the transmit power of the UE is 33 dBm; the transmit power is 32 dBm after the power compression on the first carrier only; and the transmit power is 31 dBm after the power compression on the second carrier only.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The power compression is firstly performed on the first carrier, and the transmit power after compression is 31 dBm which still exceeds the maximum transmit power. In this case, the power compression is performed on the second carrier, and at this time, in order to reduce the number of carriers on which the power compression is performed as much as possible, the power compression of the first carrier may be released. Before performing the power compression on the second carrier, the transmit power of the UE is still 33 dBm, and after the power compression on the second carrier only, the transmit power becomes 31 dBm which still cannot satisfy the limitation of the maximum transmit power. Therefore, the power compression needs to be performed on the first carrier once again, that is, the power compression is performed on both the first carrier and the second carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this embodiment, carriers as few as possible are selected for power compression, so as to ensure that most of the data to be sent on most carriers is not influenced, thereby improving the data sending performance.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this embodiment, if the transmit power still cannot satisfy the limitation of the maximum transmit power after the power compression on each carrier (that is, the transmit power after the compression on all the carriers is still higher than the maximum transmit power), an additional compression process is performed, so as to enable the final transmit power after compression to be lower than or equal to the maximum transmit power. The specific additional compression process may be: directly compressing the transmit powers of each carrier according to a difference between the transmit power and the maximum transmit power, so as to enable the total transmit power after compression to be lower than or equal to the maximum transmit power. In this embodiment, the additional compression may compress all the carriers according to an identical ratio, or compress different carriers by using different ratios, and the specific manner of additional compression is not limited here.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It should be noted that the additional compression is different from the power compression in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Firstly, the power compression is to compress the E-DPDCH gain factors only, while the additional compression is to directly compress the transmit powers.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Secondly, during the additional compress process, the original power ratio between the DPCCH and the DPDCH, the original power ratio between the DPCCH and the HS-DPCCH, the original power ratio between the DPCCH and the E-DPCCH, and the original power ratio between the DPCCH and the E-DPDCH, need to be kept unchanged, that is, the channels are compressed together according to the original gain factors.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be noted that the power ratio between the DPCCH and the E-DPDCH is not the ratio before the power compression is performed, but the permissible minimum value of the E-DPDCH specified in protocols after compression, and the additional compression process needs to keep the power ratio between the DPCCH and the minimum value of the E-DPDCH unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this embodiment, the detailed process of the additional compression is common sense of persons skilled in the art, and is not limited here.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this embodiment, if the transmit power of the UE still cannot satisfy the limitation of the maximum transmit power after the power compression on all the carriers, the additional compression process may be further performed, thereby effectively ensuring that the power control in a multi-carrier situation can be achieved.</p>
