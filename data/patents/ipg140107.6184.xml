<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Embodiments of the present invention provide a method, system and computer program product for exchanging console data in a messaging system. In an embodiment of the invention, a method for exchanging console data in a messaging system includes receiving a message in a messaging client executing in memory by at least one processor of a computer. The method further includes selecting in the message in the messaging client a portion of console data for a version of source code. For instance, the console data can be a selection of source code or an error message for a selection of source code. Finally, in response to the selection of the portion of console data, corresponding meta-data for the message can be extracted and a version of source code for the console data can be determined from the meta-data. Finally, the version of the source code can be loaded in an IDE executing in the memory by the at least one processor of the computer.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to collaborative software development and more particularly to console data exchange between developers in a collaborative software development environment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Software development has evolved from the primitive specification of program code on punch cards to a source code file driven compilation and build workflow. Early, simplistic software development projects involved a single developer coding to a specification on a single development computer using a text editor to access a source code file and separate compile and build programs processing the source code file into an executable binary. As the complexity of the computer program grew in parallel to the growth of computing power, software development evolved into a multi-developer endeavor requiring sophisticated source code management and debugging tools to corral and coordinate the efforts of the developers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Principal to the modern software development workflow is the integrated development environment (IDE). Initially introduced as the primary user interface to a particular coding language such as the venerable PASCAL or ubiquitous C++ and Java programming languages, the IDE has morphed into its own stand-alone computing product and now, is more akin to a document management enterprise system rather than a user interface to a hodge-podge of coding and debugging tools. To with, central to any marketable IDE for collaborative software development is a version control system (VCS).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The modern form of the VCS stems from early &#x201c;diff&#x201d; programs that processed two different text files and produced a log of differences in text between the two different text files. Today, the prototypical VCS tracks differences in source code files as well as other file oriented metrics resulting from the multi-party editing of the same source code file. Further, the modern VCS permits access to any of a family of versions of the same source code file. Such operations include, by way of example, requests to access a version of a source code file that is common to two different users, a merged version of two different versions of a source code file produced by two different users, a latest or newer version of a source code file, an older ancestral version of a source code file that is common to two different users, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Managing different versions of a source code file in an IDS for multiple different developers in of itself is not sufficient to efficiently support multi-developer software development projects over the entirety of the software lifecycle. Rather, part and parcel of an effective multi-party development effort is the sharing of development data&#x2014;especially compiler errors and debug messages produced by the IDE during software development. At present, conventional practice includes the &#x201c;cutting and pasting&#x201d; of console messages produced by the debugger of an IDE into a message to be transmitted to a co-developer. While the rudimentary sharing of the console messages no doubt can be helpful, the sharing of the console messages alone does not permit the joint experience of debugging requisite to effective software development. Rather, the mere sharing of console messages still requires the recipient of the console messages to first load the IDE, then to determine which source code files have been implicated by the console messages, to further determine an appropriate version of those source code files, and finally to load those source code files of the correct versions in the IDE.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention address collaborative software development improvements, and provide a novel and non-obvious method, system and computer program product for exchanging console data in a messaging system. In an embodiment of the invention, a method for exchanging console data in a messaging system includes receiving a message in a messaging client executing in memory by at least one processor of a computer. The method further includes selecting in the message in the messaging client a portion of console data for a version of source code. For instance, the console data can be a selection of source code or an error message for a selection of source code. Finally, in response to the selection of the portion of console data, corresponding meta-data for the message can be extracted and a version of source code for the console data can be determined from the meta-data. Finally, the version of the source code can be loaded in an IDE executing in the memory by the at least one processor of the computer.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the invention provide for exchanging console data in a messaging system. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a portion of console data of an IDE can be selected for copying into a message in a messaging system such as an instant messenger, e-mail client and the like. The selected portion can include source code of a source code file of a specific version as managed by a VCS coupled to the IDE, or an error message produced by the IDE for source code of a source code file of a specific version as managed by the VCS. Responsive to the selection of the portion of data, a line number of corresponding source code can be determined as can the specific version of the source code file. Thereafter, the line number and version can be included as meta-data to the selected portion and both the selected portion and the meta-data can be embedded in a message in the messaging system to a designated recipient, for example by way of a cut-and-paste operation.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The designated recipient, upon receipt of the message, can select the embedded portion. Responsive to the selection of the embedded portion, an IDE of the designated recipient can be loaded if not already present. Further, the meta-data can be retrieved from the message and a version of the source code file and the line number can be extracted there from. A source code file consistent with the version can be loaded into the IDE and the line number of the loaded source code file can be brought into view in the IDE. Alternatively, the designated recipient can be prompted to select a particular version of the source code file for loading and a line in the loaded source code file comparable to the line number of the meta-data can be brought into view in the IDE. In either circumstance, the collaborative effort to develop the source code of the source code file can be facilitated through the coordinated exchange of console data.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In further illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a process for exchanging console data in a messaging system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first user <b>110</b>A can edit source code in a source code file of a particular version as managed by a VCS (not shown) amongst several versions <b>120</b> of the source code file. Data <b>150</b> of the source code, such as a selection of the source code itself, or an error message produced in association with a selection of source code, can be selected for embedding in a message <b>140</b> for transmission from messaging client <b>130</b>A of the first user <b>110</b>A to a second user <b>110</b>B by way of messaging client <b>130</b>B. Of note, the data <b>150</b> can include not only a name of the source code file, but also a line number. In response, the version of the source code file along with the line number corresponding to the data <b>150</b> can be transmitted as meta-data <b>160</b> to the data <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Upon receipt of the message <b>140</b>, the second user <b>110</b>B can select the embedded data <b>150</b>. In response to the selection of the data <b>150</b>, the meta-data <b>160</b> can be inspected to identify a version of the source code file <b>120</b> associated with the data <b>150</b> along with the line number corresponding to the data <b>150</b>. The IDE <b>180</b> for the second user <b>110</b>B can be executed (if not already executing) and the second user <b>110</b>B can be prompted to select the version <b>170</b> of the source code file <b>120</b> to be loaded into the IDE <b>180</b>. Alternatively, the version of the source code file <b>120</b> set forth in the meta-data automatically can be loaded into the IDE <b>180</b>. Regardless, a line of the version <b>170</b> of source code corresponding to that of the meta-data <b>160</b> can be brought into view of the IDE <b>180</b>. Additionally, by visual inspection of the data <b>150</b> including the line number, the second user <b>110</b>B in collaboration with the first user <b>110</b>A can confirm whether or not both users <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B are referencing the same version of the source code file <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The process described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be implemented in a messaging data processing system. In yet further illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically depicts a messaging system configured for console data exchange. The system can include computers <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B communicatively coupled to one another over computer communications network <b>230</b>. Each of the computers <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B can include an operating system <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B hosting the operation of an IDE <b>280</b>A, <b>280</b>B. Each IDE <b>280</b>A, <b>280</b>B can be coupled to a VCS code repository <b>270</b>A, <b>270</b>B in which different versions of source code managed by a corresponding VCS (not shown) reside. Additionally, each of the computers <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B can include a messenger <b>260</b>A, <b>260</b>B configured for exchanging messages with one another over the computer communications network <b>230</b> by way of messaging server <b>220</b> operating in host <b>210</b>. By way of example, the messaging server <b>220</b> can include an e-mail server, an instant messaging server, or a bulletin board system such as a forum.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Of note, console message meta-data module <b>300</b>A, <b>300</b>B can be coupled respectively, both to the IDE <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B and also the messenger <b>260</b>A, <b>260</b>B. The console message meta-data module <b>300</b>A, <b>300</b>B can include program code operative upon execution by at least one processor of a corresponding computer <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B to select console data provided through the IDE <b>250</b>A, such as a selection of a portion of source code of a version of a source code file disposed in the VCS code repository <b>270</b>A to embed the selection in a message <b>290</b>, to identify both a version of the source code file and also a line number corresponding to the selection, to embed the version and line number in meta-data <b>200</b> for the message <b>290</b> and to transmit the message <b>290</b> to computer <b>240</b>B through messenger <b>260</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The program code of the console message meta-data module <b>300</b>A, <b>300</b>B yet further can be operative upon execution to select in the message <b>290</b> once received by the computer <b>240</b>B in the messenger <b>260</b>B the selected console data, to load in the IDE <b>280</b>B a source code file corresponding to the version of source code file referenced in the meta-data <b>200</b> and to bring into view in the IDE <b>280</b>B the line of the source code of the version of the source code file set forth in the meta-data <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In even yet further illustration of the operation of the console message meta-data module <b>300</b>A, <b>300</b>B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a process for exchanging versioned console data in a messaging system. Beginning in block <b>305</b>, console data can be placed in memory, for example source code from a source code file, or one or more error messages produced by an IDE processing the source code file. In block <b>310</b>, a portion of the console data can be selected and in block <b>315</b>, meta-data can be generated for the selected portion, including a reference to the source code file itself, a version of the source code file, a line number of the source code associated with the selected portion, and optionally, a stack trace in the event the console data includes one or more error messages.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In block <b>320</b>, a handle to a messenger client can be obtained so as to gain programmatic access to the messenger and in block <b>325</b>, the selected portion of the console data can be inserted into a message in the messenger, for example by executing a cut and paste operation. Additionally, the generated meta-data can associated with the message. Thereafter, in block <b>330</b> the message can be transmitted to a recipient. In this regard, in block <b>335</b> the message can be received by a messenger of the recipient and in block <b>340</b> the selected portion of the source code in the message can be selected. In block <b>345</b>, the meta-data associated with the message can be retrieved to identify the source code file, the version of the source code file, the line number and optionally, the stack watch.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In block <b>350</b>, a handle to the IDE of the recipient can be obtained. (to the extent the IDE is not loaded and executing, the IDE can be executed first). Subsequently, in block <b>355</b> the recipient can be prompted to select a version of the source code file to be loaded into the IDE based upon the version referenced in the meta-data. For instance, the recipient can be prompted to load a version of the source code file consistent with the version of the meta-data, a newest version of the source code file if no merge conflicts exists with the version of the source code file referenced by the meta-data, an older version of the source code file than that referenced by the meta-data, a newer version of the source code file notwithstanding any merge conflicts with the version of the source code file referenced by the meta-data, or an earliest common ancestor of the source code file before that referenced by the meta-data. In block <b>360</b>, the recipient can select a desired version of the source code file and in block <b>365</b> the selected version can be loaded in IDE. Finally, in block <b>370</b> a line of the version of the source code in the IDE corresponding to the line of the meta-data can be brought into view.</p>
