<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">As networks became widespread, people saw it as a way of distributing data. But while the average bandwidth capacity is increasing, users around the world are trying to share more data. Although the networks are able to support more bandwidth, they cannot keep up with the rapidly increasing requests of the users. Some of the network configurations are not always suitable for disseminating files of considerable size. Often, networks have to be managed in a very automatic, dynamic, and efficient way. For example, enabling distribution of files may require flexible control, distributed processing, bandwidth sensitivity, conditional processing, auditing and security.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An exemplary embodiment provides a system and a process for distributing data to a plurality of work stations via a communication network. For example, the plurality of work stations may be coupled to a data distribution system via the communication network. The data distribution system may distribute data (e.g., application files) to the plurality of work stations via the communication network. In an exemplary embodiment, the data distribution system may distribute data to one work station of the plurality of work stations at a time in order to ensure sufficient bandwidth and processing power for other applications. The data distribution system may maintain a directory of the plurality of work stations. For example, the data distribution system may distribute data to the plurality of work stations sequentially one work station at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The data distribution system may also maintain a data request database for storing data requests transmitted from the plurality of work stations. In an exemplary embodiment, during a data distribution process, a work station may transmit a data request to the data distribution system. The data distribution system may store the data request from the work station in the data request database for later processing. For example, the data distribution system may process the data request stored in the data request database after the completion of the data distribution in progress or when the data distribution system is idle (e.g., not distributing data).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a distribution system according to particular embodiments. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the distribution system <b>100</b> may include a data distribution system <b>102</b> coupled to a plurality of work stations <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>-N) via a communication network <b>104</b>. For example, the data distribution system <b>102</b> may distribute data to the plurality of work station <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>-N) via the communication network <b>104</b> sequentially, one work station <b>106</b> at a time. In an exemplary embodiment, the data distribution system <b>102</b> may receive new or updated data from a user (e.g., administrator) associated with the data distribution system <b>102</b> or other systems coupled to the data distribution system <b>102</b>. The data distribution system <b>102</b> may store and copy the new or updated data to be transmitted to the plurality of work stations <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>-N).

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The input/output (I/O) module <b>208</b> may include routers, repeater, antennas, or other transceiver device for transmitting data to and receiving data from the plurality of work stations <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>-N). For example, the input/output (I/O) module <b>208</b> may receive data from the processing module <b>210</b> or the database module <b>212</b> to be distributed to one of the plurality of work station <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>-N) during a data distribution session. For example, the database module <b>212</b> may receive new or updated data and stored. The processing module <b>210</b> may make copies of the new or updated data and provide copies of the new or updated data to the input/output module <b>208</b>. The input/output (I/O) module <b>208</b> may transmit copies of the new or updated data to one of a plurality of work stations <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>-N) at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The input/output (I/O) module <b>208</b> may receive one or more data distribution requests from at least one of a plurality of work stations <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>-N). For example, the one or more data distribution request may be transmitted via signaling system number #7 (SS7) protocol or session initiation protocol (SIP) in order to establish a data distribution session over the communication network <b>104</b>. The data distribution request may include information associated with the work station <b>106</b> that requests the data distribution session with the data distribution system <b>102</b>. For example, the data distribution request may include address information associated with the work station <b>106</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the address information associated with the work station <b>106</b> may include uniform resource identifiers (URI), uniform resource locators (URL), or other identification information to identify the requesting work station <b>106</b>.
