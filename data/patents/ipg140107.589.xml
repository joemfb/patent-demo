<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A golf shoe having an upper, a midsole, and an outsole is provided. A collapsible support element is positioned in a recess proximate to a wearer's first metatarsal bone. The collapsible support element has anisotropic mechanical properties and includes a series of longitudinal wave elements. The wave elements are stiffer in a longitudinal direction and more collapsible in a transverse direction. The wave elements resist collapsing when a golfer walks but have a propensity to collapse during the golfer's swing, which allows more efficient transfer of energy during the swing. The shoe further includes flexing channels in a forward portion as well as a flexing channel in the rear portion.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/935,454 filed on Nov. 6, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,895,773, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to shoes. More particularly, the present invention relates to golf shoes including collapsible support elements with anisotropic mechanical properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Historically, people first wore shoes to protect their feet. Over the centuries, footwear evolved into many different types that were specific to particular activities. Thus, the protection offered by a cold-weather work boot is highly different from that offered by a running shoe. In addition to protecting the feet, athletic footwear has further developed to offer specific functions dependent on the particular sport. Soccer shoes, for instance, have spikes for traction, whereas cycling shoes have very stiff soles with mounting plates for cleats to engage the pedal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The game of golf includes long stretches of walking and short moments of swinging a golf club to hit a golf ball. Consequently, golf shoes have evolved to provide the wearer with good traction on grass, comfort while walking, and a stable platform for hitting the ball. Typical golf shoes thus have a relatively stiff sole with metal spikes or plastic cleats. Some golf shoes also include gels that cushion the impact of so-called &#x201c;ground reaction forces&#x201d; on the foot. From Newton's Third Law of Motion, the law of action-reaction, it is known that the ground pushes on the foot in a direction equal and opposite to the direction the foot pushes on the ground; these are known as ground reaction forces.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Gels have been incorporated into the sole of athletic shoes. Conventional gels are generally pre-set to fit the contours of a foot or they are soft liquid gels that must be placed in a bladder. Some examples include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,155,927 and 5,493,792 to Bates, which disclose athletic shoes constructed to minimize impact shock and maximize lateral stability by use of a cushioning element comprising a chamber having flexible walls filled with a liquid composition which is preferably a gel and the chamber has a plurality of partitions for directing the flow of liquid from one portion of the chamber to another.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there remains a need in the art for golf shoes having collapsible support elements that minimize the impact of ground reaction forces when walking, and that allow more efficient transfer of energy during a golf swing.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A golf shoe comprising an upper, a midsole, an outsole, and a collapsible support element positioned in a recess proximate to a wearer's first metatarsal bone. The collapsible support element is stiffer in a longitudinal direction and is more collapsible in a transverse direction, and is designed to collapse in the transverse direction during a golf swing to allow more efficient transfer of energy.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the collapsible support element comprises a tapered gel pad comprising a thick outer end, a thin inner end, and a top surface comprising a plurality of support posts wherein the thick outer end is more collapsible than the thin inner end.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the collapsible support element comprises a single element having a wave configuration in the longitudinal direction and a variable thickness profile in the transverse direction. The thickness profile decreases in thickness from an inner thickness to an outer thickness. Also, the thickness profile can be a smooth curvature, a stepped curvature, or a combination thereof. The single element can be encased in a gel pad.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the collapsible support element comprises a series of longitudinal wave elements extending along the transverse direction, wherein the longitudinal wave elements change in frequency and orientation along the transverse direction. The inner longitudinal wave elements would have a higher wave frequency than outer longitudinal wave elements. Furthermore, the inner longitudinal wave elements can be more upright than outer longitudinal wave elements. Additionally, the inner longitudinal wave elements can have a thicker profile than the outer longitudinal wave elements.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For all embodiments, an optional second support element can be positioned in a recess beneath the midsole proximate to a wearer's calcaneus. The second support element can also be stiffer in a longitudinal direction and is more collapsible in a transverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The golf shoe may further comprise at least one flexing channel in a forward portion of a sole of the shoe and at least one flexing channel in a rear portion of the sole of the shoe. The golf shoe may also be used with replacement cleats that can have the same dimensions as the original cleats or can be a lower height than the original cleats to account for the wear and tear of the shoe.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, shoe <b>10</b> includes an upper <b>12</b>, a midsole <b>14</b> joined to the upper <b>12</b>, and an outsole <b>16</b> joined to the midsole <b>14</b>. In an advantageous aspect of the present invention, outsole <b>16</b> includes at least one toe collapsible support element <b>24</b> encased in a recess of the outsole <b>16</b> and that attenuates ground reaction forces experienced by the forefoot during a golf swing. More specifically, the collapsible support element <b>24</b> can be a collapsible gel pad <b>18</b> encased in a thermoplastic urethane (shown in FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B), or a single collapsible supporting element <b>19</b> with anisotropic mechanical properties (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>), or a series of collapsible supporting elements <b>20</b> with anisotropic mechanical properties (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Each embodiment, of the collapsible support element <b>24</b>, resists collapsing when a golfer walks, however each has a propensity to collapse in the transverse direction when the golfer swings therein allowing a more efficient transfer of energy during the golf swing. Such collapsible support elements <b>24</b> are strategically located on the medial side <b>21</b> of forward portion <b>22</b> in order to assist in weight transfer during the golf swing. Optionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, heel support element(s) <b>25</b> can be located on rear portion <b>28</b> in order to absorb shock during walking. Heel support element <b>25</b> can also be gel pad <b>18</b>, single collapsible support <b>19</b> or multiple collapsible supports <b>20</b>. Toe support element <b>24</b> and heel support element <b>25</b> can be made from the same or different materials. In another advantageous aspect of the present invention, golf shoe <b>10</b> comprises flexing channels <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>in forward portion <b>22</b> as well as a flexing channel <b>32</b> in rear portion <b>28</b>. Golf shoe <b>10</b> also has projections <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, commonly referred to as &#x201c;spikes&#x201d; and &#x201c;cleats,&#x201d; which protrude from the bottom surface of outsole <b>16</b> and can have variable heights.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">All components shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> are for a left shoe, the components for a right shoe being mirror images thereof. As used herein, &#x201c;medial side&#x201d; <b>21</b> refers to the inside peripheral edge of the shoe and &#x201c;lateral side&#x201d; <b>26</b> refers to the outside peripheral area of the shoe. As used herein, &#x201c;forward portion&#x201d; <b>22</b> refers to that end of the shoe near the toes (approximately located between lines AA and DD shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and &#x201c;rear portion&#x201d; <b>28</b> refers to that end of the shoe near the heel (approximately located between lines DD and FF shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, upper <b>12</b> has a generally conventional shape and is formed from a suitable upper material, such as leather, synthetic materials, or combinations of these. An opening <b>13</b> is formed by the top portion of the upper <b>12</b> for receiving a user's foot. Upper <b>12</b> is preferably secured to midsole <b>14</b> by stitching or with cement or other adhesives using an insole board and conventional techniques, as known by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The midsole <b>14</b> provides cushioning to the wearer, and is formed of a material such as an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA). Preferably, the midsole <b>14</b> is formed on and about the outsole <b>16</b>. Alternatively, the midsole can be formed separately from the outsole and joined thereto, such as by adhesive. Once the midsole and outsole are joined, they form a substantial portion of the bottom of shoe <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When golfers swing, their feet typically move along a transverse axis T, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, extending between medial side <b>21</b> and lateral side <b>26</b>, and more specifically along the metatarsal bones on each foot. When golfers walk, their feet typically move along the longitudinal axis L, extending between the heel and the toe. As the feet move along either transverse axis T or longitudinal axis L, they experience ground reaction forces that cause strain on muscles and bones. The collapsible support toe element <b>24</b> of the present invention attenuates the impact of such ground reaction forces and allows more efficient transfer of energy during a golf swing. Optional heel support element <b>25</b> provides additional cushioning support to the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">During a golf swing, toe support element <b>24</b> is strategically located on medial side <b>21</b> of forward portion <b>22</b>, under the first metatarsal bone and proximate to the hallux or big toe, in order to assist in weight transfer. Toe support element <b>24</b> can comprise a collapsible gel pad <b>18</b> encased in a shell, or a single collapsing element <b>19</b> with anisotropic mechanical properties, or a plurality of collapsing elements <b>20</b> with anisotropic mechanical properties, as discussed above. These support elements, located on the medial side <b>21</b> of the left and right shoes, collapse during a golf swing to allow more efficient transfer of energy during a golf swing. Structurally, toe support elements <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b> are all configured and dimensioned to fit within a recess underneath midsole <b>14</b>. The recess extends from medial side <b>21</b> to a distance about half-way across midsole <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, collapsible gel pad <b>18</b> has a generally tapered profile. Outer edge <b>180</b> is exposed at medial side <b>21</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and is the thickest portion of gel pad <b>18</b>. Opposite to outer edge <b>180</b> is thin edge <b>182</b>. Top surface <b>184</b> is disposed between edges <b>180</b> and <b>182</b>. Gel pad <b>18</b> comprises shell <b>186</b>, which encases a soft gel <b>188</b>. Since outer edge <b>180</b> is significantly thicker than thin edge <b>182</b>, there is more gel near the outer edge of gel pad <b>18</b>, so that the outer portion of gel pad <b>18</b> has a higher tendency to collapse than the inner section proximate to thin edge <b>182</b>. Additionally, a plurality of support posts <b>189</b> are disposed between soft outer edge <b>180</b> and rigid inner edge <b>182</b>. Support posts <b>189</b> minimize the tendency of the middle section of gel pad <b>18</b> under top surface <b>184</b> to collapse. Support posts <b>189</b> can be hollow and can be molded into shell <b>186</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The relatively rigid thin edge <b>182</b> and support posts <b>189</b> singly or in combination provide support for the golfer when walking along longitudinal axis L. While swinging the club along the transverse axis T, thin edge <b>182</b> singly or in combination with support posts <b>189</b> resist collapsing; however, unsupported thick outer edge <b>180</b> advantageously collapses to support the swing and to allow more efficient transfer of energy during a golf swing. Hence, gel pad <b>18</b> has anisotropic properties, i.e., resisting collapse in the longitudinal direction and tending to collapse in the transverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">By way of example, one suitable gel for gel pad <b>18</b> comprises polydimethyl-siloxane and a suitable crosslinking agent. A benefit of using such a silicone gel is that it does not leach out oil over time like rubbers/oil mixtures. Therefore, it is suitable for use next to materials such as leather. The gel has a durometer value between about 5 to 70 Shore A, a penetration value of about 300 units or above, and a viscosity value of about 1500 cps to about 2500 cps. The gel is poured into the thermoplastic urethane shell <b>186</b> to form the gel pad <b>18</b>. A fill port <b>187</b> is provided for the injection of silicone gel after shell <b>186</b> is molded.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>, in another embodiment of the present invention, the support element comprises a single collapsible support element <b>19</b> with anisotropic mechanical properties. More specifically, in this embodiment, element <b>19</b> is preferably made from a longitudinal wave configuration with the wave propagating along the longitudinal L axis. Single collapsible support element <b>19</b> also has a variable thickness in transverse direction T wherein inner thickness <b>194</b> is thicker than outer thickness <b>196</b>. The thickness profile of single element <b>19</b> can be any smooth curvature, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, stepped curvature, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, or any combination of both, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. The present invention is not limited to any thickness profile. When inserted into shoe <b>10</b>, inner thickness <b>194</b> is positioned inside midsole <b>14</b> and outer thickness <b>196</b> is positioned proximate to medial edge <b>21</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the golfer walks along longitudinal axis L, the thicker portion <b>194</b> of single collapsible support element <b>19</b> supports the shoes thereby minimizing the tendency to collapse. When the golfer swings the club and rolls his or her feet along the transverse direction T, the thinner portion <b>196</b> collapses to allow more efficient transfer of energy during a golf swing.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Single collapsible support element <b>19</b> can be also encased in a collapsible gel pad <b>19</b>, discussed above. Single element <b>19</b> can be made from a thermoplastic or thermoset polymer preferably thermoplastic elastomer or thermoplastic polyurethane.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in yet another embodiment of the present invention, the inventive collapsible support element <b>24</b> can comprise a series of collapsible support elements <b>20</b> with anisotropic mechanical properties. Elements <b>20</b> may comprise a series of waves <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c</i>, where the wave frequency and orientation of waves <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>gradually change as they extend from the inside of the shoe toward the outside of the shoe along the transverse T axis. More specifically, inner wave <b>20</b><i>a </i>has a relatively high wave frequency and is relatively upright. The next outer wave <b>20</b><i>b </i>decreases in wave frequency and is more slanted than wave <b>20</b><i>a</i>. The next outer wave <b>20</b><i>c </i>preferably has an even lower frequency and is even more slanted than waves <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>. The relative frequency of waves <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and their orientation are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Although only three waves <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c </i>are illustrated, any number of waves can be utilized. Waves with higher frequency and more upright profile are stiffer than waves with lower frequency and more slanted profile, which have a higher tendency to collapse. Hence, while walking the golfer is supported by stiffer waves, such as waves <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>, since these waves are aligned generally in the longitudinal direction L. When the golfer swings the club and rolls his or her feet along transverse direction T, less stiff waves, such as waves <b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>collapse or buckle to allow more efficient transfer of energy during a golf swing. Alternatively or additionally, waves <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c </i>can have varying thickness with the inner waves having a thicker profile than the outer waves.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Optionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>, a second or heel support element <b>25</b> can be located on lateral side <b>26</b> of rear portion <b>28</b> in order to absorb shock during walking. The heel support element <b>25</b> is configured and dimensioned to fit within a cavity underneath midsole <b>14</b> proximate to the calcaneus or heel bone. Heel support element <b>25</b> can extend from one edge to a distance that is about half-way across the midsole <b>14</b>, or can extend all the way across the heel. Heel support element <b>25</b> can be a gel pad <b>18</b>, a single anisotropic element <b>19</b>, or a plurality of anisotropic elements <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to support elements <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b>, forward portion <b>22</b> also has a series of flexing channels <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>(best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that run transversely and longitudinally through it. More specifically, flexing channel <b>30</b><i>a </i>is preferably located such that it will be generally beneath the phalanges area, while the second flexing channel <b>30</b><i>b </i>is preferably located such that it will be substantially below the user's first metatarsal bones. The middle of the second flexing channel <b>30</b><i>b </i>is preferably located directly under the metatarsal heads. This optimally allows for variability of the location of metatarsal heads by being wider than the flexion axis of the metatarsal heads. Flexing channel <b>30</b><i>c </i>runs longitudinally down forward portion <b>22</b>. In an advantageous aspect of the present invention, rear portion <b>28</b> also has a flexing channel <b>32</b> that runs longitudinally down rear portion <b>28</b>. Thus, flexing channels <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>32</b> are designed and positioned to define predetermined bending regions for more comfortable walking.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The flexing channels <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>32</b> may be formed of a thermoplastic urethane that is substantially soft for additional flexibility of the forward portion <b>22</b> and rear portion <b>28</b>. Preferably, the flexing channels <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>32</b> have a hardness of less than about 85 Shore A and more preferably about 70 Shore A. One recommended material is currently manufactured by TAIWAN URE-TECH CO., LTD. under the name U-70AP and has a Shore A of about 70. The outsole <b>16</b> of the present invention may be formed by various conventional methods. For example, one recommended method is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,979,083 issued to Robinson et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. According to this method, first and second layers are molded together.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, materials for the first layer and second layer have a hardness of at least about 70 Shore A. More preferably, the material hardness is at least about 80 Shore A, and most preferably of about 95 Shore A&#xb1;3 Shore A. Suitable materials for the first and second layers include without limitation thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers such as thermoplastic urethanes. A specific material of preference is a thermoplastic urethane, U-95A, manufactured by TAIWAN URE-TECH CO., LTD. Other applicable thermoplastic urethanes include Desmopan&#xae; from Bayer and Pebax&#xae; from Atofina.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <b>5</b>, outsole <b>16</b> includes a series of projections <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, commonly referred to as &#x201c;spikes&#x201d; and &#x201c;cleats,&#x201d; which protrude from the bottom surface of outsole <b>16</b> in order to provide traction with the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Cleats <b>34</b> are replaceable when worn and are releasably retained in cleat receptacles (not shown) which are retained in sockets (not shown). While only five replaceable cleats <b>34</b> are shown, any number of cleats <b>34</b> can be used, e.g. up to 7-9 cleats <b>34</b> can be arranged on outsole <b>16</b>. The recommended cleats <b>34</b> are commercially available from the manufacturer SOFTSPIKES&#xae;. These cleats <b>34</b> are formed of a polyurethane that is softer than the material of spikes <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, which are permanent. Spikes <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are substantially stiffer than cleats <b>34</b> to minimize wear and tear, since spikes <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are not replaceable.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The height of spikes and cleats <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is determined so that the proper amount of traction is provided. In one embodiment, the height of the softer cleat <b>34</b> is greater when not worn than the height of stiff spikes <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> since cleats <b>34</b> bend when a golfer stands in shoes <b>10</b>. Preferably, after a normal load is placed on shoes <b>10</b>, cleats <b>34</b> are bent to substantially the same height as spikes <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> to provide a flat walking surface.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Spikes <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are worn after normal wear; however, unlike cleats <b>34</b> spikes <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> cannot be replaced. Thus, in accordance to one aspect of the present invention, when replacing cleats <b>34</b>, the golfer can strategically choose the height of replacement cleats <b>34</b> to match the height of worn spikes <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. By way of example, if cleats <b>34</b> are replaced after a relatively short amount of time (e.g., two months), then replacement cleats <b>34</b> would preferably have the same height as original cleats <b>34</b> because it is unlikely that spikes <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> have diminished significantly in height. By contrast, if cleats <b>34</b> are replaced after a relatively long amount of time (e.g., one year), then replacement cleats <b>34</b> would preferably have a shorter height than original cleats <b>34</b> because it is likely that projections <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> have diminished in height. Hence, it is advantageous to golf shoe manufacturers to provide golfers with replaceable cleats <b>34</b> of varying heights and instructions guiding the golfer's selection.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A logo assembly <b>60</b> is positioned along a portion of outsole <b>16</b> and may include a transparent layer material to protect the logo when the outsole contacts the ground and permit visibility of the logo. One preferred material for the logo assembly <b>60</b> is an ester-based thermoplastic polyurethane manufactured by TAIWAN URE-TECH CO., LTD. under the name UTY-90A, having a Shore A of about 90.</p>
