<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 2007-119416, filed on Nov. 21, 2007 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Apparatuses and methods consistent with aspects of the present invention relate to an image forming apparatus and a print data processing method thereof, and more particularly, to an image forming apparatus that improves a print speed, and a print data processing method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An image forming apparatus (such as a printer) interprets input data transmitted from an image processing apparatus (such as a computer system or an external storage apparatus) according to a print language, renders the interpreted data and processes print data to print the processed data. More specifically, the image forming apparatus extracts information (such as colors and patterns) from the input data, interprets the extracted information, converts colors and generates patterns to generate final print data. The color conversion may include color correction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The image forming apparatus requires much time in interpreting the color and pattern information from the input data to generate the print data. Because the color-converting time and pattern-generating time account for much of the overall print time, the print speed decreases sharply if the input data have a large quantity of color and pattern information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The image forming apparatus consistently maintains result values to convert colors and to generate patterns. For example, the image forming apparatus corrects colors of original RGB data among the input data to generate new RGB data, and converts the new RGB data into CMYK data during a color-converting process. If coordinate values of the original RGB data are equivalent, those of the converted CMYK are equivalent also.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">That is, while processing print data to interpret a print language, the image forming apparatus repeats operations generating the same result values whenever receiving a print command, which lowers efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is provided an image forming apparatus that stores an anticipated result value of a processing having equivalent result values and processes print data by using the stored anticipated result value to improve a print speed if a print command is received, and a print data processing method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, there is provided an image forming apparatus that performs in advance a processing having equivalent result values, avoids repetitive operations by using the result value and improves operation efficiency, and a print data processing method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional aspects of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Hereinafter, a print data processing process of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> having the foregoing configuration will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may set at least one print speed enhancing mode according to a user's command (S<b>110</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the display unit <b>112</b> displays a selection on the UI unit <b>110</b> to set the print speed enhancing mode and a user selects through the input unit <b>111</b> whether to turn the print speed enhancing mode on or off.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in operation S<b>110</b>, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may display at least one of the necessary capacity of the storage unit <b>120</b> to set the print speed enhancing mode and the currently-available capacity of the storage unit <b>120</b> (S<b>111</b>). The display unit <b>112</b> may display the plurality of selection items of the print speed enhancing mode (S<b>112</b>). More specifically, the display unit <b>112</b> may display the necessary capacities (X<b>1</b> to X<b>4</b>) of the storage unit <b>120</b>, i.e., the memory capacity needed to carry out preprocessing, and currently-available capacities (Y<b>1</b> to Y<b>4</b>) of the storage unit <b>120</b> with respect to each of the plurality of selection items as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">More specifically, 8 bit data that has source information and pattern information about the color correction and color conversion includes values from zero to 255. That is, the number of possible values for the overall data is 256.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a capacity X<b>1</b> of the storage unit <b>120</b> corresponding to 256*the pattern size is necessary to set the mono font print speed enhancing mode. As anticipated result values of CMYK four colors are stored corresponding to the 256*pattern size, a capacity X<b>2</b> of the storage unit <b>120</b> corresponding to 256*pattern size*4 is necessary to set a color font print speed enhancing mode.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If the input data has coordinate values corresponding to RGB colors, a capacity X<b>3</b> of the storage unit <b>120</b> corresponding to 256*256*256*4 is necessary to store the anticipated result values of RGB colors converted into the CMYK colors and to set a color image print speed enhancing mode.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A capacity of X<b>2</b>+X<b>3</b>=X<b>4</b> of the storage unit <b>120</b> is necessary to store all anticipated result values and to set color all data including a color font/color image in the print speed enhancing mode.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A user may determine the necessary capacities X<b>1</b> to X<b>4</b> of the storage unit <b>120</b> to set the plurality of selection items in the print speed enhancing mode and the currently-available capacities Y<b>1</b> to Y<b>4</b> of the storage unit <b>120</b> through the display unit <b>112</b> and set the print speed enhancing mode.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The input unit <b>111</b> may edit the plurality of selection items of the print speed enhancing mode displayed at operation S<b>112</b> (S<b>113</b>). More specifically, the display unit <b>112</b> displays the currently-set print speed enhancing modes, and edits the print speed enhancing mode by changing or adding selection items to the plurality of print speed enhancing modes according to user's input through the input unit <b>111</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The storage unit <b>120</b> stores therein the result data from the pre-processing performed at operation S<b>120</b> (S<b>130</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The data stored in the storage unit <b>120</b> includes the anticipated result values about the color conversion and pattern generation which are consistently maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may correct colors of original RGB data among the input data to generate new RGB data and convert the new RGB data into CMYK data. If the coordinate values of the original RGB data are equivalent, the coordinate values of the converted CMYK data are also equivalent.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">More specifically, in case of 8 bit data, if a user selects the mono font print speed enhancing mode, the storage unit <b>120</b> stores therein the anticipated result values for the 256 patterns. If a user selects the color font print speed enhancing mode, the storage unit <b>120</b> stores therein anticipated result values for four colors with respect to the 256 patterns. If a user selects the color image print speed enhancing mode, the storage unit <b>120</b> stores therein the color conversion (CC) result value information of CMYK output values with respect to inputtable RGB data as an LUT (lookup table). If a user selects color all data, including the color font/color image, in the print speed enhancing mode, the storage unit <b>120</b> stores therein anticipated result values of four colors with respect to the 256 patterns and the LUT storing the CC result value information of CMYK output values with respect to inputtable RGB data. That is, the LUT according to aspects of the present invention includes output values of the input data.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The processing unit <b>140</b> processes the print data by using the anticipated result values stored in the storage unit <b>120</b> at operation S<b>130</b> (S<b>140</b>). More specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if the input data is transmitted from the image processing apparatus while the print speed enhancing mode is set, the processing unit <b>140</b> extracts the color information, pattern information and destination information from the received input data and outputs anticipated result values stored in the storage unit <b>120</b> corresponding to the extracted information. The processing unit <b>140</b> renders the outputted result values corresponding to the source, pattern and destination information to form a bitmap image.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">If the color conversion is to performed, an operation of calculating result values is unnecessary, since the processing unit <b>140</b> uses the CMYK result values stored in the LUT with respect to the inputted RGB data. That is, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> processes the print data by using the information generated by the pre-processing without generating additional print information and thereby saves printing time.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The image forming unit <b>140</b> prints the print data processed at operation S<b>140</b> (S<b>150</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an image forming apparatus <b>100</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention may determine an available capacity of a storage unit <b>120</b> during a manufacturing process regardless of user's selection (S<b>210</b>). The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may perform a pre-processing corresponding to the available capacity of the storage unit <b>120</b> determined at operation S<b>210</b> (S<b>220</b>). A processing unit <b>140</b> may automatically perform the pre-processing if the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> stores results of the pre-processing performed at operation S<b>220</b> in the storage unit <b>120</b> (S<b>230</b>).</p>
