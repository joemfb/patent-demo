<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure generally relates to a noise attenuating exhaust nozzle for a gas turbine engine. More particularly, this disclosure relates to a cooled noise attenuating structure of an exhaust nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aircraft may include an auxiliary power unit (APU) for powering various aircraft systems separate from the main propulsion engines. An APU is typically a gas turbine engine mounted within the aircraft structure. An exhaust silencer may be utilized to reduce noise generated by the APU and emitted through an exhaust duct. The exhaust duct and exhaust silencer operate at high temperatures and are therefore surrounded by insulating materials to protect surrounding components and structure. The insulating materials in turn occupy valuable space, add weight to the aircraft, and increase manufacturing costs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A disclosed example auxiliary power unit (APU) noise reduction system includes cooling features to protect the outer skin and other components from heat generated by gases passing through an exhaust duct.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The example APU noise reduction system includes an exhaust silencer disposed around an exhaust duct. Sound energy within the exhaust duct is communicated to the exhaust silencer where the sound energy is negated. A cooling air passage in thermal contact with the exhaust silencer carries heat away from other nearby components and the aircraft skin. In one example, air flow is created by a fan driving air through the air passages. In another example, an eductor creates a pressure differential that draws air through the passages and into the exhaust duct.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an auxiliary power unit (APU) noise reduction system is schematically indicated at <b>15</b> for reducing exhaust noise generated by an APU <b>10</b> and is disposed within an aircraft tail cone <b>12</b>. The example aircraft tail cone <b>12</b> is defined by an outer skin <b>14</b>. The example outer skin <b>14</b> is a sheet material that defines a portion of the outer surface of the example aircraft. The example outer skin <b>14</b> may be a sheet composite material, or a light weight metal such as aluminum, that is not intended for exposure to the high temperatures associated with exhaust gases generated by the APU <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the example APU <b>10</b> includes convection cooling features to protect the outer skin <b>14</b> and other proximate aircraft components from heat generated by gases passing through an exhaust duct <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The example APU <b>10</b> includes a gas turbine engine <b>16</b> and may be of any known configuration, where the exhaust duct <b>20</b> is configured to receive exhaust gases from the gas turbine engine <b>16</b>. Additionally, although the example APU <b>10</b> is illustrated and explained with regard to a location in an aircraft tail cone <b>12</b>, the disclosed cooling features are applicable to other locations within an aircraft structure.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The example tail cone <b>12</b> is disposed at a rear portion of an aircraft and defines a compartment for the APU <b>10</b>. The example compartment is defined on one end by a fire wall <b>18</b> and on an aft most point by an end plane <b>30</b>. The end plane <b>30</b> includes an opening <b>31</b> at an aft open end of the exhaust duct <b>20</b>. Operation of the APU <b>10</b> produces high temperature exhaust gases <b>48</b> and noise that are directed through the exhaust duct <b>20</b>. An exhaust silencer <b>24</b>, also referred to generally as noise attenuator <b>24</b>, is provided about the exhaust duct <b>20</b> to reduce the amount of noise that emanates from the exhaust opening <b>31</b>. The example silencer <b>24</b> is annular and surrounds the exhaust duct <b>20</b>. The silencer <b>24</b> fills an annular space between the exhaust duct <b>20</b> and the outer skin <b>14</b> except for space for passage <b>28</b>. Moreover, the silencer <b>24</b> can also be of a cylindrical shape that surrounds the exhaust duct <b>20</b>. The primary noise source of the APU <b>10</b> is the gas turbine engine <b>16</b>. Therefore, the APU noise reduction system <b>15</b> is also generally referred to as exhaust silencer cooling system <b>15</b> for the gas turbine engine <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the example exhaust duct <b>20</b> includes an inner surface <b>22</b>. The inner surface <b>22</b> includes a porous inner surface that is provided by a plurality of openings <b>23</b> forming a perforated inner surface that communicates noise and other sound energy to the silencer <b>24</b>. The inner surface <b>22</b> may also include other porous structures that provide for the communication of sound energy into the exhaust silencer <b>24</b>. The example silencer <b>24</b> includes a plurality of baffles <b>26</b> that are each in communication with the exhaust duct <b>20</b> through at least some of the plurality of openings <b>23</b>. The baffles <b>26</b> operate to absorb sound energy and dissipate that energy as heat. The baffles <b>26</b> may also be configured as a resonance chamber to negate noise at specific frequencies. The heat generated in the silencer <b>24</b> by the sound absorption and through thermal contact with the exhaust duct <b>20</b> is managed to prevent detrimental effects to the skin <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In conventional tail cone assemblies <b>12</b>, an outer surface <b>25</b> of the exhaust silencer <b>24</b> may be surrounded with a thermally insulating material that can reduce the amount of space for the silencer <b>24</b> and add weight. The disclosed outer surface <b>25</b> of the example exhaust silencer <b>24</b> is surrounded by passage <b>28</b> that defines a path for cooling air. The example passage <b>28</b> is annular and substantially surrounds the outer surface <b>25</b> of the exhaust silencer <b>24</b>. The passage <b>28</b> is disposed between the outer surface <b>25</b> of the exhaust silencer <b>24</b> and the skin <b>14</b>. Cooling air flow through the passages <b>28</b> absorbs heat generated in the exhaust silencer <b>24</b> and exhaust duct <b>20</b> to control the amount of thermal energy communicated to the skin <b>14</b>. The heat absorbed by cooling air flow through the passages <b>28</b> is exhausted way from the skin <b>14</b> and other aircraft components.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The examples passage <b>28</b> is disposed in thermal contact with the exhaust silencer <b>24</b>. More specifically the exhaust passage <b>28</b> is in thermal contact with the outer surface <b>25</b> of the baffles <b>26</b> of the exhaust silencer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The example passage <b>28</b> is in communication with an ambient environment through opening <b>34</b>. The opening <b>34</b> is disposed within the end plane <b>30</b> and is substantially annular. Air from outside the aircraft is drawn into the passages through the opening <b>34</b> and passes through the passage <b>28</b> toward an annular passage <b>32</b>. The annular passage <b>32</b> is disposed at a forward most end of the exhaust duct <b>20</b> and is in communication with the exhaust duct <b>20</b> through an outlet <b>35</b>. The example outlet <b>35</b> is annular and disposed adjacent a cooling air eductor <b>44</b>. The cooling air eductor <b>44</b> generates a pressure differential that drives airflow through the passages <b>28</b> and the outlet <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The example APU <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes an air inlet <b>38</b> through which air <b>40</b> is drawn for operation of the gas turbine engine <b>16</b>. Air drawn in through the inlet <b>38</b> is also utilized by an oil cooler eductor <b>42</b>. The oil cooler eductor <b>42</b> generates airflow utilized by an oil cooling system of the gas turbine engine <b>16</b>. Air indicated at <b>46</b> is drawn into the oil cooler eductor <b>42</b> to cool oil and then is exhausted with exhaust gases <b>48</b> generated by the gas turbine engine <b>16</b>. Other oil cooling devices and systems could also be utilized within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An air flow generator produces the desired air flow into and through the passage <b>28</b>. In this example, the air flow generator is a cooling air eductor <b>44</b> that generates a pressure differential by increasing airflow past the outlet <b>35</b>. The increased airflow past the outlet <b>35</b> generates a low pressure area that draws air through the passages <b>28</b>. The generated airflow further provides for the suction of air through the opening <b>34</b> at the end plane <b>30</b>. Air drawn from the outside environment is significantly cooler relative to the hot exhaust gases <b>48</b> directed through the exhaust duct <b>20</b>. The cooling air flow indicated at <b>36</b> is drawn through the passages <b>28</b> in thermal contact with the exhaust silencer <b>24</b> and absorbs heat from the exhaust silencer <b>24</b>. The cooling air flow <b>36</b> draws heat away from the exhaust silencer <b>24</b> and flows toward the outlet <b>35</b> and the cooling air eductor <b>44</b>. The now heated cooling air <b>36</b> is then passed into the exhaust duct <b>20</b> through the outlet <b>35</b> and is exhausted out through the exhaust opening <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The example cooling air eductor <b>44</b> includes an annular shape that cooperates with the outlet <b>35</b> within the exhaust duct <b>20</b>. The high velocity APU exhaust gas <b>48</b> causes a low pressure region at the outlet <b>35</b> to entrain by motive flow cooling air <b>36</b> through opening <b>34</b>. The increased flow of the cooling air <b>36</b> creates the desired low pressure zone that draws air through the opening <b>34</b> and passages <b>28</b>. As the cooling air <b>36</b> flows from the opening <b>34</b> forward toward the annular passage <b>32</b> and the outlet <b>35</b> within the passages <b>28</b>, the cooling air <b>36</b> absorbs heat from the exhaust silencer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As appreciated, the cooling air eductor <b>44</b> is shown by way of example and other configurations of eductors could be utilized to provide the desired driving force for drawing air through the passage <b>28</b>. Moreover, other air flow generators, such as a fan or other known devices may be utilized to generate the desired cooling air flow <b>36</b>. In this example, the cooling air eductor <b>44</b> passively creates the driving force that draws cooling through the passages <b>28</b>. This passive generation of air flow does not increase a load on the APU or require external power sources such as a fan would require and therefore not only provides the cooling air flow required to maintain the outer surface <b>25</b> of the exhaust silencer <b>24</b> and skin <b>14</b> at a desired temperature but also substantially reduces the need for insulation materials.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, another example APU noise reduction system <b>55</b> or exhaust silencer cooling system <b>55</b> in tail cone assembly <b>50</b> includes the exhaust duct <b>20</b> through which exhaust gasses <b>48</b> from the gas turbine engine <b>16</b> are directed out through the end opening <b>31</b>. In this example the air flow generator is provided by a cooling fan <b>56</b> for oil cooler <b>52</b>. The cooling fan <b>56</b> draws air <b>40</b> from the inlet <b>38</b> and forces it into the passage <b>28</b> through an inlet <b>54</b>. The inlet <b>54</b> is disposed in the annular passage <b>32</b> that surrounds a forward end of the exhaust duct <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The oil cooler <b>52</b> cools oil utilized by the APU <b>10</b> using air drawn through the inlet <b>38</b>. Optionally, air could be drawn from alternate locations and ducts by the fan <b>56</b> and through the oil cooler <b>52</b>. The cooling air is injected through the oil cooler <b>52</b> and then exhausted through the inlet <b>54</b> into the annular passage <b>32</b>. Air in the passage <b>32</b> is pushed out to the passage <b>28</b> surrounding the silencer <b>24</b>. Although the cooling air exhausted from the oil cooler <b>52</b> has absorbed some heat from the oil, the air remains significantly cooler then the hot exhaust gases <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cooling air flow <b>36</b> progressively absorbs heat as it flows in thermal contact with the outer surface <b>25</b> of the exhaust silencer <b>24</b> toward the outlet <b>58</b> at the end plane <b>30</b>. Accordingly, in this example the oil cooler fan <b>56</b> is utilized to drive cooling air through the passage <b>28</b>. The cooling air flow <b>36</b> in turn absorbs and removes heat from the outer surface <b>25</b> of the silencer <b>24</b> and the exhaust duct <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, the outer surface <b>25</b> of the example exhaust silencer <b>24</b> and exhaust duct <b>20</b> are cooled by a flow of cooling air flow. The flow of cooling air carries away heat generated in the exhaust silencer <b>24</b> and exhaust duct <b>20</b> to protect materials and components not compatible with exposure to the elevated temperatures of exhaust gases <b>48</b>. The disclosed cooling method and features substantially reduce and/or eliminating the need for additional insulating material. In addition, the cooling passage <b>28</b> requires significantly less space while providing increased cooling thereby allowing for the baffles <b>26</b> of the exhaust silencer <b>24</b> to be of an increased size to provide a more efficient noise attenuating function.</p>

For that reason, the following claims should be studied to determine the scope and content of this invention.</p>
