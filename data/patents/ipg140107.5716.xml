<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A first website earns rewards, e.g. points and items, for carrying out activities. Those rewards can be transferred to a second website. For example, a parent's website allows the parent to carry more adult tasks and also earn points. The points can be transferred to the child's website. A center of the universe website allows obtaining rewards for any of these websites. A social networking component operates across multiple websites.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The assignee of the present application, GANZ, hosts the website webkinz.com. A detailed description of this website is found in copending application Ser. No. 11/027,647, filed Dec. 30, 2004, the contents of which are herewith incorporated by reference. In general, this website is intended for children, for example children who are younger than 14, and hence the games and activities on this website would likely be found most interesting by those children.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many children's websites exist which host activities that are intended for children's age groups, for example, children in the 3-to 13 year-old range or older. These activities can be carried out by other people of various age groups, but are often tailored towards things that will be found interesting by the specific age group or demographic.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present application describes websites which have activities intended for different users.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An embodiment allows interaction between the websites to allow rewards earned on one website, or virtual objects purchased through one website to be transferred in a special way to another website.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Activities on a first website, such as for example, the Webkinz&#xae; website, allow participants to carry out certain activities and obtain &#x201c;rewards&#x201d; for the activities. The rewards can be points, virtual money, or virtual items that can be used on the website. It may also be possible to purchase rewards on the website.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, the virtual money can be used to buy food which can be used to feed a virtual pet or other virtual character on the website. The virtual money may be usable to buy additional things such as clothing, furniture, room decorations, interactive objects, additional virtual pets, medical care, or other, on the website.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Website participants often take actions to increase their rewards, to buy food for their virtual pets, and to provide fun activities on the website.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inventors recognized that during certain times when the children were not playing, e.g., during the day when the children are at school or at other times when the children are busy, parents and other relatives could visit the site, and play on the site in order to get rewards for their children. For example, the mother of a six-year-old might have logged on to the website, and carried out some of the activities on the website. This may be done in order to get rewards for her child. If done, the game and/or activities may be uninteresting for the parent(s), but their children appreciate the increased rewards for their virtual pets.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments disclosed herein describe connections between websites that allow rewards to be earned on one website and transferred to another.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An aspect of the application describes a second website, such as for instance, a &#x201c;parent website&#x201d; having different kinds of activities intended for a different group of individuals, but that is linked to the first website. Here, the first website (e.g., webkinz.com) is a website intended for children, for example children between 2 and 13 years old, where rewards are earned, and these rewards can be used by the users on the first website. The second website has activities intended for adults, e.g., parent age or grandparent age. For example, the activities may include gossip type trivia questions, Wheel of Fortune type problems, brainteasers, or others. The activities may be either age- or gender-specific or both. For instance, such activities can be tailored for interest to a woman of the 30 to 40-year-old age range. Other games may include crossword puzzles and other adult type activities. The website may charge a fee for entry, or may be supported by advertising. The second website may be used not only by parents and grandparents, but also by friends, relatives and the users themselves, or, in essence, by anyone.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When an activity of a certain type is successfully carried out on the second website, the user (e.g., the parent) or other adult in the child's life (e.g., a teacher) gets certain kinds of points for carrying out this activity on the second website (e.g., parent website). The points can be transferred to the child's account on the child website.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a relationship between the sites. <b>100</b> shows a child's site, shown here with the child called &#x201c;child 1&#x201d;. The child's site <b>100</b> may include, for example, a virtual pet <b>106</b>, which is a virtual representation of a plush toy that interacts within a room, chat room, or other activities within an activity center <b>105</b>. The child may interact with the virtual pet <b>106</b> within the activity center <b>105</b>. The activity center may also include virtual furniture, clothing, equipment, as well as other virtual and animated virtual objects.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The child's site <b>100</b> may also include a list of other activities shown generically as <b>110</b>. A status bar <b>115</b> shows different aspects of the child's operation within the child's site <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The status bar shows the accumulated rewards. The child can accumulate rewards both on the child's site <b>100</b> and also on the parent site <b>150</b>, which can include points received from his/her own activities on the child's site <b>100</b> and points transferred from others. The rewards can also include earned and transferred items. The items can include, for example, food to feed to the virtual pet <b>106</b>, clothing or other items that can be used to dress the virtual pet, or toys or other items that facilitate interaction with the virtual pet <b>106</b> within the activity center <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The parent site <b>150</b> hosts different activities that are more appropriate for an adult to carry out, such as crossword puzzles and other puzzles, trivia information, information on parent issues and school issues, child health issues, pregnancy issues, first aid and medical issues, and other family issues. The parent site <b>150</b> may provide points as a reward for carrying out certain activities. For example, a parent can take a training course about proper child education and receive points for completing the course. The accumulated points or rewards are shown generically as <b>155</b>, and the activities are shown generically as <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The parent site <b>150</b> may allow using or redeeming the points or rewards <b>155</b> on the parent site <b>150</b>, but also includes a transfer function <b>161</b>. Selection of the transfer function <b>160</b> brings up a separate transfer page shown as <b>165</b>. At <b>156</b>, the user can select one of multiple different sites, e.g., Webkinz.com, or some other site, here referred to as &#x201c;new site&#x201d;. There may be a list of sites that can receive this transfer of rewards from the parent site <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Many of the parents may have multiple children, and any or all of these children can be registered in advance on the parent site <b>150</b>. <b>170</b> allows selection of the recipient for the transfer. A list of the existing registered children or the possibility of adding a new child is also provided.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><b>171</b> allows selection of, and entry of, a personalized message to send along with the transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The transfer screen also includes the ability to decide what specifically will be transferred. A points or virtual cash transfer <b>176</b> is possible, where the user enters the number of points they want to transfer into the box <b>177</b>. An item transfer <b>178</b> may bring up a separate window such as <b>180</b> which allows buying an item for transfer. This provides a list of the different items that the parents can buy, the number of points it will take to buy it, and allows purchase and transfer of that item to the child.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When the child has received a transfer, the next time they log in, a pop up transfer notification is displayed. For instance, the notification says &#x201c;you have received a reward transfer from parent 1&#x201d; shown as <b>116</b>. The transfer may say the number of points or may provide further detail about what the child has received. If a personalized message has been sent, this is displayed as <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this way, the parent can carry out activities that are more interesting to the parent. The actions, however, may still provide rewards to their child.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A specific way in which this is carried out may also use a prize pack which can be awarded or purchased at specified intervals. For example, the adult may be able to purchase or subscribe to a monthly &#x201c;prize pack&#x201d;. The prize pack allows the adult to send some number of gifts, for example 10 gifts, to the children on the site of their choice. The prizes are presented by the parent to the child. For example, the parents may encourage good off-line activities and good behavior in the children. In one example, the parent may tell the children that if they go outside and play for an hour, or brush their teeth all week, or clean their room, then they will get a reward. The parent can choose to send a gift and can include the personalized message shown as <b>117</b> with the gift. The next time the child logs onto their account, they receive the gift and the message.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above, the parent may also receive free rewards such as loyalty points for playing on or otherwise using the parent site <b>150</b>. In addition to playing games, the parent site <b>150</b> may provide points for completing surveys, clicking on ads, or other conventional website actions. Using the parent site <b>150</b> provides loyalty points for the parents. The points can be exchanged for virtual money or special items.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the items that can be purchased at <b>180</b> may be exclusive items that can only be received from the parent site <b>150</b> and cannot be obtained at all from the child's site <b>100</b>. In this case, the child's site <b>100</b> may display the exclusive items, but may appear grayed or faded out, or have some other indication to demonstrate that the items cannot be obtained from the child's site <b>100</b>. The child's site <b>100</b> may indicate that they can only receive these items by a transfer from the parent site <b>150</b>. This may provide further motivation for the parent to carry out actions on the parent site <b>150</b>, since the rewards will be even more special.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each of the sites may have their own form of virtual cash, e.g., Webkinz&#xae; cash for the Webkinz&#xae; site &#x201c;(KinzCash&#x2122;&#x201d;); but more generically, Site<b>1</b> cash for a Site<b>1</b>, and Site<b>2</b> cash for a Site<b>2</b>. The embodiment may allow cash from one site to be exchanged for cash from another site, as part of the rewards transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Another embodiment may allow a user to block rewards from being received. For example, if the recipient does not want to receive a reward or gift from the transferring person, they can click the &#x201c;block&#x201d; button <b>114</b> when the message pops up indicating that a reward transfer was received. This can add, for example, the transferee to the user's permanent block list. As a result, the user can effectively block the receipt of gifts or rewards from someone that they do not like or do not want to receive gifts from, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Another embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this embodiment, a number of different websites allow different activities. Reward presentations can be transferred from any of these websites to any other website, and used on that other website. As in the above embodiments, the rewards can be used to take an action that could not be taken without the reward, e.g., to purchase an item, or change some aspect of a character or other virtual item on the website.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the following describes only certain enumerated websites, others can also be included.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The Webkinz&#xae; site <b>300</b> is a site for children, similar to the child's site <b>100</b> described above. The parent site <b>305</b> is similar to the parent site <b>150</b>, which is also described above as a site that primarily deals with parental issues, and is intended for parents, guardians, and/or grandparents of the children on the Webkinz&#xae; site <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The preschool site <b>310</b> is a site intended for younger children, such as preschool age, and more generally can be any site intended for preschool age children. The preschool site <b>310</b> intends to allow user interaction with virtual pets and other activities without requiring reading as would be required on the Webkinz&#xae; site <b>300</b>. These sites described above can generically be considered as sites intended for preschool and elementary school children, e.g. sites which have activities that are intended for preschool and elementary school age children, and as sites which more specifically allow and facilitate interfacing with virtual pets. Apart from such child-specific sites, other sites designed for parental age users who have or care for preschool or elementary school children can operate cooperatively with such child-specific sites.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The competitive matches site <b>315</b> hosts activities that allow training and competitive matches such as fighting or dueling among characters hosted on the site. For example, each of the products on the competitive matches site <b>315</b> may be a specific product such as a ninja assassin, a ninja runner, or a kung fu expert. Each character can be purchased or otherwise obtained, in a default state, with attributes, skills and talents that are predetermined for that specific character. The attributes skills and talents are described according to a numerical designation, for example a designation between 0 and 10. Each of the skills can also have subsets, which can be described using the same kind of numerical designation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the ninja assassin character may have starting attributes with a skill of 3, speed of 1, strength limit of 8, energy limit of 8, and also have some starting talents such as hide in the shadow, and back stab. The ninja assassin can be trained, however, to increase its skill, speed, strength and energy, making it a unique character different than the default. The ninja assassin can also learn additional talents, such as different kinds of moves, either through the training or through acquiring moves by redeeming rewards. However, these skills, attributes and talents can have predetermined limits. The limits can be hard limits, e.g. a specified number that the character cannot train beyond, or soft limits, e.g. where character training becomes much more difficult beyond a soft limit.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The competitive matches site <b>315</b> enables competitions for fighting, where points, bonuses, incentives or other virtual prizes are awarded. Recipients of such rewards can convert and/or apply their rewards earned on the competitive matches site <b>315</b> to another site (e.g., another parent's site or a child's site). Other sites described herein may carry out analogous operations for other types of characters, e.g. baseball players, or others. These sites may also allow training and competitions among the trained characters.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Statistics are maintained on any of these sites, for example the win-loss record of a ninja assassin character may be recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The animal site <b>320</b> is a different category of web site which enables virtually interacting with animals in different ways, e.g., by collecting, breeding and/or otherwise interacting with animals in at least some of the same way(s) that one interacts with real animals. Figurines or plush toys representing the animals can also be obtained. The figurines can also include registration codes that allow registration of the figurines as described in our application Ser. No. 11/027,647 referenced above. Also, as in that application, rewards can be obtained for games, or interactions with the pets or others, and these rewards can be used on either the animal site or on other sites.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">One advantage of a rewards transfer in this kind of site (e.g., virtual collection site) is that multiple friends can pool their rewards to buy something that they could not otherwise pay for with their individual rewards, for example, and arrange a sharing agreement.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><b>355</b> is a school site, which is like the parent site <b>150</b>, but intended for educators. The educators are presented with different things of interest to professional educators. This also allows the educators to provide rewards to the children in their classes. For example, once a teacher registers on the school site <b>355</b>, and registers the names of their children, they may be allowed to provide specified kinds of rewards to the children participating on some other sites based on their grades, homework or class behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Any of these sites may allow the rewards earned thereon to be either used on the same site, or to be transferred either as virtual cash, points, or a purchase to another site.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The embodiments disclosed herein as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, may operate over a website, where a client computer shown as <b>200</b> receives content over a channel such as the Internet <b>202</b> from a server computer <b>210</b>. The server computer may also send the same or similar content to other clients shown generally as <b>205</b>. The channel can be any existing channel including wired or wireless channels, and can be the Internet, private network, or other comparable ways of sending information from an information provider to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a center of the universe embodiment, where a special &#x2018;central&#x2019; website links all the other websites in the universe.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A number of the websites previously described, including, e.g., the Webkinz&#xae; website <b>410</b>, preschool site <b>415</b>, competitive match site <b>420</b>, animal site <b>425</b>, and generic site <b>430</b> collectively form a universe <b>401</b> of websites. All of these are connected to the center of the universe site shown as <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Many of the sites in the universe <b>401</b> have a few things in common. The sites may operate to link a real world item or product with a virtual copy of that item. Each of the products may be limited editions&#x2014;that is, that limited numbers of the products are produced, after which, the products can no longer be obtained from the manufacturer. Each site in the universe <b>401</b> may allow the user to further develop the character linked to the product. Each site uses some kind of currency or reward system that allows users to purchase virtual objects and develop their characters' characteristics. Also, each of the sites in the universe <b>401</b> has a place where the users can trade or sell their possessions; be they virtual or real possessions. Other websites may also be added to the universe <b>401</b> that do not include some or all of these features.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each website in the universe <b>401</b> has merits of its own, that make the websites independently appealing to a target demographic. The center of the universe site <b>400</b> therefore allows interaction with a universe <b>401</b> of websites that collectively appeal to virtually everyone. While only a few sites have been described for this purpose, it should be understood that other sites of any and all types can be used in the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The center of the universe site <b>400</b> therefore does not intend to be applicable to one demographic, but rather intends to be a hybrid site that provides a little bit of everything, making it appealing to people of all demographics and ages. Any type of site on the Internet can be used as the center of the universe site <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">However, the center of the universe site <b>400</b> is linked with the other universe <b>401</b> sites, and provides rewards, called center of the universe dollars, that can be used on any of the universe <b>401</b> sites. In addition, the center of the universe site <b>400</b> provides cross site advertising.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The center of the universe dollars can be used in various ways. They can be exchanged for the currency of choice on any other site in the universe <b>401</b>. For example, these other sites may each use their own specific form of virtual cash, e.g., Site<b>1</b> cash. The center of the universe dollars may be convertible into Site <b>1</b> cash. Alternatively, the center of the universe dollars can be universal virtual cash that can be used directly on any of those sites.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Center of the universe dollars can also be used to purchase items directly on the center of the universe site <b>400</b>. The items on the center of the universe site <b>400</b> are exclusive items that can be used on other sites, but are exclusive in the sense that they cannot be purchased on the other sites themselves. Therefore the user can send these items to either themselves or to someone else on a different site by addressing the recipient by username or through a feature code that can be emailed to the user and/or then emailed to the intended final recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The center of the universe site <b>400</b> may be financed through advertising or membership fees, but may also allow users to use real money to purchase items on the center of the universe site <b>400</b> for those users who do not want to invest the time to earn the center of the universe dollars. This can form another source of revenue. Moreover, this site may appeal to anyone who knows anybody else who enjoys any of the other universe <b>401</b> sites. Anyone can go to the center of the universe site <b>400</b>, and buy special limited edition gifts; either real or virtual, for themselves or for someone else, it forms a cross-demographic draw. Moreover, since the intent of the universe <b>401</b> is to appeal to literally every different possible demographic and interest, presumably everyone will know someone who is interested in one of the universe <b>401</b> sites. Therefore, for example, a gift for any age person can be obtained on the center of the universe site <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Instead of needing to visit multiple different sites or multiple different stores to find multiple different gifts, this could facilitate purchasing gifts for a myriad of different people all at the same place.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The center of the universe dollars, however, can alternatively be obtained by engaging in activities on the center of the universe site. For example, center of the universe dollars can be obtained by reading, obtaining information, or simply visiting the site, for example. Other activities on the site can also be used for obtaining such rewards.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The transfers that can be carried out in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> may also use the blocking technique described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so that a user can block specified people from sending them rewards and/or gifts.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Another embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> uses a social networking feature along with the center of the universe architecture of previous embodiments. This embodiment allows interaction between the different sites in order to carry out social networking functions between the multiple sites. The social networking functions according to the present embodiment include certain new functions for social networking that have not been available from any previous social networking systems. More generally, however, the social networking according to the present embodiment may include any kind of function where one user <b>501</b> can show and/or discuss and/or trade and/or otherwise interact with their items that are stored or otherwise cataloged on a website. In the present embodiment, the items and discussions, however, can be from any of the sites within the universe of websites. In one embodiment, the universe of sites each allow playing a game using the characters on the website, those characters being either toys, or figures or other participants in an online based game.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to this embodiment, each of a plurality of sites includes a social networking component. This social networking component is unlike other social networking components, since it includes not only information about the user itself, but also information about the characters that the user has acquired and/or trained on any of the universe of sites.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the fighting site <b>510</b> having a social networking part <b>511</b> which allows any user <b>513</b> to include their individualized character <b>512</b>, here shown as character x, as part of the social networking The user can also include personalized information about themselves, such as their interests, picture, age, or other types of information that might be found on Myspace&#x2122; or Facebook&#x2122; type websites. In addition, however, each of the sites in the universe of sites has its own version of a social network that is specific to the specific site.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The social networking component may include a purchase component shown as <b>514</b> which may offer characters for sale or trade on either one or multiple different websites. The component <b>514</b> may allow setting a specific price for the character. Alternatively, or in addition, the component may include an amount that will be necessary to trade the character. The component <b>514</b> may simply allow listing the character in a way that allows making an offer, or may be more sophisticated. In an embodiment, the center of the universe site may host all of the trades. The component <b>514</b> may also provide additional information allowing it to become a one-stop process of buying or trading items for virtual cash. An initial value for the item to be sold or traded may be set, for example by a user, as an asking price. A value determination estimator may provide users with data from which they can determine a market value of the item. The value can be based on previous sales or trades, e.g., last five trades of similar items, averages over time for trades, value when new, number of similar items that are currently for sale, or, for a rare item, the last time that a similar item was sold and information about that sale, such as the price and/or condition of the item.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The purchase component may allow the items to be purchased in center of the universe dollars, for example, after which, the seller receives the payment in center of the universe dollars. Once purchased, a secure code is provided for the transfer. The code allows the new owner to register their new item on the appropriate website. The previous registration code, used by the previous owner to register the item, is also cancelled.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a universe of websites, including a virtual fighting site <b>510</b>, the Webkinz&#xae; site <b>520</b> (the details of which are described, for example, in application Ser. No. 11/027647, filed Dec. 30, 2004, the contents of which are herewith incorporated by reference herein), and the animals site <b>530</b>, which are all connected to the center of the universe site <b>500</b>. Other sites, including any of the other sites described in this application, may also be added to this universe. Each site may have its own specific social networking function that is specific to the characteristics of the site.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Each of the individual sites making up the universe may also transfer its information to the center of the universe site. For example, the fight site <b>510</b> may allow a social networking function which allows displaying one or more of the user's trained characters, such as <b>512</b>, in the social networking area <b>511</b>. These trained characters are, in general, unique, based on the training they have received. In addition, the character, and all the contents of the social networking, can also be transferred to and displayed on, the center of the universe site <b>500</b>. The transferred social networking is shown on the Center of the Universe site as <b>505</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Other sites may similarly have social networking components that include display of collected characters from their websites. The Webkinz&#xae; site <b>520</b> allows displaying the user's collection of different Webkinz&#xae; characters <b>521</b>, <b>522</b>, and transferring those displays to the center of the universe site <b>500</b>. The animals site <b>530</b> displays the animal(s) and transfers the display of those animals to the center of the universe site.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The center of the universe site then allows any user to choose any or all of these characters as well as their specific user information to present their data to all other viewers on the network. That is, the social networking carried out by the center of the universe site <b>500</b> can include any or all of the content from any or all of the sites that are connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In any of these sites, the character can be featured or displayed in a number of different ways. For example, this may allow a user to show off their character(s) on the site itself, or on the center of the universe site, or via the center of the universe site to any of the other sites or on all of the sites. The character such as <b>512</b> may be shown as a screenshot of the character itself, e.g., as an image or an animation. The character can also be customized, for example, to show different clothes, colors, poses or views as customized. Alternatively, the character can be identified via a link to the originating site. A database of different characters can alternatively be used and displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In sites such as the Webkinz&#xae; site <b>520</b>, there may be a number of items, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as <b>521</b>, <b>522</b>. Some subset of those items may be a flagged as part of the user's personal collection. The items shown in the center of the universe site's version of the social networking may be dynamically updated. For example, when the user obtains a new Webkinz&#xae; character, it may be automatically added to the viewed collection both on the Webkinz&#xae; site, and also on the Center of the Universe site <b>500</b>. Similarly, as a Fighting character such as <b>511</b> <b>512</b> is trained, it may take on a new look, and that new look may be added to the local site and center of the universe sites.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The characters viewed may be images, and the image may be updated each time something in one of the other sites changes, such as the character.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The items which are sent and displayed may not be limited to characters but may be whole rooms. For example, the Webkinz&#xae; site may have personal rooms with furniture and the like and with items in the room. For example, <b>526</b> illustrates a room which has various pieces of furniture <b>523</b> as well as an item <b>524</b>. The entire room <b>526</b> may be sent to the center of the universe site and viewed thereon as part of the social networking.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The above has described how social networking may be carried out using a center of the universe site. Also, as in both previous embodiments, interacting with the website in any way may result in rewards being provided to the user. For example, carrying out the social networking may provide center of the universe dollars to the user of the social networking.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The trades and other operations may be carried out using any of a number of different currencies. The center of the universe site may also carry out currency exchanges. The center of the universe dollars may be usable on any of the sites, as described above. As an alternative, however, the center of the universe site <b>500</b> may provide currency exchange <b>502</b> between sites. For example, the Webkinz&#xae; site may use only a currency called KinzCash&#x2122;. The center of the universe site may allow providing a conversion between center of the universe dollars and the KinzCash&#x2122;. The center of the universe site may also provide a universal exchange that allows exchanging between KinzCash&#x2122; and some other cash available and/or usable on one of the other sites in the universe.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to these features, the center of the universe site may allow trading items and or selling items for different currency, and currency conversion. The virtual currency can also be stored in a virtual &#x201c;bank account&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The general structure and techniques, and more specific embodiments which can be used to effect different ways of carrying out the more general goals are described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although only a few embodiments have been disclosed in detail above, other embodiments are possible and the inventors intend these to be encompassed within this specification. The specification describes specific examples to accomplish a more general goal that may be accomplished in another way. This disclosure is intended to be exemplary, and the claims are intended to cover any modification or alternative which might be predictable to a person having ordinary skill in the art. For example, other sites and rewards can be used. The above describes a manual action to transfer the points and rewards, but alternatively, the rewards can be automatically transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Also, the inventors intend that only those claims which use the words &#x201c;means for&#x201d; are intended to be interpreted under 35 USC 112, sixth paragraph. Moreover, no limitations from the specification are intended to be read into any claims, unless those limitations are expressly included in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The computers described herein may be any kind of computer, either general purpose, or some specific purpose computer such as a workstation, running any program.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The programs may be resident on a storage medium, e.g., magnetic or optical, e.g. the computer hard drive, a removable disk or other removable medium. The programs may also be run over a network, for example, with a server or other machine sending signals to the local machine, which allows the local machine to carry out the operations described herein.</p>
