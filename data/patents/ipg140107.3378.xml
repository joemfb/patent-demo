<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a control circuit and a control method thereof. More particularly, the invention relates to a control circuit of a cycling switch and a control method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The conventional control switch or circuit applied to the electronic equipment can be involved in the following three types. The first type is to use a mechanical control switch to control the electronic equipment, so that the operation modes and functions of the electronic equipment can be changed by switching the mechanical control switch. The second type is to use a plurality of control switches, so that the electronic equipment can be switched to different operation modes and functions by the settings of the control switches.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a conventional control circuit of the third type for controlling the electronic equipment F<b>1</b> to operate in different operation modes and functions. According to the layout design of the control circuit, the power and state signals of the electronic equipment F<b>1</b> can be stored in the storage element <b>211</b> of the control loop <b>21</b> (e.g. a capacitor). Then, the control switches SW<b>1</b>, SW<b>2</b> and SW<b>3</b> can operate and switch the signals to change the power and state signals stored in the storage element <b>211</b> of the control loop <b>21</b>, thereby changing the operation mode and function of the electronic equipment F<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, although the above-mentioned first and second types of control circuits have the advantage of simple design, they need many switch circuits for switching between different operation modes, which may result in very complex wiring and layout. In this case, if the electronic equipment is damaged and the switch is needed to be replaced, it must consume a lot of working time for the replacement due to the complex wiring and layout.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, although the third type of control circuit has the simpler control switches design, however, the control loop <b>21</b> needs a storage element <b>211</b> for storing the power and state signals. In this case, the storage element <b>211</b> has may discharge routes, so that the electricity stored in the storage element <b>211</b> can not be kept for a long time. In order to extend the storage time, the storage element <b>211</b> with larger capacity is desired. However, the storage element <b>211</b> with larger capacity also has large volume, which will result in the waste of space, especially in the situation of no operation mode and function changes. Moreover, when the switch SW<b>3</b> is turned off, the power signal ACS can be still applied to the resistor R<b>4</b>, power loop <b>22</b>, driving loop <b>23</b> and control loop <b>21</b>, which may keep consuming the power.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is an important aspect of the invention to provide a control circuit that does not need the storage element with large capacity and can still achieve the purpose of energy saving.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the foregoing, one aspect of the invention is to provide a control circuit of a cycling switch that does not need the storage element with large capacity and can still achieve the purpose of energy saving.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve the above-mentioned aspect, one embodiment of the invention discloses a control circuit of a cycling switch for controlling an electronic equipment to operate in different operation modes and functions. The control circuit includes a switch loop, a first control loop, and a second control loop. The switch loop generates a driving signal to drive the electronic equipment. The first control loop is electrically connected with the switch loop and the electronic equipment respectively, and generates a first control signal according to a variation of the driving signal.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first control loop includes a first filter unit electrically connected with the switch loop and outputs a pulse signal according to the variation of the driving signal. In addition, the first control loop further includes a trigger unit electrically connected with the first filter unit and generates a trigger signal according to the second control signal and the pulse signal. The first control loop may further includes a delay unit electrically connected with the trigger unit and the second control loop for delaying the trigger signal, thereby delaying the first control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The second control loop is electrically connected with the first control loop and the electronic equipment respectively, and has a storage unit, which charges and discharges according to the first control signal so as to control the second control loop to generate a second control signal inputted to the first control loop and then to control the electronic equipment to operate in different operation modes and functions. In addition, the second control loop further includes an inverter unit and a discharging unit. The inverter unit is electrically connected with the delay unit and the discharging unit, and the discharging unit is electrically connected with the storage unit. The inverter unit controls to enable/disable the discharging unit according to the first control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, the second control loop may further include a charging unit electrically connected with the delay unit, the inverter unit, the discharging unit, and the storage unit for charging the storage unit based on the first control signal. In one aspect, the inverter unit includes a first switch electrically connected with the discharging unit. When the first switch is turned on based on the first control signal, the discharging unit is disabled so that the storage unit is not discharged; otherwise, when the first switch is turned off based on the first control signal, the discharging unit is enabled so that the storage unit is discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment of the invention, the control circuit further includes a converter loop electrically connected with the switch loop and generating a DC signal according to an AC signal to the switch loop.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment of the invention, the control circuit further includes a power switch electrically connected with the switch loop. When the power switch is turned on, the converter loop outputs the DC signal according to the AC signal.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment of the invention, the control circuit further includes a third control loop electrically connected with the switch loop and the converter loop respectively. The third control loop outputs a third control signal according to the AC signal to enable the switch loop, so that the switch loop generates the driving signal according to the DC signal to drive the electronic equipment. In this case, the third control loop includes a transformer unit and a second filter unit. The transformer unit is electrically connected with the converter loop and the second filter unit. The transformer unit outputs a transform signal according to the AC signal to the second filter unit, so that the second filter unit generates the third control signal to control the switch loop</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To achieve the above-mentioned aspect, one embodiment of the invention also discloses a control method of a control circuit of a cycling switch for controlling an electronic equipment to operate in different operation modes and functions. The control circuit includes a power switch, a switch loop, a first control loop and a second control loop. The switch loop outputs a driving signal, while the power switch is turned on, to drive the electronic equipment, and the second control loop includes a storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The control method according to one embodiment of the invention includes the following steps of: determining whether the state of the power switch is changed or not; altering the driving signal outputted from the switch loop according to the change of the state of the power switch; generating a first control signal by the first control loop according to a variation of the driving signal; controlling or altering the state of the storage unit by the second control loop according to the first control signal; and generating a second control signal according to the change of the state of the storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment of the invention, the step of determining whether the state of the power switch is changed or not is performed by a third control loop. The step of altering the driving signal outputted from the switch loop is performed by using the third control loop to generate a third control signal to alter the state of the switch loop, thereby altering the driving signal.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment of the invention, in the step of generating a first control signal by the first control loop, the first control loop can output a pulse signal according to the variation of the driving signal to a trigger unit. Then, the trigger unit generates a trigger signal according to the second control signal and the pulse signal, so that the first control signal can be then generated. Herein, to change the state of the storage unit is to charge or discharge the storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment of the invention, the control method further includes a step of discharging the storage unit through a discharging unit, and a step of charging the storage unit through a charging unit. Herein, the charging unit can disable the discharging unit according to the first control signal and then charging the storage unit, thereby changing the second control signal. Thus, the electronic equipment can be operated in different operation modes and functions. In addition, the charging unit may include a diode for preventing the electricity leakage of the storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The inverter unit can enable the discharging unit according to the first control signal so as to discharge the storage unit. Moreover, the inverter unit includes a first switch, and when the first switch is turned on based on the first control signal, the discharging unit is disabled so that the storage unit is not discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As mentioned above, in the control circuit of a cycling switch and the control method thereof of one embodiment of the invention, the charging and discharging of the storage unit of the second control loop can control the electronic equipment to switch between different operation modes and functions. Thus, the wiring design between the control circuit and the electronic equipment can be simplified, and it may also be simpler to replace the switch in the equipment. In addition, the electricity may be stored in the storage unit within the control circuit, and it may support the electronic equipment to function for a while during the actions of starting and shutting down of the electronic equipment. Therefore, the control circuit of one embodiment of the invention does not need a storage device with a large capacity, and it still can achieve the purpose of energy saving.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first filter unit <b>121</b> outputs a pulse signal P according to the variation of the driving signal DS. In this embodiment, the first filter unit <b>121</b> is, for example, a high-pass filter, which allows only the high-frequency signals to pass through and filter out the low-frequency signals. Thus, when the switch loop <b>11</b> is continuously enabled, because the driving signal DS is not changed and the driving signal DS does not includes high frequency, the first filter unit <b>121</b> can not output the pulse signal P. Accordingly, the first control signal CS<b>1</b> can not be generated, and the operation mode and function of the electronic equipment E is not changed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The trigger unit <b>122</b> generates a trigger signal T according to the pulse signal P and a second control signal CS<b>2</b> outputted by the second control loop <b>13</b>. For example, the trigger unit <b>122</b> may be a D-type flip-flop that is positive edge triggered or negative edge triggered. In this embodiment, the trigger unit <b>122</b> is a D-type flip-flop that is positive edge triggered.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The following Table 1 is a truth table of the trigger unit <b>122</b>, wherein D represents the input of the flip-flop, G represents the enable input of the flip-flop, Q represents the output of the flip-flop, and N represents another output of the flip-flop. The levels of N and Q are in opposite. For example, when Q is in a high level, N is in a low level; otherwise, when Q is in a low level, N is in a high level.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in Table 1, only when the enable input G of the flip-flop changes from the low level (0) to the high level (1), the level of the output Q of the flip-flop is equal to that of the input D. Meanwhile, the output Q of the flip-flop will keep at the same level until next level change (the enable input G of the flip-flop changes from the high level (1) to the low level (0)). In addition, because the level of the output Q of the flip-flop is equal to that of the input D of the flip-flop, the level of output N is in opposite to that of the input D.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At the timing that the level the enable input G of the trigger unit <b>122</b> changes from the low level to the high level, the signal outputted from the output Q of the trigger unit <b>122</b> has the same level as that outputted from the input D of the trigger unit <b>122</b> (the second control signal CS<b>2</b> outputted by the second control loop <b>13</b>). In other words, when the level of the pulse signal P changes from the low level to the high level, the level of the trigger signal T outputted by the trigger unit <b>122</b> (from the output N of the trigger unit <b>122</b>) is in opposite to that of the second control signal CS<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The trigger unit <b>122</b> outputs the trigger signal T to the delay unit <b>123</b>, and the delay unit <b>123</b> delays the trigger signal T for a while and then output it. The delayed signal is the first control signal CS<b>1</b>, which is then transmitted to the second control loop <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The second control loop <b>13</b> is electrically connected with the first control loop <b>12</b> and the electronic equipment E respectively. The second control loop <b>13</b> includes a storage unit <b>131</b>, which charges and discharges according to the first control signal CS<b>1</b>. Thus, the second control loop <b>13</b> generates a second control signal CS<b>2</b>, which is then inputted to the first control loop <b>12</b> and controls the operation mode of the electronic equipment E. In this embodiment, the storage unit <b>131</b> is a capacitor for example.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The second control loop <b>13</b> further includes an inverter unit <b>132</b> and a discharging unit <b>133</b>. The inverter unit <b>132</b> is electrically connected with the delay unit <b>123</b> and the discharging unit <b>133</b>, and the discharging unit <b>133</b> is electrically connected with the storage unit <b>131</b>. The inverter unit <b>132</b> inverts the first control signal CS<b>1</b> for controlling to enable/disable the discharging unit <b>133</b>. The storage unit <b>131</b> is discharged when the discharging unit <b>133</b> is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second control loop <b>13</b> may further include a charging unit <b>134</b> electrically connected with the delay unit <b>123</b>, the inverter unit <b>132</b>, the discharging unit <b>133</b>, and the storage unit <b>131</b>. The charging unit <b>134</b> charges the storage unit <b>131</b> based on the first control signal CS<b>1</b>. For example, when the first control signal CS<b>1</b> is in a high level, it flows through the charging unit <b>134</b> and then charges the storage unit <b>131</b>, and the discharging unit <b>133</b> is disabled.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit diagram of the second control loop <b>13</b> of the control circuit <b>1</b> according to one embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the charging unit <b>134</b> includes a first resistor R<b>1</b> and a diode D<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the first control signal CS<b>1</b> is in the high level, it flows through the first resistor R<b>1</b> and the diode D<b>1</b> to rapidly charging the storage unit <b>131</b>. Meanwhile, the second control signal CS<b>2</b> is changed to high level and then transmitted to the trigger unit <b>122</b> and the electronic equipment E (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), thereby changing the operation modes and functions of the electronic equipment E.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Regarding to the storage unit <b>131</b>, the diode D<b>1</b> is in reverse bias when the discharging unit <b>133</b> is disabled, so that the electricity stored in the storage unit <b>131</b> is not leaked quickly. Thus, during the operation mode switching of the electronic equipment E, the control circuit <b>1</b> can still supply power to the electronic equipment E for a while. Consequently, the storage unit <b>131</b> does not need the capacitor with larger capacity, such as the storage element <b>211</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that is necessary in the conventional control circuit. In addition, the power loop <b>22</b> and the driving loop <b>23</b> may have noise capacitances.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The inverter unit <b>132</b> may include a second resistor R<b>2</b>, a third resistor R<b>3</b>, a first switch S<b>1</b>, and a first capacitor C<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Each of the discharging unit <b>133</b> and the first switch S<b>1</b> is a field-effect transistor (FET), such as a JFET or a MOSFET. In one embodiment, each of the discharging unit <b>133</b> and the first switch S<b>1</b> is for example an NMOSFET.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the first control signal CS<b>1</b> is in high level and the first switch S<b>1</b> is turned on, the power source V induces a current I flowing through the third resistor R<b>3</b> and then passing through the second end S<b>12</b> of the first switch S<b>1</b> and the third end S<b>13</b> of the first switch S<b>1</b>. The current I does not flow through the first end <b>1331</b> of the discharging unit <b>133</b>, so the discharging unit <b>133</b> is disabled. Accordingly, the storage unit <b>131</b> is not discharged, and the level of the second control signal CS<b>2</b> is not changed, which means the operation mode and function of the electronic equipment E is not changed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the first control signal CS<b>1</b> is in low level and the first switch S<b>1</b> is turned off, the power source V induces a current I flowing through the third resistor R<b>3</b> and then transmitted to the first end C<b>11</b> of the first capacitor C<b>1</b>. Then, the first capacitor C<b>1</b> is charged to enable the discharging unit <b>133</b>, so that the storage unit <b>131</b> is discharged through the second end <b>1332</b> of the discharging unit <b>133</b> and the third end <b>1333</b> of the discharging unit <b>133</b>. Meanwhile, the level of the second control signal CS<b>2</b> is decreased and it becomes a low level signal.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the control circuit <b>1</b> of one embodiment may further include a converter loop <b>14</b> and a power switch <b>15</b>. The converter loop <b>14</b> is electrically connected with the switch loop <b>11</b> and the power switch <b>15</b>. When the power switch <b>15</b> is turned on, the converter loop <b>14</b> generates a DC signal DCS according to an AC signal ACS and transmits the DC signal DCS to the switch loop <b>11</b>. In this case, the converter loop <b>14</b> includes an AC/DC converter <b>141</b> for converting the inputted AC signal ACS to a DC signal DCS. The AC/DC converter <b>141</b> is commonly used in the prior art, so the detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The control circuit <b>1</b> may further include a third control loop <b>16</b>, which is electrically connected with the switch loop <b>11</b> and the converter loop <b>14</b>. In the embodiment, the third control loop <b>16</b> outputs a third control signal CS<b>3</b> according to the AC signal ACS to enable the switch loop <b>11</b>, so that the switch loop <b>11</b> generates the driving signal DS according to the DC signal DCS to drive the electronic equipment E.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, when the power switch <b>15</b> is turned on, the AC signal ACS is transmitted to the converter loop <b>14</b> and the third control loop <b>16</b>. The AC signal ACS is converted to form the DC signal DCS by the AC/DC converter <b>141</b>, the DC signal DCS is then transmitted to the switch loop <b>11</b>. In addition, the third control loop <b>16</b> outputs the third control signal CS<b>3</b> to the switch loop <b>11</b> for enabling the switch loop <b>11</b>, so that the switch loop <b>11</b> generates the driving signal DS to drive the electronic equipment E. When the power switch <b>15</b> is continuously turned on, the third control loop <b>16</b> can continuously output the third control signal CS<b>3</b> for enabling the switch loop <b>11</b>, so that the electronic equipment E may continuously operating without changing its operation mode and function.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, the third control loop <b>16</b> may include a transformer unit <b>161</b> and a second filter unit <b>162</b>. The transformer unit <b>161</b> is electrically connected with the converter loop <b>14</b> and the second filter unit <b>162</b>, and the second filter unit <b>162</b> is electrically connected with the switch loop <b>11</b>. The transformer unit <b>161</b> outputs a transform signal TS according to the AC signal ACS to the second filter unit <b>162</b>, so that the second filter unit <b>162</b> generates the third control signal CS<b>3</b> to enable/disable the switch loop <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, the transformer unit <b>161</b> attenuates the AC signal ACS to generate the transform signal TS and then outputs it to the second filter unit <b>162</b>. The second filter unit <b>162</b> is, for example, a low-pass filter, which allows only the low-frequency signals (e.g. 60 Hz) to pass through and filter out the high-frequency signals. Accordingly, when the power switch <b>15</b> is continuously turned on, the second filter unit <b>162</b> of the third control loop <b>16</b> allows the low-frequency AC signal ACS to pass through. Thus, the third control signal CS<b>3</b> is continuously outputted to enable the switch loop <b>11</b> to continuously output the driving signal DS, so that the electronic equipment E may continuously operating without changing its operation mode and function.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment of the invention (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>), the switch loop <b>11</b> may be an EFT, which has a gate electrically connected with the third control loop <b>16</b>, a source electrically connected with the converter loop <b>14</b>, and a drain electrically connected with the first control loop <b>12</b>. The third control loop <b>16</b> outputs the third control signal CS<b>3</b> to the gate of the EFT for enabling the switch loop <b>11</b>, so that the switch loop <b>11</b> outputs the driving signal DS to the electronic equipment E and the first control loop <b>12</b> for controlling them.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The operation of the control circuit <b>1</b> will be described herein below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a timing chart of the control circuit <b>1</b> of one embodiment, and the horizontal axis is a time axis.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At a first timing T<b>1</b>, the power switch <b>15</b> is turned on, the converter loop <b>14</b> outputs the DC signal DCS to the switch loop <b>11</b>, and the third control loop <b>16</b> generates the third control signal CS<b>3</b> to enable the switch loop <b>11</b> to output the driving signal DS. The DC signal DCS, the third control signal CS<b>3</b> and the driving signal DS are all in the high level at the first timing T<b>1</b>. When the power switch <b>15</b> is turned on, the first filter unit <b>121</b> generates a pulse (the peak of the pulse signal P at the timing T<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) according to the driving signal DS at this moment, which is then transmitted to the trigger unit <b>122</b>. At this timing T<b>1</b>, the second control signal CS<b>2</b> is in low level, so that the trigger signal T outputted from the trigger unit <b>122</b> is in high level (opposite to the level of the second control signal CS<b>2</b>). The trigger signal T is delayed by the delay unit <b>123</b> for a period t, and the first control signal CS<b>1</b> also becomes a high level signal. Thus, the storage unit <b>131</b> can be charged quickly by the charging unit <b>134</b> to allow the second control signal CS<b>2</b> to become a high level signal too, which is then transmitted to the electronic equipment E to change its operation mode and function.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first control signal CS<b>1</b> of high level, which is inverted by the inverter unit <b>132</b>, can turn on the first switch <b>51</b> to not charging the first capacitor C<b>1</b>, so that the discharging unit <b>133</b> is disabled. In this case, the storage unit <b>131</b> does not discharge, so the electricity stored in the storage unit <b>131</b> can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the power switch <b>15</b> is continuously turned on at the first timing T<b>1</b>, the switch loop <b>11</b> is also enabled, so that the driving signal DS and the third control signal CS<b>3</b> are still in high level. Because the driving signal DS does not have variation, the pulse signal P is still in low level, so that the levels of the trigger signal T, first control signal CS<b>1</b> and the second control signal CS<b>2</b> are not changed. Since the second control signal CS<b>2</b> is used to control the operation mode of the electronic equipment E, the operation mode and function of the electronic equipment E will not be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At a second timing T<b>2</b>, the power switch <b>15</b> is turned off, so that the third control signal CS<b>3</b> outputted by the third control loop <b>16</b> can control to disable the switch loop <b>11</b> so that the electronic equipment E will lose the driving signal DS and thus stop operating. Meanwhile, the electricity stored in the storage unit <b>131</b> can be maintained due to the configuration of the diode D<b>1</b> of the charging unit <b>134</b>, thereby keeping the second control signal CS<b>2</b> in high level for a while.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At a third timing T<b>3</b>, the power switch <b>15</b> is turned on again, so that the third control signal CS<b>3</b> outputted by the third control loop <b>16</b> can control to enable the switch loop <b>11</b> again so that the driving signal DS can be outputted to the first control loop <b>12</b> and to drive the electronic equipment E. When the power switch <b>15</b> is turned on again, the first filter unit <b>121</b> generates a pulse (the peak of the pulse signal P at the timing T<b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) according to the driving signal DS at this moment, which is then transmitted to the trigger unit <b>122</b>. At this timing T<b>3</b>, the level of the trigger signal T outputted by the trigger unit <b>122</b> is opposite to that of the second control signal CS<b>2</b>. In this case, the second control signal CS<b>2</b> is in high level, so that the trigger signal T is in low level. The trigger signal T is delayed by the delay unit <b>123</b>, and the first control signal CS<b>1</b> outputted by the first control loop <b>12</b> also becomes a low level signal.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The first control signal CS<b>1</b> of low level is transmitted to the inverter unit <b>132</b> of the second control loop <b>13</b>, so that the signal outputted to the gate of the discharging unit <b>133</b> can be inverted to a high level signal for enabling the discharging unit <b>133</b>. Accordingly, the storage unit <b>131</b> can be discharged to change the second control signal CS<b>2</b> from the original high level to low level.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">At a fourth timing T<b>4</b>, the power switch <b>15</b> is turned on again, so that the third control signal CS<b>3</b> outputted by the third control loop <b>16</b> controls to disable the switch loop <b>11</b> so that the electronic equipment E will lose the driving signal DS and thus stop operating. In this case, the first control signal CS<b>1</b> and the second control signal CS<b>2</b> are both in low level, so that the operation mode and function of the electronic equipment E will not be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Repeating the above-mentioned enabling action of the power switch charges the storage unit <b>131</b> again, so that the second control signal CS<b>2</b> becomes a high level signal, thereby changing the operation mode and function of the electronic equipment E again.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As mentioned above, the control circuit <b>1</b> of one embodiment of the invention can enable/disable the power switch <b>15</b> to switch the operation mode and function of the electronic equipment E, so that the wiring design between the control circuit <b>1</b> and the electronic equipment E is simplified. Thus, it is simpler to replace the simple switch in the equipment. In addition, the electricity can be stored in the storage unit <b>131</b> as the power switch <b>15</b> is changed from turn-on to turn-off in a short time, and it supports the electronic equipment E to function for a while during the actions of starting and shutting down of the electronic equipment E. Therefore, the control circuit <b>1</b> of one embodiment of the invention does not need a storage device with a large capacity, such as the storage element <b>211</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that is necessary in the conventional control circuit; wherein the power loop <b>22</b> and the driving loop <b>23</b> may have noise capacitances, and it still can achieve the purpose of energy saving.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The step P<b>2</b> is to control or alter the driving signal DS outputted from the switch loop <b>11</b> according to the change of the state of the power switch <b>15</b>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The second control loop <b>13</b> further includes an inter unit <b>132</b>, which can enable the discharging unit <b>133</b> according to the first control signal CS<b>1</b>, thereby discharging the storage unit <b>131</b>. The inverter unit <b>132</b> has a first switch S<b>1</b>. When the first switch S<b>1</b> is turned on according to the first control signal CS<b>1</b> (e.g. when the first control signal CS<b>1</b> is in high level, the NMOSFET of the first switch S<b>1</b> is turned on), the discharging unit <b>133</b> (e.g. an NMOSFET) is disabled, so that the storage unit <b>131</b> is not discharged. Otherwise, when the first switch S<b>1</b> is turned off according to the first control signal CS<b>1</b>, the discharging unit <b>133</b> is enabled, so that the storage unit <b>131</b> is discharged to change the store electricity therein. For example, each of the discharging unit <b>133</b> and the first switch S<b>1</b> is a transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The step P<b>5</b> is to generate a second control signal CS<b>2</b> according to the change of the state of the storage unit <b>131</b>. In this embodiment, when the storage unit <b>131</b> is charged to high level according to the first control signal CS<b>1</b>, the second control signal CS<b>2</b> outputted by the second control loop <b>13</b> becomes a high level signal.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The step P<b>6</b> is to change the operation mode and function of the electronic equipment E according to the second control signal CS<b>2</b>. In this step P<b>6</b>, the second control signal CS<b>2</b> of high level outputted by the second control loop <b>13</b> is transmitted to the electronic equipment E for switching the operation mode and function of the electronic equipment E.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">To sum up, in the control circuit of a cycling switch and the control method thereof of the invention, the charging and discharging of the storage unit of the second control loop can control the electronic equipment to switch between different operation modes and functions. Thus, the wiring design between the control circuit and the electronic equipment may be simplified, and it may also be simpler to replace the switch in the equipment. In addition, the electricity may be stored in the storage unit within the control circuit, and it may support the electronic equipment to function for a while during the actions of starting and shutting down of the electronic equipment. Therefore, the control circuit of the invention does not need a storage device with a large capacity, and it still achieves the purpose of energy saving.</p>
