<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of LED technologies, and more particularly, to a light emitting diode (LED) dimming drive device, an LED dimming drive method and a liquid crystal display (LCD).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With continuous advancement of the liquid crystal display (LCD) technologies, more and more manufacturers now choose to use light emitting diodes (LEDs) as backlight sources in LCD panels. Use of LEDs as backlight sources in LCD panels provides a lot of advantages; for example, the LCD panels can be made to have a smaller size, a longer service life, a shorter response time, a lower power consumption and much better color performance than the conventional cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the LED technologies advance continuously, requirements on dimming performance of LEDs become increasingly stricter. In the conventional LED dimming drive devices, generally a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal is output to each of a plurality of dimming control circuits simultaneously, so as to control the dimming control circuits simultaneously. In practical implementations, the LEDs are turned on or off by using the PWM signal to control a dimmer switch in each of the dimming control circuit to be turned on or off, and the dimmer switch may be implemented by a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hereinafter, one dimming control circuit will be taken as an example to illustrate a dimming process in the prior art. When a PWM signal inputted into a certain dimming control circuit is at a high level, the dimmer switch in the dimming control circuit will be turned on by the high-level PWM signal to switch on an LED which connected with the dimming control circuit; conversely, when the PWM signal is at a low level, the dimmer switch in the dimming control circuit is turned off by the low-level PWM signal so as to switch off the LED which connected with the dimming control circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the prior art, LEDs in all LED paths are switched on simultaneously, so a large amount of energy must be provided for the whole LED light emitting system within a short time. This may cause loud noises and strong electromagnetic interferences (EMI) and even instable operation of the PWM power supply system.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It shall be understood that, the embodiments described herein are only intended to illustrate but not to limit the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a schematic structural view of an LED dimming drive device according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The LED dimming drive device according to this embodiment of the present disclosure comprises a delay setting circuit <b>10</b> and a plurality of dimming control circuits <b>20</b>. The delay setting circuit <b>10</b> is configured to set a different delay time for each of the dimming control circuits <b>20</b>. Each of the dimming control circuits <b>20</b> further comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">a dimmer switch <b>21</b>, being configured to control a corresponding LED path to be switched on or off;</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">a clock delay circuit <b>22</b>, being configured to receive a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal, count the time according to the delay time, and output the PWM signal to the dimmer switch <b>21</b> when the delay time expires.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this embodiment, by setting a different delay time for each of the dimming control circuits <b>20</b> respectively, each of the clock delay circuits <b>20</b> corresponds to a different relay time respectively. Then, as the respective delay times expire, the clock delay circuits <b>22</b> will output PWM signals at different times respectively; i.e., the PWM signals are transmitted to control terminals of the dimmer switches <b>21</b> at different times, so the dimmer switches <b>21</b> will not be turned on simultaneously. As compared to the prior art, the embodiment of the present disclosure effectively avoids the noises or EMI that would otherwise occur when transmitting a large amount of energy into the LED paths to turn on the dimmer switches <b>21</b> simultaneously, thus ensuring stable operation of the PWM power supply system.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a schematic structural view of a clock delay circuit in the LED dimming drive device according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment, the clock delay time <b>22</b> further comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">a counter <b>221</b>, being configured to count the time according to the delay time when the PWM signal is transmitted to the clock delay circuit <b>22</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">a PWM signal delay module <b>222</b>, being configured to receive the PWM signal and output the PWM signal to the dimmer switch <b>21</b> when the delay time of the counter <b>221</b> expires.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this embodiment, each clock delay circuit <b>22</b> corresponds to one counter <b>221</b>, and a different delay time is set for each counter <b>221</b> via the delay setting circuit <b>10</b> respectively. Then, when the PWM signal is transmitted to the clock delay circuit <b>22</b>, the counter <b>221</b> begins to count, and once the delay time which is preset for the counter <b>221</b> of the clock delay circuit <b>22</b> expires, the PWM signal delay module <b>222</b> outputs a high-level PWM signal to the dimmer switch <b>21</b> of the corresponding circuit to turn on the dimmer switch <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to this embodiment, by using different delay times to control the PWM signal delay modules <b>222</b> to output PWM signals respectively, the PWM signals will be transmitted to control terminals of the dimmer switches <b>21</b> at different times. This effectively avoids the noises or EMI that would otherwise occur when transmitting a large amount of energy into the LED paths to turn on the dimmer switches <b>21</b> simultaneously, thus ensuring stable operation of the PWM power supply system.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a schematic structural view of an LED dimming drive device according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this embodiment, the LED dimming drive device comprises a delay setting circuit <b>110</b> and a plurality of dimming control circuits <b>120</b>. Each of the dimming control circuits <b>120</b> further comprises a dimmer switch <b>121</b> and a clock delay circuit <b>122</b>. Both functions and structures of the dimmer switch <b>121</b> and the clock delay circuit <b>122</b> are the same as those described in the first embodiment, so they will not be further described again herein.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each of the dimming control circuits <b>120</b> in the LED dimming drive device of this embodiment further comprises a first discharge suppression circuit <b>123</b> connected with the dimmer switch <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The first discharge suppression circuit <b>123</b> is configured to cut off a discharging circuit presented by a parasitic capacitor of the dimmer switch <b>121</b> to the clock delay circuit <b>122</b> when the LED path is switched off.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this embodiment, the dimmer switch <b>121</b> may be a high-voltage MOS transistor which can withstand a voltage of 60-500V or higher. The first discharge suppression circuit <b>123</b> can suppress the discharging of the clock delay circuit <b>122</b> caused by the parasitic capacitor of the high-voltage MOS transistor. The first discharge suppression circuit <b>123</b> comprises a follower. A power supply terminal of the follower is adapted to receive the delayed PWM signal for controlling the follower to be turned on or off. The delayed PWM signal is also inputted to an in-phase input of the follower, and an output of the follower is connected with a grid of the high-voltage MOS transistor to output a control signal that is in phase with the PWM signal, so that the high-voltage MOS transistor is controlled to be turned on or off.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this embodiment, the follower is turned off when the PWM signal is at a low level, so it is impossible for the parasitic capacitor of the high-voltage MOS transistor to be discharged through the clock delay circuit <b>122</b> in which the follower is located. Thus, the energy loss and noises caused by the discharging of the parasitic capacitor is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, the dimming control circuit <b>120</b> in the LED dimming drive device of this embodiment may further comprise a second discharge suppression circuit <b>124</b> connected with the dimmer switch <b>121</b>. The second discharge suppression circuit <b>124</b> is configured to cut off a discharging circuit presented by the parasitic capacitor of the dimming switch <b>121</b> to the dimmer switch <b>121</b> when the LED path is switched off.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment, the dimmer switch <b>121</b> is a high-voltage MOS transistor, and the second discharge suppression circuit comprises a low-voltage MOS transistor (which can withstand a voltage of lower than 60V). A grid of the low-voltage MOS transistor is adapted to receive the delayed PWM signal for controlling the low-voltage MOS transistor to be turned on or off. A drain of the low-voltage MOS transistor is connected to a source of the high-voltage MOS transistor, and a source of the low-voltage MOS transistor is grounded. The low-voltage MOS transistor is turned off and a source of the high-voltage MOS transistor is open when the PWM signal is at a low level, so it is impossible for the grid of the high-voltage MOS transistor to be discharged via the grounding circuit by the parasitic capacitor. This ensures that the LED path is completely cut off by securely turning off the high-voltage MOS transistor, thus further avoiding the energy loss and noises caused by the discharging of the parasitic capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a circuit diagram of the LED dimming drive device according to the second embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment, three LED dimming paths are described as an example, and the delay setting circuit <b>110</b> is implemented as a delay setting circuit DSC in this embodiment. Counters in the clock delay circuit include three counters (CT <b>10</b>, CT <b>20</b>, CT <b>30</b>). The PWM signal delay module in the clock delay circuit comprises three timing switcher SW<b>10</b>, SW<b>20</b> and SW<b>30</b>. The dimming switch <b>121</b> further comprises a high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>11</b>, a high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>21</b> and a high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the LED dimming drive device of this embodiment, each of the clock delay circuit DSC is provided with timing switches SW<b>10</b>, SW<b>20</b> and SW <b>30</b> corresponding to the counters Counter <b>10</b>, Counter <b>20</b>, Counter <b>30</b> respectively. The delay setting circuit DSC sets a different delay time for each of the counters Counter <b>10</b>, Counter <b>20</b> and Counter <b>30</b> respectively. Then, when the PWM signals are transmitted to the counters Counter <b>10</b>, Counter <b>20</b>, Counter <b>30</b> respectively, the counters begin to count the time according to respective preset delay times. Once the delay time of a counter expires, the timing switch corresponding to the counter will be turned on so that the corresponding PWM signal is output to a subsequent section of the circuit. For example, if a delay time of 16 ms is preset for the counter Counter <b>10</b>, a delay time of 32 ms is preset for the counter Counter <b>20</b> and a delay time of 48 ms is preset for the counter Counter <b>30</b>, then when the delay time of 16 ms of the counter Counter <b>10</b> expires, the timing switch SW<b>10</b> is turned on so that the PWM signal is outputted to a path where the high-voltage MOS transistor is located. On the other hand, the counters Counter <b>20</b> and Counter <b>30</b> are still clocking the time until their respective delay times expire.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">By ensuring that the PWM signal are not transmitted to the PWM clock delay circuits synchronously, this embodiment effectively avoids the noises or EMI that would otherwise occur when transmitting a large amount of energy into the LED paths to turn on the high-voltage MOS transistors Q<b>11</b>, Q<b>21</b> and Q<b>31</b> simultaneously, thus ensuring stable operation of the PWM power supply system.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">This embodiment is further able to suppress the discharging that occurs via the parasitic capacitors C<b>10</b>, C<b>20</b> and C<b>30</b> of the high-voltage MOS transistors Q<b>11</b>, Q<b>21</b> and Q<b>31</b>. The first discharging suppression circuits described above comprise followers U<b>10</b>, U<b>20</b> and U<b>30</b> respectively, and the second discharging suppression circuits described above comprise low-voltage MOS transistors Q<b>12</b>, Q<b>22</b> and Q<b>32</b> respectively. Taking the first PWM clock delay circuit and the first LED path as an example, an in-phase input of the follower U<b>10</b> receives the delayed PWM signal, an inverting input of the follower U<b>10</b> is connected to an output of the follower, and the output of the follower U<b>10</b> is connected to a grid of the high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>11</b> to output a pulse control signal in phase with the PWM signal for controlling the high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>11</b> to be turned on or off. The PWM signal is also outputted to a power supply terminal of the follower U<b>10</b> to control the follower U<b>10</b> to be turned on or off. When the PWM signal is at a high level, the follower U<b>10</b> is turned on to output a high-level pulse control signal so that the high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>11</b> is turned on. Conversely, when the PWM signal is at a low level, the follower U<b>10</b> is turned off and, correspondingly, the path in which the follower U<b>10</b> is located is cut off, which makes it impossible for the parasitic capacitor C<b>10</b> of the high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>11</b> to be discharged through the circuit where the follower U<b>10</b> is located; consequently, the energy loss and noises caused by the discharging of the parasitic capacitor C<b>10</b> is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Additionally, a grid of the low-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>12</b> also receives the delayed PWM signal for controlling the low-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>12</b> to be turned on or off. A drain of the low-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>12</b> is connected to a source of the high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>11</b>, and a source of the low-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>12</b> is grounded. When the PWM signal is at a high level, the low-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>12</b> is turned off and a source of the high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>11</b> is grounded, so this circuit can operate normally. On the other hand, when the PWM signal is at a low level, the low-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>12</b> is turned off and the source of the high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>11</b> is open, so it is impossible for the grid of the high-voltage MOS transistor Q<b>11</b> to be discharged via the grounding circuit by the parasitic capacitor C<b>10</b>. This ensures that the LED path is completely cut off by securely turning off the high-voltage MOS transistor, thus further avoiding the energy loss and noises caused by the discharging of the parasitic capacitor C<b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown a flowchart diagram of an LED dimming drive method according to a third embodiment of the present disclosure. The LED dimming drive method of this embodiment comprises the follow steps.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Step S<b>10</b>: setting a different delay time for each of a plurality of dimming control circuits and starting to count the time, and meanwhile, connecting a PWM signal to each of the dimming control circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this embodiment, this step further comprises: setting a different delay time for a counter of each of the dimming control circuits; and controlling the counter to count the time according to the delay time when the PWM signal is transmitted to the counter.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Step S<b>20</b>: outputting the PWM signal to a dimmer switch of the dimming control circuit when the delay time of the dimming control circuit expires.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this embodiment, the PWM signal is a dimming signal for driving the dimmer switch in each of the dimming control circuits so that the LED path corresponding to the dimming switch can be switched on or off. When the delay time of the counter expires, the dimming control circuit is turned on and the PWM signal is transmitted to a control terminal of the dimmer switch to control the dimmer switch to be turned on or off. If the PWM signal is at a high level, then the dimmer switch is turned on so that the LED path is switched on; and conversely, if the PWM signal is at a low level, then the dimmer switch is turned off so that the LED path is switched off. In this way, this embodiment effectively avoids the noises or EMI that would otherwise occur when transmitting a large amount of energy into the LED paths to turn on the dimmer switches simultaneously, thus ensuring stable operation of the PWM power supply system.</p>
