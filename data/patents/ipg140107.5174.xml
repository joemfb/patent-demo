<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">White light and excitation light are applied to an internal body part. An electronic endoscope captures a normal image of the internal body part irradiated with the white light, and a special image of autofluorescence emitted from living body tissue of the internal body part irradiated with the excitation light. An object distance detector detects an object distance between a CCD and an inspection area of the internal body part based on the normal image. A binning processing section applies a binning process to the special image. There are two types of binning processes, i.e. an intensity adjustment process and a resolution adjustment process. In the intensity adjustment process, the binning number is increased with increase in the object distance. In the resolution adjustment process, the binning number is decreased with increase in the object distance. Which process to perform is determined by operation on a processing type selector.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electronic endoscope system having a special imaging function such as autofluorescence imaging (AFI) and narrow band imaging (NBI).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description Related to the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a medical field, diagnosis and treatment using an electronic endoscope system are widely carried out in recent years. In the electronic endoscope system, while white light (normal light), which ranges from a blue wavelength band to a red wavelength band, is applied to the inside of a patient's body cavity, an image sensor such as a CCD captures an image of the light reflected from an internal body part. The captured image is displayed on a monitor. The electronic endoscope system can image the inside of the human body cavity in real time, and facilitates the accurate diagnosis and the effective treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The image (normal image) captured under the normal light shows an overview of the internal body part, but cannot clearly show a capillary blood vessel, an underlying blood vessel, a pit pattern, and irregularities in surface tissue such as a depression or a lump. Since a pathologic lesion is sometimes hidden in such a portion or tissue, it is desired that the capillary blood vessel or the irregularities can be clearly seen in an endoscopic image.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a method for imaging a tumor lesion including a cancer, for example, autofluorescence imaging (AFI) is known as described in US Application Publication No. 2009/0036743 (corresponding to Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2009-34224). In the AFI, special light having a specific wavelength is applied as excitation light to the internal body part, and the image sensor captures an image of autofluorescence that is emitted from an endogenous fluorescent substance of living body tissue in response to the excitation light. According to the AFI, the intensity of the autofluorescence emitted from tumor tissue is weaker than that from normal tissue. Through the use of this property, the tumor lesion is colored differently from a normal portion in a special image. Thus, the tumor lesion is clearly distinguished in the special image, though it is hard to see in the normal image.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Narrow band imaging (NBI) is also known as a method for clearly imaging a superficial blood vessel, which is positioned in the shallow depth of the living body tissue, by application of special light having wavelengths in a specific narrow band, as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-170009. In the NBI, the superficial blood vessel is distinguished by taking advantage of a light absorbing property of the blood vessel that occurs upon application of the special light and a light scattering property of the living body tissue around the blood vessel. The special image facilitates finding out a lesion that is hard to find out in the normal image.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a special imaging function such as the AFI and NBI, there is a need to obtain an optimal endoscopic image in accordance with various purposes of the image diagnosis. For example, in the case of trying to find out the lesion in the bright endoscopic image on a whole, the image requires enough intensity even in a far view in which a distal end portion of an electronic endoscope is away from the body part to be imaged. In the case of trying to find out the lesion from a minute portion of the image such as a clot in the blood vessel, the image requires resolution high enough to clearly discern the minute portion even in the far view. However, neither the US Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0036743 nor the Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-170009 discloses or even suggests an electronic endoscope system that can obtain an optimal endoscopic image in accordance with various purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide an electronic endoscope system that can obtain an optimal image in accordance with various purposes during performing a special imaging function including autofluorescence imaging (AFI) or narrow band imaging (NBI).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An electronic endoscope system according to the present invention includes a light source device, an electronic endoscope, an object distance detector, a binning processing section, and a binning processing control section. The light source device applies to an internal body part illumination light including special light in a specific wavelength band. The electronic endoscope captures an endoscopic image of the internal body part irradiated with the illumination light by using an image sensor. The endoscopic image includes a special image captured under the special light. The object distance detector detects from the endoscopic image an object distance being a distance between the image sensor and an inspection area of the internal body part. The binning processing section applies a binning process to the special image. The binning processing control section determines a binning number used in the binning process in accordance with the object distance.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The special light may be excitation light for exciting autofluorescence from living body tissue of the internal body part. The special image may be an autofluorescence image that captures autofluorescence emitted from the internal body part irradiated with the excitation light.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The binning processing control section preferably increases the binning number with increase in the object distance, and decreases the binning number with decrease in the object distance, in order to adjust intensity of the autofluorescence image. Furthermore, the binning processing control section preferably decreases the binning number with increase in the object distance, and increases the binning number with decrease in the object distance, in order to adjust resolution of the autofluorescence image.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The special light may be NBI light for distinguishing a specific portion including a superficial blood vessel, and the special image may be an NBI image of the internal body part irradiated with the NBI light. In another case, the special light may be narrow band light used for obtaining blood vessel information including a depth of a blood vessel and blood oxygen saturation. The narrow band light includes two types of light having first and second wavelengths. Absorbance of reduced hemoglobin differs from that of oxygenated hemoglobin at each of the first and second wavelengths, and an amount of difference in the absorbance between the reduced hemoglobin and the oxygenated hemoglobin at the first wavelength differs from that at the second wavelength. The special image may be a blood vessel information image of the internal body part irradiated with the narrow band light.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The binning processing control section may increase the binning number with increase in the object distance between a near view having a short object distance and a far view having a long object distance. Also, the binning processing control section may set the binning number larger in a tight close-up state than that in a close-up state. The image sensor is extremely near the inspection area of the internal body part in the tight close-up state, and the image sensor is slightly away from the inspection area in the close-up state as compared to the tight close-up state.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The electronic endoscope system may further include an imaging mode switching section for switching the electronic endoscope system to a special imaging mode. The special imaging mode includes an AFI mode for capturing an autofluorescence image that captures autofluorescence emitted from living body tissue in response to the excitation light applied from the light source device to the internal body part, an NBI mode for capturing an NBI image in which a specific portion including a superficial blood vessel is distinguished by applying the NBI light from the light source device to the internal body part, and a blood vessel information obtaining mode for capturing an image of blood vessel information including a depth of a blood vessel and blood oxygen saturation by applying the narrow band light from the light source device to the internal body part. The binning processing control section preferably determines the binning number in accordance with a type of the special imaging mode and the object distance.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The binning processing section may perform a software binning process in which the special image is constituted of plural pixel groups each of which includes plural adjoining pixels, and intensity of each pixel group corresponds with a sum of intensity of the pixels contained in the pixel group. In another case, the binning processing section may perform a hardware binning process in which the image sensor is constituted of plural pixel groups each which includes plural adjoining pixels, and the image sensor is controlled so as to output a single imaging signal on a pixel group basis. In either case, the binning number is a number of the pixels contained in each pixel group.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The illumination light may include normal light being white light ranging from a blue wavelength band to a red wavelength band. The endoscopic image may include a normal image of the internal body part irradiated with the normal light. The object distance detector may obtain the object distance from the normal image. Furthermore, the object distance detector may detect an exposure amount from the normal image, and calculates the object distance in accordance with the detected exposure amount.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The electronic endoscope system may further include a motion detector for detecting motion of the inspection area of the internal body part from a plurality of the endoscopic images, a frame addition section for applying a frame addition process to a plurality of the special images to produce a single high-quality special image, and a frame addition control section for determining a number of frames to be added in the frame addition process in accordance with the motion of the inspection area detected by the motion detector.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the present invention, when the binning process is applied to the special image such as the autofluorescence image, the binning number is determined in accordance with the object distance, which has an influence on the intensity and resolution of the special image. Therefore, it is possible to produce an optimal image that is adequate for its purpose.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An electronic endoscope system <b>10</b> of a first embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, has an autofluorescence imaging (AFI) function for imaging autofluorescence emitted from living body tissue inside a patient's body cavity. The electronic endoscope system <b>10</b> is provided with an electronic endoscope <b>11</b>, an over-tube <b>13</b>, a hood <b>14</b>, a processor device <b>15</b>, a normal light source device <b>16</b>, a special light source device <b>17</b>, and a monitor <b>18</b>. The electronic endoscope <b>11</b> captures an image inside the patient's body cavity with an image sensor such as a CCD. Into the over-tube <b>13</b>, an insert section <b>20</b> of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> is inserted. The hood <b>14</b> is attached to a distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the insert section <b>20</b>. The processor device <b>15</b> produces an endoscopic image of the internal body part based on a signal obtained by the CCD. The normal light source device <b>16</b> supplies white light (normal light) to irradiate the internal body part therewith. The special light source device <b>17</b> supplies excitation light (special light) that excites the autofluorescence from the living body tissue. The monitor <b>18</b> displays the endoscopic image.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The electronic endoscope <b>11</b> includes the flexible insert section <b>20</b> to be introduced into the patient's body cavity, an operation section <b>21</b> provided on a proximal end of the insert section <b>20</b>, and a universal cord <b>23</b> for connecting the operation section <b>21</b> to both the processor device <b>15</b> and the normal light source device <b>16</b>. At a distal end of the insert section <b>20</b>, there is formed a bending portion <b>24</b>, which is composed of a plurality of joint pieces coupled to one another. The bending portion <b>24</b> flexibly bends up or down or from side to side in response to operation of an angle knob <b>26</b> provided on the operation section <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>is provided at an end of the bending portion <b>24</b>. The distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>contains an optical system for endoscopy and the like. The distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>is aimed at a desired direction inside the body cavity by flexibly bending the bending portion <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>is provided with first and second lighting windows <b>57</b> and <b>59</b> for projecting the white light or the excitation light, an imaging window <b>62</b> for receiving the reflected white light or the autofluorescence from the internal body part, an airing/watering nozzle <b>63</b> for spraying water or ejecting air to the imaging window <b>62</b>, and a medical instrument outlet <b>64</b> from which a medical instrument led through a channel of the insert section <b>20</b> protrudes.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An imaging mode switching button <b>28</b> is provided on the operation section <b>21</b> to switch the electronic endoscope system <b>10</b> between a normal imaging mode for imaging the internal body part with the white light and a special imaging mode for imaging the autofluorescence emitted from the living body tissue upon application of the excitation light. Mode switching information is sent to a system controller <b>113</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the processor device <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the normal imaging mode, a normal image that is an image of the white light reflected from the internal body part is displayed on the monitor <b>18</b>. In the special imaging mode, on the other hand, a special image that is an image of the autofluorescence or a composite image of the normal image and the special image is displayed on the monitor <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A connector <b>30</b> is attached at one end of the universal cord <b>23</b> on the side of the processor device <b>15</b> and the normal light source device <b>16</b>. The connector <b>30</b> is a complex connector that has a communication connector to be coupled to the processor device <b>15</b> and a lighting connector to be coupled to the normal light source device <b>16</b>. The electronic endoscope <b>11</b> is detachably connected to the processor device <b>15</b> and the normal light source device <b>16</b> via the connector <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b>, the hood <b>14</b> attached to the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> is provided with an excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>. The excitation light cut filter <b>32</b> covers the imaging window <b>62</b> provided in the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a</i>, in order to cut off part or all of light in a wavelength band of the excitation light out of light entering into the imaging window <b>62</b>. The excitation light cut filter <b>32</b> cuts off the excitation light with high energy in front of the imaging window <b>62</b>, and prevents the excitation light from entering into a CCD <b>100</b> disposed in the depth of the imaging window <b>62</b>. This is effective at preventing the occurrence of halation by which electric charges become saturated at pixels of the CCD <b>100</b> and an image is bleached out.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The over-tube <b>13</b> includes a tube body <b>35</b>, an insertion channel <b>37</b> provided inside the tube body <b>35</b>, and first and second optical fibers <b>38</b> and <b>39</b>. The insert section <b>20</b> of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> is inserted into the insertion channel <b>37</b>. The first and second optical fibers <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> are disposed on the periphery of the insertion channel <b>37</b> to lead the excitation light from the special light source device <b>17</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The insertion channel <b>37</b> has a proximal opening <b>37</b><i>a </i>being an entrance of the insert section <b>20</b> of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b>, and a distal opening <b>37</b><i>b </i>being an outlet of the insert section <b>20</b>. When the insert section <b>20</b> is introduced into the insertion channel <b>37</b>, the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> with the hood <b>14</b> attached protrudes from the distal opening <b>37</b><i>b</i>. The insert section <b>20</b> of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> is introduced into the patient's body cavity in a state of being inserted in the over-tube <b>13</b>. On the periphery of the hood <b>14</b>, first and second light projection units <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are adhered to project the excitation light from the first and second optical fibers <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> to the internal body part, respectively. Note that, the first optical fiber <b>38</b> and the first light projection unit <b>41</b> are optically coupled by a connector or the like. The second optical fiber <b>39</b> and the second light projection unit <b>42</b> are optically coupled by a connector or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the normal light source device <b>16</b> is constituted of a white light source <b>45</b>, an aperture controller <b>46</b>, a white light controller <b>47</b>, a rotary shutter <b>48</b>, a position detector <b>49</b>, and a rotation controller <b>50</b>. While the normal light source device <b>16</b> is turned on, the white light source <b>45</b> is invariably turned on and emits the white light. The white light is broad band light ranging from the blue wavelength band to the red wavelength band, and, for example, is in a wavelength band of 400 nm to 700 nm as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As the white light source <b>45</b>, a xenon lamp, a halogen lamp, an LED (light-emitting diode), a fluorescent lamp, or an LD (laser diode) is available by way of example. The white light emitted from the white light source <b>45</b> is condensed by a lens <b>53</b>. After that, the condensed white light is incident upon first and second light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> through the aperture controller <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The first and second light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> are composed of optical fibers with a large diameter, or the like. A light incident end of each of the first and second light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> is connected to the normal light source device <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a light exit end of the first light guide <b>55</b> is faced to the first lighting window <b>57</b> of the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b>. Alight exit end of the second light guide <b>56</b> is faced to the second lighting window <b>59</b> of the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The white light is applied to the internal body part through the first or second lighting window <b>57</b> or <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first and second lighting windows <b>57</b> and <b>59</b> are symmetric with respect to the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b> (or the imaging window <b>62</b>) provided in the hood <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an irradiation area WL<b>1</b> of the white light projected from the first lighting window <b>57</b> and an irradiation area WL<b>2</b> of the white light projected from the second lighting window <b>59</b> overlap each other at a white light overlapping area WLR. The distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>is aimed at a target area T such that the target area T is within the white light overlapping area WLR. Thus, the target area T is irradiated with the white light enough and uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The hood <b>14</b> covers only the imaging window <b>62</b> of the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a</i>, and exposes the remaining portion of the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>to the outside in the body cavity. Thus, the hood <b>14</b> does not hinder the application of the white light from the first and second lighting windows <b>57</b> and <b>59</b>. The air or water is sprayed from the airing/watering nozzle <b>63</b> to the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b> of the hood <b>14</b>. The medical instrument protrudes from the medical instrument outlet <b>64</b> inside the body cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the aperture controller <b>46</b> disposed between the lens <b>53</b> and the rotary shutter <b>48</b> adjusts the amount of the white light emitted from the white light source <b>45</b>. The aperture controller <b>46</b> is composed of, for example, plural blades for varying the size of an aperture, a motor for moving the blades, and the like. A set value of the aperture controller <b>46</b>, that is, the amount of the white light to be passed through the aperture is controlled by the white light controller <b>47</b> via a driver <b>47</b><i>a</i>. The white light controller <b>47</b> controls the set value (the white light amount) based on the endoscopic image, which is obtained after signal processing by the processor device <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the disc-shaped rotary shutter <b>48</b> has a sectorial cutout. The cutout of the rotary shutter <b>48</b> composes a light transmitting portion <b>48</b><i>a </i>for transmitting the white light. The remaining portion of the rotary shutter <b>48</b> composes a light shielding portion <b>48</b><i>b </i>for cutting out the white light. The rotary shutter <b>48</b> is coupled to a rotation axis <b>70</b><i>a </i>of the motor <b>70</b> disposed in parallel with an optical axis of the white light source <b>45</b>. Since the rotary shutter <b>48</b> rotates by a drive of the motor <b>70</b>, the light transmitting portion <b>48</b><i>a </i>and the light shielding portion <b>48</b><i>b </i>are alternately situated in an optical path P of the white light.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The position detector <b>49</b>, composed of a photosensor or the like, detects which of the light transmitting portion <b>48</b><i>a </i>and the light shielding portion <b>48</b><i>b </i>is situated in the optical path P. Note that, in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>6</b>A, and <b>6</b>B, the position detector <b>49</b> is disposed in the vicinity of the rotary shutter <b>48</b> in such a position as to face a side edge of the rotary shutter <b>48</b>, but may be disposed in another position. For example, the position detector <b>49</b> may be disposed so as to face a surface of the rotary shutter <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, when the light transmitting portion <b>48</b><i>a </i>is situated in the optical path P, the white light is incident upon the first and second light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>. Thus, the internal body part is irradiated with the white light. This period is referred to as a first period. On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, when the light shielding portion <b>48</b><i>b </i>is situated in the optical path P, the white light is not incident upon the first and second light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>. Thus, the internal body part is shielded from the white light. This period is referred to as a second period. The position detector <b>49</b> appropriately sends information about the first and second periods to an excitation light controller <b>75</b> of the special light source device <b>17</b> and the system controller <b>113</b> of the processor device <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The durations of the first and second periods depend on the selected imaging mode. The durations of the first and second periods in the special imaging mode are twice as long as those in the normal imaging mode. In other words, the rotation controller <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> controls the rotary shutter <b>48</b> in the special imaging mode at a rotation speed half of that in the normal imaging mode. The rotation controller <b>50</b> controls the rotation speed of the rotary shutter <b>48</b> via a driver <b>50</b><i>a </i>connected to the motor <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the special light source device <b>17</b> includes first and second excitation light sources <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> and an excitation light controller <b>75</b>. Each of the first and second excitation light sources <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> is composed of a light emitting diode or the like, and emits the excitation light having wavelengths of 405&#xb1;10 nm, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. By irradiating the internal body part with the excitation light in such a wavelength band, the autofluorescence having wavelengths of 420 nm to 650 nm is emitted from an endogenous fluorescent substance in the living body tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the special imaging mode, the excitation light is invariably emitted from the first and second excitation light sources <b>72</b> and <b>73</b>. Thus, the living body tissue invariably emits the autofluorescence. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to a light transmission characteristic of the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>, transmittance of short wavelength light having a wavelength of 415 nm or less is approximately zero. Accordingly, the excitation light reflected back to the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> is cut by the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>. The amount of the autofluorescence is much smaller than that of the white light. For these reasons, the excitation light and the autofluorescence hardly exerts an influence upon the normal image, even if the normal image is obtained in the presence of the excitation light and the autofluorescence in addition to the white light inside the patient's body cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The excitation light controller <b>75</b> controls the light emission amount of the first and second excitation light sources <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> via drivers <b>75</b><i>a </i>and <b>75</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The excitation light controller <b>75</b> is connected to the white light controller <b>74</b>, and controls the emission amount of the excitation light in accordance with the control of the emission amount of the white light by the white light controller <b>47</b>. The emission amount of the excitation light is in correlation with the emission amount of the white light. The emission amount of the excitation light is changed such that the ratio between the emission amount of the excitation light and the emission amount of the white light is kept at 1/10, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, when the emission amount of the white light is changed, the emission amount of the excitation light is automatically and correspondingly changed. Thus, the exposure balance between the normal image and the special image is always maintained in an appropriate state. Note that, the emission amount of the excitation light may be controlled at switching timing from the first period to the second period so as to have a predetermined correlation between the white light and the excitation light, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, instead of being controlled in conjunction with the control of the emission amount of the white light.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The excitation light from the first excitation light source <b>72</b> is incident upon the first optical fiber <b>38</b> of the over-tube <b>13</b>. The excitation light from the second excitation light source <b>73</b> is incident upon the second optical fiber <b>39</b> of the over-tube <b>13</b>. Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the excitation light transmitted through the first optical fiber <b>38</b> is ejected from the first light projection unit <b>41</b> of the hood <b>14</b>. The excitation light transmitted through the second optical fiber <b>39</b> is ejected from the second light projection unit <b>42</b> of the hood <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As with the first and second lighting windows <b>57</b> and <b>59</b> provided in the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a</i>, the first and second light projection units <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are symmetric with respect to the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b> (or the imaging window <b>62</b>) of the hood <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an irradiation area EL<b>1</b> of the excitation light emitted from the first light projection unit <b>41</b> and an irradiation area EL<b>2</b> of the excitation light emitted from the second light projection unit <b>42</b> overlap each other at an excitation light overlapping area ELR. Furthermore, the excitation light overlapping area ELR is contained in the white light overlapping area WLR at which the two white light irradiation areas WL<b>1</b> and WL<b>2</b> overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Since the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>is aimed at the target area T such that the target area T is enclosed within the excitation light overlapping area ELR of the excitation light irradiation areas EL<b>1</b> and EL<b>2</b>, the target area T is irradiated enough and uniformly with the excitation light. Therefore, if the entire target area T is formed of normal tissue, the autofluorescence is emitted at substantially the same intensity from the entire target area T. Furthermore, since the excitation light overlapping area ELR is contained in the white light overlapping area WLR, the ratio between the white light amount and the excitation light amount is kept at constant throughout the target area T.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first light projection unit <b>41</b> includes a light diffusing member <b>90</b>, a tubular sleeve member <b>91</b> for covering the periphery of the light diffusing member <b>90</b>, a protective glass plate <b>92</b> for sealing one end of the sleeve member <b>91</b>, and a ferrule <b>93</b> fitted into the sleeve member <b>91</b> to hold the first optical fiber <b>38</b>. The first optical fiber <b>38</b> extends from a rear end of the ferrule <b>93</b> in a state of being covered with a jacket. The first optical fiber <b>38</b> with the jacket is covered with a flexible sleeve <b>95</b>, which is inserted in the sleeve member <b>91</b>. Since the configuration of the second light projection unit <b>42</b> is the same as that of the first light projection unit <b>41</b>, the description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The light diffusing member <b>90</b> is made of a transparent resin material that diffuses the excitation light from the first optical fiber <b>38</b>. In addition to the transparent resin material, transparent ceramic, glass, or the like is available. The light diffusing member <b>90</b> may have a light diffusing layer, which has minute bumps and dips or is made of a mixture of particles with different refractive indexes (such as filler), in its surface or the middle. In another case, the light diffusing member <b>90</b> may be made of a semitransparent material. The light diffusing member <b>90</b> uniformalizes the emission amount of the excitation light by the action of polarization and diffusion. Thus, the irradiation area EL<b>1</b> and emission amount of the excitation light projected from the first light projection unit <b>41</b> are adjustable by appropriately changing the material and composition of the light diffusing member <b>90</b>. In another case, the irradiation area EL<b>1</b> and emission amount of the excitation light projected from the first light projection unit <b>41</b> may be adjusted by appropriately changing a lens or the protective glass plate <b>92</b>, instead of or in addition to changing the material and composition of the light diffusing member <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> is provided with the CCD <b>100</b>, an analog frontend processor (AFE) <b>104</b>, and an imaging controller <b>106</b>. The CCD <b>100</b> receives on its imaging surface <b>100</b><i>a </i>light that has transmitted through the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>, the imaging window <b>62</b>, and a condenser lens <b>102</b>. The CCD <b>100</b> performs photoelectric conversion of the light received on its imaging surface <b>100</b><i>a</i>, and accumulates signal charges. The accumulated signal charges are read out as an imaging signal. The readout imaging signal is sent to the AFE <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The CCD <b>100</b> is a color CCD having three color pixels of R-, G-, and B-pixels with R, G, and B color filters, respectively, arranged in its imaging surface <b>100</b><i>a</i>. Since the white light ranges from the blue wavelength band to the red wavelength band, all of the R-, G-, and B-pixels react to the white light incident upon the imaging surface <b>100</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the imaging signal obtained in receiving the white light contains an R imaging signal outputted from the R-pixels, a G imaging signal outputted from the G-pixels, and a B imaging signal outputted from the B-pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the other hand, the autofluorescence is substantially in a green wavelength band, though it partly ranges to the blue or red wavelength band. For this reason, the G-pixels certainly react to the autofluorescence incident upon the imaging surface <b>100</b><i>a</i>. In other words, the imaging signal obtained in receiving the autofluorescence contains at least the G imaging signal.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The AFE <b>104</b> includes a correlated double sampling circuit (CDS) and an automatic gain controller (AGC). The CDS applies a correlated double sampling process to the imaging signal from the CCD <b>100</b>, to remove noise, which is caused by the drive of the CCD <b>100</b>, from the imaging signal. The AGC amplifies the imaging signal after the noise removal by the CDS.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The imaging controller <b>106</b> controls the imaging operation of the CCD <b>100</b>. Following the control by the imaging controller <b>106</b>, the imaging signal is outputted from the AFE <b>104</b> at a predetermined frame rate. The imaging controller <b>106</b> is connected to the system controller <b>113</b> of the processor device <b>15</b>. Thus, the imaging controller <b>106</b> appropriately changes its control method in accordance with the imaging mode and the like that the system controller <b>113</b> recognizes at the time of imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the normal imaging mode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, a normal image capture step (NI) for performing the photoelectric conversion of the white light and accumulating the signal charges is carried out in the first period. Then, in synchronization with a turn from the first period to the second period, an imaging signal readout pulse is sent from the imaging controller <b>106</b> to the CCD <b>100</b>. Upon receiving the imaging signal readout pulse, the signal charges accumulated in the CCD <b>100</b> are outputted to the AFE <b>104</b> as a normal imaging signal. Then, taking a turn from the second period to the first period, the normal image capture step (NI) is carried out again. The above sequential operation is repeated as long as the electronic endoscope system <b>10</b> is set in the normal imaging mode.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the special imaging mode, on the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the normal image capture step (NI) for performing the photoelectric conversion of the white light and accumulating the signal charges is carried out in a first half of the first period. Then, the imaging signal readout pulse is sent from the imaging controller <b>106</b> to the CCD <b>100</b> in the middle of the first period. Upon receiving the imaging signal readout pulse, the signal charges accumulated in the CCD <b>100</b> are outputted to the AFE <b>104</b> as the normal imaging signal. Since the excitation light is always applied, only the autofluorescence is incident on the CCD <b>100</b> soon after the start of the readout of the normal imaging signal. Then, the CCD <b>100</b> carries out a special image capture step (SI) for performing the photoelectric conversion of the autofluorescence and accumulating the signal charges. Although the intensity of the autofluorescence is weak, the CCD <b>100</b> can certainly receive a sufficient amount of the autofluorescence enough to form a special image, because the duration of the second period in the special imaging mode is twice as long as that in the normal imaging mode.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">After a lapse of predetermined time from the turn to the second period, the imaging signal readout pulse is sent from the imaging controller <b>106</b> to the CCD <b>100</b>. In response to it, the signal charges accumulated in the CCD <b>100</b> are outputted to the AFE <b>104</b> as a special imaging signal.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The processor device <b>15</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is electrically connected to the electronic endoscope <b>11</b>, the normal light source device <b>16</b>, the special light source device <b>17</b>, the monitor <b>18</b>, a keyboard (not shown), a printer (not shown), and the like to perform centralized control of the electronic endoscope system <b>10</b>. The processor device <b>15</b> includes a signal processor <b>110</b>, a frame memory <b>112</b>, and the system controller <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The signal processor <b>110</b>, which includes an A/D converter <b>115</b>, a tone correction section <b>116</b>, and an image processing section <b>117</b>, applies various processes to the imaging signal outputted from the AFE <b>104</b> of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> to produce a picture signal to be displayed on the monitor <b>18</b>. Based on this picture signal, images of various types are displayed on the monitor <b>18</b>. Note that, each of the tone correction section <b>116</b> and the image processing section <b>117</b> is composed of, for example, a software program for making a computer carry out appropriate processing, a memory device such as an EPROM (erasable programmable ROM) for storing the software program, and the like. The frame memory <b>112</b> stores digital image data after the A/D conversion and the picture signal after being processed by the image processing section <b>117</b> temporarily or whenever the data or picture signal is updated.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The A/D converter <b>115</b> converts the imaging signal from the AFE <b>104</b> to the digital image data. The image data contains a B component produced from the B imaging signal, a G component produced from the G imaging signal, and an R component produced from the R imaging signal. The image data after the A/D conversion includes normal image data obtained in both the normal imaging mode and the special imaging mode, and special image data obtained in the special imaging mode.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The tone correction section <b>116</b> and the image processing section <b>117</b> carry out their operation in accordance with a flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The tone correction section <b>116</b> compensates for the B component of the normal and special image data, which is partly or totally cut out by the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, since the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> captures the image through the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b> that partly or totally cuts out a light component in a wavelength band of 415 nm or less, the B component of the normal and special image data, being in a short wavelength band, is cut out. The tone correction section <b>116</b> corrects this B component.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The B component of the normal image data is corrected as follows. First, the following correction expressions (1) and (2) are calculated in advance. In the expressions (1) and (2), B&#x2032; represents the intensity of the B component in the normal image data obtained without attaching the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>, while B represents the intensity of the B component in the normal image data obtained with attaching the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>. The relation between B and B&#x2032; is expressed by the expression (1).
<br/>

Wherein, &#x3b1; represents an intensity cut rate by the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>. Thereby, B&#x2032; is calculated by the expression (2).

</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As indicated by the expression (2), when B and B&#x2032; show a linear relation, the intensity B of the B component in the normal image data obtained with attachment of the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b> is divided by a coefficient &#x3b1;, to obtain the intensity B&#x2032; to which the intensity cut by the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b> is added. Then, the intensity B of the B component in the normal image data is replaced by the intensity B&#x2032;, in order to obtain a normal image substantially the same as that captured without attachment of the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">If B and B&#x2032; show a nonlinear relation, on the other hand, the intensity of the B component may be increased by arithmetic computations such as multiplication, addition, and matrix conversion, for example. The G and R components may be decreased in accordance with the intensity of the B component cut by the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>. Furthermore, in a case where a part of the G component on a short wavelength side is cut by the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b>, the G component is preferably corrected in a like manner.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the image processing section <b>117</b> includes a balance adjustment section <b>120</b>, a sensitization section <b>121</b>, and a gradation processing section <b>122</b>. In the special imaging mode, the balance adjustment section <b>120</b> performs a balance adjustment process between the normal image and the special image using correction data. The correction data is produced from the normal and special images of tumor tissue (a portion where a cancer at an early stage emerges) and normal tissue of an unspecified patient that are captured in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">By the balance adjustment process using the correction data, the contrast between the tumor tissue and the normal tissue in the normal image is equalized to that in the special image. Taking a case where the contrast of the special image is one-fifths of the contrast of the normal image as an example, the balance adjustment section <b>120</b> multiplies the contrast of the special image by five based on the correction data, as the balance adjustment. Since the ratio between the white light emission amount and the excitation light emission amount is kept at constant, as described above, the balance adjustment is carried out with high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The balance between the normal image and the special image is dependent on the characteristics of the CCD <b>100</b> and the like. Accordingly, the function of the balance adjustment is preferably checked at least once before shipment of the electronic endoscope system <b>10</b> or before first use of the electronic endoscope system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">After that, the sensitization section <b>121</b> applies a sensitization process to the special image data. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the sensitization section <b>121</b> includes an object distance detector <b>130</b>, a binning processing section <b>131</b>, and a binning number memory <b>132</b>. The object distance detector <b>130</b> detects an exposure amount from the normal image, and calculates an object distance from the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>containing the CCD <b>100</b> to the internal body part to be imaged (object) based on the detected exposure amount. Here, the object distance is assumed to be short when the exposure amount is large, while the object distance is assumed to be long when the exposure amount is small. Note that, the object distance may be calculated from the special image.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The binning processing section <b>131</b> sensitizes the special image data by application of a software binning process. In the software binning process, adjoining plural pixels are integrated into a single pixel group, and the special image is reconfigured on a pixel group basis. An intensity value of each pixel group refers to an addition of intensity values of all pixels contained in the pixel group. A binning number refers to the number of pixels contained in the single pixel group. The binning number is represented as a multiplication of the number of pixels arranged in a vertical direction and the number of pixels arranged in a horizontal direction, for example, 2&#xd7;2. The binning number is stored in advance in the binning number memory <b>132</b>. Note that, the sensitization process may be applied to the normal image data, in addition to the special image data.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The binning processing section <b>131</b> carries out two types of processes, that is, an intensity adjustment process for adjusting the intensity value of the special image data by the software binning process, and a resolution adjustment process for adjusting the resolution of the special image data by the software binning process. Which of the intensity adjustment process and the resolution adjustment process is performed depends on operation on a processing type selector <b>133</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the intensity adjustment process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the binning number is set small in a near view having the short object distance. The binning number is increased with increase in the object distance. In a far view having the long object distance, the binning number is maximized. With variation from a near state to a far state, in other words, with increase in the object distance, the special image is increasingly lacking in its intensity. However, the lack of the intensity is eliminated because the binning number is increased in accordance with the increase in the object distance.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the resolution adjustment process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the binning number is set at its maximum in the near view. The binning number is decreased with increase in the object distance. In the far view, the binning number reaches its minimum. An image of the object to be inspected becomes small with varying from the near state to the far state, in other words, with increase in the object distance, resulting in deterioration of the visibility of the object. However, decreasing the binning number and improving the resolution can eliminate the deterioration of the visibility.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In this embodiment, the binning number is increased or decreased in accordance with the object distance. Instead of this, a frame addition process may be performed in accordance with a motion of the object. In the frame addition process, the special image data of continuous plural frames is added to produce the high-quality special image data of a single frame. In this frame addition process, the number of frames of the special image data used for producing the high-quality special image data is changed in accordance with the motion of the object. For example, when the object barely moves, the number of frames is increased to improve the image quality of the produced special image data. When the object actively moves, on the other hand, the number of frames is decreased to prevent the occurrence of blurring in the produced special image data.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The binning number may be changed by calculation using a function shown in a graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> or <b>14</b>, or may be changed with the use of a LUT <b>136</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in which the correspondence between the object distance and the binning number is represented. The sensitization section <b>121</b> may decrease the binning number when the object contains high-frequency structure at a high rate, while increase the binning number when the object contains the high-frequency structure at a low rate. When the binning number is large, a high-frequency enhancement process may be carried out. In another case, the binning number may differ between the time of screening and the time of detailed inspection. If the CCD has a high pixel count, the binning process may not be carried out when the high-resolution image is required, though the binning process may be carried out in other cases.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The gradation processing section <b>122</b> carries out a gradation process for converting the normal or special image data into the picture signal displayable on the monitor <b>18</b>. The gradation process includes a gamma correction process and a gradation correction process compatible with the monitor <b>18</b>. According to the gradation process, in the normal imaging mode, the B component of the normal image data is assigned to a B channel of the picture signal, the G component of the normal image data is assigned to a G channel of the picture signal, and the R component of the normal image data is assigned to an R channel of the picture signal.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the special imaging mode, on the other hand, the B component of the normal image data is assigned to the B channel of the picture signal, the R component of the normal image data is assigned to the R channel of the picture signal, and a G component of the special image data is assigned to the G channel of the picture signal. Thereby, a composite image of the normal image and the special image is obtained. The autofluorescence emitted from the normal tissue has a high intensity level, while the autofluorescence emitted from the tumor tissue has a low intensity level. Thus, when capturing an image of the normal tissue, the G component of the special image data has a high signal value. On the other hand, when capturing an image of the tumor tissue, the G component of the special image data has a low signal value. Thereby, when the composite image, in which the G component of the special image data is assigned to the G channel, is displayed on the monitor <b>18</b>, the normal tissue is colored green, while the tumor tissue is colored magenta.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Note that, increase in the object distance becomes one of reasons why the intensity level of the autofluorescence is decreased, besides the presence of the tumor tissue. Thus, the image processing section <b>117</b> compares the intensity level between the G component of the normal image data and the G component of the special image data, before displaying the magenta color on the monitor <b>18</b>. As a result of comparison, if the intensity level is low at both the normal image data and the special image data, it is judged that the decrease in the intensity level is simply caused by the far object distance. A portion with the low intensity level is displayed with green, instead of magenta. If the intensity level of the G component of the normal image data is high while that of the special image data is low, on the other hand, a portion with the low intensity level is judged to be the tumor tissue, and displayed with magenta.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Next, the operation of the present invention will be described. First, the electronic endoscope system <b>10</b> is set to the special imaging mode by operation on the imaging mode switching button <b>28</b>. In the special imaging mode, the white light and the excitation light are applied to the internal body part in the first period, and only the excitation light is applied thereto in the second period. Since the excitation light is applied continuously in both the first and second periods, the autofluorescence is invariably emitted from the living body tissue inside the body cavity. Then, the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> captures the normal image in the first period, and captures the special image mostly in the second period using the CCD <b>100</b>. The captured normal and special imaging signals are sent to the processor device <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the processor device <b>15</b>, the A/D converter <b>115</b> converts each imaging signal into the digital image data. Then, the tone correction section <b>116</b> applies the tone correction process to the obtained image data, and the balance adjustment section <b>120</b> of the image processing section <b>117</b> applies the balance adjustment process using the correction data. After that, the sensitization section <b>121</b> applies the sensitization process, and the gradation processing section <b>122</b> applies the gradation process. Through these processes, the composite image of the normal image and the special image is obtained. The composite image is displayed on the monitor <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The sensitization section <b>121</b> of the image processing section <b>117</b> performs the sensitization process of the special image data by applying the software binning process to the special image. First, the object distance detector <b>130</b> detects the object distance based on the normal image data. After that, the binning processing section <b>131</b> increases or decreases the binning number in accordance with the object distance.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the intensity adjustment mode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the binning number is increased with increase in the object distance. This eliminates the lack of the intensity caused by change from the near state to the far state. In the resolution adjustment mode, on the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the binning number is decreased with increase in the object distance, to improve the resolution. The improvement of the resolution prevents the deterioration in the visibility of the object, which occurs in the far state.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the above embodiment, the software binning process to be applied to the normal image data sent from the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> to the processor device <b>15</b> is carried out. Instead of this, a hardware binning process to be performed by the CCD <b>100</b> of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> may be carried out. In the hardware binning process, when the signal charges are read out from the CCD <b>100</b>, the signal charges of the adjoining plural pixels are added together. The added signal charges are outputted as the imaging signal of the single pixel group. The number of pixels contained in the pixel group is reduced when the object moves little, while the number of pixels contained in the pixel group is increased when the object moves largely.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In a second embodiment of the present invention, an electronic endoscope system <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, carries out narrow band imaging (NBI) in which narrow band light is applied to the internal body part to display a superficial blood vessel with enhancement. The structure of the electronic endoscope system <b>200</b> according to the second embodiment is partly different from that of the electronic endoscope system <b>10</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The electronic endoscope system <b>200</b> is provided with an NBI-specific light source device <b>201</b>, instead of the normal light source device <b>16</b> and the special light source device <b>17</b> of the first embodiment.

The normal light source unit <b>203</b> has structure similar to the normal light source device <b>16</b> of the first embodiment. White light (normal light) from the normal light source unit <b>203</b> is incident upon an optical fiber <b>206</b> in the first period. The white light transmits through the optical fiber <b>206</b>, and is incident upon the light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> through a coupler <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The special light source unit <b>204</b> includes a blue light source <b>208</b> for emitting NBI-specific blue light in a specific narrow wavelength band out of a blue wavelength band, a green light source <b>209</b> for emitting NBI-specific green light in a specific narrow wavelength band out of a green wavelength band, and a light source controller <b>210</b> for controlling these light sources <b>208</b> and <b>209</b> via drives <b>208</b><i>a </i>and <b>209</b><i>a</i>, respectively. It is preferable that the NBI-specific blue light is narrow band light and has a center wavelength of 415 nm, and the NBI-specific green light is narrow band light and has a center wavelength of 540 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The blue light emitted from the blue light source <b>208</b> is incident upon an optical fiber <b>212</b>. The green light emitted from the green light source <b>209</b> is incident upon an optical fiber <b>213</b>. The light transmits through the optical fibers <b>212</b> and <b>213</b>, and is incident upon the light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> through the coupler <b>207</b>. The light source controller <b>210</b> is connected to the position detector <b>49</b> of the normal light source unit <b>203</b>, and controls the blue and green light sources <b>208</b> and <b>209</b> in the second period such that each of the blue and green light is applied for predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the first period, the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> captures an image of the internal body part irradiated with the white light to take the normal image. In the second period, on the other hand, the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> captures an image of the internal body part irradiated with the blue light to take a blue special image, and captures an image of the internal body part irradiated with the green light to take a green special image. The images taken by the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> are sent to the processor device <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The image processing section <b>117</b> of the processor device <b>15</b> carries out the balance adjustment process as in the case of the first embodiment. The image processing section <b>117</b> also carries out an NBI-specific sensitization process and an NBI-specific gradation process. The sensitization section <b>121</b> sets a small binning number in the near view, and increases the binning number with increase in the object distance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The binning number is maximized in the far view. When the object is inspected in more detail, so-called magnification imaging is carried out. In the magnification imaging, the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the insert section <b>20</b> is brought nearer to the object than the near state (i.e. the object distance is shortened), and a magnified image of the object is captured. By the magnification imaging, two types of views including a tight close-up view and a close-up view are capturable depending on the object distance. In the tight close-up view, the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>is brought into a tight close-up state with the nearest possible object distance, and an image is captured in that state. In the close-up view, the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>is brought into a close-up state being farther from the object than the tight close-up state (i.e. the object distance is a little longer than that of the tight close-up state) though is still nearer to the object than the near state. The binning number is slightly increased in the tight close-up state, as compared with the binning number set between the close-up state and the near state. For example, the binning number in the tight close-up state is set at 2&#xd7;2, while the binning number between the close-up state and the near state is set at 1&#xd7;1.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Note that, a technique of varying the binning number between the close-up state and the tight close-up state may be adopted in a magnification endoscope equipped with a zoom function. In this case, a low magnified state refers to a state in which an image is captured with slightly increasing a magnifying power with the object distance set at the near state, and a high magnified state refers to a state in which an image is captured with further increasing the magnifying power with the object distance set at the near state. The binning number is increased in the high magnified state than that in the low magnified state, just as in the case of the tight close-up state and the close-up state.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the NBI, increasing the binning number eliminates the lack of the intensity that is caused by increase in the object distance. Especially, in the NBI, by eliminating the lack of the intensity in the distant view, a brownish area indicating a clot in a blood vessel is easily found out. Furthermore, since the binning number is set slightly larger in the tight close-up view than that in the close-up view, even the minute structure of the object is sharply observable.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">When using the NBI function, the gradation processing section <b>122</b> assigns the blue special image to the B and G channels of the picture signal, and assigns the green special image to the R channel of the picture signal. Thus, a composite image of the blue special image and the green special image is obtained. In this composite image, the superficial blood vessel is distinguished from the other tissue.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The electronic endoscope system <b>230</b> is provided with a light source device <b>231</b> for blood vessel information obtainment, instead of the normal light source device <b>16</b> and the special light source device <b>17</b> of the first embodiment.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The light source device <b>231</b> includes a normal light source unit <b>233</b> and a special light source unit <b>234</b> for obtaining the blood vessel information.

White light (normal light) from the normal light source unit <b>233</b> is incident upon an optical fiber <b>236</b> in the first period. The white light transmits through the optical fiber <b>236</b>, and is incident upon the light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> through a coupler <b>237</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The special light source unit <b>234</b> includes a first narrow band light source <b>238</b>, a second narrow band light source <b>239</b>, a third narrow band light source <b>240</b>, and a light source controller <b>241</b>. The first narrow band light source <b>238</b> emits first narrow band light having a center wavelength of 445 nm. The second narrow band light source <b>239</b> emits second narrow band light having a center wavelength of 472 nm. The third narrow band light source <b>240</b> emits third narrow band light having a center wavelength of 405 nm.

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The electronic endoscope <b>11</b> captures an image of the internal body part irradiated with the white light in the first period to obtain the normal image. In the second period, on the other hand, the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> captures an image of the internal body part irradiated with the first to third narrow band light to obtain first to third special images, respectively. The images obtained by the electronic endoscope <b>11</b> are sent to the processor device <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The image processing section <b>117</b> of the processor device <b>15</b> carries out the balance adjustment process, just as with the first embodiment, and then carries out the sensitization process corresponding to the blood vessel information obtainment function. The sensitization section <b>121</b> applies to the first to third special images the same sensitization process as that of the second embodiment for the NBI. In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the binning number is set small in the near state, and is increased with increase in the object distance. The binning number is maximized in the far state. In the close-up state having the object distance shorter than that in the near state, the binning number is slightly increased with decrease in the object distance.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the third embodiment, the blood vessel has to be sharply displayed in the image to obtain from the first to third special images two types of blood vessel information, that is, the depth of the blood vessel and the blood oxygen saturation. Thus, the application of the binning process, just as with the second embodiment for the NBI, allows obtainment of the blood vessel information with high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The blood vessel information obtaining section <b>232</b> obtains from the first to third special images the two types of blood vessel information including the depth of the blood vessel and the blood oxygen saturation. This blood vessel information is obtained by taking advantage of difference in the absorption spectrum between oxygenated hemoglobin HbO<sub>2 </sub>and the reduced hemoglobin Hb after releasing oxygen, out of hemoglobin contained in a red blood cell in the blood vessel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> of the spectral characteristic of absorbance, the absorbance of the oxygenated hemoglobin HbO<sub>2 </sub>is approximately the same as that of the reduced hemoglobin Hb around 405 nm being the center wavelength of the third narrow band light. The absorbance of the reduced hemoglobin Hb is higher than that of the oxygenated hemoglobin HbO<sub>2 </sub>around 445 nm being the center wavelength of the first narrow band light. The absorbance of the oxygenated hemoglobin HbO<sub>2 </sub>is higher than that of the reduced hemoglobin Hb around 472 nm being the center wavelength of the second narrow band light. The longer the wavelength of light, the deeper the light transmits into a surface of the living body tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Taking advantage of these properties, the two types of blood vessel information, namely, the depth of the blood vessel and the blood oxygen saturation are obtained. To be more specific, the blood vessel information is obtained by the following steps (A) to (C).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(A) Intensity values S<b>1</b> to S<b>3</b> are obtained from the first to third special images, respectively.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(B) The value S<b>1</b> is standardized by the value S<b>3</b>. The value S<b>2</b> is standardized by the value S<b>3</b>. In other words, S<b>1</b>/S<b>3</b> and S<b>2</b>/S<b>3</b> are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">(C) A two-dimensional map as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is produced, in which a scale of S<b>1</b>/S<b>3</b> and a scale of S<b>2</b>/S<b>3</b> are represented by orthogonal two axes. Then, the obtained values S<b>1</b>/S<b>3</b> and S<b>2</b>/S<b>3</b> are plotted on the two-dimensional map. According to the map, the larger the value S<b>1</b>/S<b>3</b>, the shallower the depth of the blood vessel becomes, and the higher the blood oxygen saturation becomes. The smaller the value S<b>1</b>/S<b>3</b>, the deeper the depth of the blood vessel becomes, and the lower the blood oxygen saturation becomes. Also, the larger the value S<b>2</b>/S<b>3</b>, the shallower the depth of the blood vessel becomes, and the lower the blood oxygen saturation becomes. The smaller the value S<b>2</b>/S<b>3</b>, the deeper the depth of the blood vessel becomes, and the higher the blood oxygen saturation becomes. Using this correlation, the information about the blood oxygen saturation and the depth of the blood vessel is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In using the function of obtaining the blood vessel information, the gradation processing section <b>122</b> adds artificial colors to the normal image in accordance with the levels of the blood oxygen saturation and the depth of the blood vessel obtained by the blood vessel information obtaining section <b>232</b>. The normal image with the artificial colors can notify a radiologist or doctor at sight about the levels of the blood oxygen saturation and the depth of the blood vessel. In this embodiment, the third special image is obtained using the third narrow band light having the wavelength of an equal absorbance point, at which absorbance of HbO and HbO<sub>2 </sub>is almost equal, and the intensity value S<b>3</b> obtained from the third special image is used for standardization of S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. However, the intensity value S<b>3</b> used in the standardization may not correspond to the equal absorbance point as long as the intensity value is detectable. The intensity values S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> are obtained using the narrow band light having the two wavelengths between which the magnitude relation of the absorbance between Hb and HbO<sub>2 </sub>is opposite to each other. However, the magnitude relation may not be opposite between the two wavelengths, as long as the absorbance of Hb and HbO<sub>2 </sub>differs at the two wavelengths.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The multi-functional light source device <b>251</b> includes a normal light source unit <b>253</b>, a special light source unit <b>254</b>, and a light source controller <b>255</b>. The normal light source unit <b>253</b> has the same structure as that of the normal light source device <b>16</b> of the first embodiment. White light (normal light) from the normal light source unit <b>253</b> is incident upon an optical fiber <b>256</b> in the first period. The white light transmits through the optical fiber <b>256</b>, and is incident upon the light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> through a coupler <b>257</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The special light source unit <b>254</b> includes the first and second excitation light sources <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> being the same as those of the first embodiment, the blue and green light sources <b>208</b> and <b>209</b> being the same as those of the second embodiment, and the first to third narrow band light sources <b>238</b> to <b>240</b> being the same as those of the third embodiment. The light source controller <b>255</b> is connected to the imaging mode switching button <b>28</b>, and switches among the light sources <b>72</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>209</b>, and <b>238</b> to <b>240</b> contained in the special light source unit <b>254</b> in response to the imaging mode set up by the imaging mode switching button <b>28</b>. In the fourth embodiment, the special imaging mode includes an AFI mode, an NBI mode, and a blood vessel information obtaining mode. The light source controller <b>255</b> is connected to the position detector <b>49</b>, and controls each light source contained in the special light source unit <b>254</b> such that light corresponding to the set imaging mode is appropriately applied in the second period.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Thereby, in the AFI mode, the excitation light is emitted from the first and second excitation light sources <b>72</b> and <b>73</b>. In the NBI mode, the NBI-specific blue light is emitted from the blue light source <b>208</b>, and the NBI-specific green light is emitted from the green light source <b>209</b>. In the blood vessel information obtaining mode, the first to third narrow band light is emitted from the first to third narrow band light sources <b>238</b> to <b>240</b>, respectively. The light from the special light source unit <b>254</b> is incident upon the light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> through an optical fiber <b>258</b> and the coupler <b>257</b>. The light source controller <b>255</b> controls the emission amount of the light from each light source contained in the special light source unit <b>254</b> via a driver <b>255</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The processor device <b>15</b> carried out processes corresponding to each imaging mode. In other words, in the AFI mode, the processes described in the first embodiment are carried out. In the NBI mode, the processes described in the second embodiment are carried out. In the blood vessel information obtaining mode, the processes described in the third embodiment are carried out. In the fourth embodiment, since the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b> is not attached to the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b>, an anti-halation process is preferably carried out in the AFI mode to prevent the occurrence of the halation due to the application of the excitation light.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the above first embodiment, the white light is applied to the internal body part, but frame sequential light including R, G, and B light may be applied instead. To apply the frame sequential light, a rotary filter <b>280</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is used instead of the rotary shutter <b>48</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. The rotary filter <b>280</b> is constituted of a light shielding portion <b>281</b> being similar to the light shielding portion <b>48</b><i>b </i>of the rotary shutter <b>48</b>, an R color filter <b>283</b><i>r </i>for transmitting the R light out of the white light emitted from the normal light source <b>45</b>, a G color filter <b>283</b><i>g </i>for transmitting the G light, and a B color filter <b>283</b><i>b </i>for transmitting the B light, which are disposed along its circumferential direction. By a turn of the rotary filter <b>280</b> around a rotation axis <b>280</b><i>a</i>, the R light, the G light, and the B light is applied in this order in the first period.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In the above first embodiment, the white light source <b>45</b> in the normal light source unit <b>16</b> produces the white light to be applied to the internal body part. Instead of this, as shown in an electronic endoscope system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the white light may be produced by a blue excitation light source <b>304</b> provided in the normal light source unit <b>16</b> and light projection units <b>306</b> and <b>307</b> provided in the distal end portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the electronic endoscope <b>11</b>. The blue excitation light source <b>304</b> emits blue laser light having a center wavelength of 445 nm. The emitted blue laser light transmits through the light guides <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>, and is applied to the internal body part through the light projection unit <b>306</b> and <b>307</b>, respectively. Note that, the blue excitation light source <b>304</b> is controlled by a light source controller <b>305</b> via a driver <b>305</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the light projection unit <b>306</b> has the same structure as those of the first and second light projection units <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, except for having a phosphor <b>310</b> instead of the light diffusing member <b>90</b>. The phosphor <b>310</b> contains plural types of fluorescent materials (for example, a YAG phosphor or a BAM (BaMgAl<sub>10</sub>O<sub>17</sub>) phosphor) that absorb part of the blue laser light from the light guide <b>55</b> and emit green to yellow pumped light.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Thus, the white light is produced by the combination of the green to yellow pumped light, which is emitted in response to the blue laser light as excitation light, and the blue laser light transmitted through the phosphor <b>310</b> without being absorbed. The light projection unit <b>307</b> has the same structure as that of the light projection unit <b>306</b>, and detailed description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the above first embodiment, the excitation light is applied from the first and second light projection units <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> attached to the hood <b>14</b>. Instead of this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the excitation light may be applied from a light projection section <b>400</b><i>a </i>of a probe <b>400</b>, which is disposed through the medical instrument insertion channel <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the insert section <b>20</b> and protruded from a probe holder <b>403</b> of a hood <b>402</b>. Note that, the probe <b>400</b> is connected to a special light source device <b>401</b> having the first and second excitation light sources <b>72</b> and <b>73</b>, which are the same as those of the above embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The hood <b>402</b> has the excitation light cut filter <b>32</b> as with the hood <b>14</b> of the above embodiments, but is different from the hood <b>14</b> in terms of having openings <b>405</b> and <b>406</b> for exposing the first and second lighting windows <b>57</b> and <b>59</b>. Accordingly, the light projection section <b>400</b><i>a </i>of the probe <b>400</b> held by the probe holder <b>403</b> is aimed at the internal body part, and the first and second lighting windows <b>57</b> and <b>59</b> are exposed from the openings <b>405</b> and <b>406</b>. Thus, the hood <b>402</b> does not interfere with application of the excitation light and the white light.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In the above first embodiment, the present invention is applied to the AFI for imaging the autofluorescence emitted from the endogenous fluorescent substance in the living body tissue by application of the excitation light. The present invention is applicable to photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) using a fluorescent labeling agent, or near infrared fluorescence imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the PDD, the wavelength of fluorescence depends on the type of the fluorescent labeling agent administered to the patient. For example, when Photofrin&#xae;, Laserphyrin&#xae;, or Visudyne&#xae; is administered as the fluorescent labeling agent, fluorescence having a center wavelength of 660 nm is emitted from the living body tissue inside the body cavity upon application of excitation light having a center wavelength of 405 nm. When 5-ALA (5-aminolevulinic acid) is administered as the fluorescent labeling agent, fluorescence having two wavelength peaks at 635 nm and 670 nm is emitted from the living body tissue inside the body cavity upon application of excitation light having a center wavelength of 405 nm. In the near infrared fluorescence imaging, ICG (indocyanine green) is used as the fluorescent labeling agent. When the ICG is administered to the patient, and excitation light having wavelengths around 800 nm is applied to the living body tissue inside the body cavity, near infrared fluorescence having a peak wavelength of 845 nm is emitted therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The above fluorescent labeling agents used in the PDD and the near infrared fluorescence imaging generally emit the fluorescence having larger intensity than that of the autofluorescence of the AFI. However, there is a case where the fluorescence is short of intensity due to insufficient accumulation of the fluorescent labeling agent in the living body tissue, or the like. In such a case, the frame addition process and the binning process, as described above, are applied to a special image that captures the fluorescence from the labeling agent. The frame addition process and the binning process are modified in accordance with the motion of the object to be inspected, in order to improve the image quality of the special image.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Although the present invention has been fully described by the way of the preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, various changes and modifications will be apparent to those having skill in this field. Therefore, unless otherwise these changes and modifications depart from the scope of the present invention, they should be construed as included therein.</p>
