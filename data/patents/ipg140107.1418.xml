<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a backlight module and a display apparatus, and more particularly to a backlight module and a display apparatus capable of improving color shifting defect.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) have been widely applied in electrical products. Currently, most of LCDs are backlight type LCDs, and comprise a liquid crystal panel and a backlight module. According to the position of the light sources, the backlight module can be classified into a side-light type or a direct-light type, in order to provide LCDs with backlight sources.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Light emitting diodes (LEDs) have several beneficial characteristics, including low electrical power consumption, low heat generation, long operational life, small volume, good impact resistance, fast response and excellent stability for emitting color light with stable wavelengths. These characteristics have made the LEDs suitable for light sources of the backlight module.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the LEDs with different colors have different luminous efficiency. For example, the luminous efficiency of a normal green LED is lower than the luminous efficiency of a red or blue LED. Therefore, when mixing the light of the LEDs with different colors to form a white light, a color shifting defect is susceptible to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For improving the above-mentioned detect, an improving method is to add the number of LEDs with lower luminous efficiency, such as to add the number of green LEDs. However, this method is susceptible to increase the cost and heat of the LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another improving method is to charge the arrangement of the LEDs. For example, the green LED is disposed close to a light output surface of a light guide plate (i.e. the upper surface of the light guide plate). However, this method still can not sufficiently improve the color shifting defect.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a result, it is necessary to provide a backlight module and a display apparatus to solve the problems existing in the conventional technologies, as described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A primary object of the present invention is to provide a backlight module, wherein the backlight module comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a light guide plate;</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The backlight module and the display apparatus of the present invention can adjust the coupling distance between the light emitting diodes with different colors and the light guide plate according to the luminous efficiency of the light emitting diodes for compensating the luminous intensity of light emitting diode with lower luminous efficiency, and thus the color shifting defect of the backlight module can be improved. In comparison with the conventional method of improving color shifting defect, the backlight module of the present invention can use fewer light emitting diodes to achieve a uniform color light, thereby reducing unnecessary cost and energy consumption. Furthermore, the backlight module of the present invention can improve the coupling effect of the light emitting diodes by the design of the light guide plate.</p>

For example, the first light emitting diode <b>160</b> is a green light emitting diode, and the second light emitting diode <b>170</b> and the third light emitting diode <b>180</b> may be a red light emitting diode and a blue light emitting diode, respectively.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, the backlight module and the display apparatus of the present invention can be based on the luminous efficiency of the light emitting diodes with different colors to adjust the arrangement position thereof, i.e. the coupling distance between the light emitting diodes and the light guide plate may be changed according to the luminous efficiency of the light emitting diodes for compensating the luminous intensity of light emitting diode with lower luminous efficiency (such as green light emitting diode). Therefore, the different color light emitted by the light emitting diodes toward the light guide plate can have substantially identical luminous intensity thereby greatly improving the color shifting defect of the backlight module. Accordingly, for example, the light emitted by R-G-B light emitting diodes can be mixed to form a uniform white light for improving the mixing effect of the light emitting diodes. Furthermore, In comparison with the conventional method of improving color shifting defect by adding the number of the light emitting diodes with lower luminous efficiency, the backlight module of the present invention can prevent from adding the number of the light emitting diodes with lower luminous efficiency, hence reducing unnecessary cost and energy consumption.</p>
