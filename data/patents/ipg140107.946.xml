<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a tool for reaming a bore and, in particular, but not exclusively, to a reaming shoe for use in reaming a wellbore.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a number of industries, bores are drilled from surface in order to access subsurface formations, including for example hydrocarbon-bearing or geothermal formations. One method of forming a bore comprises drilling to a first depth and running a first tubular section or string of tubular sections, known as casing, into the bore. The casing is suspended from surface and the annulus between the exterior of the casing and the surrounding bore wall is filled and sealed with cement. The bore is extended and a further tubular section or string of tubular sections, known as liners, are run into the bore and suspended from the casing and the annulus between the exterior of the liner and the surrounding bore wall is also filled and sealed with cement. In order to access the formation, the liner and cement are perforated to provide a fluid flow path between the formation and the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional methods of forming a bore can be both time-consuming and costly. Furthermore, it is common for the tubular string, during run in, to encounter obstructions in the bore, for example, beds of drill cuttings lying on the low side of an inclined bore, ledges, bore discontinuities, set cement or the like which can obstruct location or progress of the tubular string or other bore tools, thereby inhibiting or complicating formation and operation of the bore.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to improve the surface texture and geometric tolerances of the bore, the leading end of the tubular string may be provided with a shoe having blades arranged around its exterior surface. The blades are adapted to engage the interior of the bore and, typically, the tubular string is rotated or reciprocated to remove material from the bore wall or clear obstacles in the bore by a reaming process. In some applications, a portion of the shoe may be tapered off bore-centre to provide a nose portion.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a reaming shoe for location in a bore, the shoe comprising a rotationally balanced nose. In one embodiment, the nose has an eccentric profile.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a reaming shoe assembly for use in a bore. The assembly includes a reaming shoe for location in the bore. The shoe comprises a rotationally balanced nose. A rotary drive is rotationally coupled to the reaming shoe to enable reaming of the bore.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The various aspects of the present invention will be described first in general terms, to be followed by a more detailed description with reference to the various specific drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a reaming shoe for location in a bore, the shoe comprising a rotationally balanced nose. In one embodiment, the nose has an eccentric profile.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The provision of a rotationally balanced shoe permits relatively high speed rotation of the reaming shoe while substantially eliminating or at least reducing vibration generated by the rotation of the shoe and, in particular, but not exclusively, by rotation of the eccentric nose profile.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The eccentric nose profile may comprise a nose portion arranged to form a leading end of the nose. For example, the eccentric profile may define an off-centre portion resulting in an off-centre mass relative to an axis of the shoe. The axis may, for example, comprise a substantially central longitudinal axis of the shoe, which axis may also comprise the central longitudinal axis of a tubular component to which the shoe may be coupled and/or the bore. The shoe may be adapted to rotate about the shoe axis at a speed which, if unbalanced, would result in accelerated wear and damage to at least one of the shoe, the tubular component and the bore.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The provision of an eccentric nose profile may permit stabbing through bore obstructions, for example ledges in the bore and/or drill cuttings lying on the low side of an inclined bore, to facilitate a reciprocal reaming operation. The eccentric nose profile may be adapted to facilitate stabbing through bore obstructions while also permitting high speed rotation of the shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The shoe may comprise a body. For example, the body and the nose may comprise a single component, the nose being formed on the body. Alternatively, the nose may comprise a separate component adapted to be coupled to the body. The nose may be coupled to the body by any suitable connection. For example, the nose may be coupled to the body by a threaded connector or other mechanical fastener or connector. Beneficially, the nose may be coupled to the body by a connection that permits transmission of torque through the connection, for example, a spline connection, hexagonal drive or other suitable connector. In a further alternative, the nose may be fused to the body, for example, by brazing, adhesive or other suitable bonding process.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The nose may be constructed from any suitable material or combination or materials, including for example a metallic material or alloy, a ceramic material, a polymeric material, a glass material or other suitable material or combination of materials. In particular embodiments, the nose may be constructed from aluminium or aluminium alloy; or a ceramic material.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The shoe may comprise a weighting arrangement adapted to rotationally balance the nose about the shoe axis, whereby vibration induced by rotation of the shoe may be substantially eliminated or at least reduced. Any suitable weighting arrangement may be used. For example, the weighting arrangement may comprise at least one insert provided on at least one of the nose and the body. In particular embodiments, the at least one insert may be provided on an opposing side of the nose from the eccentric portion.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively, or in addition, the weighting arrangement may comprise at least one insert provided on the body. The at least one insert may be of any suitable form. The insert may comprise a bar, slug or pellet of material of relatively high density. For example, the material may be selected to be of higher density than the nose material such that a relatively small volume insert may be used to rotationally balance the nose. In particular embodiments, the insert may comprise a metallic material such as lead, brass or the like, though any other suitable material may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an alternative or additional arrangement, the weighting arrangement may comprise at least one bore defining a void. The bore may be provided, for example, in the body such that rotational balancing of the shoe may be achieved by the removal or omission of material from the body.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further alternative or additional arrangement, the weighting arrangement may comprise a portion of the nose formed and arranged to rotationally balance the mass of the nose about the shoe axis. In particular embodiments, the nose portion may be formed with the nose as an integral cast-in feature.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The shoe may further comprise at least one reaming element formed on, or mounted to, the shoe. For example, the reaming element may be braised, adhesively bonded or otherwise secured to the shoe. One or more reaming element may be arranged to extend radially to engage the bore to facilitate reaming of the bore. At least one reaming element may be provided on the nose.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The reaming elements may take any suitable form. For example, the reaming elements may comprise at least one reaming rib, blade or the like formed, or mounted to, an exterior surface of the body. The reaming elements may extend around at least a portion of the circumference of the body and may extend in a spiral, helical, serpentine, or other configuration. Alternatively, the elements may extend axially, that is substantially parallel to the shoe axis.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The reaming elements may further comprise a cutting or grinding element or surface, for example polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutters, carbide particles or any other arrangement suitable for assisting in performing the reaming operation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The weighting arrangement may comprise at least one bore provided in the at least one reaming element to facilitate rotational balancing of the nose. Alternatively, or in addition, the weighting arrangement may comprise at least one insert provided in the at least one reaming element to facilitate rotational balancing of the nose. The insert and/or the bore may be of any suitable form.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The nose and/or the body may define a conduit for directing fluid through the shoe. The nose may further comprise one or more port for permitting fluid to be directed to the exterior of the shoe and in particular embodiments, at least one of the ports may define, or provide mounting for, a nozzle. The provision of a port permits fluid, such as drilling mud or the like, to be directed through the shoe to assist in the removal and/or displacement of an obstruction from the bore. At least one of the ports may be integrally formed in the nose. Alternatively, or in addition, at least one of the ports may comprise a separate component coupled to the nose. The nozzle may be constructed from any suitable material, including a ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal or a material such as ceramic or machinable glass.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The nose may also define, or provide mounting for, at least one cutting structure and, in particular embodiments, the cutting structure may comprise a ceramic cutting structure or the like, ceramic cutting structures beneficially providing excellent shock fracture and cutting properties.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At least one component, or a portion of at least one component, of the shoe may be adapted to facilitate drilling through the shoe. For example, at least one of the shoe, body, nose, insert, reaming element, and fluid port may be constructed from a readily drillable material which may be frangible or otherwise adapted to break. In particular embodiments, the components may be constructed from at least one of aluminium, aluminium alloy, lead, brass, other suitable metallic material; a ceramic material; a polymeric material; a laminate material; a carbon fibre material; and a glass material, though any other suitable material may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Alternatively, or in addition, the nose may further comprise selected portions or regions of weakness. The weaker portions or regions may be cast into the nose during manufacture. Alternatively, or additionally, the nose may be subject to a machining process, or other process, to produce harder and weaker portions or regions. The provision of harder portions or regions may facilitate cutting or reaming of the bore. The provision of selected weaker portions or regions may facilitate drilling through the nose, where required.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The nose may be formed and arranged to avoid the formation of a slug of nose material when drilling through the nose and which may otherwise form an obstruction in the bore. For example, the nose may define a substantially concave distal surface defining an internal projection, upset, dimple or the like. The concave distal surface and projection may be arranged to facilitate gradual cutting away of the nose to avoid the creation of an unsupported end portion which without restraint could form an obstruction in the bore.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a reaming shoe assembly for use in a bore, the assembly comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">a reaming shoe for location in the bore, the shoe comprising a rotationally balanced nose; and</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">a rotary drive adapted to rotate the shoe to permit reaming of the bore.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the nose has an eccentric profile. The assembly may be adapted for use in reaming a drilled bore or alternatively, the assembly may be adapted for use in reaming a tubular component such as casing, liner or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The rotary drive may be of any suitable type. For example, the rotary drive may comprise a mud powered motor, electric motor or other suitable device adapted to rotate the reaming shoe. The rotary drive may be driven from surface. The assembly may be adapted to be coupled to a tubular component, such as casing, liner or drill pipe. In particular embodiments, the assembly may be adapted to be coupled to a tubular string, such as casing string or drill string and the assembly may be adapted to be run into the bore at a leading end of the tubular string.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The shoe may be adapted to rotate independently of the tubular component. Advantageously, as the shoe may rotate independently of the tubular component, rotation of the tubular component is not required to perform the reaming operation. The shoe may thus be adapted for rotation at a higher speed than the tubular component and, for example, the shoe may be adapted to rotate at a rotational speed that would otherwise result in detrimental vibration to the motor, tubular component or other component of the assembly. In particular embodiments, the shoe may be adapted to rotate at speeds of up to about 800 rpm to 1000 rpm, though the shoe may be adapted for higher rotational speeds where required. This facilitates efficient reaming operation while reducing or eliminating rotational forces on the tubular component.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The assembly may further comprise at least one stabiliser. The stabiliser may be non-rotating or may be free to rotate relative to the shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternatively, or in addition, the shoe may assist in stabilising, centralising or otherwise positioning the assembly in the bore. For example, at least one of the reaming ribs may define a helical path to provide stabilisation over the circumference of the shoe. Alternatively, the ribs may be arranged axially and extend radially to provide a degree of stabilisation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The assembly may further comprise a connector, for example, a substantially tubular connector sub or the like. The connector may be adapted to couple the tubular component to the reaming shoe, for example by a threaded connection, box and pin connection or other suitable connection.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In reference initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings, there is shown a diagrammatic sectional view of a reamer shoe <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The shoe <b>10</b> is adapted for location in a wellbore (not shown) and comprises a substantially tubular mandrel or body <b>12</b> having a central bore <b>14</b> located about an axis <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A cap or nose <b>16</b> is coupled to a distal end portion of the body <b>12</b> via a threaded connection <b>18</b>, though a spline connection, hexagonal drive or other suitable connector may be used to transmit torque through the shoe <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the nose <b>16</b> defines an eccentric offset portion or lobe <b>20</b> which extends to a greater axial extent than the remainder of the nose <b>16</b>. The distal surface of the nose <b>16</b> comprises a substantially concave central portion <b>17</b>. The nose <b>16</b> further comprises a projection or dimple <b>19</b> on an opposing side of the nose <b>16</b> from the concave surface.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The nose <b>16</b> is constructed from a metallic material, such as aluminium or brass, though other materials such as ferrous metals, or ceramics may be used where appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The nose <b>16</b> further comprises a number of bores <b>24</b>, each bore <b>24</b> adapted to receive a slug or insert <b>26</b> (two inserts <b>26</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The inserts <b>26</b> are constructed from a slug of material, such as lead or brass, which is of greater density than the material from which the nose <b>16</b> is constructed. Due to the distribution of mass in the nose <b>16</b>, the centre of mass of the nose <b>16</b> is located away from the central axis <b>15</b>. Accordingly, by selection of the mass of the inserts <b>26</b>, the nose <b>16</b> can be balanced about the central axis <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The nose <b>16</b> further comprises a bore <b>28</b> which is substantially aligned with the bore <b>14</b> of the body <b>12</b> and provides a fluid flow path through the shoe <b>10</b>. At least one conduit or port <b>30</b> is provided in the nose <b>16</b>, each port providing a fluid conduit between the bores <b>14</b>,<b>28</b> and the wellbore (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> of the drawings, the shoe <b>10</b> further comprises cutting structures in the form of reaming ribs <b>32</b>. The ribs <b>32</b> extend radially from the exterior surface of the body <b>12</b> and, as will be described below, in use, the ribs <b>32</b> are adapted to engage the bore wall to perform a reaming operation on the wall. In the embodiments shown in the figures, the ribs <b>32</b> are integrally formed with the body <b>12</b>, though the ribs <b>32</b> may comprise separate components coupled to the body <b>12</b> where appropriate. Any rib arrangement may be employed. By way of example, two rib arrangements are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> of the drawings. In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the ribs <b>32</b> are circumferentially spaced around the exterior surface of the body <b>12</b> and extend substantially parallel to the central axis <b>15</b>. In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the ribs <b>32</b> extend helically around the exterior surface of the body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one of the ribs <b>32</b> also comprises a number of bores defining voids <b>34</b>. The provision of the voids <b>34</b> in the body <b>12</b> further assists in balancing the shoe <b>10</b> relative to the central axis <b>15</b>, where required.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">One or more of the components of the shoe <b>10</b> are provided with abrasive particles which assist in removing material during operation of the shoe <b>10</b>. For example, the ribs <b>32</b> are provided with cutting or grinding surfaces <b>36</b>, such as PDC cutters, though carbide particles or other suitable arrangements may be used as required. The outer surface of the nose <b>16</b> is also dressed with carbide particles <b>38</b> to provide further cutting structures.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ports <b>30</b> in the nose <b>16</b> can also be hardened by introducing a skin of hard particulate material applied, for example, by high velocity oxygen fuel spraying (HVOF) or another suitable process.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In use, the shoe <b>10</b> is run into a wellbore or tubular component to be reamed (not shown). The lobe <b>20</b> enables the shoe <b>10</b> to stab or cut through obstructions (not shown) in the wellbore or tubular component without rotation, where required, including for example, ledges or drill cuttings lying on the low side of an inclined bore.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The ribs <b>32</b> engage the interior surface of the wellbore or tubular component, rotation or reciprocation of the shoe <b>10</b> reaming the wellbore to the required dimension and surface texture. The abrasive particles <b>36</b>,<b>38</b> provided on the ribs <b>32</b> and nose <b>16</b> further assist in performing the reaming operation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The shoe <b>10</b> is adapted to rotate at speeds of up to about 1000 rpm, though higher speeds may be used where appropriate, this facilitating efficient reaming of the wellbore. During rotation, the inserts <b>26</b> and/or voids <b>34</b> assist in balancing the nose <b>16</b> of the shoe <b>10</b> to reduce or substantially eliminate vibration generated by forces produced from rotation of the nose <b>16</b> about the central axis <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Fluid, such as drilling mud or the like (not shown) is directed through the bore <b>14</b>, the bore <b>28</b> and through the port or ports <b>30</b> to assist in removing material from the bore. The fluid may then be re-circulated to surface via an annulus (not shown) between the shoe <b>10</b> and the bore.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, a seal member, such as an o-ring seal <b>29</b>, is provided between the nose <b>16</b> and the body <b>12</b> to substantially prevent or reduce leakage of fluid through the connection <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of the drawings, there is shown an assembly <b>1</b> for running a bore-lining tubular <b>2</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Only the lower portion of the tubular <b>2</b> is shown, though the tubular <b>2</b> may form part of tubular string. The assembly <b>1</b> comprises a reamer shoe similar to the shoe <b>10</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B and like components are indicated by like numerals. The shoe <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a further, alternative reaming rib arrangement to the arrangements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The assembly <b>1</b> further comprises a mud-powered motor <b>3</b> adapted to rotate the reamer shoe <b>10</b> and the reamer shoe <b>10</b> is coupled to the motor <b>3</b> via a connector sub <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The assembly <b>1</b> further comprises a stabiliser <b>5</b> located on the reamer shoe <b>10</b>. The stabiliser <b>5</b> is non-rotating or free to rotate relative to the reamer shoe <b>10</b>. Although one stabiliser is shown, it will be recognised that a plurality of stabilisers <b>5</b> may be provided at spaced locations on the assembly <b>1</b> as required.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In use, the reamer shoe <b>10</b> is coupled to the tubular component <b>2</b> and run into a wellbore or tubular component to be reamed (not shown). The lobe <b>20</b> enables the shoe <b>10</b> to stab or cut through an obstruction (not shown) in the wellbore or tubular component without rotation, where required.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The motor <b>3</b> is operated to rotate the reamer shoe <b>10</b> relative to the tubular component <b>2</b> and the stabiliser <b>5</b>. For example, the shoe <b>10</b> is adapted to rotate at speeds of up to about 1000 rpm. This facilitates efficient reaming operation while reducing rotational forces on the tubular component <b>2</b>. The motor <b>3</b> is adapted to rotate the shoe <b>10</b> at significantly higher speeds than would typically be used when rotating drill string or casing. Higher rotational speeds may be used to facilitate more efficient reaming operations such that a less complex motor can be used. The balanced nose <b>16</b> permits high speed rotation while mitigating or substantially eliminating vibration generated by forces produced from rotation of the nose <b>16</b> about the central axis <b>15</b> which may otherwise be transmitted to the assembly <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The ribs <b>32</b> engage the interior surface of the wellbore or tubular component, rotation of the shoe <b>10</b> reaming the wellbore to the required dimension and surface texture. The abrasive particles provided on the ribs and nose further assist in performing the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On completion of the reaming operation, the shoe <b>10</b> can be drilled through to permit extension of the bore or permit location of tools or pipe through the bore. At least some of the components of the reaming shoe <b>10</b> are sacrificial, that is they are suitable for drilling through. The substantially concave portion <b>17</b> and dimple <b>19</b> assist in avoiding the creation of an unsupported portion of the nose <b>16</b> which may otherwise be left in the bore to act as a further obstruction in the bore. The dimple <b>19</b> is arranged such that, where the nose <b>16</b> is subject to a drill through operation by a drilling tool (not shown), the drilling tool engages the dimple <b>19</b>, this facilitating gradual cutting away of the dimple <b>19</b> and the nose <b>16</b> by the drilling tool. In the absence of such a projection, drilling through a tapering nose <b>16</b> may result in the nose wall being cut through, leaving an unsupported end portion or slug of material which without restraint could form an obstruction in the bore.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It should be understood that the embodiments described are merely exemplary of the present invention and that various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, while the embodiment described above relates to reaming a wellbore, the shoe may be used to ream a tubular component such as casing, liner or other downhole tubular component. Alternatively, the shoe may be used in reaming any bore, including for example as may be formed to access a geothermal formation or the like.</p>
