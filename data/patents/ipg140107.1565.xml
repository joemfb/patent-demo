<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the priority date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/428,565, filed Dec. 30, 2010.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to crash test dummies and, more particularly, to an ankle assembly for a crash test dummy.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Automotive, aviation, and other vehicle manufacturers conduct a wide variety of collision testing to measure the effects of a collision on a vehicle and its occupants. Through collision testing, a vehicle manufacturer gains valuable information that can be used to improve the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Collision testing often involves the use of anthropomorphic mannequins, better known as &#x201c;crash test dummies.&#x201d; During collision testing, an operator places a crash test dummy inside a vehicle, and the vehicle undergoes a simulated collision. The collision exposes the crash test dummy to high inertial loading, and sensors inside the crash test dummy, such as accelerometers, pressure gauges, and the like, generate electrical signals of data corresponding to the loading. Cables transmit these electrical signals of data to a data acquisition system (DAS) for subsequent processing. This data reveals information about the effects of the collision on the crash test dummy and can be correlated to the effects a similar collision would have on a human occupant.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the present invention is an ankle assembly for a crash test dummy. The ankle assembly includes an ankle base assembly for attachment to a foot of the crash test dummy. The ankle assembly also includes a clevis assembly for attachment to a leg of the crash test dummy and cooperating with the ankle base assembly. The clevis assembly includes a clamping nut to allow proper ankle positions for different ankle and also allow friction adjustment to simulate human bracing in impact conditions. The ankle assembly further includes a plurality of elastomeric elements that allow proper inversion and eversion performance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, the present invention is a crash test dummy including a body having a leg and a foot. The crash test dummy includes an ankle assembly interconnecting the leg and foot. The ankle assembly includes an ankle base assembly attached to the foot and a clevis assembly attached to the leg and cooperating with the ankle base assembly. The clevis assembly includes a fastener to connect the clevis assembly and the ankle base assembly together to allow proper ankle positions for different ankles and also allow friction adjustment to simulate human bracing in impact conditions. The ankle assembly further includes a plurality of elastomeric elements disposed between the clevis assembly and ankle base assembly that allow proper inversion and eversion performance of the ankle assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One advantage of the present invention is that a new ankle assembly is provided for a crash test dummy. Another advantage of the present invention is that the ankle assembly includes a friction shoulder bolt that acts as a clamping nut to allow proper ankle positions for different ankles and also allow friction adjustment to simulate human bracing in impact conditions. Yet another advantage of the present invention is that the ankle assembly includes a plurality of elastomeric elements that allow proper inversion and eversion performance of the ankle assembly. Still another advantage of the present invention is that the ankle assembly provides an ankle joint that offers human like range of motion. A further advantage of the present invention is that the ankle assembly has at least one elastomeric element to provide visco-elastic loading response like a human ankle under tension. Yet a further advantage of the present invention is that the ankle assembly allows enough range of motion to allow the dummy toe to touch the brake pedal during the dummy positioning all the time for different vehicle designs. Still a further advantage of the present invention is that the ankle assembly allows the foot to pivot along the ankle joint for adjustment. Yet still a further advantage of the present invention is that the ankle assembly serves as a new tool for automotive crash impact development.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other features and advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated, as the same becomes better understood, after reading the subsequent description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to the drawings and in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of an ankle assembly <b>10</b>, according to the present invention, is shown in operational relationship with a crash test dummy, generally indicated at <b>12</b> and partially shown. The crash test dummy <b>12</b> is of a three-year-old child side impact dummy and is illustrated in a seated position. This crash test dummy <b>12</b> is used primarily to test the performance of automotive interiors and restraint systems for small children front and rear seat occupants. The size and weight of the crash test dummy <b>12</b> are based on anthropometric studies by the Human Biomechanics and Simulation Standards Committee Task Force of the Society of Automotive Engineers. It should be appreciated that ranges of motions, centers of gravity, and segment masses simulate those of human subjects defined by the anthropometric data.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the crash test dummy <b>12</b> includes a femur assembly <b>14</b> for a left leg having one end connected to a pelvis assembly (not shown) and an opposite end connected to a knee assembly <b>16</b>. The crash test dummy <b>12</b> also includes a tibia assembly <b>18</b> having one end connected to the knee assembly <b>16</b> and an opposite end connected to the ankle assembly <b>10</b>. The crash test dummy <b>12</b> includes a foot assembly <b>20</b> connected to the ankle assembly <b>10</b>. It should be appreciated that, although only the left leg is described, the right leg is similar in construction.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The various components of the crash test dummy <b>12</b> are covered in a vinyl skin. The crash test dummy <b>12</b> includes a lower leg flesh/skin <b>22</b> covering a portion of the leg between the knee assembly <b>16</b> and the foot assembly <b>20</b>. It should be appreciated that the crash test dummy <b>12</b> is placed into and out of test fixtures (not shown) and vehicles (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 16</figref>, the ankle assembly <b>10</b> includes an ankle clevis assembly, generally indicated at <b>24</b>, attached to the tibia assembly <b>18</b> and an ankle base assembly, generally indicated at <b>26</b>, attached to the foot assembly <b>20</b> and cooperating with the ankle clevis assembly <b>24</b>. The ankle clevis assembly <b>24</b> includes a clevis member <b>28</b> having a generally inverted &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape. The clevis member <b>28</b> has a top portion <b>30</b> extending laterally and side portions <b>32</b> extending downwardly therefrom.
