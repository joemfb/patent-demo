<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Application No. 10-2008-0102557, filed Oct. 20, 2008, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the present invention relates to a photo sensing device, a photo sensing circuit, a touch panel, and a method of sensing an output value of a photo sensing element, whereby the influence of a threshold voltage of a driving transistor is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Photo sensing devices are used in various ways in order to detect the presence of incident light and the intensity of a spot of incident light. In particular, photo sensing devices have been recently used in order to recognize a touch position of a photo sensing touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve this, a photo sensing device uses various photo sensing elements, in particular, photo diodes. Each photo diode generates a current in proportion to the intensity of incident light.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A photo sensing device uses a predetermined driving device or element in order to obtain a current generated due to incident light as an output signal. Generally, a driving transistor operating as a source follower is used as a photo sensing device. In order to turn-on a transistor, a voltage greater than a threshold voltage needs to be applied between a gate terminal and a source terminal. At this time, an output of the transistor can be affected by the threshold voltage. In addition, the threshold voltage can vary according to environmental factors such as temperature, electric field, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Along with the development of small-sized and highly-integrated electronic devices, a photo sensing device having maximum sensitivity in a minimized area is desired.</p>

The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The specification and the drawings are not intended to limit aspects of the present invention and the scope of the prevent invention should be defined by the attached claims. The meanings of the terms used in the specification of the present invention should be construed as meanings and concepts not departing from the spirit and scope of the invention based on the principle that the inventor is capable of defining concepts of terms in order to describe his or her invention in the most appropriate way.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Aspects of the present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a photo sensing device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The photo sensing device <b>100</b> includes a scanning unit <b>130</b>, a driving unit <b>140</b>, and a photo sensing unit <b>160</b>. When light is incident on the photo sensing unit <b>160</b>, the photo sensing unit <b>160</b> outputs a current according to the intensity of the incident light, the driving unit <b>140</b> outputs a value according to the current output from the photo sensing unit <b>160</b>, and the scanning unit <b>130</b> outputs an output in response to a scan signal for a predetermined period of time. In the present embodiment, scanning is performed twice during every photo sensing period.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The photo sensing unit <b>160</b> generates a current according to the intensity of the incident light. At this time, if the intensity of the incident light is higher, a stronger current is generated. To achieve this, the photo sensing unit <b>160</b> may include a predetermined photo sensing element, for example, a photo diode. The photo sensing device is not limited to any particular device as long as the photo sensing device generates a current according to the intensity of incident light.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The driving unit <b>140</b> receives and outputs a value based on the current generated by the photo sensing unit <b>160</b>, which is based on the incident light. Generally, since the value output from the photo sensing unit <b>160</b> is a signal of very small intensity, the driving unit <b>140</b> may amplify the value output from the photo sensing unit <b>160</b> and outputs the amplified value.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The scanning unit <b>130</b> outputs a sensed value of the driving unit <b>140</b> twice during every photo sensing period. The scanning unit <b>130</b> outputs a current of the driving unit <b>140</b> in a first mode when light is gathered on the photo sensing unit <b>160</b> and in a second mode when the photo sensing unit <b>160</b> is initialized. To achieve this, the scanning unit <b>130</b> includes a scan controlling unit <b>132</b> outputting a scan signal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The photo sensing device <b>100</b> may further include a sensing data calculating unit <b>110</b> calculating an output difference between the first mode and the second mode. According to the present embodiment, in order to calculate the output difference between the first mode and the second mode, the intensity of light incident on the photo sensing unit <b>160</b> is measured, and the sensing data calculating unit <b>110</b> calculates the output difference. The sensing data calculating unit <b>110</b> may include a storage unit (not shown) storing output values of the first mode and/or the second mode, and a calculation unit (not shown) calculating the output difference between the first and second modes. The calculation unit may be embodied as software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The photo sensing device <b>100</b> may further include an initialization unit <b>150</b> initializing the photo sensing unit <b>160</b>. According to the present embodiment, in order to compensate for a variation in an output value due to a change of a threshold voltage of the driving unit <b>140</b>, the output difference between the first and second modes is calculated. At this time, in order to obtain the output value indicating the effect of the threshold voltage, an output of the photo sensing unit <b>160</b> that is initialized is obtained. At this time, prior to the second mode, and after the first mode when light is gathered on the photo sensing unit <b>160</b>, in order to initialize the photo sensing unit <b>160</b> during every photo sensing period, for example, every frame, the initialization unit <b>150</b> applies an initialization voltage to the photo sensing unit <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The photo sensing device <b>100</b> may further includes an output resetting unit <b>120</b> initializing a data line outputting a current of the scanning unit <b>130</b>. Generally, the data line for applying input data or output data includes a capacitor element. A voltage level of the data line varies according to the capacitor element. The output resetting unit <b>120</b> initialize the data line by applying a predetermined voltage to the data line in order to remove a value stored in the capacitor element of the data line whenever obtaining new input data or output data. The output resetting unit <b>120</b> initializes the data line whenever the output values of the first and second modes are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The photo sensing unit <b>160</b>, the driving unit <b>140</b>, the scanning unit <b>130</b>, the initialization unit <b>150</b> and the output resetting unit <b>120</b> may be embodied using transistors and photo diodes, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, the photo sensing device <b>100</b> may be embodied in a cell array shape, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and a unit denoted by Cell_mn of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is repeatedly arranged, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a timing diagram showing control signals applied to a photo sensing circuit and data output from the photo sensing circuit, according to an embodiment of the present invention. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an operation of the photo sensing circuit will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The photo sensing device <b>100</b> initializes a photo diode PD (&#x201c;a&#x201d;). To achieve this, an initialization signal Reset_in[m], generated by an initialization controlling unit <b>152</b>, is applied to an initialization transistor T<b>2</b>. When the initialization signal Reset_in[m] is applied to the initialization transistor T<b>2</b>, a second power voltage V<b>2</b> is applied to an end of the photo diode PD so that a voltage of the end of the photo diode PD is set to a predetermined voltage. Thus, a driving transistor T<b>1</b> and the photo diode PD are initialized.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When a voltage of the end of the photo diode PD is set to a predetermined voltage, the photo diode PD gathers light for a period of gathering light (&#x201c;b&#x201d;). During the gathering of light, a gate electrode voltage of the driving transistor T<b>1</b> varies. At this time, a current is generated in the photo diode PD due to incident light. An amount of the current is determined according to the intensity of the incident light. Thus, the current flows through the initialization transistor T<b>2</b> and the photo diode PD, and an electric potential of a node N<b>1</b> is determined according to the amount of current.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the period of gathering light is over, a reset transistor T<b>4</b> is turned-on by a reset signal Reset in order to initialize the data line Data[n] (&#x201c;c&#x201d;). When the reset transistor T<b>4</b> is turned-on, a third power voltage V<b>3</b> is applied to the data line Data[n] so that the data line Data[n] is charged with a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to obtain the output of the first mode by the photo diode PD in which light is gathered, a scan transistor T<b>3</b> is turned-on by a scan signal Scan[m] (&#x201c;d&#x201d;). With the turning-on the scan transistor T<b>3</b> by the scan signal Scan[m], the value charged in the data line Data[n] is applied to a source of the driving transistor T<b>1</b>. A current corresponding to a gate voltage of the driving transistor T<b>1</b> flows through the scan transistor T<b>3</b> and the driving transistor T<b>1</b>. Due to the current, a voltage of the data line Data[n] is determined, and the sensing data calculating unit <b>110</b> outputs the output of the first mode. That is, the output of the first mode is a value of a point of the data line Data[n] at which a period &#x2018;d&#x2019; is over. At this time, the gate voltage of the driving transistor T<b>1</b> is a voltage of the node N<b>1</b>, according to the intensity of incident light. The gate electrode voltage of the driving transistor T<b>1</b> is not fixed to an initial value, and varies with light gathering. A value Vgs of the driving transistor T<b>1</b> is determined by the gate electrode voltage determined by light gathering. That is, a value of the data line Data[n] reflects a drop in voltage due to light gathering instead of reflecting only a threshold voltage Vth of the driving transistor T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After obtaining the output of the first mode, the scan transistor T<b>3</b> is turned-off again, the data line Data[n] is initialized again by the reset signal Reset (&#x201c;e&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, the photo diode PD is initialized, and an output of the second mode is obtained from the photo diode PD (&#x201c;f&#x201d;). To achieve this, before the scan signal Scan[m] is applied in order to obtain the output of the second mode, the photo diode PD is initialized. That is, the initialization signal Reset_in[m] is applied to a gate of the initialization transistor T<b>2</b> so that the second power voltage V<b>2</b> is applied to the photo diode PD. At this time, the driving transistor T<b>1</b> is turned-on, and the value of the data line Data[n] drops, reflecting the threshold voltage Vth of the driving transistor T<b>1</b>. The output of the data line Data[n], when a period &#x2018;f&#x2019; is over, is determined by a current flowing through the scan transistor T<b>3</b> and the driving transistor T<b>1</b>, which is generated by the photo diode PD that is initialized. When the photo diode PD is initialized, the sensing data calculating unit <b>110</b> obtains the output of the second mode from the output of the data line Data[n].</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the outputs of the first mode and the second mode are determined, the sensing data calculating unit <b>110</b> outputs an output difference between the first mode and the second mode to determine sensing data.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the current generated by the photo diode PD is output through the driving transistor T<b>1</b>, an output current of the driving transistor T<b>1</b> is reduced by the threshold voltage Vth of the driving transistor T<b>1</b>. Generally, since data obtained from the photo diode PD has a very small value, the threshold voltage Vth greatly affects the sensing data. In addition, since the threshold voltage Vth is affected by temperature and electromagnetic field, when the photo sensing circuit is arrange in a cell array type, the threshold Vth may vary for each respective cell. According to the present embodiment, since the outputs of the first mode and the second mode are respectively obtained by two scanning operations, and the sensing data is determined by the output difference between the first and second modes, the influence of the threshold voltage Vth can be removed from the sensing data.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The photo sensing circuits are arranged as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to embody the touch panel <b>300</b> calculating a touch position of a screen, which is touched by a user. The initialization controlling unit <b>152</b> generates the initialization signal Reset_in[m] for initializing the photo diode PD. The scan controlling unit <b>132</b> turns-on the scan transistor T<b>3</b>, and generates the scan signal Scan[m] for obtaining the output of the data line Data[n]. The scan signal Scan[m] and the initialization signal Reset_in[m] may be commonly applied to cells of the same line.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The sensing data calculating unit <b>110</b> obtains the output of the data line Data[n] by the scan signal Scan[m].

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The touch panel <b>300</b> may be used as a touch panel using internal light and a touch panel using external light.

Alternatively, at least one of the initialization controlling unit <b>152</b>, the scan controlling unit <b>132</b> and the sensing data calculating unit <b>110</b> may be integrated to embody a single driving circuit.</p>

In the combination display and touch panel <b>400</b>, both functions of touch-screen and displaying can be provided by a single panel instead of a stacked display panel and a touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The combination display and touch panel <b>400</b> may include a photo sensing layer <b>410</b> and an emissive layer <b>420</b>. A photo sensing cell S and an emissive cell EL may be alternately arranged, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, the stack structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is only an example of the combination display and touch panel <b>400</b>, and it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that various changes may be made. For example, the photo sensing cell S and the emissive cell EL may be formed on the same plane, or may be formed in the same cell.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a structural view of a combination display and touch panel <b>400</b>, according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p>

Since the scan signal Scan[m] for the photo sensing circuitry B is scanned twice during every photo sensing period, the display scanning signal Scan<b>2</b>[m] may be separately provided from the scan signal Scan[m] for the photo sensing circuitry B.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to aspects of the present invention, sensing data is obtained by calculating a difference between two outputs, thereby removing the influence of a threshold voltage.</p>
