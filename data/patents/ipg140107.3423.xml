<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/JP2010/058949, filed on May 20, 2010, claiming priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-127498, filed May 27, 2009, the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a light-emitting device and a method for manufacturing thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An organic electroluminescent element (hereinafter, &#x201c;electroluminescent&#x201d; is also referred to as &#x201c;EL&#x201d;) is a light-emitting element that comprises a light-emitting layer comprises an organic substance as a light-emitting material, and comprises a pair of electrodes (an anode and a cathode) and the light-emitting layer placed between the electrodes. When voltage is applied to the organic EL element, holes are injected from the anode and electrons are injected from the cathode. The holes and electrons are recombined in the light-emitting layer to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Studies have been conducted on, for example, an illuminating device that comprises a light-emitting device comprising the organic EL element as a light source. By enlarging the area of each of the layers such as the electrode and the light-emitting layer that constitute the organic EL element, the organic EL element can emit light at a large area and then improve lightness. However, enlarging the area of the element increases a voltage drop at the electrode in operation, which may make the center of the element relatively darker. Thus, enlarging the area of the element may result in apparent nonuniformity in brightness. Under the circumstances, in order to secure a certain level of lightness while inhibiting nonuniformity in brightness, an illuminating device comprising a plurality of organic EL elements the areas of which are enlarged but still enough small to make nonuniformity in brightness invisible to a user has been suggested (see JP 2007-257855 A, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic of a light-emitting device <b>2</b> in which a plurality of (three in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) organic EL elements <b>1</b> are connected in series. FIG. <b>9</b>(<b>1</b>) is a plan view of the light-emitting device <b>2</b> and FIG. <b>9</b>(<b>2</b>) is a cross-sectional view of the light-emitting device <b>2</b>. The plurality of organic EL elements <b>1</b> are usually provided on a supporting substrate <b>3</b> on which a driving circuit is formed to drive the organic EL elements <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The light-emitting device <b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> comprises three organic EL elements <b>1</b>. These three organic EL elements <b>1</b> are arranged on the supporting substrate <b>3</b> in a prescribed array direction X to be connected in series. As described above, each organic EL element <b>1</b> comprises a pair of electrodes <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> and a light-emitting layer <b>6</b> placed between the electrodes. Hereinafter, one electrode out of the pair of electrodes <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> that is closer to the supporting substrate <b>3</b> is described as a first electrode <b>4</b>, and the other electrode that is farther from the supporting substrate <b>3</b> than the first electrode <b>4</b> is described as a second electrode <b>5</b>. One of the first and second electrodes <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> works as an anode and the other electrode works as a cathode. Between the first and second electrodes <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, a prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> may be placed in addition to the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> in consideration of element characteristics, easiness of processes, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first electrodes <b>4</b> of the organic EL elements <b>1</b> are discretely arranged to be spaced at prescribed intervals in the array direction X and therefore they are not in physical connection with each other. In the same manner, the second electrodes <b>5</b> of the organic EL elements <b>1</b> are discretely arranged to be spaced at prescribed intervals in the array direction X and therefore they are not in physical connection with each other. Thus, there is no physical connection between the first electrodes <b>4</b> and between the second electrodes <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, the second electrode <b>5</b> is physically connected to the first electrode <b>4</b> of the organic EL element <b>1</b> neighboring in the array direction X. Thus, the organic EL elements <b>1</b> are connected in series. Specifically, the first electrode <b>4</b> is formed so that one end (hereinafter, also referred to as the left end) in one array direction X (hereinafter, &#x201c;one array direction X&#x201d; is also referred to as &#x201c;left&#x201d; and &#x201c;the other array direction X&#x201d; is also referred to as right) of the first electrode <b>4</b> extends to overlap the right-side end (hereinafter, also referred to as the right end) of the second electrode <b>5</b> of the organic EL element <b>1</b> neighboring to the left, and therefore it is physically connected to the first electrode <b>4</b> of the organic EL element <b>1</b> neighboring to the left. Thus, the second electrode <b>5</b> is physically connected to the first electrode <b>4</b> of the organic EL element <b>1</b> neighboring in the array direction X to constitute a series connection of the organic EL elements <b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the case of forming the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> using a low molecular compound as an organic substance, the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> is usually formed by a vapor deposition method. The vapor deposition method achieves pattern formation of layers relatively easily and therefore, for example, can achieve selective pattern formation of the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> only on the first electrode <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the other hand, the inventors of the present invention have conducted studies on forming a light-emitting layer by a coating method in view of easiness of processes. Specifically, they studied on applying an ink comprising a material of the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> by a prescribed coating method to form a film and then solidifying the film to form the light-emitting layer <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A step of forming the organic EL elements <b>1</b> in series illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> by a coating method will be described below referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the step of forming the organic EL elements <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">First, three first electrodes <b>4</b> are discretely formed on the supporting substrate <b>3</b> to be spaced at prescribed intervals in the array direction X (see FIG. <b>10</b>(<b>1</b>)). For example, a conductive thin film can be formed by a sputtering method, followed by patterning by photolithography to discretely form the first electrode <b>4</b>. Next, the ink comprising a material of the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> is applied on the supporting substrate <b>3</b> by the prescribed coating method (see FIG. <b>10</b>(<b>2</b>)). Generally by a coating method, selective pattern application of an ink only on a desired area is difficult to achieve and the ink is applied even on an unneeded area such as areas between the first electrodes <b>4</b> and on the left end of the first electrode <b>4</b>. Therefore, after applying the ink, a step of removing the ink applied on the unneeded area is required (see FIG. <b>10</b>(<b>3</b>)). Ink removal can be performed using, for example, a waste, a cotton swab, or the like impregnated with a solvent to which the ink is soluble to strip the ink applied on the unneeded area. Then, the film formed after application is solidified by heating or the like to form the light-emitting layer <b>6</b>. Subsequently, patterning the second electrode <b>5</b> is performed by, for example, a vapor deposition method (see FIG. <b>10</b>(<b>4</b>)). The second electrode <b>5</b> is formed to reach and overlap the left end of the first electrode <b>4</b> of the organic EL element <b>1</b> on the right. Thus, the organic EL elements <b>1</b> in series are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As described above, in the case of forming the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> in the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> by a coating method, the step of removing the ink that is once applied is required, resulting in an increase of the number of steps. Since the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> usually deteriorates as exposed to atmosphere, in the step of forming the organic EL element <b>1</b>, duration of the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> being exposed to atmosphere is preferably short and, after applying the ink, the electrode or the like for covering the light-emitting layer is needed to be formed as soon as possible. However, in the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the step of removing the ink is required and duration of the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> being exposed to atmosphere is long, which may lead to deterioration of the light-emitting layer <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first electrode <b>4</b> is formed by a method that can form a fine pattern, such as photolithography or mask vapor deposition, so that the clearances between the neighboring first electrodes <b>4</b> can be extremely small. However, in the method that comprises the step of removing the ink once applied, it is generally difficult to strip the applied film by an extremely small width as of the clearances between the neighboring first electrodes <b>4</b>. Because of this, even when the first electrodes <b>4</b> are formed with the extremely small clearances between neighboring electrodes, the ink is to be removed by a width larger than the clearances between the first electrodes <b>4</b>, and therefore the step of removing the ink leads to limitation of a light-emitting region.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A purpose of the present invention is to provide a light-emitting device comprising a series connection of organic EL elements with large light-emitting areas, the light-emitting layer of the device can be formed by a coating method in which a step of wiping a prescribed ink off can be omitted.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0077">1) Structure of Light-Emitting Device</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0078">The structure of a light-emitting device will be described below referring to drawings. A light-emitting device of a present embodiment may be used in a light source of, for example, an illuminating device, a liquid crystal display device, or a scanner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view of a light-emitting device <b>11</b> of a first embodiment of the present invention. The light-emitting device <b>11</b> comprises a supporting substrate <b>12</b> and a plurality of organic EL elements <b>13</b> provided on the supporting substrate <b>12</b> in a prescribed array direction X to be connected in series. The prescribed array direction X is defined to be a direction vertical to the thickness direction Z of the supporting substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0079">In other words, the array direction X is defined to be parallel to the principal surface of the supporting substrate <b>12</b>. In the present embodiment, the plurality of organic EL elements <b>13</b> are arranged along a prescribed straight line as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, while they may be arranged along a prescribed curve. In the case where the organic EL elements <b>13</b> are arranged along the prescribed curve, the array direction X corresponds to a tangential direction of the prescribed curve.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0080">The number of the organic EL elements <b>13</b> to be provided on the supporting substrate <b>12</b> is designed as appropriate depending on the design.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0081">In a first embodiment below, the light-emitting device <b>11</b> comprising three organic EL elements <b>13</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0082">Each organic EL element <b>13</b> comprises a pair of electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and a light-emitting layer <b>16</b> placed between the electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. One electrode out of the pair of electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> works as the anode of the organic EL element <b>13</b> and the other electrode works as the cathode of the organic EL element <b>13</b>. Hereinafter, the electrode out of the pair of electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> that is closer to the supporting substrate <b>12</b> is also referred to as a first electrode <b>14</b>, and the other electrode that is farther from the supporting substrate <b>12</b> than the first electrode <b>14</b> is also referred to as a second electrode <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0083">Between the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, one or more prescribed layers are placed. Between the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, at least the light-emitting layer <b>16</b> is placed as the one or more prescribed layers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0084">The light-emitting layer <b>16</b> extends in the array direction X across the organic EL elements <b>13</b>. In the present embodiment, as for the organic EL elements <b>13</b> in series, a continuous light-emitting layer is formed in an integrated fashion extending in the array direction X from the light-emitting layer <b>16</b> of the organic EL element <b>13</b> provided on one end (the left end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the array direction X to the light-emitting layer <b>16</b> of the organic EL element <b>13</b> provided on the other end (the right end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the array direction X. In the case where a prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer is placed between the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, the prescribed layer may extend in the array direction X across the organic EL elements <b>13</b> or may be formed separately for each organic EL element <b>13</b> with spaces in between. In the case where the prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer is formed by a coating method, the prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer preferably extends in the array direction X across the organic EL elements <b>13</b>, as in the case of the light-emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0085">The first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> (the pair of electrodes) comprise extended portions <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>, respectively, that extend, as viewed from one thickness direction Z (hereinafter, also referred to as &#x201c;in a planar view&#x201d;) of the supporting substrate <b>12</b>, protruding from the light-emitting layer <b>16</b> in a width direction Y vertical to both of the thickness direction Z of the supporting substrate and the array direction X. The extended portion <b>17</b> of the first electrode <b>14</b> is formed within the first electrode <b>14</b> as a part of the first electrode <b>14</b>, and the extended portion <b>18</b> of the second electrode <b>15</b> is formed within the second electrode <b>15</b> as a part of the second electrode <b>15</b>. The first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b> (the pair of electrodes) that constitute one organic EL element <b>13</b> do not come into contact with each other, and the extended portion <b>17</b> of the first electrode <b>14</b> and the extended portion <b>18</b> of the second electrode <b>15</b> do not overlap in a planar view. In the present embodiment, the extended portion <b>17</b> of the first electrode <b>14</b> extends in the width direction Y from the left-side end (hereinafter, also referred to as the left end) of a portion of the first electrode <b>14</b> facing the second electrode <b>15</b>. The extended portion <b>18</b> of the second electrode <b>15</b> extends in the width direction Y from the right-side end (hereinafter, also referred to as the right end) of a portion of the second electrode <b>15</b> facing the first electrode <b>14</b>. Thus, the extended part <b>17</b> of the first electrode <b>14</b> and the extended portion <b>18</b> of the second electrode <b>15</b> do not overlap in a planar view and are electrically insulated.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0086">One electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> (the pair of electrodes) comprises a connecting portion. The connecting portion extends in the array direction X from the extended portion to the other electrode of the organic EL element neighboring in the array direction X so as to be connected to the other electrode. Not only the one electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> (the pair of electrodes) but also the other electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> (the pair of electrodes) may comprise such a connecting portion. In other words, the other electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> (the pair of electrodes) may also comprise the connecting portion that extends in the array direction X from the extended portion to one electrode of the organic EL element neighboring in the array direction X so as to be connected to the one electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0087">In the present embodiment, the first electrode <b>14</b> that corresponds to the one electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> (the pair of electrodes) comprises a connecting portion <b>19</b>. In other words, the first electrode <b>14</b> comprises the connecting portion <b>19</b> that extends to the left from the extended portion <b>17</b> of the first electrode <b>14</b> to the extended portion <b>18</b> of the second electrode <b>15</b> (the other electrode) of the organic EL element on the left. Thus, the connecting portion <b>19</b> of the first electrode <b>14</b> overlaps in a planar view the extended portion <b>18</b> of the second electrode <b>15</b> (the other electrode) of the organic EL element on the left so as to be directly connected to the second electrode <b>15</b> (the other electrode) at the overlapping portion.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0088">The extended portion that extends from the light-emitting layer <b>16</b> in the width direction Y in a planar view is provided in one or the other width direction Y, and is preferably provided in both of the width direction Y. In other words, the extended portions <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> preferably comprise first extended portions <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>a </i>that extend protruding from the light-emitting layer in one width direction in a planar view and second extended portions <b>17</b><i>b </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>that extend protruding from the light-emitting layer <b>16</b> in the other width direction Y in a planar view. With the extended portions <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> that extend from the light-emitting layer <b>16</b> in both of the width direction Y in a planar view, the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b> each of the neighboring organic EL elements <b>13</b> are connected at the both ends in the width direction Y.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0089">Among the organic EL elements <b>13</b> in series, each of the first electrode <b>14</b> of the leftmost organic EL element <b>13</b> and the second electrode of the rightmost organic EL element <b>13</b> is connected to a trace that is electrically connected to a power supply (not illustrated). Thus, power is supplied from the power supply to the organic EL elements <b>13</b> in series to allow each organic EL element to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0090">Each organic EL element <b>13</b> is powered via the connecting portion. In the present embodiment, each organic EL element <b>13</b> comprises the extended portions <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> that extend from the light-emitting layer <b>16</b> in both of the width direction Y in a planar view and therefore is powered via the both ends in the width direction Y. The brightness per unit area of a portion of the organic EL element <b>13</b> decreases, due to a voltage drop, with distance from the site at which the organic EL element <b>13</b> is powered. In the present embodiment, the brightness per unit area of a portion of the organic EL element <b>13</b> decreases, due to the voltage drop, with distance in the width direction Y from the extended portions <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>, namely it decreases as the portion is closer to the center in the width direction Y. However, since each organic EL element <b>13</b> is powered via the both ends in the width direction Y, impact of the voltage drop can be inhibited as compared to the case of an element that is powered via one end in the width direction Y, and therefore nonuniformity in brightness can be inhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0091">The structure of the supporting substrate <b>12</b> and the organic EL element <b>13</b> will be described below in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0092">As described above, between the first and second electrodes <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, not only the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> but also the prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer <b>6</b> may be provided. the layer provided between the cathode and the light-emitting layer may be an electron injection layer, an electron transport layer, or a hole block layer. When both of the electron injection layer and the electron transport layer are provided between the cathode and the light-emitting layer, a layer in contact with the cathode is called the electron injection layer, and a layer except for the electron injection layer is called the electron transport layer.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0093">The electron injection layer has function to improve electron injection efficiency from the cathode. The electron transport layer has function to improve electron injection from a layer in contact with the surface on the cathode side. The hole block layer has function to block the transport of holes. When any one of the electron injection layer and the electron transport layer or both has function to block the transport of holes, the layer may also serve as the hole block layer.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0094">The layer provided between the anode and the light-emitting layer may be a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, or an electron block layer. When both of the hole injection layer and the hole transport layer are provided between the anode and the light-emitting layer, a layer in contact with the anode is called the hole injection layer, and a layer except for the hole injection layer is called the hole transport layer.</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0178">The ink <b>27</b> to be supplied through the ink supply tube <b>26</b> from the tank <b>24</b> to the slit-shape outlet is extruded through the slit-shape outlet under pressure (static pressure) generated due to the height of the liquid level inside the tank <b>24</b> and force generated at the slit-shape outlet due to capillary action. The magnitude of static pressure that is to be applied on the liquid depends on the relative difference between the liquid level inside the tank <b>24</b> and the liquid level inside the nozzle <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0179">The relative difference can be adjusted by adjusting the position of the tank <b>24</b> in the vertical direction, and therefore the amount of liquid to be extruded through the slit-shape outlet can be controlled by adjusting the position of the tank <b>24</b> in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0180">The CAP Coater system <b>21</b> further comprises a controller implemented by a microcomputer or the like. The controller controls the displacement driving means described above and the like. The controller controls the displacement driving means so as to control the positions of the nozzle <b>23</b> and the tank <b>24</b> in the perpendicular direction and the displacement of the surface plate <b>22</b> in the array direction X. While the ink <b>27</b> is being applied, the liquid level of the ink <b>27</b> inside the tank <b>24</b> decreases over time due to consumption of the ink <b>27</b>. The controller controls the displacement driving means based on the detection result obtained by the liquid level sensor <b>28</b> so as to adjust the position of the tank <b>24</b> in the perpendicular direction, whereby the height of the ink <b>27</b> to be extruded through the slit-shape outlet can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0181">The operation of the above-described CAP Coater system <b>21</b> on ink application will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0182">(A Step of Applying)</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0183">While the ink that is being discharged through the nozzle <b>23</b> is in contact with the subject <b>29</b>, the nozzle <b>23</b> and the subject <b>29</b> are moved against each other in a prescribed array direction X.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0184">Specifically, the tank <b>24</b> is raised so that the liquid level of the ink inside the tank <b>24</b> is higher than the top of the nozzle <b>23</b> to allow the ink to be discharged through the slit-shape outlet, while the nozzle <b>23</b> is raised so that the top of the nozzle <b>23</b> becomes closer to the subject <b>29</b>, whereby the ink being discharged through the slit-shape outlet comes into contact with the subject <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0185">Then, while maintaining the state that the ink is in contact with the subject <b>29</b>, the table <b>22</b> holding the subject <b>29</b> is moved in the other array direction X (to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). After the table <b>22</b> holding the subject <b>29</b> is moved by a prescribed distance, the table <b>22</b> is caused to stop. Thus, a film having a substantially the same width as the width in a longitudinal direction of the slit-shape outlet is formed on the surface of the subject <b>29</b>. In the present embodiment, displacement of the nozzle <b>23</b> and the table <b>22</b> is controlled so that the ink is applied on an area between the first extended portion <b>17</b><i>a </i>defined in one width direction Y of the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second extended portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>defined in the other width direction Y of the first electrode <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0186">A clearance between the nozzle <b>23</b> and the subject <b>29</b> on ink application is designed to be about 0.05 mm to 0.3 mm, for example. Although the subject <b>29</b> is moved to apply the ink in the present embodiment, the nozzle <b>23</b> instead of the subject <b>29</b> may be moved in one array direction X (to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or both of the nozzle <b>23</b> and the workpiece <b>29</b> may be moved.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0187">Subsequently, the nozzle <b>23</b> is moved below so as to make the nozzle <b>23</b> and the subject <b>29</b> to be spaced from each other for solidifying the film. In the case where the light-emitting layer is formed using a polymerizable compound, the light-emitting layer can be solidified by light irradiation or heating. The film can also be solidified by removing a solvent contained in the ink, and in such a case, the film can be solidified by heat treatment or leaving the subject for a prescribed period of time. The light-emitting layer <b>16</b> is thus formed.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0188">As described above, between the second electrode <b>15</b> and the light-emitting layer <b>16</b>, the prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer may be placed. When the prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer is formed by a coating method, the prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer is preferably formed on the light-emitting layer by the same method as the above-described method for forming the light-emitting layer. In other words, the prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer is preferably formed by continuously applying the ink comprising the material of the prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer in the array direction X across the organic EL elements <b>13</b> and solidifying the film. In the case where the prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer is formed by a dry process such as a vapor deposition method, the prescribed layer that is different from the light-emitting layer may be selectively formed only on the first electrode <b>14</b> in a planar view.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0189">Next, the second electrode <b>15</b> is formed. Patterning the second electrode <b>15</b> can be performed on the light-emitting layer <b>16</b> by, for example, forming a film made of the material of an anode or a cathode described above selectively only on the area on which the second electrode <b>15</b> is to be provided by a mask vapor deposition method.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0190">In the light-emitting device <b>11</b> above described, the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b> each of the neighboring organic EL elements <b>13</b> are connected at a region protruding, in a planar view, in the width direction Y from a region on which the light-emitting layer <b>16</b> is formed, and therefore the neighboring organic EL elements <b>13</b> are connected in series. Thus, the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b> each of the neighboring organic EL elements <b>13</b> are not required to be connected at a region between the organic EL elements <b>13</b>. For this reason, the light-emitting layer and the like may be formed at the region between the neighboring organic EL elements <b>13</b> and therefore, in the case of forming the light-emitting layer by a coating method, a step of removing the light-emitting layer to be formed at the region between neighboring organic EL elements <b>13</b> can be omitted. Therefore, even by a coating method such as a CAP coating method that is relatively less capable of coating a fine pattern, the organic EL elements <b>13</b> in series can be easily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0191">In the case of forming the light-emitting layer by a coating method, the step of removing the light-emitting layer to be formed at the region between neighboring organic EL elements <b>13</b> can be omitted, and therefore limitation of a light-emitting region resulting from stripping the light-emitting layer off does not occur. Because of this, the distance between the neighboring organic EL elements can be as small as possible and the light-emitting area can be enlarged.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic of a light-emitting device <b>31</b> of a second embodiment of the present invention. The only differences between the light-emitting device <b>31</b> of the present embodiment and the light-emitting device <b>11</b> of the first embodiment described above are the shapes of the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b>. Therefore, description will be made only on the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b>, while the portions that correspond to the first embodiment are provided with the same reference numerals as in the first embodiment and overlapping description is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0193">In the present embodiment, not only the first electrode <b>14</b> but also the second electrode <b>15</b> may comprise a connecting portion <b>32</b>.

<p id="p-0141" num="0194">Therefore, as for the pair of organic EL elements <b>13</b> neighboring in the array direction X, the connecting portion <b>19</b> extends to the left from the extended portion <b>17</b> of the first electrode <b>14</b> of the organic EL element <b>13</b> on the right, while the connecting portion <b>32</b> extends to the right from the extended portion <b>18</b> of the second electrode <b>15</b> of the organic EL element <b>13</b> on the left. Thus, the connecting portion <b>19</b> of the first electrode <b>14</b> overlaps the connecting portion <b>32</b> of the second electrode <b>15</b>, so that the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b> each of the neighboring organic EL elements <b>13</b> are connected.</p>

<p id="p-0144" num="0197">In the light-emitting device <b>11</b> of the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, only the first electrode <b>14</b> comprises the connecting portion <b>19</b>, while in the light-emitting device <b>41</b> of the third embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, only the second electrode <b>15</b> comprises the connecting portion <b>42</b>. In the case where only one electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> comprises the connecting portion, which electrode is to comprise the connecting portion may be selected as appropriate depending on the design and, however, only one electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> (the pair of electrodes) that has lower sheet resistance preferably comprises the connecting portion. In other words, when the sheet resistance of the first electrode <b>14</b> is lower than the sheet resistance of the second electrode <b>15</b>, only the first electrode <b>14</b> preferably comprises the connecting portion <b>19</b> as in the light-emitting device <b>11</b> of the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In contrast, when the sheet resistance of the second electrode <b>15</b> is lower than the sheet resistance of the first electrode <b>14</b>, only the second electrode <b>15</b> preferably comprises the connecting portion <b>42</b> as in the light-emitting device <b>41</b> of the third embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0198">One electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> is formed of a component having light transparency so as to output light emitted from the light-emitting layer <b>16</b>. The component having light transparency generally has higher sheet resistance than that of a conductive component having no light transparency. Because of this, the one electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> that has light transparency usually has higher sheet resistance. Therefore, in ordinary cases, only the other electrode that is not the one electrode having light transparency preferably comprises the connecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0199">On operation of the light-emitting device, a voltage drop also occurs at the connecting portion formed of a conductor. However, by providing the connecting portion only on the electrode that is formed of a component having lower sheet resistance, the voltage drop to occur at the connecting portion can be inhibited, which in turn can decrease power consumption.</p>

Therefore, description will be made only on the auxiliary electrode, while the portions that correspond to the each embodiment described above are provided with the same reference numerals and overlapping description is omitted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a region of the auxiliary electrode is hatched.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0201">The auxiliary electrode is provided in contact with at least one of the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b> (the pair of electrodes). In the case where the auxiliary electrode is provided in contact with the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b>, two auxiliary electrodes, one in contact with the first electrode <b>14</b> and the other in contact with the second electrode, are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0202">The auxiliary electrode is formed of a component that has sheet resistance that is lower than that of the electrode in contact with the auxiliary electrode. An auxiliary electrode <b>52</b> is preferably provided in contact with the electrode of the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b> (the pair of electrodes) that has higher sheet resistance. As described above, one electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> is formed of a component having light transparency so as to output light emitted from the light-emitting layer <b>16</b>. The electrode having light transparency usually has higher sheet resistance than that of the other electrode. Because of this, in ordinary cases, the one electrode of the first and second electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> that has light transparency preferably comprises the auxiliary electrode <b>52</b> in contact therewith. In the light-emitting device <b>51</b> of the present embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the auxiliary electrode <b>52</b> is provided in contact with the first electrode <b>14</b> that serves as the electrode having light transparency.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0203">The auxiliary electrode <b>52</b> has lower sheet resistance than that of the electrode with which the auxiliary electrode <b>52</b> is in contact, and therefore is usually opaque.

<p id="p-0151" num="0204">The light-emitting layer <b>16</b> can emit light, in principle, at a region (hereinafter, also referred to as a facing region) at which the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b> face each other in a planar view.

For this reason, the auxiliary electrode <b>52</b> is preferably provided at the region other than the facing region of the first electrode <b>14</b> and the second electrode <b>15</b> in a planar view.</p>

A linear auxiliary electrode may be formed, for example, in a grid or in stripes, at the facing region in a planar view, and the auxiliary electrode formed at the facing region and the auxiliary electrode formed at the periphery of the facing region may be connected.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0206">As the material of the auxiliary electrode, a material with high electric conductivity is preferably used, and the materials may be Al, Ag, Cu, Au, or W. Alloys such as Al&#x2014;Nd and Ag&#x2014;Pd&#x2014;Cu may be used in the auxiliary electrode. The thickness of the auxiliary electrode is designed as appropriate depending on sheet resistance required and the like and is, for example, 50 nm to 2000 nm. The auxiliary electrode may be a monolayer or a stacked body in which a plurality of layers are stacked. In the case where adhesion to the supporting substrate <b>12</b> (such as a glass substrate) or the first electrode <b>14</b> (such as an ITO thin film) is desired to be improved, the case where protection of the metal surface from oxygen and moisture is desired, or other cases, a layer having a certain function may be stacked on a thin film made of the material with high electric conductivity. For example, a stacked body in which a thin film made of the material with high electric conductivity is interposed between thin films made of Mo, Mo&#x2014;Nb, Cr, and the like can be used as the auxiliary electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0207">The embodiments described above provide light-emitting devices in which a plurality of organic EL elements are connected to constitute a series connection and, however, the present invention can be suitably applied to a light-emitting device in which a plurality of organic EL elements are connected to constitute a plurality of series connections.

<p id="p-0156" num="0209">In the light-emitting device in which a plurality of organic EL elements are connected to constitute a series connection, voltage of a driving source driving the organic EL elements increases as the number of the elements increases.

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0157" num="0210">A light-emitting device having substantially the same structure as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> was formed. In Example 1, two series connections each composed of eight organic EL elements were connected in parallel. In other words, a light-emitting device comprising 16 organic EL elements of 8&#xd7;2 was formed.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0211">The structure of the organic EL element is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0212">Supporting substrate/anode/hole injection layer/interlayer/light-emitting layer/electron injection layer/cathode</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0213">An ITO thin film with a film thickness of 150 nm was formed on a supporting substrate by a sputtering method.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0214">Patterning of the ITO thin film into a prescribed shape was performed by photolithography to form an anode.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0215">On the supporting substrate on which the anode was formed, a hole injection layer, an interlayer, and a light-emitting layer were sequentially formed by a coating method. The hole injection layer, the interlayer, and the light-emitting layer were formed by a spin coating method using an ink. A film was formed even on an unneeded area by the spin coating method, and therefore the film applied on the unneeded area was wiped off using a waste impregnated with a solvent to which the ink was soluble. After the wiping-off step, the hole injection layer, the interlayer, and the light-emitting layer were formed across the plurality of organic EL elements. The shapes of the hole injection layer, the interlayer, and the light-emitting layer were designed to be approximately rectangular of 74.0 mm&#xd7;71.2 mm in a planar view. The film thicknesses of the hole injection layer, the interlayer, and the light-emitting layer were 6 nm, 2 nm, and 6 nm, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0216">Next, Ba was deposited 5 nm by a vapor deposition method as an electron injection layer, and Al was then deposited 100 nm by a vapor deposition method as a cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0217">The widths in a lateral direction of five organic EL elements of the eight organic EL elements in series were designed to be relatively shorter, and the widths in the lateral direction of the other three organic EL elements were designed to be relatively longer. Specifically, the light-emitting regions of the five organic EL elements were designed to be approximately rectangular of 66.0 mm&#xd7;10.4 mm in a planar view, and the light-emitting regions of the three organic EL elements were designed to be approximately rectangular of 66.0 mm&#xd7;20.0 mm in a planar view.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0218">When a voltage of 50 volts was applied to the light-emitting device, the organic EL element emitted light.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0219">In Example 1, use of a spin coating method in which pattern coating is difficult to achieve required a step of wiping-off the film. However, in the case where the CAP Coater system <b>21</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is used for application by a prescribed application width to form a film, the step of wiping-off the film can be omitted.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0167" num="0220">In Example 2, a light-emitting device was formed in the same manner as in Example 1 except that an auxiliary electrode was formed on an anode. The structure in Example 2 was the same as the structure in Example 1 except that the auxiliary electrode was formed, and therefore description will be made only on the auxiliary electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0221">The auxiliary electrode was formed on the anode made of an ITO thin film. The auxiliary electrode was formed on the anode at a region other than where the anode and a cathode faced each other. By a vapor deposition method, Mo, Al&#x2014;Nd, and Mo were deposited 50 nm, 800 nm, and 50 nm, respectively, in the order from the side of the ITO thin film. In other words, the auxiliary electrode with a three layer structure (Mo/Al&#x2014;Nd/Mo) was formed on the ITO thin film.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0222">The sheet resistance of the conductor made of the ITO thin film alone was 10&#x3a9;/, and the sheet resistance of the conductor made of the ITO thin film stacked with the auxiliary electrode was 0.38&#x3a9;/. Thus, it was confirmed that sheet resistance can be decreased by stacking the auxiliary electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0223">When a voltage of 50 volts was applied, the organic EL element emitted light.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Industrial Applicability</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0224">According to the present invention, the light-emitting layer extending in the prescribed array direction across the plurality of organic EL elements makes it possible to form the light-emitting layer by a coating method that can continuously apply the ink in the array direction, and to omit the step of wiping the ink off even in the case of using such a coating method. Since one electrode and the other electrode each of the neighboring organic EL elements are connected at a region that is, as viewed from one thickness direction of the supporting substrate, different from the region on which the light-emitting layer is formed, a series connection of the organic EL elements can be formed even in the case of forming the light-emitting layer that extends in the array direction across the organic EL elements. In addition, limitation of the light-emitting region resulting from stripping the light-emitting layer that is formed between the electrodes and on the electrodes does not occur, and therefore the distance between the neighboring organic EL elements can be as small as possible and the light-emitting area can be enlarged.</p>
