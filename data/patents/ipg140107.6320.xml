<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure pertains generally to computer security, and more specifically to protecting computers by altering application behavior based on content provider reputation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As anti-malware systems become better at identifying malicious executable files, malware is more frequently being distributed in non-executable, content-based files that are processed or loaded by application programs. For example, malware is often disguised as content in PDF or other types of media and/or document files, which are opened by specific applications (e.g., Adobe Reader&#xae;, Microsoft Word&#xae;, Apple Quick Time&#xae;, etc.). Frequently, content-based malware infects computers by causing the processing application to run malicious active content, such as JavaScript. This type of malware leverages vulnerabilities in content formats as well as user ignorance to distribute itself and infect computers in this manner. As a specific example, there has recently been a large increase in the amount of malware distributed in PDF files. Due to the complexity of these formats and attack type, such malware often evades traditional signature based detection. It would be desirable to address these issues.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A content source reputation management system protects a computer system from malicious attacks by altering content processing application behavior, based on at least content provider reputation. More specifically, incoming network traffic is monitored, and content-based files in the monitored incoming network traffic originating from remote sources are identified. The identified content-based files can be downloaded from remote sources, or attached to incoming electronic communications. When a specific content-based file originating from a specific remote source is identified, security information concerning that specific, identified content-based file is gleaned. This gleaned security information comprises at least a security reputation of the specific remote source from which the file originates. The security reputation of the specific remote source can be retrieved from a stored collection of file source reputations, such as a database. An attempt to open a specific, content-based file is identified, and a security risk rating concerning the file is determined, based on gleaned security information concerning the file. Determining the security risk rating concerning the file can be based on just the security reputation of the specific remote source from which the file originates, or on additional security information concerning the file as well, such as the file's size and format. In response to the determined security risk rating concerning the file exceeding a given threshold, behavior associated with the attempt to open the file is altered. This altering of behavior can comprise, for example, blocking the attempt to open the file, disabling a scripting engine for the instance of the content processing application attempting to open the file or altering file system and/or operating system resource access privileges of the instance of the content processing application.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The Figures depict various embodiments for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary network architecture <b>100</b> in which a content source reputation management system <b>101</b> can be implemented. The illustrated network architecture <b>100</b> comprises multiple clients <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B and <b>103</b>N, as well as multiple servers <b>105</b>A and <b>105</b>N. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> is illustrated as residing on client <b>103</b>A. It is to be understood that this is an example only, and in various embodiments various functionalities of this system <b>101</b> can be instantiated on a client <b>103</b>, a server <b>105</b> or can be distributed between multiple clients <b>103</b> and/or servers <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Clients <b>103</b> and servers <b>105</b> can be implemented using computer systems <b>210</b> such as the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and described below. The clients <b>103</b> and servers <b>105</b> are communicatively coupled to a network <b>107</b>, for example via a network interface <b>248</b> or modem <b>247</b> as described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Clients <b>103</b> are able to access applicants and/or data on servers <b>105</b> using, for example, a web browser or other client software (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates three clients and two servers as an example, in practice many more (or fewer) clients <b>103</b> and/or servers <b>105</b> can be deployed. In one embodiment, the network <b>107</b> is in the form of the Internet. Other networks <b>107</b> or network-based environments can be used in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a computer system <b>210</b> suitable for implementing a content source reputation management system <b>101</b>. Both clients <b>103</b> and servers <b>105</b> can be implemented in the form of such computer systems <b>210</b>. As illustrated, one component of the computer system <b>210</b> is a bus <b>212</b>. The bus <b>212</b> communicatively couples other components of the computer system <b>210</b>, such as at least one processor <b>214</b>, system memory <b>217</b> (e.g., random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), flash memory), an input/output (I/O) controller <b>218</b>, an audio output interface <b>222</b> communicatively coupled to an external audio device such as a speaker system <b>220</b>, a display adapter <b>226</b> communicatively coupled to an external video output device such as a display screen <b>224</b>, one or more interfaces such as serial ports <b>230</b>, Universal Serial Bus (USB) receptacles <b>230</b>, parallel ports (not illustrated), etc., a keyboard controller <b>233</b> communicatively coupled to a keyboard <b>232</b>, a storage interface <b>234</b> communicatively coupled to at least one hard disk <b>244</b> (or other form(s) of magnetic media), a floppy disk drive <b>237</b> configured to receive a floppy disk <b>238</b>, a host bus adapter (HBA) interface card <b>235</b>A configured to connect with a Fibre Channel (FC) network <b>290</b>, an HBA interface card <b>235</b>B configured to connect to a SCSI bus <b>239</b>, an optical disk drive <b>240</b> configured to receive an optical disk <b>242</b>, a mouse <b>246</b> (or other pointing device) coupled to the bus <b>212</b> e.g., via a USB receptacle <b>228</b>, a modem <b>247</b> coupled to bus <b>212</b>, e.g., via a serial port <b>230</b>, and a network interface <b>248</b> coupled, e.g., directly to bus <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other components (not illustrated) may be connected in a similar manner (e.g., document scanners, digital cameras, printers, etc.). Conversely, all of the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> need not be present. The components can be interconnected in different ways from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The bus <b>212</b> allows data communication between the processor <b>214</b> and system memory <b>217</b>, which, as noted above may include ROM and/or flash memory as well as RAM. The RAM is typically the main memory into which the operating system and application programs are loaded. The ROM and/or flash memory can contain, among other code, the Basic Input-Output system (BIOS) which controls certain basic hardware operations. Application programs can be stored on a local computer readable medium (e.g., hard disk <b>244</b>, optical disk <b>242</b>) and loaded into system memory <b>217</b> and executed by the processor <b>214</b>. Application programs can also be loaded into system memory <b>217</b> from a remote location (i.e., a remotely located computer system <b>210</b>), for example via the network interface <b>248</b> or modem <b>247</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> is illustrated as residing in system memory <b>217</b>. The workings of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> are explained in greater detail below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The storage interface <b>234</b> is coupled to one or more hard disks <b>244</b> (and/or other standard storage media). The hard disk(s) <b>244</b> may be a part of computer system <b>210</b>, or may be physically separate and accessed through other interface systems.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The network interface <b>248</b> and or modem <b>247</b> can be directly or indirectly communicatively coupled to a network <b>107</b> such as the Internet. Such coupling can be wired or wireless.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the operation of a content source reputation management system <b>101</b> residing in the system memory <b>217</b> of a client computer <b>103</b>, according to some embodiments. As described above, the functionalities of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> can reside on a client <b>103</b>, a server <b>105</b>, or be distributed between multiple computer systems <b>210</b>, including within a cloud-based computing environment in which the functionality of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> is provided as a service over a network <b>107</b>. It is to be understood that although the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as a single entity, the illustrated content source reputation management system <b>101</b> represents a collection of functionalities, which can be instantiated as a single or multiple modules as desired (an instantiation of specific, multiple modules of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). It is to be understood that the modules of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> can be instantiated (for example as object code or executable images) within the system memory <b>217</b> (e.g., RAM, ROM, flash memory) of any computer system <b>210</b>, such that when the processor <b>214</b> of the computer system <b>210</b> processes a module, the computer system <b>210</b> executes the associated functionality. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;computer system,&#x201d; &#x201c;computer,&#x201d; &#x201c;client,&#x201d; &#x201c;client computer,&#x201d; &#x201c;server,&#x201d; &#x201c;server computer&#x201d; and &#x201c;computing device&#x201d; mean one or more computers configured and/or programmed to execute the described functionality. Additionally, program code to implement the functionalities of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> can be stored on computer-readable storage media. Any form of tangible computer readable storage medium can be used in this context, such as magnetic or optical storage media. As used herein, the term &#x201c;computer readable storage medium&#x201d; does not mean an electrical signal separate from an underlying physical medium.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> monitors incoming non-executable content-based files <b>303</b> entering a user's computer <b>210</b>, determines whether the content is legitimate or malicious and takes appropriate steps to keep the computer <b>210</b> secure based on the results of the determination. More specifically, a network traffic monitoring module <b>301</b> of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> monitors incoming network traffic and identifies incoming content-based files <b>303</b> in formats such as PDF, MP3, .doc, etc. The network traffic monitoring module <b>301</b> can use conventional network monitoring functionality to detect the downloading of files to the computer <b>210</b> from remote sources, and the incoming of electronic communications to which files are attached. Where the network traffic monitoring module <b>301</b> detects an incoming file in either of these ways (e.g., download from a website, attachment to an email, etc.), it determines whether it comprises a content-based file <b>303</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;content-based file&#x201d; <b>303</b> means a file primarily storing data, such as text, sound, pictures, video or the like, to be perceived by a human, typically through the use of a content processing application <b>329</b> such as a word processor, media player or the like. Content-based files <b>303</b> are distinct from executable files, which store executable code (e.g., .exe files, .com files, .dll files, etc.). In different embodiments, different specific file formats can be explicitly included or excluded from the working definition of content-based files <b>303</b> as desired (e.g., explicitly include PDF, explicitly exclude .xls, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Where the network traffic monitoring module <b>301</b> identifies a content-based file <b>303</b>, a file information gleaning module <b>305</b> of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> gleans security information <b>307</b> concerning the identified content-based file <b>303</b>. The security information <b>307</b> concerning the identified content-based file <b>303</b> comprises information that is indicative of whether the file is legitimate or malicious. The file information gleaning module <b>305</b> gleans the remote source <b>309</b> of the content-based file <b>303</b> (e.g., the IP address from which it was downloaded, the sender of the electronic communication with which it was distributed, etc.) as a component of the security information <b>307</b>. The security information <b>307</b> can further comprise additional information concerning the content-based file <b>303</b> such as the transmission protocol used for the file transfer, whether the file <b>303</b> was encrypted during transmission, whether the file <b>303</b> is signed, the size of the file <b>303</b>, the file format, file attributes (e.g., read-only, system), etc. Where the content-based file <b>303</b> is in the form of an attachment to an electronic communication, the file information gleaning module <b>305</b> can also glean security information <b>307</b> such as the email server, SMTP gateway, email protocol, etc. It is to be understood that in different embodiments, different security information <b>307</b> can be gleaned as desired. The file information gleaning module <b>305</b> stores the gleaned security information <b>307</b> in association with the corresponding content-based file <b>303</b> in a secure fashion, such that when the content-based file is processed (e.g., opened) by an associated content processing application <b>329</b>, the security information can be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, where the network traffic monitoring module <b>301</b> identifies a content-based file <b>303</b>, a source reputation retrieving module <b>311</b> of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> retrieves a security reputation <b>317</b> associated with the file source <b>309</b>. More specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a reputation database <b>315</b> (or other suitable storage mechanism(s)) can be maintained, storing security reputations <b>317</b> concerning various sources <b>309</b> of files, such as websites, URLs, Internet Protocol (&#x201c;IP&#x201d;) addresses for any protocol, email and Instant Messaging (&#x201c;IM&#x201d;) senders, users of social networking sites (e.g., Facebook&#xae; MySpace&#xae;, Twitter&#xae;) etc. The reputation database <b>315</b> can be maintained by a centralized computer security system <b>319</b>, running, for example, on a server <b>105</b>. In some embodiments, separate databases <b>315</b> are maintained for 1) network based sources <b>309</b> such as IP addresses and URLs and 2) user based sources <b>309</b> such senders of electronic communications and other distributors of files. Security reputations <b>317</b> of network sources <b>309</b> can be based on factors such as whether malicious code has been detected as originating from the given source <b>309</b>. Security reputations <b>317</b> of user based sources <b>309</b> can be based on factors such as whether given users have been detected sending or otherwise distributing malicious files, SPAM, links to malware URLs, links to phishing sites or other attacks, etc. In any case, the source reputation retrieving module <b>311</b> can retrieve the security reputation <b>317</b> of the source <b>309</b> of a given identified content-based file <b>303</b> from the database <b>315</b>, and add the retrieved security reputation <b>317</b> to security information <b>307</b> concerning that content-based file <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, a database <b>315</b> is also maintained storing security reputations <b>317</b> of different content processing applications <b>329</b>, such as readers of different formats of content-based files <b>303</b>. In such embodiments, where the network traffic monitoring module <b>301</b> identifies a content-based file <b>303</b>, an application reputation retrieving module <b>313</b> of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> can retrieve a security reputation <b>317</b> of a specific content processing application <b>329</b> associated with the format of the identified content-based file <b>303</b> (e.g., Adobe Reader&#xae; where a PDF file <b>303</b> is identified). The application reputation retrieving module <b>313</b> can then add the retrieved security reputation <b>317</b> to security information <b>307</b> concerning that content-based file <b>303</b>. The security reputations <b>317</b> of given content processing applications <b>329</b> can be based on factors such as whether the application <b>329</b> is from a trusted vendor, has any known security vulnerabilities, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Typically, where one or more reputation databases <b>315</b> are maintained by a centralized computer security system <b>319</b>, the centralized computer security system <b>319</b> receives corresponding information concerning file sources (and/or content processing applications <b>329</b>) from a plurality of clients <b>103</b> over time. Such information can be determined by, for example, a conventional anti-malware system (not illustrated). It is to be understood that the functionality described herein is not tied to any specific methodology or instantiation as to how security reputations <b>317</b> are calculated, which can be done according to conventional or other techniques as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A file access detecting module <b>321</b> of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> detects when attempts are made to open content-based files <b>303</b>, and a content risk determining module <b>323</b> of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> uses the associated security information <b>307</b> to determine security risk ratings <b>325</b> for specific content-based files <b>303</b>. To determine the security risk rating <b>325</b> for a specific content-based file <b>303</b>, the content risk determining module <b>323</b> uses the security reputation <b>317</b> of the source <b>309</b> of the file <b>303</b>, as well as optionally other factors in the security information <b>307</b> associated with the file <b>303</b>. The lower the security reputation <b>317</b> of the source <b>309</b>, the riskier the content-based file <b>303</b> is determined to be. The content risk determining module <b>323</b> can also adjust the security risk rating <b>325</b> based on other factors in the security information <b>307</b> associated with the file <b>303</b>. For example, a file <b>303</b> transmitted using a secure protocol is considered less risky than otherwise, and a file <b>303</b> encrypted during transmission is considered less risky than one transmitted in the clear. Likewise, a signed file <b>303</b> is typically considered less risky than an unsigned one. The specific file format can be taken into account as well (e.g., PDF, .doc, etc.). For example, files <b>303</b> of given formats can be expected to be within given size ranges, and a file <b>303</b> that is outside of a specific range for its format can be considered riskier than those within the range. Additionally, the security reputation <b>317</b> of a content processing application <b>329</b> associated with the file format can be taken into account. Where the content-based file <b>303</b> is in the form of an attachment to an electronic communication, security information <b>307</b> such as the email server, SMTP gateway, email protocol, etc., can be utilized by the content risk determining module <b>323</b> in adjusting the security risk rating <b>325</b>. It is to be understood that the exact security information <b>307</b> to use to determine the security risk rating <b>325</b> of a given file <b>303</b> is a variable design parameter, as is any weightings assigned to different factors.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A behavior altering module <b>327</b> of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> can alter the behavior associated with the openings of given content-based files <b>303</b>, responsive to their associated security risk ratings <b>325</b>. For example, where the security risk rating <b>325</b> of a given content-based file <b>303</b> exceeds a given threshold, the behavior altering module <b>327</b> can block the opening of the content-based file <b>303</b> altogether, or alter the privileges and/or setting associated with the file <b>303</b> in order to alter its behavior (e.g., lower privileges, selectively disable settings to minimize potential damage from an attack/prevent an attack, etc.). For example, certain known exploits in Adobe Reader&#xae; allow a malicious PDF file <b>303</b> to carry out an attack on the computer <b>210</b> on which it is opened. These attacks typically involve the PDF file <b>303</b> utilizing JavaScript. Therefore, where the security risk rating <b>325</b> of a given PDF file <b>303</b> exceeds a given threshold, the behavior altering module <b>327</b> can disable the JavaScript engine for the instance of Adobe Reader&#xae; opening the file <b>303</b>. This can be achieved under Microsoft Windows&#xae; via the registry settings, more specifically by setting the value of the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\Acrobat Reader\9.0\JSPrefs\bEnableJS to 0 (it is to be understood that the exact name of the key can vary between versions of Microsoft Windows&#xae; and Abode Reader&#xae;). Another way to disable JavaScript access is to patch the process memory location to disable JavaScript engine functionality dynamically for the particular instance of Adobe Reader&#xae; processing the risky file <b>303</b>, thereby leaving JavaScript enabled for other files <b>303</b> that are trusted. Selectively disabling the JavaScript engine for high risk files <b>303</b> prevents the use by these files <b>303</b> of PDF exploits that use JavaScript to attack the user's computer <b>210</b>. The JavaScript engine can be disabled for other content processing applications <b>329</b> processing other file formats in a similar manner. Additionally, the JavaScript engine can be disabled for applications such as Internet browsers that load content processing applications <b>329</b> as plug-ins, where the security risk rating <b>325</b> of a content-based file <b>303</b> being opened exceeds a given threshold. Script processing engines for scripting formats other than JavaScript can be selectively disabled in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The behavior altering module <b>327</b> can also alter the behavior of content-based files <b>303</b> with security risk ratings <b>325</b> exceeding a given threshold in other ways. In some embodiments, the behavior altering module <b>327</b> can simply lower the access privileges or restrict some actions for the instance of the content processing application <b>329</b> opening the file <b>303</b>. More specific behavior altering actions can be taken as well, such as preventing the instance of the content processing application <b>329</b> from creating new files, editing files, or opening and/or accessing additional file system and/or operating system resources. In various embodiments, the behavior altering module <b>327</b> can modify settings and privileges, as well as employ conventional or other types of sandboxing techniques, to restrict the actions, behaviors and file and other system access available in association with the processing of content-based files <b>303</b> with security risk ratings <b>325</b> exceeding associated thresholds. It is to be understood that specifically what behavior altering steps to apply in response to specific security risk ratings <b>325</b> for specific files <b>303</b> of specific formats can vary between embodiments, as can the values of given thresholds beyond which to take such actions.</p>

The source reputation retrieving module <b>311</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can retrieve <b>405</b> the security reputation <b>317</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) from a reputation database <b>315</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Additionally, the application reputation retrieving module <b>313</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can retrieve <b>407</b> a security reputation <b>317</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of a specific content processing application <b>329</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) associated with the format of the content-based file <b>303</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) from the reputation database <b>315</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The file access detecting module <b>321</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) detects <b>409</b> an attempt to open the specific, content-based file <b>303</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and the content risk determining module <b>323</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the content source reputation management system <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) determines <b>411</b> a security risk rating <b>323</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) concerning the file <b>303</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) based on gleaned security information <b>307</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).
