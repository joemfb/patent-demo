<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the disclosure relate to tops for vehicles. More particularly, embodiments of the disclosure relate to a vehicle top which is suitable for convertible off-road sports vehicles and facilitates entry of sunlight and air into the passenger compartment of the vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Convertible off-road sports vehicles such as those of the JEEP&#xae; brand have increased in popularity in recent years due in large part to their off-road capabilities. Convertible off-road sports vehicles have an open passenger compartment. A frame which is fitted with a roll bar surrounds the passenger compartment to protect occupants in the event of an accident. A cover which is made of a soft canvas or canvas-like material can be detachably fitted on the frame. The cover typically has a non-transparent top with transparent or semi-transparent side and rear windows.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The conventional cover for convertible off-road sports vehicles forms an enclosure around and transmits little sunlight or air into the passenger compartment of the vehicle. Additionally, many of the conventional covers are not waterproof and fail to prevent entry of precipitation into the passenger compartment. Therefore, a vehicle top which is suitable for convertible off-road sports vehicles and facilitates entry of sunlight and air and prevents entry of precipitation into the passenger compartment of the vehicle is desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the disclosure are generally directed to a vehicle top for a convertible vehicle having a passenger compartment. An illustrative embodiment of the vehicle top includes a transparent or semi-transparent vehicle top panel adapted to attach to the vehicle and cover the passenger compartment, at least one pair of drip rails carried by the vehicle top panel on opposite sides of the vehicle top panel and at least one attachment mechanism carried by the vehicle top panel and adapted to attach the vehicle top panel to the vehicle.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the described embodiments or the application and uses of the described embodiments. As used herein, the word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; or &#x201c;illustrative&#x201d; means &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any implementation described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; or &#x201c;illustrative&#x201d; is non-limiting and is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. All of the implementations described below are exemplary implementations provided to enable persons skilled in the art to practice the disclosure and are not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. Moreover, the illustrative embodiments described herein are not exhaustive and embodiments or implementations other than those which are described herein and which fall within the scope of the appended claims are possible. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description. Relative terms such as &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;front&#x201d;, &#x2018;rear&#x201d;, &#x201c;side&#x201d;, &#x201c;interior&#x201d; and &#x201c;exterior&#x201d; as used herein are intended for descriptive purposes only and are not necessarily intended to be construed in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> of the drawings, an illustrative embodiment of the vehicle top is generally indicated by reference numeral <b>1</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and will be hereinafter described, the vehicle top <b>1</b> is adapted for attachment to a convertible vehicle <b>26</b> which in some applications may be a convertible off-road sports vehicle. The vehicle top <b>1</b> facilitates transmission of sunlight into a passenger compartment <b>33</b> of the vehicle <b>26</b> while preventing precipitation from entering the passenger compartment <b>33</b> during operation of the vehicle <b>26</b>. The vehicle top <b>1</b> may additionally shield occupants of the passenger compartment <b>33</b> from potentially harmful UV radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The vehicle top <b>1</b> includes a vehicle top panel <b>2</b> which may have a generally elongated, rectangular shape. The vehicle top panel <b>2</b> is a transparent or semi-transparent plastic material. In some embodiments, the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> may be a transparent or semi-transparent thermoplastic such as poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), for example and without limitation. The material of construction of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> may be selected to maximize transmission of visible light through the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> and filtering of UV radiation. The vehicle top panel <b>2</b> and other components of the vehicle top <b>1</b> can be molded using conventional vacuum-molding and/or other fabrication techniques which are known by those skilled in the art. The vehicle top panel <b>2</b> has a front panel edge <b>3</b> and a rear panel edge <b>4</b> which may be generally parallel to each other. The vehicle top panel <b>2</b> further includes an interior panel surface <b>5</b> and an exterior panel surface <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">At least one pair of drip rails <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> extends from opposite sides of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the drip rails <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> may include a pair of elongated front drip rails <b>10</b> which extend outwardly from respective sides of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b>. Each front drip rail <b>10</b> may extend rearwardly from the front panel edge <b>3</b> and terminate between the front panel edge <b>3</b> and the rear panel edge <b>4</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each front drip rail <b>10</b> may be generally curved in cross-section and is concave with respect to the interior panel surface <b>5</b> and convex with respect to the exterior panel surface <b>6</b>. Each front drip rail <b>10</b> may have an elongated front drip rail edge <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The drip rails <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> may further include a pair of elongated rear drip rails <b>12</b> which extend outwardly from respective sides of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b>. Each rear drip rail <b>12</b> may extend rearwardly from the corresponding front drip rail <b>10</b> and terminate at the rear panel edge <b>4</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each rear drip rail <b>12</b> may be generally curved in cross-section and is concave with respect to the interior panel surface <b>5</b> and convex with respect to the exterior panel surface <b>6</b>. Each rear drip rail <b>12</b> may have an outwardly-curved rear drip rail edge <b>12</b><i>a</i>. When the vehicle top <b>1</b> is deployed on the convertible off-road sports vehicle <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), as will be hereinafter described, the front drip rails <b>10</b> and the rear drip rails <b>12</b> curve downwardly from the plane of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The front drip rails <b>10</b> may conform in shape to the respective front doors (not illustrated) of the convertible off-road sports vehicle <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to which the vehicle top <b>1</b> is attached and maintain sufficient clearance to accommodate opening and closing of the doors. Therefore, in some embodiments, each rear drip rail <b>12</b> may extend further (have a greater extent of curvature) outwardly and downwardly from the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> than each front drip rail <b>10</b>, as illustrated. Accordingly, a drip rail notch <b>14</b> may transition between the front drip rail <b>10</b> and the rear drip rail <b>12</b> each side of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, in some embodiments, multiple panel stiffeners <b>16</b> may extend transversely across the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> for stiffening or reinforcing purposes. In the illustrative embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, three panel stiffeners <b>16</b> extend across the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> in substantially parallel, spaced-apart relationship to each other. In other embodiments, a greater or lesser number of the panel stiffeners <b>16</b> may extend across the vehicle top panel <b>2</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, in some embodiments, the panel stiffeners <b>16</b> may extend between the front drip rails <b>10</b> and between the rear drip rails <b>12</b> and may protrude from the interior panel surface <b>5</b> of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b>. The panel stiffeners <b>16</b> may be molded or otherwise fabricated into the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> according to the knowledge of those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, in some embodiments, multiple strakes <b>18</b> may extend longitudinally along the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> for stiffening or reinforcing purposes. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the strakes <b>18</b> may intersect the panel stiffeners <b>16</b>. In the illustrative embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, seven strakes <b>18</b> extend across the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> in substantially parallel, spaced-apart relationship to each other. In other embodiments, a greater or lesser number of the strakes <b>18</b> may extend across the vehicle top panel <b>2</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in some embodiments, the strakes <b>18</b> may extend between the front panel edge <b>3</b> and the rear panel edge <b>4</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the strakes <b>18</b> may protrude from the interior panel surface <b>5</b> of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b>. The strakes <b>18</b> may be molded or otherwise fabricated into the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> according to the knowledge of those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> may be fitted with at least one attachment mechanism <b>21</b> which facilitates attachment of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> to the vehicle <b>26</b>. The attachment mechanism <b>21</b> may include but is not limited to standard methods or techniques used to attach vehicle covers to the passenger compartment frame <b>28</b> at the conventional factory attachment points. In some embodiments, the attachment mechanism <b>21</b> may include at least one panel clamp <b>22</b> which may be attached to the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> according to the knowledge of those skilled in the art and facilitates attachment of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> to the vehicle <b>26</b> typically as will be hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>8</b> of the drawings, exemplary implementation of an illustrative embodiment of the vehicle top <b>1</b> is illustrated. When deployed on a convertible off-road sports vehicle <b>26</b>, the vehicle top <b>1</b> facilitates entry of sunlight into the passenger compartment <b>33</b> of the vehicle <b>26</b> while preventing rainwater from dripping from the vehicle top <b>1</b> into the passenger compartment <b>33</b>. In some applications, the convertible off-road sports vehicle <b>26</b> may be a JEEP&#x2122; vehicle. Accordingly, the vehicle <b>26</b> generally may include a vehicle chassis <b>27</b> from which extends a passenger compartment frame <b>28</b>. The passenger compartment frame <b>28</b> encloses a passenger compartment <b>33</b>. The passenger compartment frame <b>28</b> may include a pair of rear frame members <b>29</b>, a pair of top frame members <b>30</b> which extend forwardly from the respective rear frame members <b>29</b> and roll bars <b>31</b> which extend upwardly from the vehicle chassis <b>27</b> to the top frame members <b>30</b>. A windshield frame <b>32</b> extends from the vehicle chassis <b>27</b> at the front of the passenger compartment <b>33</b> and may be reinforced by the top frame members <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, the vehicle top <b>1</b> may be attached to the passenger compartment frame <b>28</b> by first orienting the front panel edge <b>3</b> with the windshield frame <b>32</b> and then extending the front drip rails <b>10</b> and the rear drip rails <b>12</b> over the top and side surfaces of the respective top frame members <b>30</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> may be secured to the windshield frame <b>32</b> by attaching the panel clamp or clamps <b>22</b> of the attachment mechanism <b>21</b> to the windshield frame <b>32</b>. In some embodiments, the attachment mechanism <b>21</b> may include a pair of panel attachment straps <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) which secures the rear portion of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> to the rear frame members <b>29</b> and/or the top frame members <b>30</b> of the passenger compartment frame <b>28</b>. Additional or alternative attachment mechanisms known by those skilled in the art may be used to attach the vehicle top <b>1</b> to the passenger compartment frame <b>28</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> may be configured to cover the entire portion of the passenger compartment <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">During operation of the vehicle <b>26</b>, the vehicle top <b>1</b> offers the impression that the vehicle <b>26</b> is topless to occupants in the passenger compartment <b>33</b> while facilitating transmission of sunlight directly from above the vehicle <b>26</b> into the passenger compartment <b>33</b> and preventing entry of precipitation into the passenger compartment <b>33</b>. The vehicle top <b>1</b> may additionally prevent or minimize entry of potentially harmful UV radiation into the passenger compartment <b>33</b>. The front drip rails <b>10</b> and the rear drip rails <b>12</b> extend outwardly and downwardly from the respective top frame members <b>30</b> of the passenger compartment frame <b>28</b> and facilitate runoff of precipitation (not illustrated) from the respective sides of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b>. Therefore, the front drip rails <b>10</b> and the rear drip rails <b>12</b> prevent the precipitation from dripping off the sides of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> into the passenger compartment <b>33</b>. When use is not desired, the vehicle top <b>1</b> can be selectively removed from the vehicle <b>26</b> by detaching the panel clamps <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) from the windshield frame <b>32</b> and detaching the rear portion of the vehicle top panel <b>2</b> from the rear frame members <b>29</b> and/or the top frame members <b>30</b> of the passenger compartment frame <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the vehicle top <b>1</b> gives occupants of the vehicle <b>26</b> the impression that the vehicle <b>26</b> is being operated without a cover while protecting the occupants from potentially harmful UV radiation and precipitation. The vehicle top <b>1</b> can be fabricated in one piece with a lightweight construction to enable as few as one person to selectively deploy the vehicle top <b>1</b> on or remove the vehicle top <b>1</b> from the vehicle <b>26</b>. The attachment mechanism <b>21</b> may include but is not limited to provisions for attachment of the vehicle top <b>1</b> to the passenger compartment frame <b>28</b> at the conventional factory attachment points for vehicle covers.</p>
