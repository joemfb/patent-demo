<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method, system, and medium are provided for efficiently locating a desired item within an ordered list of items, such as a list of contacts, pictures, or football teams. An illustrative method includes presenting a selectable option on a mobile device's display, presenting a positional indicator on the display when the selectable option has been selected that indicates to the user its position within the ordered list of items, and if the selectable option is moved, dynamically indicating the positional indicator's position among the list of items. The selection of the selectable option may be made by any object, such as a finger or stylus. Further, releasing the selection of the selectable option, such as removing the object used from the display, allows for a display of an item in the ordered list of items that corresponds to the position of the positional indicator.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An aspect of an embodiment of the present invention includes an ability to view notification of new events with minimal effort by way of a mobile communications device. In one embodiment, a way to provide notification of new events (such as receiving a voicemail, instant message, etc.) is to provide a dynamically updateable list of items that indicates a change in status of an event, wherein the list is viewable by touching a predetermined region on a touchscreen device that is part of the mobile communications device.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, another representation of a mobile communications device is provided and referenced generally by the numeral <b>210</b>. We use a separate reference numeral to help map the instant text to a relevant figure, but we do not mean to convey that mobile device <b>210</b> is different than any of the other many references to a mobile device throughout this disclosure, including the block-diagram representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Mobile device <b>210</b> includes a display <b>212</b>, which in one embodiment is a touchscreen display that is able to receive input by way of touch actions or interactions. Touchscreen display <b>212</b> may be adapted to receive any number of types of touch actions such as single touches, taps, slides, or other gestures. Additionally, in various embodiments, touchscreen display <b>212</b> may be adapted to receive multiple simultaneous touch actions that may generate a type of input distinct from input generated by a single touch action.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Touchscreen display <b>212</b> also includes a predetermined region <b>214</b> that includes one or more dynamic icons <b>216</b> which indicate a state associated with the mobile communications device <b>210</b>. As used herein, a state associated with the mobile communications device <b>210</b> may include any configuration of settings, features, event notifications, etc. associated with the functionality of the device <b>210</b>. For example, in one embodiment, dynamic icons <b>216</b> may indicate that, as part of the state of the device <b>210</b>, the battery power is at 100%, the radio signal is at a certain strength, the time of day, or any number of other state variables known in the art. We do not mean to limit the nature of the dynamic icons displayed in the predetermined region <b>214</b> herein, and it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any number of icons can be included to provide information of any kind.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the predetermined region may be provided without including icons, and in other embodiments, the predetermined region may be provided in any area of the touchscreen display <b>212</b>. For clarity and consistency, we illustrate predetermined region <b>214</b> as being provided at the top of touchscreen display <b>212</b> but do not mean to limit the arrangement to that illustrated herein. In an embodiment of the present invention, predetermined region <b>214</b> may be persistently presented. That is, regardless of what is being displayed on the touchscreen display <b>212</b>, the predetermined region <b>214</b> is always displayed. Additionally, regardless of any type of application that is running, or any other type of functionality that is being presented on display <b>212</b>, the predetermined region <b>214</b> may be visible. In various embodiments, predetermined region <b>214</b> is persistently visible, even when transitioning between a first and second screen displayed on the touchscreen display <b>212</b>. It should be evident that the functionality associated with the display of predetermined region <b>214</b> is generally independent of many other aspects of the mobile communications device <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In further embodiments, exceptions may be made for the persistent display of predetermined region <b>214</b> such as, for example, when an application is being utilized that requires all of the screen real estate of display <b>212</b>. Such an application may correspond to a text input mode presented in landscape orientation or portrait orientation, an audio/video presentation, and the like. Various modifications of such an exception may be made, including having no exception, and any one or combination of such configurations is intended to be within the ambit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Predetermined region <b>214</b> may also include a dynamic icon <b>218</b> that indicates whether a new event has occurred. As used herein, a new event may include things such as receiving a phone call, message (e.g., a voicemail, an email, a text message, and the like), initiating an alarm, receiving a file (e.g., a picture, an audio file, a video file, and the like), or arriving at a time associated with a calendared event, which may be an event that, upon occurrence, triggers an alarm, notification, or reminder to be presented. In one embodiment, dynamic icon <b>218</b> may be a particular image corresponding to a particular event. For example, dynamic icon <b>218</b> may appear as a phone handset when a new call is received.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, dynamic icon <b>218</b> may be represented as a generic image that indicates that a new event of any kind has occurred. That is, dynamic icon <b>218</b> may not be specific to any particular type of event, but rather may provide an indication that some event, whatever it is, has occurred. It will be appreciated that dynamic icon <b>218</b> can be represented with any type of image. For simplicity and clarity, dynamic icon <b>218</b> is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> and subsequent figures as a star. We do not mean, by this representation, to suggest that dynamic icon <b>218</b> must, or even should, be represented by a star, as any type of image or symbol may be equally as useful. A star is used herein as an arbitrary choice that provides clarity and consistency between the various figures.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an embodiment of the present invention, predetermined region <b>214</b> is capable of receiving touch input. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that touchscreen display <b>212</b> may include numerous areas or regions (including the entire touchscreen display <b>212</b>) that are capable of receiving touch input, and that the functionality provided by touch input at a particular location of touchscreen display <b>212</b> may vary, depending on particular applications, underlying operating systems, and the like. In an embodiment, predetermined region <b>214</b> may be configured in such a way that touch input to the predetermined region <b>214</b> always produces the same type of functionality. For example, as described further below, touch input to predetermined region <b>214</b> may always result in the presentation of a list of items.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, a mobile communications device <b>210</b> is shown which includes predetermined region <b>214</b> capable of receiving touch input. A user's finger <b>220</b> is shown making contact with the touchscreen display <b>212</b> in the predetermined region <b>214</b>. As described above, such a contact may be a touch input which may be received in predetermined region <b>214</b> and may result in some functionality within the mobile communications device <b>210</b>. Although the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> shows a touch input by way of contact between a user's finger <b>220</b> and the touchscreen display <b>212</b>, we do not mean to limit the capability of touchscreen display <b>212</b> to receiving touch input from a finger. Touchscreen device <b>212</b> may also be capable of receiving touch input as a result of contact with another object such as, for example, a stylus. In some embodiments, touch input may be accomplished by way of any object coming into contact with touchscreen display <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, according to an embodiment of the invention, a list <b>222</b> of items may be presented incident to a touch input received by way of the predetermined region <b>214</b>. Touch input may include any number of touch actions or gestures as described above. In one embodiment, only a single touch action such as, for example, a tap, is necessary to produce the functionality described herein with reference to the predetermined region <b>214</b>. In an embodiment, a subsequent similar touch action such as a single tap may cause the reverse effect of discontinuing the presentation of, for example, the list <b>222</b>. In an embodiment, the list <b>222</b> of items may provide a set of statuses of events. Statuses of events may include things such as whether a new event has occurred, the time since the last event occurred, whether an event has been responded to in some way, and the like. In an embodiment, the list <b>222</b> may present a list of items, each of which indicates that a new event of some kind has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an embodiment, the presentation displayed incident to receiving touch input in the predetermined region <b>214</b> may be superimposed over the top of whatever is being displayed or interacted with on the touchscreen display <b>212</b> such that the presentation does not interfere with anything associated with that which is being displayed on display <b>212</b>. Also, the presentation may be displayed without having to first (or concurrently) transition away from the screen being displayed previous to receiving touch input to predetermined region <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, a contacts menu may be displayed on touchscreen display <b>212</b> before touch input is received in the predetermined region <b>214</b>. A user may be interacting with the contacts menu such as by creating a new contact, selecting an existing contact, editing an entry and the like, when the user decides to provide touch input to the predetermined region <b>214</b>. In an embodiment, upon receiving that touch input, the listing <b>222</b> may be superimposed over the top of the contacts menu without changing the state of any functionality or display characteristics associated with the contacts menu. Thus, when the user causes a further touch input to the predetermined region, in an embodiment, the list <b>222</b> may be removed from the display, revealing the contacts menu, which may be displayed in exactly the same state that it was before the user interacted with the predetermined region <b>214</b>. This way, new events or other information may be viewed without interrupting the functionality of a current application, and without having to exit or transition from a current screen to another.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Additionally, touch input by way of predetermined region <b>214</b> may result in a presentation of information <b>224</b> associated with one or more of the dynamic icons <b>216</b>. Although both the list <b>222</b> and the information <b>224</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, in another embodiment, only a list <b>222</b> is presented incident to receiving touch input to the predetermined region <b>214</b>. In a further embodiment, only the information <b>224</b> is provided incident to receiving touch input to predetermined region <b>214</b>. In still further embodiments, either one or both of the list <b>222</b> and/or the information <b>224</b> may be provided depending on any number of circumstances which may be addressed by incorporating particular rules or conditions, as understood by those skilled in the art, into the programs and other code that control the functionality of device <b>210</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the information <b>224</b> may always be displayed incident to receiving touch input to the predetermined region <b>214</b>, even though the list <b>222</b> may not be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, additional detail is provided to help describe the nature of the information <b>224</b> and list <b>222</b>, which are blown up for detail, that are provided incident to receiving touch input by way of predetermined region <b>214</b>. As shown in the figure, the information <b>224</b> may include information associated with any number of the dynamic icons <b>216</b> provided in the predetermined region <b>214</b>. In an embodiment, the information <b>224</b> provides explanation or detail regarding the icons <b>216</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, information in the form of text <b>226</b> is provided which indicates an aspect of the state of the device <b>210</b> that corresponds to information indicated by one or more of the icons <b>216</b>. An image <b>228</b> is also provided. The image <b>228</b> may include a duplicate of a dynamic icon <b>216</b>, a check box, or any other image.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Moreover, the contents of the information <b>224</b> may be somewhat static, completely static, somewhat dynamic, or completely dynamic. For instance, in an embodiment, the information <b>224</b> may always contain images of icons and text describing what the icons represent. In other embodiments, the icons and associated text provided may vary depending on which icons are presented in the predetermined region. In another embodiment, the information <b>224</b> may present a duplicate icon along with text explaining the status of the functionality represented by the icon, which may vary depending on the state of the device <b>210</b>. In still a further embodiment, text may be provided along with a check box, that when checked indicates that the subject matter of the text is relevant to the current state of the device <b>210</b>. Any number of combinations of the above examples, including other possibilities and configurations are possible and are intended to be within the ambit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a list <b>222</b> of items <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> is shown. In an embodiment, the list <b>222</b> may contain fewer items than illustrated, and in another embodiment, the list <b>222</b> may contain more items than illustrated. In one embodiment, the list <b>222</b> may contain more items than will fit within the display area of the touchscreen display <b>212</b> and a scrolling function may be provided to display additional items. The items <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> present statuses of events such as, for example, new events. New events may be events that have occurred without any notification other than that presented within the list <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">That is, in one case a user may be interacting with a screen that lists text messages received. While interacting with or viewing that screen, a new text message may be received. In this case, the user may be notified of the receipt of the new text message by seeing an indication on the screen with which the user is interacting. In one embodiment, this new message is not included as a new event in the listing <b>222</b>. However, in a similar embodiment, if a new voicemail is received while the user is interacting within the text message screen, the new voicemail may be included in the listing <b>222</b> as a new event.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In other embodiments, an event may be included in the list <b>222</b> so long as the event has not been acted on by a user. That is, so long as a user does not view, reply to, interact with, or in some other way confirm receipt or notification of the event, the event may be included in the list <b>222</b>. In still further embodiments, the list <b>222</b> may be adapted to be configured by a user such that the user can determine the conditions under which an event will be included in the list <b>222</b>. Similarly, any number of possibilities exist for the type of status of an event that may be reflected in the listing <b>222</b> of statuses, as will be understood by the description above.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an embodiment, the list may include any number of items <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> that present statuses of events. The items <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> may be dynamically updateable, in that their presentation may vary as new events occur, as statuses of events change, etc. In an embodiment, the list <b>222</b> only includes items <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> that correspond to a particular status such as &#x201c;new.&#x201d; Thus, for example, if the only new event that the device <b>210</b> has received (or has observed the occurrence of) the list <b>222</b> may only present that single item. In another embodiment, the list <b>222</b> may present a set of statuses for events wherein the set of events represented remains consistent, but the notification of the statuses changes. This feature may also be one that is inherent to the functionality of the device <b>210</b>, or in other embodiments may be a feature that is configurable by a user or service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, an item <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> within the listing <b>222</b> may include any number of types of information. In an embodiment, a text string <b>244</b> is provided which indicates the type of event associated with the particular item <b>232</b>. Each item <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> may contain such a text string. Additionally, an image <b>242</b> is provided, as shown in item <b>230</b>. The image <b>242</b> may be any type of image, and in one embodiment, the image corresponds to the type of event associated with the item <b>230</b>. In another embodiment, the image <b>242</b> corresponds to the specific event that corresponds to the item <b>230</b>. For example, if a new email is received, the item <b>232</b> representing that new event may include an image <b>242</b> that includes a picture of the sender of the new email. In a further embodiment, an image is not provided. Additionally, an indicator <b>246</b> is provided that indicates the number of new events associated with a particular type of event. Thus, for example, if one new email has arrived, the indicator <b>246</b> may be a numeral &#x201c;1.&#x201d; The information presented within an item <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> may take any number of different forms and may be preset, determined by a service provider, a user, or any other party or functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an embodiment, items <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> are capable of being interacted with by touch input, which can include focus interactions or even motion gestures. That is, each of items <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> may include a particular region or area of the touchscreen display <b>212</b> that is capable of receiving touch input. Upon receiving touch input to an item <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b>, further information may be presented. That further information, in an embodiment, corresponds to the event or events associated with the item that received touch input. For example, incident to receiving touch input to the item <b>232</b> associated with receipt of a new email, further information such as the time, sender, subject, etc., of the email may be provided. In another embodiment, touch input to item <b>232</b> may result in the presentation of the text of the new email. In still further embodiments, touch input to item <b>232</b> may cause the presentation of an email inbox, listing all or a portion of received email messages. It will be appreciated that any number of the above, combinations of the above, or other configurations may be utilized in presenting further information incident to receiving touch input to an item.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">To recapitulate, we have described an aspect of the invention that relates to performing a method of presenting on a user interface of a mobile communications device a persistently visible predetermined region capable of receiving touch input. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, one embodiment of this method includes, at a step <b>320</b>, on a user interface, presenting a persistently visible predetermined region capable of receiving touch input on a first screen. The first screen on which the predetermined region is presented may present a first set of information. Additionally, the predetermined region is capable of being interacted with by way of a touch input such that receiving a touch input to the predetermined region causes a listing of a set of statuses of events to be presented, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first set of information may include any information associated with a feature, aspect, functionality, option, etc., of the mobile communications device. For example, the first screen may include a menu that presents information in the form of items that correspond to further menus, lists, applications, or other features. We do not mean to limit the scope of the first set of information as used herein, and recognize that the first set of information may be anything displayable on a display device of a mobile communications device, and may include text, objects, items, graphics, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A step <b>322</b> includes transitioning to a second screen that presents a second set of information while presenting the predetermined region. The second set of information, like the first set of information, may include anything displayable on a mobile communications device. Additionally, the predetermined region is persistently viewable during and after the transition. At a step <b>324</b>, a touch input is received to the predetermined region. Incident to receiving the touch input, at a step <b>326</b>, a listing of a set of statuses of events is presented. As indicated above, the listing may be presented without affecting the functionality of the second screen, and may be superimposed over the second set of information, such that a subsequent touch input may remove the listing, revealing the second set of information associated with the second screen.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, another embodiment of the invention is provided that includes, at a step <b>340</b>, providing a set of screens that present options that a user can invoke to cause information to be provided to the mobile communications device. Generally, one of the set of screens is displayed at any given time. It will be appreciated that the options presented may include any number of objects, items, buttons, and the like that allow a user to interact with various features, functions, applications, etc. These options may include objects, information, representations, items, and the like as described herein and elsewhere within this disclosure as well as those that are not described.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At a step <b>342</b>, a persistently visible predetermined region capable of receiving touch input is presented across each of the screens such that the predetermined region is never unavailable when any one of the screens is presented. At a step <b>344</b>, touch input is received to the predetermined region, and incident to receiving that touch input, at a step <b>346</b>, a set of statuses of events is displayed on a display of a mobile communications device.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, another embodiment of the present invention is provided that includes, at a step <b>350</b>, presenting a persistently visible predetermined region on a first screen of a mobile communications device. The persistently visible predetermined region is capable of receiving touch input. A step <b>352</b> includes transitioning from the first screen to a second screen, wherein the predetermined region is persistently visible from the second screen in the same manner as it was on the first screen. At a step <b>354</b>, a single touch action is received by way of the predetermined region. In an embodiment, a single touch action includes only one contact such as a tap from a finger or stylus in the predetermined region. It is important to note that the single touch action does not include transitioning away from the second screen, and that nothing about the display or functionality of the second screen is affected incident to the single touch action received in step <b>354</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a final illustrative step, step <b>356</b>, a dynamically updateable list is presented which includes at least one item that conveys a status of an event. If an event experiences a change from a first state to a second state, the change is reflected in the list. It should be understood, in light of the description above, that a change in status as described herein may include any number of status changes related to an event such as the receipt of a new event, an aging of a previous event by a certain duration, an updated event, an occurrence of a calendared event, and the like.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Correcting Data Inputted into a Mobile Communications Device</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">An aspect of an embodiment of the present invention includes an ability to input and correct data inputted into a mobile communications device using a touchscreen. In one embodiment, a way to input data (e.g., text, character strings, etc.) is to provide a modal keypad on a touchscreen display of a mobile communications device that is capable of receiving touch input. Character strings and other text inputted by way of the modal keyboard is checked against recognized character strings, and an option for automatically correcting incorrectly inputted character strings is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a mobile communications device <b>410</b> is shown. As before, we use a separate reference numeral to help map the instant text to a relevant figure, but we do not mean to convey that mobile device <b>410</b> is different than any of the other many references to a mobile device throughout this disclosure, including the block-diagram representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the mobile device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref>. Mobile device <b>410</b> includes a display <b>412</b>, which in one embodiment is a touchscreen display that is able to receive input by way of touch actions or interactions.

Additionally, in various embodiments, touchscreen display <b>412</b> may be adapted to receive multiple simultaneous touch actions that may generate a type of input distinct from input generated by a single touch action. Further, touchscreen display <b>412</b> may be adapted to receive touch input by way of contact with any number of objects such as, for example, a finger or a stylus.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Touchscreen display <b>412</b> includes a region <b>414</b> that contains various icons, indicators, and the like. In one embodiment, the region <b>414</b> is a persistently visual predetermined region capable of receiving touch input, as described above. In another embodiment, region <b>414</b> may be adapted to contain any number of icons or indicators of any kind. In a further embodiment, touchscreen display <b>412</b> does not contain a region <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Touchscreen display <b>412</b> is shown to display a modal keypad <b>416</b>. As used herein, a modal keypad includes a set of objects that are displayed on a touchscreen display <b>412</b> of a mobile communications device <b>410</b>, where each of the set of objects represents a letter, number, punctuation mark, or other character or set of characters. The modal keypad <b>416</b> may also include other objects representing buttons that have other functionality associated therewith such as, for example, a space bar, a return key, and a caps-lock button, as shown in row <b>418</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Other such objects may include, for example, a &#x201c;done&#x201d; button, a screen-toggle button (for toggling between different screens such as a modal keypad and a screen showing only character input), or a keypad-toggle button (such as a button for toggling between a keypad having letters to a keypad having numbers), as shown in row <b>420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Each of the objects displayed as part of the modal keypad <b>416</b> are capable of receiving touch input so that a user may interact with them in a conventional manner. In an embodiment, touch input to an object representing a character or characters causes that character or characters to appear as text on a viewing screen <b>422</b> provided on the touchscreen display <b>412</b>. Viewing screen <b>422</b> displays characters <b>424</b> inputted by way of touch actions to the modal keypad <b>416</b> and may be oriented in any number of manners. Although viewing screen <b>422</b> is shown, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, as oriented above the modal keypad <b>416</b>, we do not intend to limit embodiments to this orientation. Viewing screen <b>422</b> may be oriented above, below, within, to the side, or in any other manner with respect to modal keypad <b>416</b>. One such alternative orientation, for example, is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, which shows a &#x201c;landscape&#x201d; oriented modal keypad <b>416</b> and viewing screen <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, modal keypad <b>416</b> may include any number of arrangements of objects therein, and although we only illustrate a few of the possible configurations herein, we do not intent to limit the arrangements that other embodiments of the present invention may employ. For example, in one embodiment, modal keypad <b>416</b> may include all of the letters of an alphabet, listed in order in rows, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that modal keypad <b>416</b> may be provided with objects representing characters of any language, including but not limited to, mathematic and scientific languages. Modal keypad <b>416</b> may, as indicated above, also be presented in any number of arrangements such as the &#x201c;landscape&#x201d; arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Turning briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a mobile communications device <b>410</b> is shown. Touchscreen display <b>412</b> includes a modal keypad <b>440</b>, oriented in a &#x201c;landscape&#x201d; fashion. That is, the characters displayed within the modal keypad <b>440</b> are positioned such that they are upright when the phone is held sideways, wherein the axis connecting the top and bottom of the device <b>410</b> is parallel with the ground. The &#x201c;landscape&#x201d; orientation is known in the art, and we do not mean to vary the general impression that the use of that word gives to the reader. Modal keypad <b>440</b> is disposed just below viewing screen <b>422</b>. In an embodiment, a modal keypad may be arranged with alphabetical characters arranged in a typical &#x201c;QWERTY&#x201d; keyboard fashion, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. In other embodiments, some of which may include characters from languages other than English, the characters may be arranged in any number of other ways. We do not intend to limit the arrangement possibilities by the illustrations provided herein, but illustrate only a few of the possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Additionally, whether the modal keypad is oriented as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, or in some other manner, the modal keypad may contain any type of character that may be useful as character string input. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> illustrate modal keypads <b>416</b>, <b>440</b> as displaying alphabetical characters (i.e., letters), and various punctuation marks. Other embodiments may include, as illustrated in rows <b>452</b> and <b>454</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, characters such as numerals, various symbols, or even portions of character strings, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. In an embodiment such as the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, for example, a modal keypad <b>412</b> may include commonly used character strings such as portions of e-mail addresses (e.g., &#x201c;MAIL.&#x201d;, &#x201c;.org&#x201d;, &#x201c;.com&#x201d;, etc.) or uniform resource locators, or portions, (&#x201c;WWW.&#x201d;, &#x201c;HTTP://&#x201d;, &#x201c;.com&#x201d;, etc.), as shown in rows <b>456</b> and <b>458</b>. It will be understood that any character strings or character string portions may be included in a modal keypad <b>416</b>. In some embodiments, modal keypad <b>416</b> may be adapted to allow a user to choose the contents thereof, and may in other embodiments, allow the user to define the contents or objects included.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a set of character strings <b>424</b> representing text is shown as being displayed in viewing window <b>422</b>. The viewing window <b>422</b> also includes a cursor <b>429</b> that indicates the position at which the next inputted character will be displayed. In an embodiment, inputted text or data represented by characters may be checked for accuracy such as, for example, by comparing the inputted character string to recognized character strings. Recognized character strings may be contained in any number of dictionary databases, such as, for example, database <b>114</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In an embodiment, inputted text or data takes the form of a user-entered character string. In one embodiment, a user-entered character string may be checked for accuracy after it has been inputted. In another embodiment, a user-entered character string may be continuously checked for accuracy while it is being entered.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For instance, in one embodiment, an application such as an input method application or predictive text application may compare the character string to recognized character strings as the user enters the character string, and the interpretation thereof may continuously change in pace with the user's entering of data, finally resting on a most likely interpretation when the user has completed entering data. For example, one such application that may be used or modified for this purpose is the XT9 Smart Input predictive text solution, available from Nuance Communications, Inc. of Burlington, Mass. In one embodiment, the continuous results of the accuracy may be displayed on the touchscreen display <b>412</b> as the user enters the character string. In another embodiment, the continuous results may not be displayed on the touchscreen display <b>412</b>, and only the final interpretation may be displayed. In yet another embodiment, none of the interpretations or corrections may be displayed, where the exact characters that the user has entered will be displayed. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the correction application may be configured in any other manner, so long as it is configured to compare, in some way, user-entered character strings to recognized character strings. Recognized character strings may include correctly spelled words, commonly used words (although incorrectly spelled), or any other type of word or character string that is included in the dictionary database. In some embodiments, as described further below, one or more of the recognized character strings contained in a dictionary database may be entered into the database by a user or other individual, application, program, or functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In any of the embodiments described above, when a user-entered character string is received, the device <b>412</b> may determine one or more suggestions for replacing the user-entered character string. In an embodiment, suggestions for replacing the user-entered character string may be determined only in the case where the user-entered character string is not a recognized character string. In other embodiments, suggestions may be provided regardless of whether the user-entered character string is recognized. In still further embodiments, the determination of suggestions may be dependent upon any number of factors, which may be established by a programmer, an application, or even a user, for example. Suggestions may include other character strings containing similar characters, character arrangements, and the like, and may be further based upon other factors such as context, dialect, grammar, and the like. Any number of suggestions may be determined. In one embodiment, for example, one or two suggestions may be determined. In another embodiment, three or more suggestions may be determined. In various embodiments, the number of suggestions determined may also be based upon various factors such as, for example, those described above.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an embodiment of the present invention, after determining a suggestion for replacing a character string, the user-entered character string may be marked with a visual indication that a suggestion for replacement thereof has been determined. In an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, such a visual indication may include underlining the user-entered character string. In other embodiments, other types of visual indications may be used such as, for example, highlighting, bolding, or displaying the user-entered character string in a different color. We do not intend to limit the possibilities that may be used for marking a character string with a visual indication as described herein, as any sort of visual indication may be sufficient to accomplish the goals and objectives of the various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In another embodiment, an automatic-correction function is provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the automatic-correction function may operate in much the same way as above, but includes automatically replacing the user-entered character string <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> with a suggested character string <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>. In some embodiments, the suggested character string <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> that replaces the user-entered character string may include the first suggested character string determined. In other embodiments, the various suggested character strings determined may be ranked according to the likelihood that a user intended to enter any one of the various suggested character strings when the user actually entered the user-entered character string, and the suggested character string <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> used to replace the user-entered character string may be the character string with highest ranking. In other embodiments, the suggested character string <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> used to replace the user-entered character string may be determined by any number of other factors and is not meant to be limited by our disclosure herein.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In an embodiment, the suggested character string <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> that replaces the user-entered character string may be marked with a visual indication that the suggested character string <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> has replaced the user-entered character string <b>426</b>, <b>428</b>. The visual indication may take any form, as described above with respect to the user-entered character string. In an embodiment, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the suggested character string <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> may be marked with a visual indication such as by underlining the suggested character string <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>. As above, the suggested character string <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> may also be marked by bolding, highlighting, changing its color, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Additionally, in an embodiment, an input region <b>434</b> is provided that is associated with the visual indication, whether the visual indication corresponds to a user-entered character string <b>426</b>, or a suggested character string <b>430</b>. The input region <b>434</b> is capable of receiving touch input. Upon receiving touch input to the input region <b>434</b>, which may be defined by any amount of space surrounding and/or including the character string having the visual indication, a set of alternative suggestions for replacing the character string may be provided. In an embodiment of the present invention, cursor <b>429</b> may be unaffected by user input to the input region <b>434</b>. That is, even though a user may interact with the input region <b>434</b>, the cursor <b>429</b> will remain in the position in which it was before the user interacted with input region <b>434</b>, thus allowing for a user to perform editing and be able to rapidly return to inputting data.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, a mobile communications device <b>410</b> is shown. On a touchscreen display <b>412</b>, a viewing screen <b>422</b> contains a set of user-entered character strings <b>468</b>. One of the user-entered character strings <b>470</b> is shown and has been marked with a visual indication that a suggested character string has been determined in relation thereto. Upon receiving user input to an input region <b>471</b>, defined in association with the marked user-entered character string <b>470</b>, a set of alternative suggested character strings <b>474</b>, <b>476</b> is shown in a user interface <b>472</b>. In an embodiment, user interface <b>472</b> may replace all or a portion of the modal keypad. In another embodiment, the user interface <b>472</b> may be provided in addition to the modal keypad, such as by providing the user interface within some region of the viewing screen <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">It should be understood that, although we illustrate four alternative suggested character strings, any number of alternative suggested character strings may be provided. For example, in an embodiment, one, two, or three alternative suggested character strings may be provided. In a further embodiment, five or more alternative character strings may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In another embodiment, a button <b>484</b> capable of receiving touch input may be provided for allowing a user to select an active or inactive state corresponding to the automatic-correction function. In other words, a user, by interacting with a button <b>484</b>, may be able to turn the automatic-correction function on or off. It will be appreciated that the automatic-correction function may also be toggled between the active and inactive states in any number of other ways. For example, in one embodiment, the option for setting the auto-correction function to a particular state may be provided in a menu such as, for example, a settings or options menu. In other embodiments, the option for selecting between active and inactive states for the automatic-correction function may be presented in a predetermined region of the touchscreen. In a further embodiment, for example, the option may be available as a series of keystrokes or by a particular touch input anywhere or in a certain region of the touchscreen display. It will be further appreciated by those skilled in the art that any number of additional buttons, options, and the like may be provided for allowing a user to perform any number of other functions by interacting therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In an embodiment, each of the alternative suggested character strings <b>474</b>, <b>476</b> has at least one character in common with the user-entered character string. In other embodiments, the alternative suggested character strings <b>474</b>, <b>476</b> include the user-entered character string <b>474</b>. In another embodiment, the set of alternative suggested character strings <b>474</b>, <b>476</b> includes a suggested character string that is used to automatically replace the user-entered character string, in which case the character string <b>470</b> may actually have been replaced by a character string such as suggested character string <b>476</b>. Each of the alternative suggested character strings <b>474</b>, <b>476</b> may also have an associated input region <b>475</b> capable of receiving touch input. In an embodiment, incident to receiving touch input to an alternative suggested character string <b>474</b>, <b>476</b> by way of an associated touch region <b>475</b> the user-entered character string <b>470</b> is replaced by the alternative suggested character string with which the input region is associated.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, a user may have entered the character string &#x201c;TYEPING&#x201d; where the user actually meant to enter the word &#x201c;TYPING.&#x201d; Unless the user-entered character had been automatically replaced by the word &#x201c;TYPING,&#x201d; the user may cause that replacement to occur by causing touch input to the input region <b>475</b> associated with the alternative suggested character string <b>476</b> &#x201c;TYPING.&#x201d; However, it may be the case that the user does not wish to replace the user-entered character string with a suggested character string. If the automatic-correction function had previously caused the replacement to occur, the user may undo the replacement by simply causing touch input to the input region <b>475</b> associated with the user-entered character string &#x201c;TEYPING.&#x201d; In some cases, a user may wish to add a user-entered character string as a recognized character string in the dictionary database of the device <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In an embodiment, the user interface presents a &#x201c;learn&#x201d; button <b>480</b> and an &#x201c;unlearn&#x201d; button <b>482</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>. Each of the buttons <b>480</b>, <b>482</b> is receiving touch input. Upon receiving touch input to the &#x201c;learn&#x201d; button <b>480</b>, a selected user-entered character string <b>470</b> may be added to the dictionary database such that the user-entered character string <b>470</b> becomes a recognized character string. In an embodiment of the present invention, as a recognized character string, the user-entered character string <b>470</b> may not be subject to correction and/or alternative suggested character strings being provided in the future. Additionally, the now-recognized user-entered character string <b>470</b> may be used as an alternative suggested character string in the future. Other embodiments provide for adding, or learning, a user-entered character string automatically such as by entering a user-entered character string into the dictionary database after receiving input comprising that character string a plurality of times. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various configurations are possible to accomplish this same objective, as well as that such an automatic learning function may be implemented in addition to any number of the various features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In an embodiment of the present invention, upon receiving touch input to the &#x201c;unlearn&#x201d; button <b>482</b>, a suggested character string may be removed from the dictionary database. For example, a user may spell a name incorrectly several times, causing the incorrect spelling to be automatically learned by device <b>410</b>. The user may then, upon receiving that spelling as a suggested character-string, interact with an &#x201c;unlearn&#x201d; button <b>482</b>, causing the incorrect spelling to be removed from the dictionary database. This removal may be permanent or temporary, and it will be appreciated that such a function may be accompanied by functionality that accomplishes the reverse, such as an &#x201c;undo&#x201d; functionality. In various embodiments, the options described above (i.e., adding character strings to a database and removing character strings from a database), may be accomplished by means other than presenting a &#x201c;learn&#x201d; and &#x201c;unlearn&#x201d; button as illustrated. In various embodiments, other types of objects may be presented on the screen for a user to interact with. In other embodiments, rules may be established such that one or both of the functionalities are invoked incident to some sequence of events such as, for example, the repetitious use of a particular character string. In still further embodiments, a user may interact directly with the character string as it is represented on the screen in order to add to or remove from a dictionary database.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">To recapitulate, we have described an aspect of the invention that relates to performing a method of inputting data into a mobile communications device having a touchscreen. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, one embodiment of this method includes, at a step <b>520</b>, receiving a user-entered character string. As described above, a user-entered character string can include any string of any type of characters such as, for example, a word, a number, a series of symbols, and the like. Additionally, a character-string, as used herein, may be expressed in any written language, as well as any mathematical or scientific language. In some embodiments, the user-entered character string may be a misspelled word. In other embodiments, the user-entered character string may be a correctly spelled word. In still further embodiments, the user-entered character string may not be a word, but rather a number, a URL, an e-mail address, etc. Additionally, in an embodiment, the user-entered character string is not recognized by the mobile communications device.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">At a step <b>522</b>, the user-entered character string is automatically replaced with a suggested character string. In various embodiments, the suggested character string is a correctly spelled word that has at least one character in common with the user-entered character string. In other embodiments, the suggested character string may be a correctly spelled word, and in some embodiments, the suggested character string may be an incorrectly spelled word. Generally, the suggested character string is one that is contained within a dictionary database associated with the mobile communications device.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, at a step <b>524</b>, the suggested character string is marked with a visual indication that the suggested character string replaced the user-entered character string. In an embodiment, the suggested character string is underlined. In other embodiments, the suggested character string may be highlighted, bolded, or presented in a different color than other character strings. It should be appreciated that any suitable visual indication may be used to mark the suggested character string. As indicated at a step <b>526</b>, the visual indication is maintained even if the suggested character string is a correctly spelled word. At a step <b>528</b>, an input region is provided in an area on the touchscreen in which the suggested character string is displayed. The input region provided at step <b>528</b> is associated with the visual indication and is capable of receiving touch input. Thus, for example, a user may &#x201c;tap&#x201d; (i.e., cause touch input to) on a marked character string, such as a suggested character string that has been marked.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Accordingly, at step <b>530</b>, touch input is received by way of the input region, and incident to receiving that touch input, as shown at step <b>532</b>, a set of alternative character strings is presented. The set of alternative character strings includes suggestions for replacing the suggested character string. It will be understood that as suggested replacements for the suggested character string, the alternative character strings may also include alternative suggestions for replacing the user-entered character string. In an embodiment, each of the alternative character strings has at least one character in common with the user-entered character string. In another embodiment, each of the alternative character strings may have at least one character in common with the suggested character string. In further embodiments, the set of alternative character strings may include either or both of the user-entered character string and the suggested character string. In still further embodiments, an input region is provided which corresponds to each of the alternative character strings, such that a user may be able to &#x201c;tap&#x201d; on one of the alternative character strings to cause some functionality such as, for example, to cause the selected alternative character string to replace the suggested character string.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated by a flow diagram showing a method for inputting data into a mobile communications device having a touchscreen, including, at a step <b>534</b>, presenting an option to a user that permits the user to select an active or inactive state associated with an automatic-correction function. As indicated previously, this option may be presented to the user in any number of ways such as, for example, presenting a button for toggling the states between active or inactive. At a step <b>536</b>, a user selection of either an active or an inactive state associated with the automatic-correction function is received.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">At a step <b>538</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a user-entered character string is received. At a step <b>540</b>, a dictionary database is referenced. A dictionary database generally includes recognized character strings, and referencing such a database may include an operation such as querying the dictionary database with a particular search term such as, for example, whether there is a character string or character strings within the dictionary database that have a certain number of characters in common with a user-entered character string. A dictionary database may actually include a plurality of databases. In an embodiment, a dictionary database may include several different databases, each containing a particular type of character string. For example, in various embodiments, a first database may be provided for housing recognized words, while another database may be provided for housing recognized URLs or email addresses. It should be understood that a dictionary database may be configured to contain any type of character string including numbers, formulas, abstract collections of symbols, portions of words, prefixes, suffixes, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">At a step <b>542</b>, a suggested character string is automatically determined. In an embodiment, the suggested character string is a recognized character string from the dictionary database and is selected as a suggested replacement for the user-entered character string. The decision diamond <b>544</b> indicates an internal determination of whether the automatic-correction is in an active or inactive state, the state generally being dependent upon the user selection of step <b>536</b>. If the automatic-correction function is in an active state, the illustrative method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> continues with a step <b>546</b> in which the user-entered character string is replaced with the suggested character string.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">At a step <b>548</b>, the suggested character string is marked with a visual indication that the suggested character string replaced the user-entered character string. As described above, this visual indication may take any form suitable such as, for example, underlining, bolding, and the like. Further, as illustrated at a step <b>550</b>, that visual indication is maintained until a touch input is received that corresponds to an instruction to remove the visual indication. Such an instruction may be presented in any manner, so long as it is prompted by some purposeful touch input to the device. In an embodiment, an input region capable of receiving touch input and that corresponds to the visual indication may be provided. In one embodiment, incident to receiving touch input by way of the input region, a set of alternative character strings may be presented as suggestions for replacing the suggested (or the user-entered) character string. Additionally, in another embodiment, an option to select an inactive state associated with the automatic-correction function may again be presented at any time.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, if the automatic-correction function is determined, at a step <b>544</b>, to be in an inactive state, the user-entered character string is marked with a visual indication representing the determination of a suggested character string, as shown at step <b>552</b>. Where a user has selected an inactive state associated with the automatic-correction function, user-entered character strings will be preserved just as they were inputted by the user. In this manner, the user may have an option to return to a given character string and edit it, preserve it, or replace it with a suggested character string, etc. In an embodiment, the user-entered character string that is marked may also have associated therewith an input region similar to the input region described above, with reference to the suggested character string. Incident to interacting with the input region associated with and generally presented in the same area of the touchscreen as the marked user-entered character string, a set of alternative character strings may be presented as suggestions for replacing the user-entered character string.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, another illustrative embodiment of a method in accordance with the present invention is shown in a flow diagram. The illustrative method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> includes, at a step <b>560</b>, receiving a user-entered character string. At a step <b>562</b>, a dictionary database having a plurality of recognized character strings is referenced. In an embodiment, the dictionary database is referenced to determine whether it contains any suggested character strings for replacing the user-entered character string. At a step <b>564</b>, the user-entered character string is automatically replaced with a suggested character string from the dictionary database.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As described above, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the suggested character string is marked, at a step <b>566</b>, with a visual indication that the suggested character string replaced the user-entered character string. Additionally, as shown at step <b>566</b>, the visual indication has an input region provided therewith. In an embodiment, the input region is capable of receiving touch input. Accordingly, at a step <b>568</b>, touch input is received by way of the input region. Incident to receiving the touch input at the input region, at a step <b>570</b>, an option is presented for removing the suggested character string from the dictionary database. It will be understood that an option for adding the user-entered character string (or any other character string) may be presented as well. The option or options provided at step <b>570</b> may, in an embodiment, be selected by way of a user acting upon the option with some sort of touch input.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">At a step <b>572</b>, a touch input representing a selection of the option to remove the suggested character string from the database dictionary is received. In another embodiment, an option to add the user-entered character string, or any other character string, to the dictionary database may be received. In a further embodiment, an option to take no action may be received, and in still a further embodiment, no option may be received. In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, however, incident to a selection of an option to remove the suggested character string from the database, at a step <b>574</b>, the suggested character string is removed from the database. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, this illustrative step may also include replacing the suggested character string (i.e., in the viewing screen) with the user-entered character string, or with some other character string. In various other embodiments, as described above, any number of other options may be presented in response to receiving touch input to the input region. In some embodiments, interacting with actionable words does not change cursor position, thus allowing for rapid editing and continuing of a composition.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">List-Position Locator</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As referenced above, another aspect of an embodiment of the invention includes the ability to arrive at a desired position in an ordered list of items on a display. The ordered list of items is stored in a mobile communications device. In one embodiment of the invention, a user may select, by way of a touch action, a selectable option, which causes a positional indicator to appear on the display. The positional indicator is responsive to the movement of the selectable option, and indicates a corresponding position among the ordered list of items.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a representation of a display <b>610</b> of a mobile device, such as mobile communications device <b>210</b>, is provided. We use a separate reference numeral to help map the instant text to a relevant figure, but we do not mean to convey that display <b>610</b> is different than any of the other many references to a display throughout this disclosure, including the block-diagram representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Display <b>610</b>, in one embodiment, is a touchscreen display that is able to receive input by way of touch actions or other interactions. As previously mentioned, a touch action can be accomplished by receiving touch input from a user's finger, but we do not mean to limit the capability of a touchscreen display, such as display <b>610</b>, to receiving touch input from a user's finger. Display <b>610</b> may also be capable of receiving touch input as a result of contact with another object such as, for example, a stylus, or a fingernail. In other embodiments, a touch action may be accomplished by way of any object coming into contact with display <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, a touch action may be accomplished by using a touch sensitive surface that may not be located on the4 display <b>610</b>, but that may be located on the side of the mobile device in the form of a touch sensitive strip. In other embodiments, the mobile device may include an optical sensor that is capable of detecting the motion of an object, such as a finger, fingernail, or stylus, through imaging. In addition, biometric finger print sensors may be used that detect motion of a fingerprint across the optical detector.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Numerals <b>612</b> and <b>614</b> represent the width and length, respectively, of the display <b>610</b>. When the mobile device is vertically oriented, so that the user may view the display <b>610</b> in a portrait view, as represented by display <b>610</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the length <b>614</b> may be greater than the width <b>612</b>. The mobile device may also, in some instances, be horizontally oriented so that the user may view the display <b>610</b> in a landscape view. In these instances, the width of the display is now represented by numeral <b>614</b>, and the length is <b>612</b>. Here, the width <b>614</b> may be greater than the length <b>612</b>. In some embodiments, however, the width and length may be equal.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Display <b>610</b> has a user interface <b>616</b>, which is illustrated as a plurality of icons and data. We have included a portion of an exemplary user interface <b>616</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to provide an illustration of what a user interface of display <b>610</b> may look like in some embodiments of the present invention. In these embodiments, user interface <b>616</b> is an ordered list of items that are stored in the mobile device, such as mobile communications device <b>210</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The ordered list of items may include, but is not limited to, contacts, photographs, videos, music, sports teams, and the like. The remaining portion of the user interface <b>616</b> is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in order to focus attention on the other elements of the present invention, such as the selectable option <b>618</b> and positional indicator <b>620</b>, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As mentioned above, an embodiment of the invention includes the ability to navigate through and reach a desired position among an ordered list of items. This may be achieved by moving a selectable option <b>618</b> in a direction allowed for by the mobile device. In embodiments, the selectable option <b>618</b> is capable of being moved by a touch action in a first direction, such as along the length <b>614</b> of display <b>610</b>. Here, the user may move the selectable option <b>618</b> in this direction to navigate through an ordered list of items, as described above. In these and other embodiments, selectable option <b>618</b> is also capable of being moved in a second direction, such as along the width <b>612</b> of display <b>610</b>. In these embodiments, the user may have located the desired item within the ordered listed of items, but there may be a subset list of items associated with the item that the user is able to navigate through. The user may then move selectable option <b>618</b>, for example by a touch action, along the width <b>612</b> of display <b>610</b> to navigate through the subset list of items.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">It should be noted that the selectable option <b>618</b> may indicate the overall list position in many embodiments. For example, if the ordered list of items is alpha sorted, or in alphabetical order, there may not be 26 evenly spaced regions (e.g., one evenly spaced region for each letter of the alphabet) in relation to the movement of the selectable option <b>618</b>. In these embodiments, for instance, if the alpha sorted list includes only items beginning with the letter A through D, the selectable option <b>618</b>, because it indicates the current location within the overall list of items, may appear at or near the bottom of the display <b>610</b> once the end of the list has been reached, even though the end of the list may be an item beginning with D, but not Z.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As described above, the selectable option <b>618</b> allows the user to navigate through an ordered list of items to reach a desired position among this list. To give the user an indication of the relationship between the position of the selectable option <b>618</b> and the current location in the ordered list of items, we have provided a positional indicator <b>620</b> that dynamically displays an indication of the current location within the ordered list of items. Examples of an ordered list of items, as discussed above include, but are not limited to contacts, photographs, videos, music, sports teams, and the like, all of which may be stored in the mobile device. Depending on how the items are arranged within the ordered list of items, the items may be in alphabetical order, numerical order, or ordered by date, time, size, or any other way that items may be arranged in a list.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As an example of the above, the ordered list of items is a list of contacts saved in the mobile device, and the contacts are ordered alphabetically by first name. Here, when the user selects the selectable option <b>618</b> by some type of touch action as described above, the positional indicator <b>620</b> is presented on the display <b>610</b>. In one embodiment, the positional indicator <b>620</b> is presented on the display <b>610</b> incident to the user moving the selectable option <b>618</b> in any direction allowable by the mobile device. In another embodiment, the positional indicator is presented on the display <b>610</b> at some set time after the selectable option <b>618</b> is moved by the user's touch action. In still another embodiment, the positional indicator <b>620</b> is presented on the display <b>610</b> incident to the user's touch action, even before the selectable option has been moved. In various aspects of each embodiment described, the positional indicator <b>620</b> may gradually appear on display <b>610</b>, so that the brightness of positional indicator <b>620</b> is displayed gradually. Positional indicator <b>620</b> may also gradually disappear in this same fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Positional indicator <b>620</b>, as previously described, dynamically indicates a corresponding position within the ordered list of items. Positional indicators <b>620</b>A, <b>620</b>B, <b>620</b>C, <b>620</b>D, and <b>620</b>E represent various examples of the indication that may be provided to the user when moving the selectable option, as described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the positional indicator <b>620</b> takes on a form consistent with the types of items included in the ordered list of items. In one embodiment, a letter may be presented on the positional indicator, such as the letter &#x201c;A&#x201d; as shown on positional indicator <b>620</b>A. In this embodiment, the list may be a list of contacts, sports teams, or any other list of items that can be ordered alphabetically. We have shown positional indicator <b>620</b>B with the number &#x201c;1&#x201d; on it. If the list of ordered items can be ordered numerically, such as a list of phone numbers or addresses, a numerical value may be presented on the positional indicator <b>620</b>B in these embodiments to provide the user with a corresponding position in the ordered list of items in relation to the position of the selectable option <b>618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In another embodiment, the list may be a list of sports teams, such as a list of baseball teams, football teams, soccer teams, basketball teams, and the like. In this embodiment, the positional indicator, such as positional indicator <b>620</b>C may present the logo representing the team where the selectable option is located. In one aspect of this embodiment, each team may have one or more items associated with it, such as recent scores, schedules, statistics, and the like, so that moving the selectable option <b>618</b> until the desired team logo appears on the positional indicator <b>620</b>C provides the user with an efficient way to locate this information.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some instances, the ordered list of items may include pictures, videos, or other items that can be ordered by size. In accordance with this embodiment, we have shown positional indicator <b>620</b>D with &#x201c;20 MB&#x201d; presented on it, representing the file size of one or more items in the ordered list corresponding to the current position of selectable option <b>618</b>. This may give the user an easy and efficient way to locate a certain item, such as a picture or video, if the file size is known or can be approximated. Moving to positional indicator <b>620</b>E, we show an embodiment that presents &#x201c;1/1/2000,&#x201d; representative of a date that may appear on a positional indicator if the ordered list of items may be ordered by date. Such lists may include events (e.g., calendar-related items), pictures, videos, and the like. As mentioned above, the positional indicator may take on a form consistent with the items in the ordered list, and as such, other indication information may be presented on the positional indicator other than what has been described above. As shown by numeral <b>621</b>, these are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As we previously discussed, the width <b>612</b> and length <b>614</b> of the display are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The display <b>610</b> is shown in a portrait view, wherein the positional indicator has a width <b>624</b> and length <b>622</b>. In this view, the width of the positional indicator <b>624</b>, in many embodiments, is greater than a majority of the display width <b>612</b>. When the phone is turned in a landscape view (e.g., rotated 90 degrees from the portrait view), however, numeral <b>612</b> represents the length of the display, and numeral <b>624</b> represents the length of the positional indicator. Here, the length of the positional indicator <b>624</b> may, in some embodiments, be greater than a majority of the width of the display <b>612</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, we have provided an embodiment illustrating the ability of the positional indicator to display different information according to the corresponding position of the selectable option in relation to the location among the ordered list of items. Display <b>710</b> has a selectable option <b>712</b> and a positional indicator <b>714</b>. In this aspect of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the ordered list of items may include contacts, sports teams, e-mail addresses, or any other list that may be ordered alphabetically. Selectable option <b>712</b> is located near the top of the device, and therefore corresponds to a position within the ordered list of items at the top or near the top of the list. If the list includes contacts saved to the mobile device, such as mobile communications device <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the list may begin with one or more names that start with the letter &#x201c;A,&#x201d; as is shown on positional indicator <b>714</b>. The user may then select selectable option <b>712</b> by way of a touch action, which results from contact to display <b>710</b> with an object such as, for example, a finger, a stylus, or a fingernail.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Display <b>720</b> illustrates a second position of the selectable option <b>722</b> as a result of the user selecting and moving it in a first direction, for example, in a downward direction along the length of display <b>720</b>, as shown. Moving selectable option <b>722</b> to a second position has caused positional indicator <b>724</b> to display a different letter corresponding to the new position of selectable option <b>722</b> in relation to the location among the ordered list of items. For instance, as the letter &#x201c;G&#x201d; is shown on positional indicator <b>724</b>, one or more items within the ordered list may start with the letter &#x201c;G.&#x201d; In this instance, if there are no items that start with the letter &#x201c;G,&#x201d; &#x201c;G&#x201d; would not be presented on the positional indicator, and would skip to the next letter that is associated with the next item in the ordered list. In another instance, however, even if there are no items starting with &#x201c;G,&#x201d; the letter &#x201c;G&#x201d; may still appear on the positional indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, display <b>730</b> illustrates a third instance of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, wherein selectable option <b>732</b> has been moved to a third position so that the letter presented on positional indicator <b>734</b> represents the item located among the ordered list of items corresponding to the position of selectable option <b>732</b> in this third position. Similarly, display <b>740</b> illustrates selectable option <b>742</b> in a fourth position, and the letter &#x201c;S&#x201d; on positional indicator <b>744</b> represents the corresponding item within the ordered list of items.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">We have included display <b>750</b> to illustrate an instance where the selectable option <b>752</b> has been moved to the bottom or near the bottom of display <b>750</b>, wherein its location corresponds to the last or one of the last items within the ordered list. Here, the letter &#x201c;Z&#x201d; is presented on positional indicator <b>754</b>, indicating to the user that the end or near the end of the ordered list has been reached. The embodiment described above easily and efficiently allows a user to reach a desired item within an ordered list of items.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the embodiments described above with respect to moving the selectable option, presenting the positional indicator, and reaching a desired location within an ordered list of items, it should be noted that while the ordered list of items may be visible on the display while the positional indicator is presented to the user, the ordered list of items may not change its position as the selectable option is moved on the display. In order to save processing power, the positional indicator dynamically displays the current position within the ordered list of items, but the ordered list of items remains in a constant position or state until the user reverses the touch action, for example, by removing the object (e.g., finger, fingernail, stylus) from the selectable option.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">To recapitulate, we have described an aspect of the invention that relates to performing a method of reaching a position in an ordered list of items on a display. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, one embodiment of this method includes, at a step <b>810</b>A, presenting a selectable option on the mobile device's display that can be selected by touch actions. These touch actions might take the form of, for example, a user's finger, finger nail, or a stylus. At a step <b>812</b>A, incident to receiving an indication that the selectable option has been selected, as described above, a positional indicator is presented on the display. The positional indicator indicates to the user its current position within the ordered list of items. For example, if the ordered list of items consists of names of soccer teams that are ordered alphabetically, the positional indicator may display a letter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, representing items in the ordered list located correspondingly to the position of the selectable option. At a step <b>814</b>A, incident to the user moving the selectable option in a first dimension, the positional indicator indicates a position among the ordered list of items.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The user may, at any time, reverse the touch action by, for example, removing the object used to select the selectable option. For example, if the user used his or her finger to provide the touch action, the user may lift the finger from the display to reverse the touch action. Reversing the touch action causes an item in the ordered list to be presented on the display. In some embodiments, the item presented on the display is the first item in the ordered list that starts with the letter presented on the positional indicator when the touch action is reversed. For example, if the positional indicator displays an &#x201c;M&#x201d; at the time that the touch action is reversed, the first item starting with &#x201c;M&#x201d; may be the first item listed on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In some embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the length or width of the positional indicator is greater than a majority of a length or width of the display. We have illustrated this in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which illustrates that the positional indictor width <b>624</b> is greater than a majority of the display width <b>612</b> when the phone is positioned in a portrait view, as shown. Should the mobile device be turned on its side (e.g., landscape view), the positional indicator length, represented now by numeral <b>624</b>, may be greater than a majority of the display length, now represented by numeral <b>612</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">We previously mentioned that while the selectable option is being moved by the user, which causes the display of the positional indicator, the ordered list of items in the background may still be viewable. The ordered list, however, may become dimmed to focus the user's attention on the positional indicator, rather than on the ordered list. In an embodiment, the ordered list is gradually dimmed when the positional indicator is presented on the display, and may gradually revert to its original brightness once the touch action is reversed, as described above. In addition, in some embodiments, the presentation of the positional indicator may also be gradual, so that the positional indicator is first dimmed, and gradually becomes brighter on the display. The same would occur when the touch action is reversed, wherein the positional indicator may gradually disappear from the display.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, another embodiment of the invention is provided that includes presenting a selectable option on a touchscreen of a mobile device at a step <b>810</b>B. The user may interact with the selectable option by way of the touchscreen, and in the same ways as described above, a touch action by the user allows the selectable option to be selected. At a step <b>812</b>B, as the selectable option is moved in a first direction, a positional indicator is presented on the display that indicates to the user a corresponding position among the ordered list. The positional indicator's size is represented by a length and a width, such as a positional-indicator length and positional-indicator width. The display's size is also represented by a length and a width, termed a display length and a display width. As previously mentioned, the size of the positional indicator, in some embodiments, is such that either its length consumes a majority of the display length, or its width consumes a majority of the display width. This is represented by numerals <b>814</b>B and <b>816</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">We have also mentioned that the user, upon locating an item using the selectable option and the positional indicator, may wish to locate an item in a subset list of items for the located item. One or more of the items in the ordered list may have an associated subset list of items, so that the positional indicator may be moved in a different direction, such as a second direction, to allow the user to navigate through the subset list of items and reach a desired location within this list as well. As with reversing the touch action described above, a user may cause an item within the subset list to be presented on the display by reversing the touch action (e.g., releasing the finger used to move the selectable option), wherein the item is categorized in the subset list at a position consistent with the positional indicator.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Event Disposition Control For Mobile Communications Device</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Another aspect of an embodiment of the invention includes an ability to respond to various events by way of a mobile communications device. In one embodiment, a way to respond to a given event (such as receiving a call, receiving a voicemail, etc.) is to provide an informational element, which can take the form of a graphical user interface (GUI) object, that presents information related to the event and is also a slideable object that can be moved by a user into a drop zone to give rise to a desired action.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, another representation of a mobile communications device is provided and referenced generally by the numeral <b>910</b>. We use a separate reference numeral to help map the instant text to a relevant figure, but we do not mean to convey that mobile device <b>910</b> is different than any of the other many references to a mobile device throughout this disclosure, including the block-diagram representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Mobile device <b>910</b> includes a display <b>912</b>, which in one embodiment is a touchscreen display that is able to receive input by way of touch actions or interactions.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Blown up for detail, a user interface <b>914</b> is shown as being presentable on display <b>912</b>. Various types of events may give rise to seeking user input. Illustrative events include things such as receiving a phone call; receiving a message (e.g., a voicemail, an email, a text message, and the like); initiating an alarm; receiving a file (e.g., a picture, an audio file, a video file, and the like); or an arriving at a time associated with a calendared event. For example, ten o'clock on a Monday morning may arrive, which triggers a reminder to be presented.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In one embodiment, an informational element <b>916</b> is presented on display <b>912</b>. Informational element <b>916</b> serves as an event summary that includes descriptive information that is contextually related to the event. Thus, for example, when mobile device <b>910</b> receives an incoming call, informational element <b>916</b> might present caller-identifying information that helps a user to determine an identification of the incoming caller. In the case of an alarm, informational element <b>916</b> might present textual data that describes the event associated with the alarm. We will describe this aspect in greater detail below. In some embodiments, our technology of utilizing sliding and drop zones helps prevent unintentional actions, such as accidentally unlocking the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As mentioned, incident to an occurrence of some event, informational element <b>916</b> is presented on display <b>912</b>. This affords the option to a user to move informational element <b>916</b> to one of at least two drop zones, including a first drop zone <b>918</b> and a second drop zone <b>920</b>. Upward movement is indicated by dotted arrow <b>922</b>, and downward movement is indicated by dotted arrow <b>924</b>. Informational element <b>916</b> both presents information describing or related to the event that gave rise to its presentation and is also slideable by way of touch actions into either of the first or second drop zones <b>918</b>, <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Although we say &#x201c;into&#x201d; the drop zones, we do not mean to imply that informational element <b>916</b> needs to be moved to wholly within a drop zone. This is not the case. In fact, in some embodiments, mobile device <b>910</b> tracks an amount of movement away from an initial starting position. If informational element <b>916</b> is moved beyond a threshold distance away from the initial starting position in a certain direction, then it will be deemed to have been dropped in one of the two drop zones. Similarly, if information element <b>916</b> is moved beyond a threshold distance toward another drop zone, then it will be deemed to have been released into the other drop zone. In still other embodiments, informational element <b>916</b> will be deemed to have been dropped into one of the drop zones if it is moved within a certain proximity of that drop zone. Thus, it might be the case that if an upper portion of informational element <b>916</b> crosses some threshold area associated with first drop zone <b>918</b>, then it will be considered to have been moved to the first drop zone. Same with the second drop zone.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments, a user may use his or her finger or a stylus or some other object to indicate a desire to move informational element <b>916</b>. One way that motion of informational element <b>916</b> might be tracked is for mobile device <b>910</b> to map a general pressure point to a specific point or line. This specific point or line can then be used to track how far informational element <b>916</b> is moved along display <b>912</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Each of the drop zones <b>918</b> and <b>920</b> are associated with certain actions. That is, if informational element <b>916</b> is moved to first drop zone <b>918</b> then a first action occurs, and if informational element <b>916</b> is dragged to second drop zone <b>920</b>, then a second action occurs. In one embodiment, if informational element <b>916</b> is not dragged to either first drop zone <b>918</b> or to second drop zone <b>920</b>, then a default action is allowed to occur. This default action is different than either the first or second actions. Being different, though, does not necessarily contemplate an entirely different action, but also includes a temporal differentiation. For example, if a user of device <b>910</b> receives an incoming call, the device might ring for a certain period of time, after which the notification will stop. But this only occurs after a certain amount of time; for example, six rings or 25 seconds (random examples). It may be the case that the second action, associated with second drop zone <b>920</b> is to dismiss a call which, in effect, stops the incoming-call notification. Although it may be true that in both situations the incoming-call notifications were stopped, the second action is still different than the default action because the default action would have allowed the call-notification operations to continue for a certain amount of time, but the second action (which is associated with second drop zone <b>920</b>) stopped the call-notification operations immediately.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, additional detail is provided to help describe the notion of a certain action happening incident to moving informational element <b>916</b> to a certain drop zone. Like reference numerals correspond to like objects, but we will add a &#x201c;B&#x201d; designator to help refer to specific items in specific FIGs. Thus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, user interface <b>914</b>B depicts an informational element <b>916</b>B, and a first drop zone <b>918</b>B. In one embodiment, first drop zone <b>918</b>B consumes an upper portion of the display. Although not necessarily shown on user interface <b>914</b>B, first drop zone <b>918</b>B might begin at a reference line, which is denoted by numeral <b>930</b>. Again, a user may not see line <b>930</b>. In other embodiments, first drop zone <b>918</b>B might be clearly presented on user interface <b>914</b>B for the user to see so that the user will know of a boundary that defines first drop zone <b>918</b>B. As shown, descriptive information <b>932</b> is included as part of informational element <b>916</b>B. This information may include one or both of a graphic <b>934</b> as well as textual information <b>936</b>. Other types of descriptive information could also be provided in informational element <b>916</b>B. We show two for illustrative purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As mentioned, descriptive information <b>932</b> is related to the incoming event that gave rise to the presentation of informational element <b>916</b>. For example, if the relevant event were an incoming call, then graphic <b>934</b> might present a picture of the incoming caller. Textual information <b>936</b> might present identifying indicia that identifies the incoming caller. If the incoming event were an alarm, then graphic <b>934</b> might take the form of a stagnant bell or some other indicator that a user might readily associate with an alarm. Graphic <b>934</b> can also be customized by a user so that the user can determine what gets presented incident to an occurrence of some event.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The type of descriptive information that gets presented varies with the nature of the instant event. We show some illustrative events in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>; for example answer a call is designated by reference numeral <b>935</b>. Reference numeral <b>937</b> references opening &#x201c;X,&#x201d; which symbolizes anything that might be opened; for example, an email message, a picture, a text message, etc. Numeral <b>938</b> indicates snoozing an alarm. Reference numeral <b>940</b> represents a user-customized option. Thus, in one embodiment, the first drop zone <b>918</b>B becomes associated with a user-defined option such that when informational element <b>916</b>B is moved to first drop zone <b>918</b>B, an action that has been selected by a user is performed. Clearly, other actions can also be performed besides those that are illustratively shown. We indicate this by ellipses <b>942</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As we have discussed so far, an incoming event might give right to a presentation of informational element <b>916</b>B. In such a situation, a user has an option of moving informational element <b>916</b>B to one of at least two drop zones, which will trigger a certain action to be performed. We have shown some illustrative actions such as answering a call, opening attachments, or snoozing an alarm. If a user desires to carry out what might be opposites of the types of actions listed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, then the informational element can be moved to the second drop zone.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, user interface <b>914</b>C is shown as including second drop zone <b>920</b>C, which might receive informational element <b>916</b>C. If informational element <b>916</b>C is moved to second drop zone <b>920</b>C, then a different set of actions might occur than those that occurred as we mentioned in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. For example, rather than answering a call, a second action might be to send that call to voicemail, referenced by numeral <b>941</b>. Rather than opening an attachment or a message, etc., the same might be dismissed, which is indicated by reference numeral <b>943</b>. Rather than responding to an alarm or snoozing an alarm, dragging informational element <b>916</b>C to second drop zone <b>920</b>C might turn off an alarm, which is referenced by numeral <b>944</b>. A user can customize a desired option, which includes providing a new option, that should be carried out when informational element <b>916</b>C is moved to second drop zone <b>914</b>C. This is referenced by numeral <b>946</b>. Of course other actions might be performed in connection with dragging informational element <b>916</b>C to second drop zone <b>914</b>C, which is represented by ellipses <b>948</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">One way that this aspect of the invention is helpful is that a sliding motion is hard to accidentally cause, especially sliding to a specific area. Thus, if mobile device <b>910</b> is in a user's pocket or handbag and a certain event occurs, then by utilizing embodiments of the present invention, unintended actions can be avoided. That is, a user is unlikely to accidentally complete a sequence necessary to give rise to an action, especially when that sequence includes initially tapping in a certain portion of display <b>912</b> so as to activate or direct a focus to informational element <b>916</b>, and then to also drag informational element <b>916</b> to one of the two drop zones <b>918</b> or <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some embodiments, more than two drop zones can be provided. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, we illustratively show four drop zones: first drop zone <b>950</b>, second drop zone <b>952</b>, third drop zone <b>954</b>, and fourth drop zone <b>956</b>. In this embodiment, event summary <b>958</b> can be moved to any of four drop zones to initiate one of four possible actions. In this way, more alternatives can be provided to a user to respond to an incoming event. For example, consider a situation when a person receives a picture mail, or an email with a picture attachment. Perhaps first drop zone <b>950</b> opens the textual portion of the email message. Whereas dragging the picture mail to third drop zone <b>954</b> may open only the picture portion of the message. Dragging the event summary associated with the picture mail to second drop zone <b>952</b> might be associated with a dismissal action to dismiss any sort of a notification associated with the arrival of the picture mail message. And fourth drop zone <b>956</b> might be associated with moving the picture mail message to a user-defined folder so that a user can easily locate the message in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts a representation of a product known as the iPhone offered by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. One feature included in the iPhone is the ability to slide a control to answer an incoming call. Thus, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a phone <b>1010</b> includes a slideable element <b>1012</b>, which is designated by shading. The slideable element includes an edge <b>1014</b>. Often, an outline is provided, which includes an edge <b>1016</b>. Embodiments of our invention are different than this sort of technology, which has no secondary action, uses a very small portion of the screen, utilizes only a single direction, does not encompass the concept of a drop zone, has no dismiss action, and a variety of other differences. In the prior-art example, slideable control <b>1012</b> must be dragged completely to the right to answer an incoming call. That is, edge <b>1014</b> must come in contact with edge <b>1016</b>. Accordingly, the concept of a drop zone is not employed. Moreover, slideable element <b>1012</b> is just that, merely an element that does not provide any descriptive information. That is, the thing that is moved is static in the respect that whenever a phone call comes in, it is merely presented, but does not include any sort of descriptive information that is associated with the event that gave rise to its presentation. That is, there is nothing contextually relevant that describes the event that gave rise to its presentation. A user would not be able to achieve a desired action by using the prior art without looking at the device. But according to embodiments of our invention, a user could easily approximate a halfway portion of a screen and easily drag our informational element into one of the two drop zones without even looking at the device. We will also describe below ways to vary a vibrational response of the mobile device consistent with a dragging of the informational element. Still further differences include the fact that only a single action can be performed. But according to embodiments of our invention, multiple actions can be performed including what we refer to as both a positive action as well as a negative action, which are to the exclusion of a default action. Thus, when an incoming call is received on our described device, it can either be answered or affirmatively sent to voicemail or some other action taken. The prior art offers no secondary action, especially in which the secondary action is not some default action.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">To recapitulate, we have described an aspect of the invention that relates to performing a method of responding to an event by way of a mobile communications device. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, one embodiment of this method includes, at a step <b>1110</b>, incident to an occurrence of an event, presenting an informational element on the mobile device's display that can be manipulated by touch actions. These touch actions might take the form of a user's finger touch actions or also might include a user using a stylus. At a step <b>1112</b>, descriptive information is presented in the informational element that is contextually related to the event. Thus, descriptive information can include things such as a caller's phone number, a picture associated with a caller, or a file name of a file. At a step <b>1114</b>, at least two drop zones are provided that each consume an area of the display. The first drop zone is associated with the first action, and the second drop zone is associated with a second action. In one embodiment, the first drop zone is in an upper portion of the display, and a second drop zone is in a lower portion of the display, or vice versa. We explained that the first action is not always the same. That is, the action associated with the first drop zone varies according to the nature of the event that gave rise to the presentation of informational element <b>916</b> to begin with. In some cases moving informational element <b>916</b> to first drop zone <b>918</b> causes a first action to occur, but, depending on the nature of the event, dragging informational element <b>916</b> to the exact same drop zone causes a different action or set of actions to occur. Thus, the first action differs according to the event that gave rise to the presentation of informational element <b>916</b>. In some embodiments, first drop zone <b>918</b> is associated with a positive-type action, whereas second drop zone <b>920</b> is associated with a negative-type action.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Decision diamond <b>1116</b> indicates different actions that might occur as the informational element <b>916</b> is moved in various ways. As mentioned, if the informational element is moved to the first drop zone then mobile device <b>910</b> will do the first action, as indicated by numeral <b>1118</b>. If the informational element is moved to the second drop zone, then mobile device <b>910</b> will do the second action, as indicated by numeral <b>1120</b>. If the informational element is not dragged to either drop zones, then a default action will be allowed to occur, which is referenced by numeral <b>1122</b>. We have mentioned that this default action is different at least in some respects than either of the first or second actions, including a difference that may be defined in a temporal aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Illustrative positive actions include answering an incoming call, observing an incoming message, viewing an incoming file, viewing an incoming media attachment, opening a calendar-related item, and the like. Illustrative negative-type actions include dismissing an incoming call, sending an incoming call to voicemail, dismissing an incoming message, dismissing an incoming call, silencing an alarm, or the like. What some people refer to as positive actions, other people may refer to as negative actions.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, another embodiment of the invention is provided that includes receiving an indication of an occurrence of an event at a step <b>1150</b>. At a step <b>1152</b>, the embodiment of this method continues by presenting an informational element on the device. We have discussed possible natures of the informational element and how it includes information that is contextually relevant to the nature of the event that gave rise to the presentation of the informational element.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">A final illustrative step <b>1154</b> includes receiving user input that disposes the informational element to one of at least two drop zones that are defined by respective portions of the device's display and that are respectively associated with certain actions such that moving the informational element to one of the at least two drop zones invokes a certain response that is consistent with the corresponding drop zone. We have also mentioned how the response can vary based on either the nature of the event or based on how the user has customized what actions should flow incident to the informational element being moved to a respective drop zone.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Physical Feedback to Indicate Object Directional Slide</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As previously alluded to, another aspect of the invention includes an ability to enhance vibrational feedback so that it can provide information on tasks that are being performed. An illustrative task is a drag task. In this aspect of the invention, directional slide can be indicated by vibrational response.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Consider <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As we previously discussed, an object <b>1212</b> can be presented on device <b>1210</b> incident to an occurrence of some event. We previously described how this object can be dragged into one of at least two drop zones <b>1214</b> and <b>1216</b> to cause one of at least two desired actions to occur. We explained that dragging object <b>1212</b> into first drop zone <b>1214</b> could cause a first action to occur that is associated with first drop zone <b>1214</b>, and we also described how dragging object <b>1212</b> to second drop zone <b>1216</b> could be used to instantiate a different action that is associated with second drop zone <b>1216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">There may be some cases where it is desirable for a user to be able to determine a direction that object <b>1212</b> is being moved without looking at the display of mobile device <b>1210</b>. Moreover, there may be cases where a user has limited visual acuity, or may even be blind, such that viewing the display of mobile device <b>1210</b> is not even possible. Rather than making such a device as mobile communications device <b>1210</b> unavailable to such users, we provide a way to indicate directional movement by providing vibrational feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">For example, in one embodiment, as object <b>1212</b> is moved upward <b>1218</b>, an intensity of a vibrational response increases. Similarly, as object <b>1212</b> is moved in a downward direction <b>1220</b>, an intensity of a vibrational response of device <b>1210</b> decreases. As previously alluded to, &#x201c;intensity&#x201d; can include magnitude and/or frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">As previously mentioned, this object <b>1212</b> can include descriptive information that describes attributes of the event that gave rise to its presentation.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The vibrational response that is provided incident to moving object <b>1212</b> is dynamic in nature and occurs in real time. That is, it is dynamic in nature in that it can continuously vary as the location of object <b>1212</b> varies. It is continuous in that whatever response is being provided continues to be provided until a desired outcome is reached. Thus, rhythmic or pulsing responses are contemplated within the scope of &#x201c;continuous.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In some embodiments, the vibrational response continues until a desired task is completed. For example, to complete a task might be to drop object <b>1212</b> into one of the two drop zones <b>1214</b> or <b>1216</b>. In some embodiments, the intensity of the vibrational response continues along some pattern as object <b>1212</b> is moved along a first direction. In some embodiments, the vibrational response changes drastically once <b>1212</b> is moved to drop zone <b>1214</b>. In some embodiments, changing drastically means to cease a vibrational response. In other embodiments, changing drastically means providing a vibrational response that is inconsistent with the pattern that had been followed as object <b>1212</b> was being moved along a first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">As mentioned, moving object <b>1212</b> in an upwardly direction might cause an increase in intensity of vibrational response. An increase in intensity can include an increase in magnitude and/or an increase in frequency. An increase in magnitude would mean that a small vibrational response would turn into a larger vibrational response. For example, a gentle ping might turn into a more robust thud. Another way that intensity can be increased is by increasing frequency. Mobile device <b>1210</b> might buzz more the more object <b>1212</b> is moved in an upward direction. The frequency by which vibrations are measured can increase as object <b>1212</b> is moved in a first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Everything we say can be applicable to movement in the second direction but with an opposite effect. That is, moving object <b>1212</b> in a downward direction <b>1220</b> might cause a decrease in intensity of a vibrational response. That is, a frequency decrease might occur, or a magnitude decrease might occur.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, a curve <b>1230</b> is depicted as part of a diagram that plots an illustrative vibrational intensity <b>1232</b> based on a displacement <b>1234</b> of a GUI object from some starting position <b>1236</b>. In one embodiment, rightward flow <b>1238</b> would translate to displacing an object in a first direction, whereas leftward flow <b>1240</b> would indicate movement in a second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Reference numeral <b>1242</b> marks an illustrative starting location. Thus, say an incoming call was received by mobile device <b>1210</b>. In this example, object <b>1212</b> would be presented, and mobile device <b>1210</b> would vibrate with an intensity consistent with a level denoted by reference numeral <b>1242</b>. As object <b>1212</b> is moved toward first drop zone <b>1214</b>, the vibrational intensity might increase consistent with the upper portion <b>1244</b> of curve <b>1230</b>. As object <b>1212</b> is moved in a different direction, vibrational intensity might decrease consistent with a lower portion <b>1246</b> of curve <b>1230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In one embodiment, curve <b>1230</b> is monotonically increasing. That is, each instance of intensity is greater than the previous when moving in a rightward direction. It may be the case that curve <b>1230</b> is monotonically increasing only over a certain range of values. For example, perhaps curve <b>1230</b> is only monotonically increasing from the area marked by a first dashed line <b>1248</b> as well as a second dashed line <b>1250</b>. It may be the case that beyond this range, curve <b>1230</b>, although not shown in this way, may take on a drastically different pattern than in the past. For example, for displacements beyond marker <b>1250</b>, perhaps the vibrational intensity drops markedly off, which would translate to a steep decline in curve <b>1230</b> after marker <b>1250</b>. It might also be the case that the vibrational intensity markedly increases after marker <b>1250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">One way that such marked changes might be used can be seen in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, which depicts another curve, which is referenced by numeral <b>1254</b>. On <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, we illustrate two drop zones, such as a first drop zone <b>1256</b> and a second drop zone <b>1258</b>. As we have previously mentioned, it may be the case that a vibrational intensity makes a marked change after a certain displacement from a starting position. One possible point to mark such a change in vibrational intensity is referenced by numeral <b>1260</b>. As shown, a vibrational intensity of mobile device <b>1210</b> might progressively increase along an upper portion <b>1262</b> of curve <b>1254</b> until point <b>1260</b> is reached, at which a vibrational intensity might change in a way that is different than it had been changing as object <b>1212</b> was being moved in a first direction. Again, although not necessarily reflected in diagram <b>12</b>B, it may be the case that after object <b>1212</b> is moved beyond point <b>1260</b>, and into drop zone <b>1256</b>, curve <b>1254</b> follows a path such as that referenced by numeral <b>1264</b> or that marked by numeral <b>1266</b>. One reason for doing this is to allow a user to be able to perceive that object <b>1212</b> has been moved to a specific drop zone.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Similarly, moving object <b>1212</b> along a lower portion <b>1268</b> of curve <b>1254</b> might continue along a certain pattern until a point <b>1270</b> is reached, after which it may make a marked change, which is intended to be shown by reference numerals <b>1272</b> as well as numeral <b>1274</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The general shape of curve <b>1254</b> does not need to follow the shape that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> or <b>12</b>B. Rather, as is desired, curve <b>1254</b> may take on a variety of shapes. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12C through 12D</figref>, we indicate that vibrational intensity may increase in a manner consistent with curve <b>1280</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>. Curve <b>1282</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref> is another possible pattern. Vibrational intensity may also follow the curve of <b>1284</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref> as object <b>1212</b> is displaced in different directions. Still another illustrative curve is indicated by reference numeral <b>1286</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>. We do not mean for reference numerals <b>1280</b>-<b>1286</b> to be all inclusive; but rather, they are intended to illustrate that various patterns are applicable to various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> depicts a flow chart that illustrates an illustrative method for enabling a user to control a mobile communications device that includes a vibration component. At a step <b>1310</b>, an object is presented on a touchscreen display of a mobile communications device that includes a vibration component. An illustrative vibration component can be the vibration component <b>124</b> referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In some embodiments, vibration component <b>124</b> takes the form of a motor with an offset weight such that rotating the offset weight causes the motor, or a thing coupled to the motor, to vibrate. In some embodiments, vibration component <b>124</b> takes the form of a haptics motor. Real-time control is used to support directionality.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">At a step <b>1312</b>, the object is made moveable on the touchscreen such that it can be moved by way of a touch interaction. Thus, for example, a user can use his or her thumb to move object <b>1212</b>. As the user moves object <b>1212</b> in different directions, different vibrational responses are provided dynamically and in real time so that a user can perceive a direction that object <b>1212</b> is being moved by perceiving the vibrational response. Thus, at a step <b>1314</b>, in real time, an intensity of an output of the vibration component is continuously varied to cause a vibrational response of the mobile communications device such that movement of the object in a first direction causes a first continuous vibrational output, and movement of the object in a second direction causes a second continuous vibrational output. We have mentioned that in one embodiment, the intensity can monotonically increase as object <b>1212</b> is progressively more displaced along a first direction such that every advancement of the object in the first direction produces a vibrational output that is greater than when the object was in any proceeding position. In some embodiments, this occurs up until a certain threshold, after which the vibrational intensity changes in an inconsistent way so as to denote that an object such as object <b>1212</b> has moved into a certain area of interest such as a drop zone. Of course embodiments of the present invention do not need to rely on dual drop zones as we have shown. Rather, the scope of this aspect of the invention is widely applicable to any graphical user interface object that is to be moved in some direction. Directionality of that object can be made to correspond to a vibrational intensity such that directionality of the object can be perceived by perceiving the intensity of the corresponding vibrational output. In some embodiments, processor <b>116</b> is configured to help coordinate the vibrational response to a movement of an object such as object <b>1212</b> so that movement of the object can be deciphered without (or with) physically viewing display <b>118</b>. This vibrational response would not be a mere playback of a prerecorded action; but rather, a dynamically created vibrational response that is created based on a movement of the object. Thus, more than just playing back a response incident to an occurrence of some event, embodiments of the invention provide for a real-time creation of a vibrational response that occurs based on real-time events. In some embodiments, vibrational outputs follow respectively consistent patterns; namely, for some ranges they progressively increase or progressively decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, another embodiment of the present invention is provided. At a step <b>1320</b>, an indication of an occurrence of an event is received. At a step <b>1322</b>, an object is presented on a touchscreen of the mobile device. The object can be manipulated via touch action to respond to the event.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">At a step <b>1324</b>, in real time, an intensity of a vibrational response is varied consistent with a movement of the object such that the movement of the object in a first direction results in a first vibrational output, and movement of the object in a second direction results in a second vibrational output.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Many different arrangements of the various components depicted, as well as components not shown, are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Embodiments of the present invention have been described with the intent to be illustrative rather than restrictive. Alternative embodiments will become apparent to those skilled in the art that do not depart from its scope. A skilled artisan may develop alternative means of implementing the aforementioned improvements without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
