<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A video player for limiting the view by a viewer not satisfying the view allowance condition allowing a young person to view a specific video. When a limited video viewing of which by a viewer not satisfying a view allowance condition is limited by limiting the broadcast time zone, e.g., by limiting the broadcast time zone to the midnight of when the young people are asleep is recorded, the video player inhibits reproduction of the limited video in a time zone other than the time zone from the recording start time of the limited video to a predetermined time. Since the limited video can be reproduced only in the time zone from the originally broadcast time to a predetermined time, any viewer not satisfying the view allowance condition is prevented from viewing a limited video.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, by various methods, for movies, television broadcasts, recording medium such as an optical disc, and distribution through the Internet, it is possible to view various kinds of videos at home, more specifically in his/her room. Such a video may contain scenes of violent or sexual content, that are desirable to be limited in viewing mainly by a young person. Usually, because the target necessary to be limited in viewing for such a video (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;limited video&#x201d;) is a young person, the age of a visitor to a movie theater may be limited when the limited video is shown in the movie theater. Further, for a recording medium recorded with the limited video, the age of a purchaser may be limited at a shop. However, because a viewer cannot be theoretically limited from viewing the television broadcasts, a time period for broadcasting the limited videos is limited to the middle of the night in many cases.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Further, adding information about limiting in viewing to a video itself, or more specifically to the data of a video, has been partly adopted. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a technique in which a television receiver automatically skips a limited portion by using the information added to the video where the limited portion to be limited in viewing is contained in the video being broadcasted. Further, Patent Document 2 discloses a technique in which a video is reproduced while skipping the limited portion where the limited portion is contained in the video recorded in the recording medium.</p>

In the meantime, the display section <b>15</b> and the operating section <b>16</b> may also be configured with a touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0064">Also, to the control section <b>11</b>, a signal processing section <b>21</b> that performs a process and a transmission of a visual signal and an audio signal is connected. To the signal processing section <b>21</b>, a tuner section <b>23</b> that receives various kinds of broadcasting, such as ground-based broadcasting, satellite broadcasting, cable broadcasting, analog broadcasting, and digital broadcasting, is connected. The tuner section <b>23</b> receives a broadcasting signal corresponding to a video. The signal processing section <b>21</b> performs a signal process such as decoding of the broadcasting signal received by the tuner section <b>23</b>. Further, the tuner section <b>23</b> can receive data for the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) in addition to the broadcasting signal corresponding to the video. Therefore, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> can perform a program selection or a program reservation using the received EPG data. Further, the tuner section <b>23</b> is configured so that it receives an external clock time as needed, specifically external clock time information indicative of a standard time of an area where the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> is installed, from data contained in the broadcasting signal, for example and, thus, functioning as external clock time information receiving means. The control section <b>11</b> also performs a process to synchronize the clock time inside the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;internal clock time&#x201d;) clocked by the clocking section <b>14</b> with the clock time indicated by the external clock time information received by the tuner section <b>23</b>.</p>

The television receiver <b>3</b> displays an image on its screen based on the data outputted from the output section <b>24</b>, and reproduces audio from its speaker. Thus, the control section <b>11</b>, the signal processing section <b>21</b>, the drive section <b>22</b>, and the output section <b>24</b> function as reproducing section or reproducing means.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0068">Next, a process performed by the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 1 of the invention having the above-mentioned configuration will be explained. In Embodiment 1, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> performs a process to limit reproduction of a limited video that is a video to be limited in viewing by a viewer not satisfying a condition to view a specific video (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;view allowance condition&#x201d;) such as a movie categorized as PG-13 (Parental Guidance 13th) as an example. Specifically, when the limited video broadcasted during the middle of the night in order to limit viewing by a young person is recorded, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> allows reproduction of the limited video only during a time period from a recording start clock time at which the recording of the limited video is started to a predetermined clock time. As an end clock time at which the time period during which the limited video can be reproduced ends, a predetermined clock time such as one hour before dawn is designated, and this predetermined clock time is stored in the ROM <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart showing a processing procedure when the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 1 performs a reservation for timer recording, and the control section <b>11</b> executes it according to the control program stored in the ROM <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0070">The tuner section <b>23</b> receives the EPG data as needed, and the control section <b>11</b> stores the EPG data received by the tuner section <b>23</b> in the RAM <b>12</b>. The EGP data includes information specifying a broadcast start clock time and a broadcast end clock time of each program being broadcasted on each channel, and further includes information specifying a program of the limited video. In accordance with an acceptance of an instruction by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b>, or an acceptance of the light signal by the remote controller optical receiving section <b>17</b>, the control section <b>11</b> displays the EPG on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> by outputting the EPG data stored in the RAM <b>12</b> from the output section <b>24</b> to the television receiver <b>3</b> (S<b>11</b>). A program to be timer-recorded is selected on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller. Thus, the control section <b>11</b> accepts the instruction for the timer recording of the selected program through the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller optical receiving section <b>17</b> (S<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0071">The control section <b>11</b> then determines based on the EPG data stored in the RAM <b>12</b> whether the program on which the instruction for the timer recording has been accepted is a program of the limited video (S<b>13</b>). When the program on which the instruction for the timer recording has been accepted is a program of the limited video (S<b>13</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> stores in the RAM <b>12</b> timer program information specifying the program on which the instruction for the timer recording has been accepted associating with limiting information specifying that the program is a program of the limited video (S<b>14</b>), and terminates the process. When the program on which the instruction for the timer recording has been accepted is not a program of the limited video (S<b>13</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> stores in the RAM <b>12</b> only the timer program information specifying the program on which the instruction for the timer recording has been accepted without performing the process of Step S<b>14</b> (S<b>15</b>), and terminates the process.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0072">In the processing procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> above, although the process performing a reservation for timer recording using the EPG has been shown, the reservation for timer recording may be performed by other methods such as a method using G-code. Further, in place of determining whether the program to be timer-recorded is a program of the limited video based on the EPG data, the information specifying whether the program on which the instruction for the timer recording has been accepted is a program of the limited video may be inputted to the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b>, by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart showing a processing procedure when the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 1 records a video, and the control section <b>11</b> executes it according to the control program stored in the ROM <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0074">The control section <b>11</b> determines as needed whether it has reached the recording start clock time at which time the recording is specified to be started based on the internal clock time clocked by the clocking section <b>14</b> according to the timer program information stored in the RAM <b>12</b> (S<b>21</b>). When it is determined that the recording start clock time is not yet reached (S<b>21</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> continues the determination of whether it has reached the recording start clock time. When it is determined that the recording start clock time is reached (S<b>21</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the limiting information is associated with the timer program information specifying the program to be recorded (S<b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0075">In Step S<b>22</b>, when it is determined that the limiting information is associated with the timer program information (S<b>22</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> receives the broadcasting signal of the channel specified by the timer program information with the tuner section <b>23</b> until the broadcast end clock time, and records the data which has decoded the received broadcasting signal by the signal processing section <b>21</b>, in a recording medium at the drive section <b>22</b>. At this time, the video of the program identified by the timer program information is associated with metadata such as the recording start clock time, a recording date, and a program name extracted from the EPG data and the limiting information, and is recorded in the recording medium by the drive section <b>22</b>. Also, at the same time, the control section <b>11</b> records a video of a counterprogram and its metadata being broadcasted in parallel on a channel other than the channel on which the program identified by the timer program information is broadcasted, in a recording medium by the drive section <b>22</b> associating with the program identified by the timer program information (S<b>23</b>). In the meantime, the control section <b>11</b> causes the signal processing section <b>21</b> to encode the video of the counterprogram by a higher compression ratio with respect to a compression ratio of the video of the program identified by the timer program information and encoded by the signal processing section <b>21</b>, and causes the drive section <b>22</b> to record it in the recording medium. In the meantime, the channel of the counterprogram may be set beforehand to a specific channel, for example a channel specialized in educational programs that never broadcasts a program of the limited video, or may be selected at random. However, when selecting the counterprogram at random, it is necessary to select a program that is not a program of the limited video.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0076">In Step S<b>22</b>, when it is determined that the limiting information is not associated with the timer program information (S<b>22</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> causes the drive section <b>22</b> to record only the video and metadata of the program identified by the timer program information in the recording medium (S<b>24</b>). After a process of Step S<b>23</b> or Step S<b>24</b> is finished, the control section <b>11</b> terminates the process.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are flowcharts showing a processing procedure when the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 1 reproduces a video, and the control section <b>11</b> executes it according to the control program stored in the ROM <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0078">As mentioned above, the drive section <b>22</b> may record two or more videos within the storage capacity of the recording medium. Therefore, as supporting means for selecting a video that the user wants to reproduce from the two or more videos recorded in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b>, the control section <b>11</b> may process to display thumbnails, each of which is a reduced image of an image (for example, an image at the recording start clock time) contained in each of the videos recorded in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b>, on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b>. However, because there is a limit to the number of thumbnails that can be displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> at the same time, the control section <b>11</b> simultaneously displays a predetermined number of thumbnails corresponding to the predetermined number of videos on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b>, respectively, from those with newer recording start clock times, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0079">The control section <b>11</b> stands by for an acceptance of a display instruction of the thumbnails of the videos recorded in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b> (S<b>31</b>). In the meantime, the display instruction of the thumbnails of the videos is given to the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller. When there is no acceptance of the display instruction of the thumbnails (S<b>31</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> continues standing by for the acceptance of the display instruction of the thumbnails. When the display instruction of the thumbnails has been accepted by the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller optical receiving section <b>17</b> (S<b>31</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether a limited video associated with the limiting information is included in the predetermined number of videos that are recorded in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b> to be displayed as thumbnails (S<b>32</b>). When it is determined that a limited video is included in the predetermined number of videos to be displayed as thumbnails (S<b>32</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the internal clock time is within time period from the recording start clock time of the limited video to be displayed as thumbnails to the predetermined clock time stored in the ROM <b>13</b>, that is, time period during which the limited video can be reproduced (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;reproducible time period&#x201d;) (S<b>33</b>). When it is determined that the internal clock time is not within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>33</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> replaces the thumbnail of the limited video among the predetermined number of thumbnails with a thumbnail of the video of the counterprogram recorded simultaneously with the limited video, and displays the predetermined number of thumbnails on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> with the thumbnail of the video that is not a limited video (S<b>34</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">In Step S<b>32</b>, when it is determined that a limited video is not included in the predetermined number of videos to be displayed as thumbnails (S<b>32</b>: NO), or in Step S<b>33</b>, when it is determined that the internal clock time is within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>33</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> displays the predetermined number of thumbnails corresponding to the predetermined number of videos on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b>, respectively, by outputting data for the predetermined number of thumbnails as they are from the output section <b>24</b> to the television receiver <b>3</b> (S<b>35</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">After a process of Step S<b>34</b> or Step S<b>35</b> is finished, the control section <b>11</b> stands by for an acceptance of a reproduction instruction of any one of the two or more videos whose thumbnails are displayed on the television receiver <b>3</b> (S<b>36</b>). In the meantime, the reproduction instruction of the video is given to the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller. When there is no acceptance of the reproduction instruction (S<b>36</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> returns the process to Step S<b>32</b>. Therefore, when the user does not perform any operation where the thumbnails are displayed, the control section <b>11</b> continues the display of the predetermined number of thumbnails by repeating the processes from Step S<b>32</b> to Step S<b>36</b>, as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0082">By the way, in this case, the determination result in Step S<b>32</b> as mentioned above will not change, and when it is &#x201c;NO&#x201d; (a limited video is not included in the predetermined number of videos), the control section <b>11</b> continues displaying the same thumbnails as before on the television receiver <b>3</b>. Further, when the determination result in Step S<b>32</b> is &#x201c;YES&#x201d; (a limited video is included in the predetermined number of videos), the control section <b>11</b> executes the determination process in Step S<b>33</b>, as mentioned above. By the way, this determination result in Step S<b>33</b> may change from &#x201c;YES&#x201d; to &#x201c;NO&#x201d; or vice versa, from &#x201c;NO&#x201d; to &#x201c;YES&#x201d; as time passes. Therefore, when the internal clock time shifts from outside the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>33</b>: NO) to inside the reproducible time period (S<b>33</b>: YES) while the user does not perform any operation where the thumbnails are displayed, the predetermined number of thumbnails including the thumbnail of the limited video are displayed as they are, in place of the thumbnail of the video of the counterprograms being displayed till then (S<b>35</b>). On the contrary, when the internal clock time shifts from inside the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>33</b>: YES) to outside the reproducible time period (S<b>33</b>: NO) while the user does not perform any operation where the thumbnails are displayed, the thumbnail of the limited video being displayed till then, is replaced with the thumbnail of the video of the counterprogram, and the predetermined number of thumbnails are displayed (S<b>34</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0083">In either case, when a reproduction instruction of any one of the videos has been accepted while the predetermined number of thumbnails are displayed as mentioned above (S<b>36</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> causes the drive section <b>22</b> to read-out from the recording medium data of the video instructed for the reproduction, and causes the signal processing section <b>21</b> to process the read-out data and to output it from the output section <b>24</b> to the television receiver <b>3</b>. Thus, by the television receiver <b>3</b> displaying the video based on the data outputted from the signal processing section <b>21</b>, reproduction of the video instructed for the reproduction is started (S<b>37</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0084">After the reproduction of the video has been started, until the reproduction of the video is finished, the control section <b>11</b> repeatedly executes the following process. First, the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the video under reproduction is a limited video (S<b>38</b>). When the video under reproduction is not a limited video (S<b>38</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the video under reproduction has been reproduced to the end (S<b>39</b>), and determines whether a reproduction stop instruction by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller has been accepted (S<b>40</b>). When the reproduction of the video under reproduction has not been performed to the end (S<b>39</b>: NO) and the reproduction stop instruction has not been accepted (S<b>40</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> returns the process to Step S<b>38</b>, and repeats a similar process as mentioned above while continuing the reproduction of the video (S<b>41</b>). When the reproduction of the video under reproduction has been performed to the end (S<b>39</b>: YES), or when a reproduction stop instruction has been accepted (S<b>40</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> stops the reproduction of the video (S<b>42</b>), and returns the process to Step S<b>31</b>. Therefore, when the reproduction of the video that is not a limited video has been started, the video will be reproduced to the end unless the user instructs a stop for the reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0085">On the other hand, when the video under reproduction is a limited video (S<b>38</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the internal clock time is within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>43</b>). When it is determined that the internal clock time is within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>43</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>39</b>, and performs a similar process to the process in the case that the video under reproduction is not a limited video, as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0086">However, when it is determined that the internal clock time is not within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>43</b>: NO), specifically, when the internal clock time shifts from inside the reproducible time period (S<b>43</b>: YES) to outside the reproducible time period (S<b>43</b>: NO) during the reproduction of the limited video, the control section <b>11</b> forcibly stops the reproduction of the limited video that is under reproduction (S<b>42</b>), and returns the process to Step S<b>31</b>. Therefore, though the reproduction of the limited video can be started during the reproducible time period of the limited video, the reproduction of the limited video will be stopped when the reproducible time period of the limited video is over. In this case, because the reproducible time period of the limited video has already passed, though the user again instructs to display the thumbnails in order to again reproduce the limited video whose reproduction was stopped, the thumbnail of the counterprogram will be displayed without displaying the thumbnail of the limited video, as mentioned above. Therefore, the limited video whose reproduction has been forcibly stopped cannot be reproduced until the next reproducible time period of the limited video comes.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0087">In the meantime, where the videos more than the number corresponding to the predetermined number of thumbnails being displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> are recorded in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b>, it may be possible to display the thumbnails of the respective videos from those with newer recording start clock times to those with older recording start clock times per a predetermined number at a time, by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller. Of course, when a thumbnail displayed in this way is specified by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller similar to that as mentioned above, reproduction of a corresponding video will be started and, thus, the procedure according to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> will be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is schematic views illustrating states in which a predetermined number of thumbnails are displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) shows a case where a thumbnail of the limited video is displayed during the reproducible time period, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>) shows a case where a thumbnail of the limited video is displayed during a time period other than the reproducible time period.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0089">A plurality of thumbnails <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> (or <b>38</b>), <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b>. By operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller to select any one of the thumbnails, the user can start reproduction of the selected video. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) shows a state where the thumbnail <b>33</b> is selected, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>) shows a state where the thumbnail <b>38</b> is selected. Further, for the selected thumbnail, the metadata <b>31</b> such as a recording start clock time, recording date, program name and channel number are displayed on an upper left portion of the screen. During the reproducible time period of the limited video, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), the thumbnail <b>33</b> of the limited video is displayed as it is, and an indication of &#x201c;PG-13&#x201d; indicating that the video of the thumbnail <b>33</b> is a limited video is also included in the metadata <b>31</b>. On the other hand, during a time period other than the reproducible time period of the limited video, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>), the thumbnail <b>33</b> of the limited video is not displayed, and the thumbnail <b>38</b> of the video of the counterprogram to the limited video is displayed instead. However, because this image of the thumbnail <b>38</b> is not the limiting information, the metadata <b>31</b> thereof does not include data indicative of the limited video.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0090">In the meantime, although examples in which one thumbnail of the limited video is included are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, two or more thumbnails of limited videos may exist among the predetermined number of thumbnails displayed on the same screen and at the same time. However, when the recording start clock time of the respective limited videos differs from the others, the number of thumbnails of the limited videos to be displayed may differ depending on the internal clock time.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0091">As mentioned above, in the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 1 of the invention, because it is configured so that the user specifies a video that he/she wants to reproduce by selecting its thumbnail, the thumbnail <b>33</b> of the limited video is not displayed during a time period other than the reproducible time period of the limited video. For this reason, reproduction of the limited video cannot be started during a time period other than the reproducible time period of the limited video. Further, though the reproduction of the limited video was started during the reproducible time period of the limited video, the reproduction of the limited video will be forcibly stopped when it passes the reproducible time period of the limited video during the reproduction, and the limited video cannot be reproduced until the next reproducible time period of the limited video comes. Therefore, the limited video recorded in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b> is inhibited from being reproduced during a time period other than the reproducible time period.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0092">In the meantime, in Embodiment 1 mentioned above, a process to display the thumbnails on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> as content information of the videos has been performed. However, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> may also be configured so that the metadata of the respective videos are displayed in a list on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> as the content information of the videos, and the user selects a video that he/she wants to reproduce using the metadata. Also in this case, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> displays the metadata of the counterprogram corresponding to each of the limited videos instead of the metadata of the limited video during a time period other than the reproducible time period of each of the limited videos.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0093">As explained in detail above, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 1 of the invention also records the video of the counterprogram when recording the limited video to be limited in viewing by a viewer such as a young person not satisfying the view allowance condition. When the thumbnail indicating the recorded limited video is displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b>, the thumbnail of the video of the counterprogram is displayed during a time period other than the reproducible time period of the limited video, and the thumbnail of the limited video is displayed during the reproducible time period. As a result, because the thumbnail of the limited video is not displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> during a time period other than the reproducible time period of the limited video, the viewer cannot recognize that the limited video is recorded and, thus, it is possible to surely prevent the limited video from being reproduced. Therefore, when the broadcasting time period of the limited videos is limited to the middle of the night during which young people are asleep, though the limited video is recorded, because the recorded limited video is reproducible only during a time period from a recording start clock time of the limited video itself, that is, from a broadcasted clock time at which the limited video is actually broadcasted, to the predetermined clock time (the reproducible time period of the limited video), it is possible to prevent the viewer not satisfying the view allowance condition from viewing the limited video.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0094">Further, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 1 of the invention displays the thumbnail of the video of the counterprogram to the limited video on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> during a time period other than the reproducible time period of the limited video. Thus, by the user who performed a reservation for timer recording of the limited video checking the thumbnail of the counterprogram, he/she can check that the limited video is recorded though the thumbnail of the limited video is not displayed. Further, because the video of the counterprogram is encoded with a compression ratio higher than a limited video, and is recorded in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b>, it is possible to reduce an extra volume of the recording medium necessary to record the counterprogram as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0095">Further, in the present invention, because the internal clock time (i.e., the clock time inside the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> that is clocked by the clocking section <b>14</b>) is synchronized with the external clock time of the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> (the standard time of the area where the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> is installed) using the external clock time information indicative of the external clock time, it is possible to correctly manage the reproducible time period of the limited video. For this reason, it is possible to prevent an irregular operation to reproduce the limited video during a time period other than the reproducible time period of the limited video by intentionally changing the internal clock time clocked by the clocking section <b>14</b> in the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b>. Therefore, it is possible to surely prevent a viewer not satisfy the view allowance condition from viewing the limited video during a time period other than the reproducible time period of the limited video by irregularly operating the internal clock time.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0096">In the meantime, in Embodiment 1, upon a reservation for timer recording, although it is configured so that it acquires the limiting information specifying that a program is a program of the limited video based on the EPG data, or acquires the limiting information from the operation of the user, the method of acquiring the limiting information is not limited thereto. Some broadcasting stations may broadcast a limited video with a broadcasting signal including information specifying that it is a limited video. Therefore, when the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the invention receives and records the broadcasting signal including the information specifying that it is such a limited video, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> may also be configured so that it records the received video and the limiting information associated with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0097">In the meantime, in Embodiment 1, it is configured so that it performs a process to record the video of the counterprogram together with the limited video, and display the thumbnail of the video of the counterprogram instead of the limited video during a time period other than the reproducible time period, that is, time period other than time period from the recording start clock time of the limited video to the predetermined clock time. However, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 1 may also be configured so that it does not record the video of the counterprogram. In this case, it may be preferable that only a predetermined number of thumbnails of videos other than the limited video are displayed during a time period other than the reproducible time period of the limited video.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0098">Further, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the invention may also be configured so that it allows the television receiver <b>3</b> to display the thumbnail of the limited video also during a time period other than the reproducible time period, and the user can arbitrarily set whether to display the thumbnail of the limited video during a time period other than the reproducible time period. In this case, though the display of the thumbnail of the limited video is instructed during a time period other than the reproducible time period, it may be preferable to configure the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> so as not to perform the display.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0099">Further, in Embodiment 1, although the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> is configured so that the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> itself limits reproduction of the video recorded in the recording medium with the drive section <b>22</b>, it may not be limited thereto. For example, of course, when a recording medium in which data of a video is recorded by other recording apparatus is loaded to the drive section <b>22</b>, it may also be possible to perform a process to limit reproduction of the limited video recorded in the recording medium. Further, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> may be a play-only apparatus. Also, in this case, it may be possible to realize a function of the video reproducing apparatus of the present invention by limiting reproduction of a limited video when the video recorded in the recording medium by the other recording apparatus is reproduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="p-0094" num="0100">Next, a video reproducing apparatus according to Embodiment 2 of the invention will be explained. In Embodiment 2, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> performs a process to unexceptionally limit reproduction of a video recorded during specific time period such as the middle of the night during which there is a possibility that a limited video is broadcasted (hereinafter, referred to as limiting time period). The video reproducing apparatus of such an Embodiment 2 is effective, for example, when timer recording a program that does not include information specifying a program of the limited video, when timer recording an analog TV broadcasting by a manual setting, or when starting a recording of an analog TV broadcasting directly by an operation of the user with the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0101">However, because an internal configuration example of the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 2 is similar to that of the video reproducing apparatus according to Embodiment 1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an explanation thereof will be omitted. In Embodiment 2, by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller, specific time period during which there is a possibility that a limited video is broadcasted (for example, from 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.) is specified. The video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> sets the specified time period as limiting time period, and stores the set limiting time period in the RAM <b>12</b>. Further, similar to the case of Embodiment 1, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> performs a process to accept a reservation for programmed recording, and record a video of the reserved program and metadata thereof associated with each other in a recording medium by the drive section <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are flowcharts showing a processing procedure when the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 2 reproduces a video, and the control section <b>11</b> executes it according to the control program stored in the ROM <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0103">The control section <b>11</b> stands by for an acceptance of a display instruction of thumbnails of the videos recorded in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b> (S<b>51</b>). In the meantime, the display instruction of the thumbnails of the videos is given to the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller. When there is no acceptance of the display instruction of the thumbnails (S<b>51</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> continues standing by for the acceptance of the display instruction of the thumbnails. When the display instruction of the thumbnails has been accepted by the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller optical receiving section <b>17</b> (S<b>51</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether a video, whose recording start clock time is included within the limiting time period stored in the RAM <b>12</b> (hereinafter, referred to as limiting time period video), is included in the predetermined number of videos to be displayed with thumbnails by referring to metadata associated with the video and recorded in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b> (S<b>52</b>). When it is determined that the limiting time period video is included (S<b>52</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the internal clock time is within the limiting time period (S<b>53</b>). When it is determined that the internal clock time is not within the limiting time period (S<b>53</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> displays a predetermined number of thumbnails of the videos on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> except for the limiting time period video (S<b>54</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0104">In Step S<b>52</b>, when it is determined that there is no limiting time period video in the two or more videos to be displayed by the thumbnails (S<b>52</b>: NO), or in Step S<b>53</b>, when it is determined that the internal clock time is within the limiting time period (S<b>53</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> displays the predetermined number of thumbnails corresponding to the predetermined number of videos on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b>, respectively, by outputting data of the predetermined number of thumbnails as they are, from the output section <b>24</b> to the television receiver <b>3</b> (S<b>55</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0105">After the process in Step S<b>54</b> or Step S<b>55</b> is finished, the control section <b>11</b> stands by for an acceptance of a reproduction instruction of any one of the two or more videos whose thumbnails are displayed on the television receiver <b>3</b> (S<b>56</b>). In the meantime, the reproduction instruction of the video is given to the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller. When there has been no acceptance of the reproduction instruction (S<b>56</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> returns the process to Step S<b>52</b>. Therefore, when the user does not perform any operation where the thumbnails are displayed, the control section <b>11</b> continues the display of the predetermined number of thumbnails by repeating the process from Step S<b>52</b> to Step S<b>56</b>, as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0106">By the way, in this case, the determination result in Step S<b>52</b> mentioned above will not change, and when it is &#x201c;NO&#x201d; (where limiting time period video is not included in the predetermined number of thumbnails), the control section <b>11</b> continues displaying the same thumbnails as before on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b>. Further, when the determination result in Step S<b>52</b> is &#x201c;YES&#x201d; (where limiting time period video is included in the predetermined number of thumbnails), the control section <b>11</b> performs the determination process in Step S<b>53</b>, as mentioned above. By the way, the determination result in Step S<b>53</b> may change from &#x201c;YES&#x201d; to &#x201c;NO&#x201d;, or vise versa from &#x201c;NO&#x201d; to &#x201c;YES&#x201d;, as time passes. Therefore, when the internal clock time shifts from outside the limiting time period (S<b>53</b>: NO) to inside the limiting time period (S<b>53</b>: YES) while the user does not perform any operation where the thumbnails are displayed, the predetermined number of thumbnails, including the thumbnail of the limiting time period video that has not been displayed till then are displayed (S<b>55</b>). On the contrary, when the internal clock time shifts from inside the limiting time period (S<b>53</b>: YES) to outside the limiting time period (S<b>53</b>: NO) while the user does not perform any operation where the thumbnails are displayed, the predetermined number of thumbnails not including the thumbnail of the limiting time period video that has been displayed till then are displayed (S<b>54</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0107">In either case, when the reproduction instruction of any one of the videos has been accepted while the predetermined number of thumbnails are displayed as mentioned above (S<b>56</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> causes the drive section <b>22</b> to read out data of the video that is instructed for the reproduction from a recording medium, and causes the signal processing section <b>21</b> to process the read-out data and output it from the output section <b>24</b> to the television receiver <b>3</b>. Thus, the reproduction of the video that is instructed for reproduction is started by reproducing the video on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> based on the data outputted from the signal processing section <b>21</b> (S<b>57</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0108">The control section <b>11</b> repeatedly executes the following process until the reproduction of the video is finished after the reproduction of the video has been started. First, the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the video under reproduction is the limiting time period video (S<b>58</b>). When the video under reproduction is not the limiting time period video (S<b>58</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the video under reproduction has been reproduced to the end (S<b>59</b>), and whether it has accepted a reproduction stop instruction by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller (S<b>60</b>). When the reproduction of the video under reproduction has not been performed to the end (S<b>59</b>: NO) and the reproduction stop instruction has not been accepted (S<b>60</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> returns the process to Step S<b>58</b> and repeats a similar process as mentioned above while continuing the reproduction of the video (S<b>61</b>). When the reproduction of the video under reproduction has been performed to the end (S<b>59</b>: YES), or when the reproduction stop instruction has been accepted (S<b>60</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> stops the reproduction of the video (S<b>62</b>), and returns the process to Step S<b>51</b>. Therefore, when the reproduction of the video whose recording start clock time is not included in the limiting time period, that is, the video that is not a limiting time period video, has been started, the video will be reproduced to the end unless the user instructs a stop for the reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0109">When the video under reproduction is a limiting time period video (S<b>58</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the internal clock time is within the limiting time period (S<b>63</b>). When it is determined that the internal clock time is within the limiting time period (S<b>63</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>59</b>, and performs a similar process to the case where the video under reproduction is not the limiting time period video, as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0110">However, when it is determined that the internal clock time is not within the limiting time period (S<b>63</b>: NO), specifically, when the internal clock time shifts from inside the limiting time period (S<b>63</b>: YES) to outside the limiting time period (S<b>63</b>: NO) during the reproduction of the limiting time period video, the control section <b>11</b> forcibly stops the reproduction of the limiting time period video under reproduction (S<b>62</b>), and returns the process to Step S<b>51</b>. Therefore, though the reproduction of the limiting time period video could have been started during the limiting time period, the reproduction of the video will be stopped when the limiting time period is over. In this case, because it has already passed the limiting time period, though the user again instructs the display of the thumbnails to reproduce the video again that was stopped in its reproduction, the thumbnail of the limiting time period video will not be displayed. Therefore, the video whose reproduction was forcibly stopped cannot be reproduced until the next limiting time period comes.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0111">In the meantime, when videos more than the number corresponding to the predetermined number of thumbnails being displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> are recorded in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b>, by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller, it is possible to display the thumbnails of the respective videos per a predetermined number at a time, from those with older recording start clock times to those with newer recording start clock times. Of course, similar to the above, when a thumbnail displayed in this way is specified by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller, then reproduction of the corresponding video is started, and it will be processed in the procedure according to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0112">As mentioned above, in Embodiment 2, the middle of the night when the limited video may be broadcasted is set as the limiting time period. Further, when the thumbnails of the recorded videos are displayed for reproduction of the videos, for a thumbnail of a video (a limiting time period video) that was started its recording at a clock time included in the set limiting time period, it is displayed during the limiting time period and not displayed during a time period other than the limiting time period. As a result, because the thumbnail of the video (a limiting time period video) that is started its recording at a clock time included in the limiting time period and may include a limited video that is not displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> during a time period other than the limiting time period, a viewer cannot recognize that such a video is recorded and, thus, it is possible to surely prevent the limited video from being reproduced. Further, though reproduction of the limiting time period video is started during the limiting time period, the reproduction of the limiting time period video will be forcibly stopped when it passes the limiting time period during the reproduction and, then, it cannot be reproduced until the next limiting time period comes. Therefore, though the limited video broadcasted during the limiting time period was recorded, since the recorded limited video is reproducible only during the limiting time period, it is possible to prevent a viewer not satisfying the view allowance condition from viewing the limited video.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0113">In the meantime, in Embodiment 2, although the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> is configured so that the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> itself limits the reproduction of the video recorded in the recording medium by the drive section <b>22</b>, it may not be limited thereto. For example, when a recording medium in which data of a video was recorded by other recording apparatus is loaded into the drive section <b>22</b>, of course, it may also be configured so that a process to inhibit reproduction of a video (a limiting time period video), whose recording start clock time is included in the limiting time period set in the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the invention, among the videos recorded in the recording medium is performed during a time period other than the limiting time period. Further, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> may be a play-only apparatus. Even in this case, when reproducing the video recorded in the recording medium by the other recording apparatus, it may be possible to realize a function of the video reproducing apparatus of the invention by inhibiting reproduction of the video, whose recording start clock time is included in the limiting time period set in the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b>, during a time period other than the limiting time period.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading>
<p id="p-0108" num="0114">Next, a video reproducing apparatus according to Embodiment 3 of the invention will be explained. The video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 1 mentioned above is configured so that it limits viewing of a limited video by a viewer not satisfying the view allowance condition by inhibiting reproduction of the limited video during a time period other than the time period from a recording start clock time of the recorded limited video to the predetermined clock time (the reproducible time period of the limited video). However, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 3 of the invention reproduces the limited video with a degraded image quality during a time period other than the reproducible time period.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0115">However, because an internal configuration example of the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 3 is similar to that of the video reproducing apparatus according to Embodiment 1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an explanation thereof will be omitted. Further, similar to the case of Embodiment 1, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 3 performs a process to accept a reservation for timer recording, and associates a video of a program reserved for the timer recording with metadata and records the video and the metadata in a recording medium with the drive section <b>22</b>. Further, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 3 is also similar to that of Embodiment 1 in that a thumbnail that is a reduced image of an image contained in each video is displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b>, as supporting means for the user to select a video to be reproduced among two or more recorded videos. However, in Embodiment 3, a thumbnail of a limited video is also displayed regardless of time period.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0117">The control section <b>11</b> of the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> accepts a reproduction instruction specifying a video to be reproduced among two or more videos whose thumbnails are displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> (S<b>71</b>). In this case, as mentioned above, a thumbnail of limited video is also displayed regardless of time period. Further, the reproduction instruction is given to the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller. The control section <b>11</b> then determines whether the video to be reproduced is a limited video is recorded associated with limiting information in the recording medium of the drive section <b>22</b> (S<b>72</b>). When it is determined that the video to be reproduced is a limited video (S<b>72</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the internal clock time is within time period from a recording start clock time of the limited video to be reproduced to a predetermined clock time stored in the ROM <b>13</b>, that is, a reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>73</b>). When it is determined that the internal clock time is not within the reproducible time period of the limited video to be reproduced (S<b>73</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> causes the drive section <b>22</b> to read out data of the video instructed for reproduction from the recording medium, and causes the signal processing section <b>21</b> to perform a signal processing to reduce a red component from the read-out data and output it from the output section <b>24</b> to the television receiver <b>3</b>. Thereby, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> causes the television receiver <b>3</b> to start reproduction of the video that is reduced in red from the original video (S<b>74</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0118">On the other hand, in Step S<b>72</b>, when it is determined that the video to be reproduced is not a limited video (S<b>72</b>: NO), or in Step S<b>73</b>, when it is determined that the internal clock time is within the reproducible time period of the limited video to be reproduced (S<b>73</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> starts reproduction of the video instructed for the reproduction by reproducing the video (the original video, red of which is not reduced) on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b> as it is (S<b>75</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0119">The control section <b>11</b> repeatedly executes the following process until the reproduction of the video is finished after the reproduction of the video has been started in Step S<b>74</b> or S<b>75</b>.

When the video under reproduction is not a limited video (S<b>76</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the video under reproduction has been reproduced to the end (S<b>77</b>), and whether a reproduction stop instruction by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> and the remote controller has been accepted (S<b>78</b>). When the reproduction of the video under reproduction has not been performed to the end (S<b>77</b>. NO), and when the reproduction stop instruction has not been accepted (S<b>78</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> returns the process to Step S<b>76</b> and repeats a similar process as mentioned above, while continuing the reproduction of the video (in this case, the original video, red of which is not reduced) under reproduction (S<b>79</b>). When the reproduction of the video (in this case, the original video) under reproduction has been reproduced to the end (S<b>77</b>: YES), or when the reproduction stop instruction has been accepted (S<b>78</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> stops the reproduction of the video (S<b>80</b>), and returns the process to Step S<b>71</b>. Therefore, when reproduction of a video that is not a limited video has been started, the video will be reproduced to the end unless the user instructs a stop to the reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0120">When the video under reproduction is a limited video (S<b>76</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the video under reproduction is an original video (S<b>81</b>). When the video under reproduction is an original video (S<b>81</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> then determines whether the internal clock time is within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>82</b>). When it is determined that the internal clock time is within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>82</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>77</b>, and performs a similar process to the case as mentioned above where the video under reproduction is not the limited video.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0121">However, when it is determined that the internal clock time is not within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>82</b>: NO), specifically, when the internal clock time shifts from inside the reproducible time period (S<b>82</b>: YES) to outside the reproducible time period during the reproduction of the limited video (S<b>82</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> restarts the reproduction of the limited video while reducing in red from this point, although the limited video has been reproduced by an original video (S<b>83</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0122">Thus, until the reproduction of the limited video is finished after the reproduction of the limited video reduced in red has been started, the control section <b>11</b> repeatedly executes the following process. First, the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the limited video under reproduction has been reproduced to the end (S<b>77</b>), and whether a reproduction stop instruction by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller has been accepted (S<b>78</b>). When the limited video under reproduction reduced in red has not been reproduced to the end (S<b>77</b>: NO), and when a reproduction stop instruction has not been accepted (S<b>78</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> returns the process to Step S<b>76</b>, and repeats a similar process as mentioned above, while continuing the reproduction of the limited video reduced in red (S<b>79</b>).

Therefore, also when the reproducible time period of the limited video has passed after the reproduction of the limited video has been started during the reproducible time period, the limited video will be reproduced to the end in a state where red is reduced unless the user instructs a stop to the reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0123">On the other hand, when the video under reproduction is a limited video but not an original video, that is, when the limited video has been reproduced in a state where red is reduced (S<b>76</b>: YES, and S<b>81</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> then determines whether the internal clock time is within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>84</b>). When it is determined that the internal clock time is not within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>84</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>77</b>, and performs a similar process as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0124">However, when it is determined that the internal clock time is within the reproducible time period of the limited video (S<b>84</b>: YES), specifically, when the internal clock time during the reproduction of the limited video reduced in red shifts from outside the reproducible time period (S<b>84</b>: NO) to inside the reproducible time period (S<b>84</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> restores the limited video that has been reproduced while being reduced in red till then to the original video, and restarts the reproduction (S<b>85</b>). After this, the control section <b>11</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>77</b>, and performs a similar process as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0125">Therefore, when it shifts into the reproducible time period of the limited video after the reproduction of the limited video has been started in a state where red is reduced during a time period other than the reproducible time period, the limited video will be reproduced to the end as an original video unless the user instructs a stop to the reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0126">As mentioned above, in the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 3 of the invention, by reducing red from the video being reproduced on the screen of the television receiver <b>3</b>, for example, because the color of blood does not appear in its original color in violence expression, and the color of skin appears bluish in sexual expression, the influence of the limited video on the viewer is reduced. Therefore, in Embodiment 3, by degrading the image quality of the limited video being reproduced during a time period other than the reproducible time period, also in the case that the limited video is reproduced by mistake during a time period other than the reproducible time period, it is possible to reduce the influence on a viewer not satisfying the view allowance condition, such as a young person who needs to be limited in viewing the limited video.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0127">In the meantime, in Embodiment 3, although the video reproducing apparatus is configured so that red contained in the limited video is reduced as an example when reproducing the limited video during a time period other than the reproducible time period, the method of degrading the image quality of the limited video may not be limited thereto. As other methods, when the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the invention reproduces the limited video during a time period other than the reproducible time period, a process of degrading the limited video using the other method such as converting the limited video into monochrome, or applying mosaic to the limited video, for example, may be performed.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading>
<p id="p-0122" num="0128">Next, a video reproducing apparatus according to Embodiment 4 of the invention will be explained. The video reproducing apparatus according to Embodiment 2 mentioned above is configured so that it limits viewing of the limited video by a viewer not satisfying the view allowance condition by inhibiting reproduction of a video that is recorded during a specific limiting time period, during a time period other than the limiting time period. However, the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 4 of the invention, during a time period other than the limiting time period, reproduces a video, which is recorded during a specific limiting time period, by being degraded an image quality. The video reproducing apparatus of such Embodiment 4 is effective, for example, when a program not including information specifying a program of the limited video is timer-recorded, when an analog TV broadcasting is timer-recorded by a manual setting, or when a recording of an analog TV broadcasting is started directly by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> or the remote controller.</p>

When the reproduction of the video (in this case, the original video) under reproduction has been performed to the end (S<b>107</b>: YES), or when the reproduction stop instruction has been accepted (S<b>108</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> stops the reproduction of the video (S<b>110</b>), and returns the process to Step S<b>101</b>. Therefore, when reproduction of a video that is not a limiting time period video has been started, the video will be reproduced to the end unless the user instructs a stop for the reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0134">When the video under reproduction is a limiting time period video (S<b>106</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the video under reproduction is an original video (S<b>111</b>). When the video under reproduction is the original video (S<b>111</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> then determines whether the internal clock time is within the limiting time period (S<b>112</b>). When it is determined that the internal clock time is within the limiting time period (S<b>112</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>107</b>, and performs a similar process to the case where the video under reproduction is not a limiting time period video, as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0135">However, when it is determined that the internal clock time is not within the limiting time period (S<b>112</b>: NO), specifically, when the internal clock time shifts from inside the limiting time period (S<b>112</b>: YES) to outside the limiting time period (S<b>112</b>: NO) during the reproduction of the limiting time period video, the control section <b>11</b> restarts reproduction of the limiting time period video while reducing in red, although the limiting time period video has been reproduced till then by the original video (S<b>113</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0136">Thus, after the reproduction of the limiting time period video reduced in red has been started, the control section <b>11</b> repeatedly executes the following process until the reproduction of the video is finished. First, the control section <b>11</b> determines whether the video (a video reduced in red from the limiting time period video) under reproduction has been reproduced to the end (S<b>107</b>), and whether it has accepted a reproduction stop instruction by the user operating the operating section <b>16</b> and the remote controller (S<b>108</b>). When it is determined that the reproduction of the video reduced in red under reproduction is not performed to the end (S<b>107</b>: NO), and when the reproduction stop instruction has not been accepted (S<b>108</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> returns the process to Step S<b>106</b> and repeats a similar process as mentioned above while continuing the reproduction of the video reduced in red (S<b>109</b>). When the video under reproduction reduced in red has been reproduced to the end (S<b>107</b>: YES), or when the reproduction stop instruction has been accepted (S<b>108</b>: YES), the control section <b>11</b> stops the reproduction of the video reduced in red (S<b>110</b>), and returns the process to Step S<b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0137">Therefore, when the limiting time period has passed after the reproduction of the limiting time period video was started during the limiting time period as an original video, the video will be reproduced to the end in a state where red is reduced unless the user instructs a stop for the reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0138">On the other hand, when the video under reproduction is a limiting time period video but not an original video, that is, when the limiting time period video has been reproduced in a state where red is reduced (S<b>106</b>: YES, and S<b>111</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> then determines whether the internal clock time is within the limiting time period (S<b>114</b>). When it is determined that the internal clock time is not within the limiting time period (S<b>114</b>: NO), the control section <b>11</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>107</b>, and performs a similar process as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0139">However, when it is determined that the internal clock time is within the limiting time period (S<b>114</b>: YES), specifically, when the internal clock time shifts from outside the limiting time period (S<b>114</b>: NO) to inside the limiting time period (S<b>114</b>: YES) while being reproduced in a state where red is reduced, the control section <b>11</b> restores the video to the original video, that has been reproduced while being reduced in red till then, and restarts reproduction (S<b>115</b>). After this, the control section <b>11</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>107</b>, and performs a similar process as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0140">Therefore, when it shifts within the limiting time period after the reproduction of the limiting time period video was started in a state where red was reduced during a time period other than the limiting time period, after that, the video will be reproduced to the end in a state of its original video unless the user instructs a stop for the reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0141">As mentioned above, also in Embodiment 4, similar to the case of Embodiment 3, by reducing red of a video that is likely a limited video (a limiting time period video) whose recording start clock time is included in the limiting time period, influence of the video on a viewer may be reduced. Therefore, in Embodiment 4, when a video (a limiting time period video) recorded during the limiting time period during which the limited video may be broadcasted is reproduced, by degrading an image quality of the video, it is possible to reduce the influence on a viewer not satisfying the view allowance condition, such as a young person who needs to be limited in viewing the limited video though the limited video is reproduced by mistake during a time period other than the limiting time period.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0142">In the meantime, in Embodiment 4, similar to Embodiment 3 as mentioned above, although an aspect using a method of reducing red contained in a video as a method of degrading the image quality of the video that is likely a limited video (a limiting time period video) has been shown, it may not be limited thereto. As other methods, when the video reproducing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the invention reproduces a video during a time period other than the reproducible time period, a process of degrading the video using the other methods, such as, converting the video into monochrome, or applying mosaic to the video, for example, may be performed.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0137" num="0143">In the meantime, although an example in which a video is reproduced on a screen of a television receiver has been explained in each of the above-mentioned Embodiments, a configuration in which the video reproducing apparatus according to the present invention itself includes a monitor and a speaker may also be possible, and further, of course, it may also be possible to apply the present invention to a personal computer system including the monitor and speaker.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0144">Further, although a video (a TV program) categorized as PG-13 (Parental Guidance 13th) is illustrated in the above-mentioned Embodiments as a video to be limited in viewing by a viewer not satisfying a view allowance condition to view a limited video (a specific video), it may not be limited thereto.</p>
