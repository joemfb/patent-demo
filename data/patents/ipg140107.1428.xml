<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention concerns a hairspring and the method of manufacturing the same and, more specifically, a hairspring with a raised terminal curve formed in a single piece.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The regulating member of a timepiece generally includes an inertia wheel, called a balance, and a resonator called a hairspring. These parts have a determining role as regards the working quality of the timepiece. Indeed, they regulate the movement, i.e. they control the frequency of the movement.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of a hairspring with a raised terminal curve, many materials and methods have been tested, but without resolving difficulties as regards resonant assembly</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to overcome all or part of the aforecited drawbacks, by providing a one-piece hairspring with a raised terminal curve, whose thermo-elastic coefficient can be adjusted and which is obtained using a manufacturing method that minimises assembly difficulties.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention therefore concerns a one-piece hairspring that includes a balance spring coaxially mounted on a collet, made in the same layer of silicon-based material, characterized in that it includes a device that elevates or raises the outer coil of said balance spring above said layer of silicon-based material in order to improve the concentric development of said hairspring.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0040">The invention relates to a method, generally designated <b>1</b>, for manufacturing a one-piece hairspring <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032; with an elevated or raised terminal curve for a timepiece movement. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref>, method <b>1</b> includes successive steps for forming at least one type hairspring, which can be entirely formed of silicon-based materials.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0041">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</figref>, the first step <b>100</b> consists in taking a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate <b>3</b>. Substrate <b>3</b> includes a top layer <b>5</b> and a bottom layer <b>7</b> each formed of silicon-based material.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0042">Preferably, in this step <b>100</b>, substrate <b>3</b> is selected such that the height of bottom layer <b>7</b> matches the height of one part of the final hairspring <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0043">Preferably, top layer <b>5</b> is used as spacing means relative to bottom layer <b>7</b>. Consequently, the height of top layer <b>5</b> will be adapted in accordance with the configuration of the hairspring with a raised terminal coil <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0044">In a second step <b>101</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a cavity <b>8</b> is selectively etched, for example by a DRIE (deep reactive ionic etch) process, in top layer <b>5</b> of silicon-based material. Cavity <b>8</b> preferably forms a pattern <b>6</b> that defines the inner and outer contours of a silicon part belonging to elevation device <b>2</b> of hairspring <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0045">In a first variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, pattern <b>6</b> forms the median part of elevation means <b>4</b> of elevation device <b>2</b> of hairspring <b>21</b>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates, pattern <b>6</b> takes the approximate form of a curved, rectangular plate. However, advantageously according to method <b>1</b>, the etch on the top layer <b>5</b> leaves complete freedom as regards the geometry of pattern <b>6</b>. Thus, it might not necessarily be rectangular, but, for example, trapezoidal.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0046">In a second variant, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, pattern <b>6</b> forms the intermediate part of elevation means <b>4</b>&#x2032; of elevation device <b>2</b>&#x2032; of hairspring <b>21</b>&#x2032;. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, pattern <b>6</b> takes the approximate form of a curved, rectangular plate. However, advantageously according to method <b>1</b>, the etch on top layer <b>5</b> leaves complete freedom as regards the geometry of pattern <b>6</b>. Thus, in particular, it might not necessarily be rectangular, but, for example, could form a complete ring.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0047">Preferably, for the first variant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, another cavity <b>10</b> may be etched during step <b>101</b> so as to form a pattern <b>9</b> distinct from pattern <b>6</b>, which defines the inner and outer contours of a silicon part respectively belonging to a collet <b>27</b> of hairspring <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0048">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, pattern <b>9</b> thus forms the median part of collet <b>27</b> of hairspring <b>21</b> with a raised terminal curve. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, pattern <b>9</b> is approximately cylinder-shaped with a circular section. However, advantageously according to method <b>1</b>, the etch on top layer <b>5</b> leaves complete freedom as regards the geometry of pattern <b>9</b>. Thus, in particular, it might not necessarily be circular but, may be, for example, elliptical and/or have a non-circular inner diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0049">Preferably, during step <b>101</b>, at least one bridge of material <b>16</b> is made in order to hold the hairspring <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032; with a raised terminal curve on substrate <b>3</b> during manufacture. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that a bridge of material <b>16</b> is left between one of the main surfaces of pattern <b>6</b> and the rest of the non-etched layer <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0050">In a third step <b>102</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an additional layer <b>11</b> of silicon-based material is added to substrate <b>3</b>. Preferably, additional layer <b>11</b> is secured to top layer <b>5</b> by means of silicon fusion bonding (SFB). Thus, step <b>102</b> advantageously covers top layer <b>5</b> by binding the top faces of pattern <b>6</b> and possible <b>9</b>, with a very high level of adherence, to the bottom face of additional layer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0051">In a fourth step <b>103</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, cavities <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> are selectively etched, for example, by a DRIE process similar to that of step <b>101</b>, in additional silicon layer <b>11</b>. These cavities <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> form three patterns <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> and <b>24</b>, which define the inner and outer contours of the silicon parts of hairspring <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032; with a raised terminal curve.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0052">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, pattern <b>17</b> is approximately cylindrical with a circular section, and pattern <b>19</b>, is approximately spiral-shaped. However, advantageously according to method <b>1</b>, the etch on additional layer <b>11</b> allows complete freedom as regards the geometry of patterns <b>17</b> and <b>19</b>. Thus, in particular, pattern <b>19</b> may, for example, have more coils or an inner coil including a Grossmann curve that improves its concentric development, as explained in EP Patent No. 1 612 627, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0053">Preferably, for the first variant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, pattern <b>17</b> made in additional layer <b>11</b> is of similar shape to and plumb with pattern <b>9</b> made in top layer <b>5</b>. This means that cavities <b>18</b> and <b>10</b>, respectively forming the inner diameter of patterns <b>17</b> and <b>9</b>, communicate with each other and are approximately one on top of the other. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, patterns <b>9</b> and <b>17</b> respectively form the upper and median parts of collet <b>27</b> of hairspring <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0054">Advantageously, as patterns <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> are etched at the same time, they form a one-piece part in additional layer <b>11</b>. In the first variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, patterns <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> form respectively the lower portion of collet <b>27</b> and the balance spring <b>25</b> of hairspring <b>21</b> with a raised terminal curve. In the second variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, pattern <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> respectively form first collet <b>27</b>&#x2032; and first balance-spring <b>25</b>&#x2032; of hairspring <b>21</b>&#x2032; with a raised terminal wave.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0055">Preferably, pattern <b>24</b> made in additional layer <b>11</b> is of similar shape to and approximately plumb with pattern <b>6</b> made in top layer <b>5</b>. In the first variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, patterns <b>6</b> and <b>24</b> respectively form the upper and intermediate parts of elevations means <b>4</b> of elevation device <b>2</b> of hairspring <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0056">In the second variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, patterns <b>6</b> and <b>24</b> respectively form the upper and intermediate parts of elevation means <b>4</b>&#x2032; of elevation device <b>2</b>&#x2032; of hairspring <b>21</b>&#x2032;. Of course, similarly, the pattern of bridge of material <b>16</b> can be extended into additional layer <b>11</b> during step <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0057">After this fourth step <b>103</b>, it is clear that patterns <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> and <b>24</b> etched in additional layer <b>11</b> are connected by the bottom of pattern <b>24</b>, with a high level of adherence, above pattern <b>6</b>, which is etched in top layer <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0058">Preferably, as shown in dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, method <b>1</b> can include a fifth step <b>104</b> that consists in oxidising at least pattern <b>19</b>, i.e. the balance spring <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>&#x2032; of hairspring <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032; so as to make said first balance spring more mechanically resistant and to adjust its thermo-elastic coefficient. This oxidising step is explained in EP Patent No. 1 422 436, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0059">Advantageously, according to the invention, after fourth step <b>103</b>, or preferably, after fifth step <b>104</b>, method <b>1</b> may include three embodiments A, B and C, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. However, each of the three embodiments A, B and C ends in the same final step <b>106</b>, which consists in releasing the manufactured hairspring <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032; with a raised terminal curve from substrate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0060">Advantageously, release step <b>106</b> can be achieved simply by applying sufficient forces to hairspring <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032; to break bridge of material <b>16</b>. This forces may, for example, be generated manually by an operator or by machining.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0061">According to a first embodiment A, in a sixth step <b>105</b>, cavities <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are selectively etched, for example by a similar DRIE process to that of steps <b>101</b> and <b>103</b>, in bottom layer <b>7</b> of silicon-based material. These cavities <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> form three patterns <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>22</b>, which define the inner and outer contours of silicon parts of hairspring <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032; with a raised terminal curve.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0062">In the first variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, pattern <b>13</b> is approximately cylinder-shaped with a circular section and pattern <b>15</b> is approximately spiral-shaped. Moreover, pattern <b>22</b> takes the form of a curved rectangular plate. However, advantageously according to method <b>1</b>, the etch in bottom layer <b>7</b> leaves complete freedom as regards the geometry of patterns <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>22</b>. Thus, in particular, pattern <b>15</b> may, for example, have more coils.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0063">Preferably, for the first variant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, pattern <b>13</b>, made in bottom layer <b>7</b>, is of similar shape to and substantially plumb with patterns <b>9</b> and <b>17</b> made in top layer <b>5</b> and additional layer <b>11</b>. This means that cavities <b>12</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>18</b> respectively forming the inner diameters of patterns <b>13</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>17</b>, communicate with each other and are approximately one on top of the other. In the first variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, patterns <b>17</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>13</b> respectively form the high, median and low parts of collet <b>27</b> of hairspring <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0064">Preferably for the second variant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, pattern <b>13</b> made in bottom layer <b>7</b> is of similar shape to and approximately plumb with pattern <b>17</b> made in top layer <b>5</b>. This means that cavities <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> respectively forming the inner diameter of patterns <b>13</b> and <b>17</b> are approximately one on top of the other, without being contiguous. In the second variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, patterns <b>17</b> and <b>13</b> respectively form the first collet <b>27</b>&#x2032; and the second collet <b>27</b>&#x2033; of the double series hairspring <b>21</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0065">Preferably, pattern <b>22</b> made in bottom layer <b>7</b> is of similar shape to and approximately plumb with pattern <b>6</b> made in top layer <b>5</b>. In the first variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, patterns <b>22</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>24</b> respectively form the low, intermediate and high parts of elevation means <b>4</b> of elevation device <b>2</b> of hairspring <b>21</b>. In the second variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, patterns <b>22</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>24</b> respectively form the low, intermediate and high parts of elevation means <b>4</b>&#x2032; of elevation device <b>2</b>&#x2032; of hairspring <b>21</b>&#x2032;. Of course, the pattern of bridge of material <b>16</b> can be extended into bottom layer <b>7</b> during step <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0066">Moreover, preferably for the first variant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, pattern <b>15</b> is made to satisfy the criteria of a Phillips hairspring. Thus, advantageously, as patterns <b>22</b> and <b>15</b> are etched at the same time, they therefore form a one-piece part in bottom layer <b>7</b>. In the first variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, patterns <b>22</b> and <b>15</b> respectively form the low part of elevation means <b>4</b> and the terminal curve <b>23</b> of elevation device <b>2</b> of hairspring <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0067">Finally, preferably for the second variant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, pattern <b>15</b> is made in a similar manner to pattern <b>19</b> made during step <b>103</b>. Thus, advantageously, as patterns <b>13</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>15</b> are etched at the same time, they therefore form a one-piece part in bottom layer <b>7</b>. In the second variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, patterns <b>22</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>13</b> respectively form the low part of elevations means <b>4</b>&#x2032; and the second balance spring <b>23</b>&#x2032; of elevation device <b>2</b>&#x2032;, and the second collet <b>27</b>&#x2033; of double balance spring <b>21</b>&#x2032; in series. Advantageously, according to method <b>1</b>, the etch in bottom layer <b>7</b> allows complete freedom as regards the geometry of pattern <b>15</b>. Thus, pattern <b>15</b> may, for example, have more coils or an inner coil that includes a Grossmann curve for improving its concentric development, as explained in EP Patent No 1 612 627, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0068">After final step <b>106</b>, explained above, first embodiment A thus produces a one-piece hairspring <b>21</b> or <b>21</b>&#x2032; with a raised terminal curve, formed entirely of silicon-based materials, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> or <b>12</b>. It is thus clear that there are no longer any problems as regards forming the parts, since they are directly formed on fixed elements during manufacture of hairspring <b>21</b> or <b>21</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0069">In the first variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, hairspring <b>21</b> includes a balance spring <b>25</b>, coaxially connected to a collet <b>27</b>, whose outer coil has an elevation device <b>2</b>, mainly comprising a rectangular plate etched in three layers <b>11</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b> which act as elevation means <b>4</b> and a terminal curve <b>23</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the hairspring <b>21</b> with a raised terminal curve that is obtained therefore has a Breguet&#xae; configuration. Advantageously according to the invention, it will be noted that collet <b>27</b> is also etched in three layers <b>11</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, which improves the guiding of hairspring <b>21</b>. Moreover, inner coil <b>26</b> of balance spring <b>25</b> has a Grossmann curve to improve its concentric development.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0070">Further, the etches performed in steps <b>103</b> and <b>105</b> of method <b>1</b> leave complete freedom as to the geometry of terminal curve <b>23</b>, balance springs <b>25</b>, elevation means <b>4</b> and collet <b>27</b>. Thus, in particular, the continuity between balance spring <b>25</b>, elevation means <b>4</b> and terminal curve <b>23</b> may have a different geometry.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0071">In accordance with the same reasoning, collet <b>27</b> can have uniformly peculiar or different dimensions and/or geometries at least over one of bottom, median and/or top parts <b>13</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>17</b>. Indeed, depending upon the arbour on which collet <b>27</b> will be mounted, the inner diameter can have a complementary shape over all or part of the height of collet <b>27</b>. Likewise, the inner and/or outer diameters are not necessarily circular but may be, for example, elliptical and/or polygonal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0072">It should also be noted that the very high level of structural precision of deep reactive ionic etching decreases the start radius of balance spring <b>25</b>, i.e. the outer diameter of collet <b>27</b>, which means that the inner and outer diameters of collet <b>27</b> can be miniaturised. It is thus clear that hairspring <b>21</b> is able to receive, through cavities <b>18</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, advantageously an arbour of smaller diameter than that which is currently usually manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0073">Preferably, said arbour can be secured to the internal diameter <b>18</b> and/or <b>10</b> and/or <b>12</b> of one of collets <b>27</b>. The lighting of collet can for example be made by resilient means etched in collet <b>27</b> made in a silicon based material. The arbour can be tightened using resilient means etched in silicon collet <b>27</b>&#x2032; or <b>27</b>&#x2033;. Such resilient means may, for example, take the form of those disclosed in FIGS. 10A to 10E of EP Patent No. 1 655 642 or those disclosed in FIGS. 1, 3 and 5 of EP Patent No. 1 584 994, said Patents being incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0074">In the second variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, hairspring <b>21</b>&#x2032; has a first balance spring <b>25</b>&#x2032; coaxially connected to a collet <b>27</b>&#x2032; and whose outer coil includes an elevation device <b>2</b>&#x2032; mainly comprising a rectangular plate etched in three layers <b>11</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b> acting as elevation means <b>4</b>&#x2032;, a second balance spring <b>23</b>&#x2032;, and a second collet <b>27</b>&#x2033;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the hairspring <b>21</b>&#x2032; thereby obtained has a double, series hairspring configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0075">Further, the etches performed in steps <b>103</b> and <b>105</b> of method <b>1</b> leave complete freedom as to the geometry of balance springs <b>25</b>&#x2032; and <b>23</b>&#x2032;, elevation means <b>4</b>&#x2032; and collets <b>27</b>&#x2032; and <b>27</b>&#x2033;. Thus, in particular, the continuity between balance springs <b>25</b>&#x2032;, <b>23</b>&#x2032; and elevation means <b>4</b>&#x2032; may have a different geometry. It is also possible to envisage, as in the preceding variant, that the inner coils of each of balance springs <b>25</b>&#x2032; and <b>23</b>&#x2032; could have a Grossmann curve to improve the concentric development of each coil.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0076">In accordance with the same reasoning, collets <b>27</b>&#x2032; and <b>27</b>&#x2033; can also have peculiar or different dimensions and/or geometries. Indeed, depending on which collet <b>27</b>&#x2032;, <b>27</b>&#x2033; the arbour will be mounted with, the inner diameter of said collet can then have a complementary shape. Likewise, the inner and/or outer diameters of each collet <b>27</b>&#x2032;, <b>27</b>&#x2033; are not necessarily circular but may be, for example, elliptical and/or polygonal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0077">It should also be noted that the very high level of structural precision of deep reactive ionic etching decreases the start radius of each of balance springs <b>25</b>&#x2032; and <b>23</b>&#x2032;, i.e. the outer diameter of collets <b>27</b>&#x2032; and <b>27</b>&#x2033;, which means that the inner and outer diameters of collets <b>27</b>&#x2032; and <b>27</b>&#x2033; can be miniaturised. It is thus clear that hairspring <b>21</b>&#x2032; is capable of receiving, through cavities <b>18</b> or <b>12</b>, advantageously an arbour of smaller diameter than that which is currently usually manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0078">Preferably, said arbour can be secured to the internal diameter <b>18</b> and/or <b>12</b> of one of collets <b>27</b>&#x2032;, <b>27</b>&#x2033;. The other collet can then be mounted either on the sprung balance bar or on the balance. The arbour can be tightened using resilient means etched in silicon collet <b>27</b>&#x2032; or <b>27</b>&#x2033;. Such resilient means may, for example, take the form of those disclosed in FIGS. 10A to 10E of EP Patent No. 1 655 642 or those disclosed in FIGS. 1, 3 and 5 of EP Patent No. 1 584 994, said Patents being incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0079">According to a second embodiment B, after step <b>103</b> or <b>104</b>, method <b>1</b> includes a sixth step <b>107</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, consisting in implementing a LIGA process (from the German &#x201c;r&#xf6;ntgenLlthographie, Galvanoformung &#x26; Abformung&#x201d;). This process includes a series of steps for electroplating a metal on the bottom layer <b>7</b> of substrate <b>3</b> in a particular shape, using a photostructured resin. As this LIGA process is well known, it will not be described in more detail here. Preferably, the metal deposited may be, for example, gold or nickel or an alloy of these metals.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0080">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, step <b>107</b> may consist in depositing a cylinder <b>29</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the cylinder <b>29</b> is for receiving an arbour, which is advantageously driven therein. Indeed, one drawback of silicon is that it has very few elastic and plastic zones, making it very brittle. The invention thus proposes to tighten an arbour, for example a balance staff, not against the silicon of collet <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032; or <b>27</b>&#x2033;, but on the inner diameter <b>28</b> of metal cylinder <b>29</b>, which is electroplated during step <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0081">Advantageously, according to method <b>1</b>, the cylinder <b>29</b> obtained by electroplating allows complete freedom as regards its geometry. Thus, in particular, the inner diameter <b>28</b> is not necessarily circular, but for example polygonal, which could improve the transmission of stress in rotation with an arbour of matching shape.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0082">In a seventh step <b>108</b>, similar to step <b>105</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, cavities are selectively etched, for example by a DRIE method, in bottom layer <b>7</b> of silicon-based material. These cavities allow patterns to be formed similar to patterns <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>22</b> of the first embodiment A according to one of the two variants.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0083">After final step <b>106</b>, explained above, the second embodiment B thus produces a one-piece, hairspring with a raised terminal curve, formed of silicon-based materials with the same advantages as embodiment A, with the addition of a metal part <b>29</b>. It is thus clear that there is no longer any problem as regards forming parts, since they are formed directly on fixed elements during manufacture of the hairspring <b>21</b> or <b>21</b>&#x2032;. Finally, advantageously, an arbour can be driven against the inner diameter <b>28</b> of metal part <b>29</b>. One could therefore preferably envisage cavities <b>12</b> and/or <b>10</b> and/or <b>18</b> according to the variant including sections of larger dimensions than that of inner diameter <b>28</b> of metal part <b>29</b>, so as to prevent the arbour being in push fit contact with collet <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032; or <b>27</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0084">According to a third embodiment C, after step <b>103</b> or <b>104</b>, method <b>1</b> includes a sixth step <b>109</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, consisting in selectively etching a cavity <b>30</b>, for example, by a DRIE process, to a limited depth in bottom layer <b>7</b> of silicon-based material. Cavity <b>30</b> forms a recess to be used as a container for a metal part. As in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the cavity <b>30</b> obtained can take the form of a disc. However, advantageously according to method <b>1</b>, the etch of bottom layer <b>7</b> allows complete freedom as regards the geometry of cavity <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0085">In a seventh step <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, method <b>1</b> includes implementation of a galvanic growth or LIGA process for filling cavity <b>30</b> in accordance with a particular metal shape. Preferably, the deposited metal may be, for example, gold or nickel or an alloy of these metals.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0086">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, step <b>110</b> may consist in depositing a cylinder <b>31</b> in cavity <b>30</b>. Cylinder <b>31</b> is for receiving an arbour, which is advantageously driven therein. Indeed, as explained above, one advantageous feature of the invention consists in tightening the arbour, for example the balance staff, not against the silicon-based material of collet <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032; or <b>27</b>&#x2033; but on the inner diameter <b>32</b> of metal cylinder <b>31</b>, which is electroplated during step <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0087">Advantageously according to method <b>1</b>, cylinder <b>31</b> obtained by electroplating allows complete freedom as regards its geometry. Thus, in particular, the inner diameter <b>32</b> is not necessarily circular but, for example, polygonal, which could improve the transmission of stress in rotation with an arbour of matching shape.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0088">Preferably, method <b>1</b> includes an eighth step <b>111</b>, consisting in polishing the metal deposition <b>31</b> made during step <b>110</b>, in order to make said deposition flat.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0089">In a ninth step <b>112</b>, similar to step <b>105</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, cavities are selectively etched, for example, by a DRIE process, in bottom layer <b>7</b> of silicon-based material. These cavities form patterns similar to patterns <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>22</b> of the first embodiment A according to one of the two variants.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0090">After final step <b>106</b> explained above, third embodiment C produces a one-piece, hairspring formed of silicon-based materials with the same advantages as embodiment A, with the addition of a metal part <b>31</b>. It is thus clear that there are no longer any manufacturing problems, since the parts are directly formed on fixed elements during manufacture of hairspring <b>21</b> or <b>21</b>&#x2032;. Finally, advantageously, an arbour can be driven against inner diameter <b>32</b> of the metal part. One could therefore preferably envisage cavities <b>12</b> and/or <b>10</b> and/or <b>18</b> according to the variant having sections of larger dimensions than that of the inner diameter <b>32</b> of metal part <b>31</b>, to prevent the arbour being in push fit contact with collet <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032;, <b>27</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0091">According to the three embodiments A, B and C, it should be understood that the final hairspring <b>21</b> or <b>21</b>&#x2032; is thus assembled prior to being structured, i.e. prior to being etched and/or altered by electroplating. This advantageously minimises the dispersions generated by current manufacturing methods and, consequently, improves the precision of a regulator member on which it will depend.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0092">Advantageously, according to the invention, it is also clear that it is possible for several hairsprings <b>21</b> or <b>21</b>&#x2032; with a raised terminal curve to be made on the same substrate <b>3</b>, which allows batch production.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0093">Moreover, it is possible to make a driving insert of the same type as metal depositions <b>29</b> and/or <b>31</b> also, or solely from additional layer <b>11</b> and/or top layer <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0094">Method <b>1</b> may include after step <b>105</b>, <b>108</b> or <b>112</b>, a step of the same type as step <b>104</b> which would consist in oxidising pattern <b>15</b>, i.e. terminal curve <b>23</b> or balance spring <b>23</b>&#x2032; of hairspring <b>21</b> or <b>21</b>&#x2032; so as to make it more mechanically resistant and to adjust its thermo-elastic coefficient. A polishing step of the type of step <b>111</b> may also be performed between step <b>107</b> and step <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0095">Advantageously according to the invention, whichever embodiment A, B or C is used, method <b>1</b> allows step <b>103</b>, which consists in etching balance spring <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>&#x2032; and collet <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032; in additional layer <b>11</b> to be reversed with step <b>105</b>, <b>108</b> or <b>112</b>, which consists in etching terminal curve <b>23</b> or balance spring <b>23</b>&#x2032; and collet <b>27</b>&#x2033; in bottom layer <b>7</b>. This means that terminal curve <b>23</b> or balance spring <b>23</b>&#x2032; and collet <b>27</b>&#x2033; can be etched first on additional layer <b>11</b>, then balance spring <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>&#x2032; and collet <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032; can be etched in bottom layer <b>7</b>. In such case, terminal curve <b>23</b> could be oxidised, in step <b>104</b>, for example, before balance spring <b>25</b> is oxidised.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0096">A conductive layer could also be deposited over at least a part of hairspring <b>21</b> or <b>21</b>&#x2032; so as to prevent isochronism problems. This layer may be of the type disclosed in EP Patent No. 1 837 722, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0097">The height of collet <b>27</b> may be more limited than in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> of the first variant illustrated, i.e. for example, it may be limited to layers <b>5</b> and <b>11</b>. The elevation means <b>4</b> could also take a different form from a curved rectangular plate.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0098">Finally, at least a second bridge of material could be provided, so as to hold hairspring <b>21</b> to substrate <b>3</b> during manufacture, which could be performed between the outer curve of pattern <b>19</b> and the rest of the non-etched layer <b>11</b>.</p>
