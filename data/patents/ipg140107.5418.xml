<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an audio processing technology field, and in particular to a multi-channel signal encoding method, decoding method, encoding apparatus, decoding apparatus, and encoding and decoding system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the people's living standards are increasingly improved, high-quality speakers are gradually spreading among ordinary families. A multi-channel speaker produces high-quality acoustic effects. The channel level difference (channel level difference, CLD) is an important parameter that reflects the sound field of multi-channel signals. This parameter indicates the energy relationship between two signals in a multi-channel signal within each frequency band. It is widely used in existing multi-channel encoding algorithms, such as strength multi-channel signal, parameter multi-channel signal, and Panning algorithms. The channel level difference uses a scalar quantizer for quantization processing. This scalar quantizer is a 31-dimensional vector codebook CLD<sub>s</sub>. This vector codebook CLD<sub>s</sub>=[&#x2212;50, &#x2212;45, &#x2212;40, &#x2212;35, &#x2212;30, &#x2212;25, &#x2212;22, &#x2212;19, &#x2212;16, &#x2212;13, &#x2212;10, &#x2212;8, &#x2212;6, &#x2212;4, &#x2212;2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]. The dimension of the codebook is five bits. Quantization processing is performed for the channel level difference according to the vector codebook CLD<sub>s</sub>. Each element in the vector codebook CLD<sub>s </sub>indicates the quantization level for CLD.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During the implementation of the present invention, the inventor discovers the following disadvantages in the prior art:</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The prior art uses a same method for quantization processing of channel level differences of all types, but does not quantizes the channel level differences according to the characteristics of the channel level differences, leading to poor flexibility in quantizing channel level differences of a multi-channel signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Step <b>102</b>: Determine a sum of channel level differences (CLDs) of a current frame of a multi-channel signal in a certain frequency band area.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this embodiment, the certain frequency band area may be an entire frequency band, or a preset partial frequency band area. For example, an entire frequency band is divided into two frequency bands: a high frequency band and a low frequency band. The sum of CLDs of the current frame of the multi-channel signal in the high frequency band area is calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Step <b>104</b>: Determine an average value of sums of channel level differences (CLDs) of at least two frames before the current frame in the certain frequency band area.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">This step may be as follows: calculating an average value of CLDs of N frames that include the current frame and N&#x2212;1 frames before the current frame according to the sum of CLDs of the current frame in the certain frequency band area and the sum of CLDs of the N&#x2212;1 frames before the current frame in the certain frequency band area.

This step may be as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">obtaining an absolute value of a difference between the sum of CLDs of the current frame and the average value of the CLDs of the at least two frames before the current frame;</p>
