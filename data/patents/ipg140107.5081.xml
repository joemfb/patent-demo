<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A particular method includes receiving multiple requests to access a signal processing resource of a device that supports multiple subscriptions during a first time period. During the first time period, a first subscription is granted access to the signal processing resource, and a second subscription is denied access to the signal processing resource. A remedial action policy and historical information related to subscription access to the signal processing resource may be used to determine whether to grant access to the signal processing resource to the second subscription during a second time period. When access to the signal processing resource is granted to the second subscription during the second time period, hysteresis may be used to determine whether to grant access to the first subscription during a third time period after the second time period in order to preserve paging performance of the first subscription.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure is generally related to devices that support multiple subscriptions that share signal processing resources.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">III. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Advances in technology have resulted in smaller and more powerful computing devices. For example, there currently exist a variety of portable personal computing devices, including wireless computing devices, such as portable wireless telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and paging devices that are small, lightweight, and easily carried by users. More specifically, portable wireless telephones, such as cellular telephones and internet protocol (IP) telephones, can communicate voice and data packets over wireless networks. Further, many such wireless telephones include other types of devices that are incorporated therein. For example, a wireless telephone can also include a digital still camera, a digital video camera, a digital recorder, and an audio file player. Also, such wireless telephones can process executable instructions, including software applications, such as a web browser application that can be used to access the Internet. As such, these wireless telephones can include significant computing capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A mobile communication device (e.g., a wireless telephone) may enable a user to utilize multiple subscriptions (that may be associated with the same or different networks). To illustrate, a first subscriber identity module (SIM) of a dual-SIM dual-standby (DSDS) device may be associated with a first subscription and a second SIM may be associated with a second subscription. In a DSDS device with a single receive-transmit (Rx-Tx) chain, there may be contention between subscriptions in accessing one or more shared radio frequency (RF) resources of the single Rx-Tx chain. For example, when there is a contention for access to a shared RF resource (e.g., a paging collision), a first subscription may be granted access to the shared RF resource (i.e., &#x201c;win&#x201d;) over a second subscription. As a result, the second subscription may &#x201c;lose&#x201d; and get &#x201c;whatever's left,&#x201d; potentially resulting in degradation of performance of the second subscription. While DSDS devices may support dual-subscription concurrency by using two separate dedicated Rx-Tx chains for the two subscriptions, this may lead to a higher bill of materials (BOM) and a larger printed circuit board (PCB) area.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">IV. SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Performance of one subscription (e.g., a secondary subscription) of a device that supports multiple subscriptions may be degraded compared to another subscription (e.g., a primary subscription) as a result of contention for one or more shared signal processing resources (e.g., RF resources). Application of a remedial action policy and use of historical information related to subscription access to a signal processing resource may improve the performance of the secondary subscription. That is, one or more remedial actions may be taken in order to improve a user experience and call performance associated with the primary and secondary subscriptions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular embodiment, a method includes receiving a first set of requests to access a signal processing resource (e.g., a radio frequency (RF) resource) of a device (that supports multiple subscriptions) during a first time period. Each subscription may be associated with its own user identity module, or each subscription may be associated with a common user identity module. For example, the device may include a first subscriber identity module (SIM) associated with a first subscription and a second SIM associated with a second subscription. At least one of the requests received during the first time period is related to the first subscription, and at least one of the requests is related to the second subscription. During the first time period, the first subscription is granted access to the signal processing resource and the second subscription is denied access to the signal processing resource. A second set of requests to access the signal processing resource are received during a second time period. At least one of the requests received during the second time period is related to the first subscription, and at least one of the requests is related to the second subscription. The method includes determining whether to grant access to the signal processing resource to the second subscription during the second time period and to deny access to the signal processing resource to the first subscription during the second time period. The determination may be based on a remedial action policy and evaluation of historical information related to subscription access to the signal processing resource. When access to the signal processing resource is granted to the second subscription during the second time period, hysteresis may be used to determine whether to grant access to the signal processing resource to the first subscription during a third time period after the second time period in order to preserve paging performance of the first subscription.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another particular embodiment, an apparatus includes a signal processing resource, a first SIM interface, a second SIM interface, and a controller. The first SIM interface, the second SIM interface, and the controller are communicatively coupled to the signal processing resource. The first SIM interface is configured to receive a first SIM associated with a first subscription, and the second SIM interface is configured to receive a second SIM associated with a second subscription. During a first time period, a first set of requests to access the signal processing resource may be received. At least one of the requests received during the first time period is related to the first subscription, and at least one of the requests is related to the second subscription. The controller is configured to grant access to the signal processing resource to the first subscription during the first time period and to deny access to the signal processing resource to the second subscription during the first time period. During a second time period, a second set of requests to access the signal processing resource may be received. At least one of the requests received during the second time period is related to the first subscription, and at least one of the requests is related to the second subscription. The controller is configured to determine, based on a remedial action policy and based on historical information related to subscription access to the signal processing resource, whether to grant access to the signal processing resource to the second subscription during the second time period. When access to the signal processing resource is granted to the second subscription during the second time period, hysteresis may be used to determine whether to grant access to the signal processing resource to the first subscription during a third time period after the second time period in order to preserve paging performance of the first subscription.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another particular embodiment, an apparatus includes means for receiving a first SIM that is associated with a first subscription and means for receiving a second SIM that is associated with a second subscription. The apparatus further includes means for receiving a first set of requests to access a signal processing resource during a first time period. At least one of the requests is related to the first subscription and at least one of the requests is related to the second subscription. The apparatus includes means for granting access to the signal processing resource to the first subscription and denying access to the second subscription during the first time period. The apparatus includes means for receiving a second set of requests to access the signal processing resource during a second time period, where at least one request is related to the first subscription and at least one request is related to the second subscription. The apparatus further includes means for determining whether to grant access to the signal processing resource to the second subscription (and to deny access to the signal processing resource to the first subscription) during the second time period. The determination may be based on a remedial action policy and based on historical information related to subscription access to the signal processing resource. When access to the signal processing resource is granted to the second subscription during the second time period, hysteresis may be used to determine whether to grant access to the signal processing resource to the first subscription during a third time period after the second time period in order to preserve paging performance of the first subscription.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One particular advantage provided by at least one of the disclosed embodiments is that performance of a dual-subscription device (e.g., a dual-SIM dual-standby device) with a single Rx-Tx chain may be improved. For example, one or more remedial actions may be taken to improve the performance of a subscription that may be degraded as a result of contention for one or more shared signal processing resources. Hysteresis may be used to preserve paging performance of a particular subscription (e.g., a higher priority subscription).</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">VI. DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present disclosure relates to resolution of contention for one or more signal processing resources (e.g., RF resources) in devices that support multiple subscriptions (e.g., multi-subscription devices). As an example, a device that supports two subscriptions (e.g., a DSDS device) may share one receive-transmit (Rx-Tx) chain. Each subscription may request RF resources for a set of reasons, and each reason may be associated with a numeric priority and a duration. A &#x201c;collision&#x201d; may occur when there is an overlap in the durations requested by the two subscriptions. Such collisions may be transient or persistent in nature. By arbitrating access to the RF resources, performance may be improved in order to provide a user experience that is closer to a device that supports a single subscription. Further, by arbitrating access to the RF resources, performance of a secondary subscription may be improved. Hysteresis may be used so that paging performance of the primary subscription is not degraded below an acceptable level as a result of the secondary subscription being granted access to the RF resources instead of the primary subscription.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a particular embodiment of a system of arbitrating access to at least one shared signal processing resource of a dual-subscription device is illustrated and is generally designated <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> includes a device <b>102</b> that supports multiple subscriptions (e.g., a mobile telephone or other communication device). For example, each subscription may be associated with its own user identity module (UIM), such as a subscriber identity module (SIM), a code division multiple access (CDMA) removable UIM (R-UIM), or other type of R-UIM. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the device <b>102</b> is capable of receiving multiple SIMs. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the device <b>102</b> is a dual-SIM device with a single receive-transmit (Rx-Tx) chain <b>104</b> that includes at least one signal processing (e.g., RF) resource <b>106</b>. The device <b>102</b> includes a first SIM interface <b>108</b> to receive a first SIM <b>110</b> that is associated with a first subscription (e.g., a subscription associated with a first network <b>112</b>) and a second SIM interface <b>114</b> to receive a second SIM <b>116</b> that is associated with a second subscription (e.g., a subscription associated with a second network <b>118</b>). Alternatively, the two subscriptions may be associated with the same network. For example, the SIMs <b>110</b>, <b>116</b> may be plugged into or otherwise connected to the respective SIM interfaces <b>108</b>, <b>114</b>. The first SIM interface <b>108</b>, the second SIM interface <b>114</b>, and a controller <b>120</b> may be communicatively coupled to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> (e.g., via electrical connections between the SIM interfaces <b>108</b>, <b>114</b>, the controller <b>120</b>, and the signal processing resource <b>106</b>). To illustrate, a first electrical connection between the first SIM interface <b>108</b> and the signal processing resource <b>106</b> may provide a communication path between the first SIM <b>110</b> and the signal processing resource <b>106</b> when the first SIM <b>110</b> is connected to the first SIM interface <b>108</b>. As another example, a second electrical connection between the second SIM interface <b>114</b> and the signal processing resource <b>106</b> may provide a communication path between the second SIM <b>116</b> and the signal processing resource <b>106</b> when the second SIM <b>116</b> is connected to the second SIM interface <b>114</b>. Thus, both SIMs <b>110</b>, <b>116</b> may be concurrently connected to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> (e.g., via the SIM interfaces <b>108</b>, <b>114</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The controller <b>120</b> is configured to receive a first set of requests to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> during a first time period. At least one of the first set of requests is related to the first subscription (e.g., associated with the first SIM <b>110</b>), and at least one of the first set of requests is related to the second subscription (e.g., associated with the second SIM <b>116</b>). During the first time period, the controller <b>120</b> is configured to grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription and to deny access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the second subscription. For example, the first subscription may be a higher priority subscription than the second subscription. As such, access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> may be granted to the higher priority subscription and may be denied to a lower priority subscription.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The controller <b>120</b> is configured to receive a second set of requests to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> during a second time period. At least one of the second set of requests is related to the first subscription and at least one of the second set of requests is related to the second subscription. The controller <b>120</b> is configured to determine, based on a remedial action policy <b>126</b> and based on historical information <b>128</b> related to subscription access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b>, whether to grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first or second subscription during the second time period. The controller <b>120</b> may be configured to grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the second subscription (and to deny access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription) based on the determination. In this case, the second subscription &#x201c;wins&#x201d; the contention for access to the shared signal processing resource <b>106</b>, and the first subscription &#x201c;loses&#x201d; the contention for access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b>. In a particular embodiment, the controller <b>120</b> may be further configured to use hysteresis to determine whether to grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription (e.g., a higher priority primary subscription) during a third time period that is after the second time period in order to preserve paging performance of the first subscription.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When requested access periods overlap, a collision takes place. Such collisions may be transient or persistent in nature. As an illustrative example (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the first subscription may request access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> at time t<b>1</b> for duration <b>1</b>, and the second subscription may request access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> at time t<b>2</b> for duration <b>2</b>. As another illustrative example (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the first subscription may request access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> at time t<b>4</b> for duration <b>4</b>, and the second subscription may request access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> at time t<b>3</b> for duration <b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in each case, the time periods overlap, resulting in contention for the signal processing resource <b>106</b> (e.g., collisions).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">During operation of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the controller <b>120</b> may receive a first set of requests to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> during a first time period. To illustrate, the controller <b>120</b> may receive a request from the first subscription to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> (e.g., an RF resource) at a first time and for a first duration in order to receive an incoming page (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) from the first network <b>112</b>. The controller <b>120</b> may receive another request from the second subscription to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> at a second time and for a second duration in order to receive an incoming page (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) from the second network <b>118</b>. The first time and the second time may be the same or different. Further, the first duration and the second duration may be the same or different. In one embodiment, the first subscription and the second subscription operate under a common slot cycle index (SCI) and hash to a common paging slot. In this case, the contention for access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> may be considered &#x201c;persistent&#x201d; in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When the requested access periods overlap, the controller <b>120</b> may grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription during the first time period such that the incoming page associated with the first subscription may be received from the first network <b>112</b>. The controller <b>120</b> may deny access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the second subscription, such that the incoming page associated with the second subscription may be &#x201c;missed&#x201d; (i.e., not received from the second network <b>118</b>). For example, the first subscription may be considered a higher priority subscription than the second subscription. As such, the controller <b>120</b> may grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription over the second subscription.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The controller <b>120</b> may receive a second set of requests to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> during a second time period. To illustrate, the controller <b>120</b> may receive a request from the first subscription to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> at a third time and for a third duration in order to receive an incoming page <b>122</b> from the first network <b>112</b>. The controller <b>120</b> may receive another request from the second subscription to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> at a fourth time and for a fourth duration in order to receive an incoming page <b>124</b> from the second network <b>118</b>. The third time and the fourth time may be the same or different, and the third duration and the fourth duration may be the same or different.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When the requested access periods overlap, the controller <b>120</b> may determine, based on a remedial action policy <b>126</b> and based on historical information <b>128</b>, whether to grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first or second subscription during the second time period. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the historical information <b>128</b> may include at least first subscription access denial information <b>130</b> and second subscription access denial information <b>132</b>. For example, the first subscription access denial information <b>130</b> may include at least information associated with the controller <b>120</b> granting access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription during the first time period. As another example, the second subscription access denial information <b>132</b> may include at least information associated with the controller <b>120</b> denying access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the second subscription during the first time period.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the controller <b>120</b> grants access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the second subscription during the second time period, the controller <b>120</b> may deny access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription during the second time period. As a result, the incoming page <b>122</b> associated with the first subscription may be &#x201c;missed&#x201d; (i.e., not received from the first network <b>112</b>). When the controller <b>120</b> grants access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription during the second time period, the controller <b>120</b> may deny access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the second subscription during the second time period. As a result, the incoming page <b>124</b> associated with the second subscription may be &#x201c;missed&#x201d; (i.e., not received from the second network <b>118</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a particular embodiment, the remedial action policy <b>126</b> may define a threshold number of access denials <b>134</b> before the second subscription is granted access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> during the second time period. In this case, the controller <b>120</b> may grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the second subscription during the second time period when a number of times that the second subscription has been denied access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> satisfies the threshold number of access denials <b>134</b>. The number of times that the second subscription has been denied access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> may be determined based on the second subscription access denial information <b>132</b>. For example, the second subscription access denial information <b>132</b> may include a count of an absolute number of access denials or a count of a number of consecutive access denials. In the case of a number of consecutive access denials, the count may be reset when the second subscription is granted access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> (e.g., during the second time period or during a subsequent time period).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The remedial action policy <b>126</b> may indicate that remedial actions may not be invoked for certain reasons or requests (e.g., a request to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to obtain a football game score may be denied). For example, if collisions are transient in nature and there are multiple re-transmissions for non-emergency broadcast messages, the remedial action policy <b>126</b> may specify that remedial actions are not to be invoked when a subscription requested RF resources for demodulating or monitoring non-emergency broadcast messages and &#x201c;lost&#x201d; the contention (e.g., when the subscription was denied access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a particular embodiment, a numeric priority may be associated with various requests (or reasons associated with a request). When a numeric priority associated with a particular request (or reason for the particular request) that lost the contention is below a threshold, the remedial action policy <b>126</b> may specify that remedial actions are not to be invoked. To illustrate, a numeric priority associated with a request to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> for a football game score may be low (e.g., a numeric priority of 10) while a numeric priority associated with a request to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to monitor for an incoming voice call may be high (e.g., a numeric priority of 200). The remedial action policy <b>126</b> may specify that remedial actions are not to be invoked when the numeric priority is less than a threshold value such as 100. In this case, remedial actions may not be invoked when a request to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> for a football game score (e.g., a request with a numeric priority less than 100) lost a contention. By contrast, remedial actions may be invoked when a request to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to monitor for an incoming voice call (e.g., a request with a numeric priority greater than 100) lost a contention. As another example, the remedial action policy <b>126</b> may specify that remedial actions are not to be invoked when a difference in numeric priorities involved in the contention is above a threshold. The remedial action policy <b>126</b> may specify that remedial actions are not to be invoked when the difference in numeric priorities is greater than a threshold value such as 100. To illustrate, remedial actions may be invoked when a request to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to monitor for an incoming voice call lost a contention with a request to access the signal processing resource <b>106</b> for a football game score (e.g., a difference in numeric priorities of 190).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, adaptive, dynamic, context-sensitive remedial actions may be taken for a subscription that lost an initial contention. That is, future access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> may be granted to the subscription that lost one or more previous contentions. The access grants may occur at different points in time for different subscriptions. For page monitoring, remedial actions may take place at subsequent paging slots where repeat pages are expected. In a particular embodiment, the remedial action policy <b>126</b> may be determined at least in part based on a first page retransmission algorithm <b>136</b> associated with the first subscription and a second page retransmission algorithm <b>138</b> associated with the second subscription. The first page retransmission algorithm <b>136</b> may be determined by the first network <b>112</b>, and the second page retransmission algorithm <b>138</b> may be determined by the second network <b>118</b>. Thus, in this case, network specific information regarding the page retransmission algorithms <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> may be required in order to implement the remedial action policy <b>126</b>. Alternatively, access may be granted for the next N paging slots to the subscription that lost the initial contention in order to cover the time span of the page retransmissions. However, a large N may adversely affect the paging performance of the subscription that &#x201c;won&#x201d; the initial contention. In an alternative embodiment, the remedial action policy <b>126</b> may define a pseudo-random number sequence <b>140</b> that is used to determine whether to grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the subscription that lost the initial contention during the second time period. For non-emergency broadcast monitoring, remedial actions may occur at subsequent broadcast slots, not necessarily at the next immediate broadcast slot.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If the device <b>102</b> is in a weak coverage area, enhancements to one or more modem algorithms may be made be used to improve the performance of the subscription that lost the initial contention (e.g., the second subscription). For page monitoring, losing a contention for RF resources at one paging slot may result in a longer time that elapses between a last instance of page monitoring and a next instance of page monitoring. Possible enhancements to modem algorithms may include deeper searches, earlier wakeups and more recovery mechanisms during reacquisition in slotted mode, the enablement of receive diversity (RxD) capabilities of the modem, and other techniques to enhance demodulation performance of the modem.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a particular embodiment, when access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> is granted to the second subscription (e.g., a lower priority subscription) during the second time period, hysteresis may be used to determine whether to grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription (e.g., a higher priority primary subscription) during a third time period that is after the second time period in order to preserve paging performance of the first subscription. For example, the controller <b>120</b> may use the first subscription access denial information <b>130</b> to determine whether paging performance of the first subscription (e.g., the higher priority subscription) is unsatisfactory. When the paging performance is determined to be unsatisfactory, the controller <b>120</b> may grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription during the third time period.</p>

As another illustrative example, the third time period may include a predetermined period of time to grant access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> to the first subscription.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a ladder diagram illustrates a particular embodiment of a method of performing a remedial action in response to one subscription being denied access to a shared signal processing resource of a dual-subscription device and is generally designated <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A first subscription (e.g., associated with Stack 1) may request access to a signal processing resource (e.g., the signal processing resource <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The first subscription sends a request to a transceiver receiver manager (TRM) to request access at time t<b>1</b> for duration <b>1</b> in order to perform a reacquisition and page demodulation procedure. A priority of P2 may be assigned to the request from the first subscription. A second subscription (e.g., associated with Stack 2) may request access to the signal processing resource at time t<b>2</b> for duration <b>2</b> in order to perform a reacquisition and page demodulation procedure. A lower priority of P3 may be assigned to the request from the second subscription. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is an overlap in the first duration and the second duration, resulting in a contention for the signal processing resource. Based on a priority comparison, the request from the first subscription wins the contention (i.e., the access request is granted), and the request from the second subscription loses the contention (i.e., the access request is denied). As such, the second subscription is unable to perform the reacquisition and page demodulation procedure at time t<b>2</b>, potentially resulting in a missed page.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A remedial action may be taken to improve the performance of the second subscription after the second subscription &#x201c;lost&#x201d; the initial contention for the signal processing resource. The second subscription may request access to the signal processing resource at time t<b>3</b> for duration <b>3</b> in order to perform a reacquisition and page demodulation procedure. The first subscription may request access to the signal processing resource at time t<b>4</b> for duration <b>4</b> in order to perform a reacquisition and page demodulation procedure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is an overlap in the third duration and the fourth duration, resulting in a contention for the signal processing resource. The remedial action may include raising a priority level associated with the access request from the second subscription to P1 (above the priority level of P2 associated with the first subscription). As a result, the request from the second subscription wins the contention, and the request from the first subscription loses the contention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If the first subscription is a primary subscription (i.e., a higher priority subscription), hysteresis may be used to preserve paging performance of the first subscription as a result of the denial of the request at time t<b>4</b>. For example, the signal processing resource may be granted to the paging slots of the first subscription where retransmissions after time t<b>4</b> are expected, and there may be no remedial actions for the second subscription if contentions occur at these potential repeat paging slots for the first subscription. As another example, the first subscription may win the next N contentions after time t<b>4</b>, and there may be no remedial actions for the second subscription for these N contentions. As a further example, the first subscription may win the contentions over a time window T after time t<b>4</b>, and there may be no remedial actions for the second subscription if contentions occur during the time window T.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates that the performance of a subscription that &#x201c;lost&#x201d; an initial contention for a signal processing resource may be improved by raising a priority level associated with a subsequent request for access to the signal processing resource such that the subsequent access request may be granted. Further, hysteresis may be used to preserve paging performance of one subscription (e.g., a higher priority primary subscription) after a remedial action is taken to improve the performance of another subscription (e.g., a lower priority secondary subscription).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a chart illustrates a particular embodiment of a method of arbitrating access to a shared signal processing resource of a dual-subscription device and is generally designated <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One example of persistent contentions/collisions is a code division multiple access (CDMA) plus CDMA (&#x201c;C+C&#x201d;) case, where two subscriptions operate under the same slot cycle index (SCI) and hash to the same paging slot. A predetermined pattern of resource sharing (e.g., sharing access to the signal processing resource <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be adopted based on an understanding of different retransmission algorithms of different network providers. The pattern of resource sharing may be based on the relative priority of the two subscriptions. Increasing the number of page retransmissions may mitigate the number of missed calls that result from persistent contentions/collisions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the two subscriptions have the same priority (i.e., a 1:1 resource allocation). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates that for a slot cycle index (SCI) of 2, telescoping page retransmissions (e.g., 2 repeat pages at approximately 5 seconds and 15 seconds after the first page) may result in an effective average number of pages per call of 1.5. As an alternative to the pre-determined pattern of 1:1 resource allocation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, pseudo-random (uncorrelated) number sequences may be used to determine a pattern of resource sharing when the two subscriptions have the same priority. As another alternative, using an N-level pseudo-random number sequence and comparing random variables with threshold derived from a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of random variable to arbitrate signal processing resources between the two subscriptions may enable articulation of different levels of relative priorities between the two subscriptions. For example, a uniform random number generator that produces an output including random integers from 1 to 10 with an equal probability of each number (i.e., a 1/10 probability for each number) may be used. Utilizing the uniform random number generator that produces random integers from 1 to 10, the threshold may be set to a predetermined value of 7 such that the first subscription &#x201c;wins&#x201d; if the random number produced from the uniform random number generator is less than or equal to 7 (i.e., &#x3c;=7) and the second subscription &#x201c;wins&#x201d; if the random number is greater than or equal to 8 (i.e., &#x3e;=8). Accordingly, in cases of persistent collisions at each paging slot, the output of the uniform random number generator is compared to the threshold and an average pattern of 7:3 resource sharing is achieved. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates that a predetermined pattern of resource sharing between two subscriptions that have the same priority may provide improved performance with respect to persistent contentions/collisions.</p>
