<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Users have access to a wide variety of content from a wide variety of sources. Network access, for instance, may be used to provide a variety of content to a user, such as streaming movies, video-on-demand, music, downloadable content for local storage, and so on. However, the user may interact with a device at a location that shares bandwidth of the network with other devices, such as at a residence (e.g., the user's home), a business, and so on. Therefore, consumption of content by the other devices at the location may affect the ability of the user's device to consume content.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Content stream management techniques are described. In an implementation, a communication is examined at a client device from at least one other client device that describes per stream usage of network bandwidth by the at least one other client device to receive content. Usage of the network bandwidth at the client device is managed based on the communication and a determination of per stream usage of the network bandwidth to receive content by the client device that also consumes at least a portion of the network bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an implementation, a client device includes one or more modules configured to determine per stream usage of content at the client device that consumes at least a portion of network bandwidth that is available at a location and form a communication to be communicated to at least one other client device that shares the network bandwidth that is available at the location with the client device. The communication describes per stream usage by the client device. Another communication is examined, from the at least one other client device, that describes per stream usage of the other client device that consumes at least a portion of the network bandwidth. Per stream usage by the client device is managed based at least in part on the determination of the per stream usage of content at the client device and the described per stream usage of the other client device described by the other communication.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an implementation, one or more computer-readable media comprise instructions that are stored thereon that, responsive to execution by a client device, cause the client device to perform operations comprising comparing per stream usage of content that consumes network bandwidth with per stream usage of a plurality of streams of content usage by another client device that shares bandwidth that is assigned to a location that includes the client device and the other client device, prioritizing the per stream usage of the client device and the other client device; and implementing the prioritized per stream usage at the client device.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Users may have access to a wide variety of content via a network connection. However, in some instances a client device that is used by the user to access the content may share network bandwidth with other client devices. For example, the client device may be located in a home of the user that includes a variety of other client devices that are configured to access content via a network connection. However, the amount of bandwidth that is made available to the location may be limited, such that the client devices share the network bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Although traditional techniques were developed to manage usage of the bandwidth, these techniques made a fundamental assumption that each device is configured to consume a single stream of content. Therefore, these traditional techniques failed when confronted with client devices that could consume multiple streams, such as digital video recorders having multiple tuners, client devices having multiple display devices, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Content stream management techniques are described. In an implementation, user activity is specified &#x201c;per stream&#x201d; of content to accurately reflect usage of network bandwidth. Further, communications that describe this usage are shared between devices that share the network bandwidth. Therefore, each of the client devices may make determinations on how to manage the network bandwidth through stream usage. For example, each of the client devices may employ techniques (e.g., algorithms) that assign priorities to the stream usage. Further, these algorithms may be configured to provide similar results such that each of the client devices makes a similar determination regarding how to manage the network bandwidth, which accordingly provides for decentralized management. Further discussion of the management techniques may be found in relation to the following sections.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the following discussion, an example environment is first described that is operable to perform techniques to manage streams of content. Example procedures are then described that may be employed in the example environment, as well as in other environments. Although these techniques are described as employed within a television environment in the following discussion, it should be readily apparent that these techniques may be incorporated within a variety of environments without departing from the spirit and scope thereof For example, these techniques may be employed to manage provision of a variety of resources, such as a number of tuners, frequencies (e.g., satellite frequencies), CPU cycles, and so on.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example Environment</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of an environment <b>100</b> in an example implementation that is operable to manage content streams. The illustrated environment <b>100</b> includes a distribution system <b>102</b> of a network operator which may employ one or more distribution servers, a client device <b>104</b> and a content provider <b>106</b> that are communicatively coupled, one to another, via network connections <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. In the following discussion, the distribution system <b>102</b>, the client device <b>104</b> and the content provider <b>106</b> may be representative of one or more entities, and therefore reference may be made to a single entity (e.g., the client device <b>104</b>) or multiple entities (e.g., the clients <b>104</b>, the plurality of clients <b>104</b>, and so on). Additionally, although a plurality of network connections <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are shown separately, the network connections <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may be representative of network connections achieved using a single network or multiple networks. For example, network connection <b>108</b> may be representative of a broadcast network with back channel communication, an Internet Protocol (IP) network, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The client device <b>104</b> may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, the client device <b>104</b> may be configured as a computer that is capable of communicating over the network connection <b>110</b>, such as a desktop computer (e.g., a media center computer), a mobile station, an entertainment appliance, a set-top box communicatively coupled to a display device as illustrated, a wireless phone, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The content provider <b>106</b> includes one or more items of content <b>112</b>. The content <b>112</b> may include a variety of data, such as television programming, video-on-demand (VOD) files, downloadable media, and so on. The content <b>112</b> is communicated over the network connection <b>108</b> to the distribution system <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Content <b>112</b> communicated via the network connection <b>108</b> is received by the distribution system <b>102</b> and may be stored as one or more items of content <b>114</b>. The content <b>114</b> may be the same as or different from the content <b>112</b> received from the content provider <b>106</b>. The content <b>114</b>, for instance, may include additional data for broadcast to the client device <b>104</b>, such as electronic program guide data, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The content <b>114</b> is also illustrated as including a plurality of streams that include a video stream <b>116</b> and an audio stream <b>118</b>. The video and audio streams <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> may be configured in a variety of ways, such as encapsulated in a transport stream that is communicated over the network connection <b>110</b> to the client device <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The client device <b>104</b>, as previously stated, may be configured in a variety of ways to receive the content <b>114</b> streamed over the network connection <b>110</b>. The client device <b>104</b> typically includes hardware and software to transport and decrypt the content <b>114</b> received from the distribution system <b>102</b> for rendering, e.g., by the illustrated display device and speakers.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The client device <b>104</b> in the example environment <b>100</b> includes digital video recorder (DVR) functionality. For instance, the client device <b>104</b> may include memory <b>120</b> to record content <b>114</b> as content <b>122</b> received via the network connection <b>110</b> for output to and rendering by the display device and speakers. The memory <b>120</b> may be configured in a variety of ways, such as a hard disk drive, a removable computer-readable medium (e.g., a writable digital video disc), semiconductor based memory, and so on. Thus, content <b>122</b> that is stored in the memory <b>120</b> of the client device <b>104</b> may be copies of the content <b>114</b> that was streamed from the distribution system <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The client device <b>104</b> as illustrated in this example also includes a communication module <b>124</b> that is executable on the client device <b>104</b> to control content playback on the client device <b>104</b>, such as through the use of one or more &#x201c;command modes&#x201d;, i.e., &#x201c;trick modes&#x201d;, to tune to a particular channel, order pay-per-view content, and so on. The command modes may provide non-linear playback of the content <b>122</b> (i.e., time shift the playback of the content <b>122</b>) such as pause, rewind, fast forward, slow motion playback, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The distribution system <b>102</b> is illustrated as including a content manager module <b>126</b>. The content manager module <b>126</b> is representative of functionality to configure content <b>114</b> for streaming over the network connection <b>110</b> to the client device <b>104</b>. The content manager module <b>126</b>, for instance, may configure content <b>112</b> received from the content provider <b>106</b> to be suitable for transmission over the network connection <b>108</b>, such as to &#x201c;packetize&#x201d; the content <b>114</b> into a plurality of streams that are encapsulated within a transport stream for distribution over the Internet, map the content <b>112</b> to particular channels, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, in the environment <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the content provider <b>106</b> may broadcast the content <b>112</b> over a network connection <b>108</b> to a multiplicity of network operators, an example of which is illustrated as distribution system <b>102</b>. The distribution system <b>102</b> may then stream the content <b>114</b> over a network connection <b>110</b> to a multitude of client devices, an example of which is illustrated as client device <b>104</b>. The client device <b>104</b> may then store the content <b>114</b> in the memory <b>120</b> as content <b>122</b> and/or render the content <b>114</b> immediately for output as it is received, such as when the client device <b>104</b> is configured to include digital video recorder (DVR) functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As previously described, traditional techniques made a fundamental assumption that there is a single active consumption of a stream of content per device. This made the client device unable to properly represent the priority of its currently consumed streams, e.g., if it supports multiple live viewing screens, using these traditional techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated environment <b>100</b>, however, the client device <b>104</b> includes a stream manager module <b>128</b> that is representative of functionality of the client device <b>104</b> to manage stream usage and accordingly network bandwidth that is shared by the client device <b>104</b> with other client devices. For example, the network connection <b>110</b> may provide a maximum amount of bandwidth for a fee to the location <b>130</b>, such as an office, residence, and so on. Accordingly, client devices at the location <b>130</b> share the available network bandwidth of the network connection <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To manage usage of the network bandwidth of the network connection <b>110</b>, the stream manager module <b>128</b> may be configured to communicate per stream usage by the client device <b>104</b> to other client devices. Additionally, the stream manager module <b>128</b> may receive communications from the other client devices that describe respective per stream usage. These communications may then serve as a basis to prioritize which streams are permitted to consume the network bandwidth, further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following figure. For example, the priorities may be based on a type of consumption (e.g., recording versus live), a priority assigned to a client device itself (e.g., a television in a family room may be given priority over a television in a bedroom), and so on. Although the stream manager module <b>128</b> is illustrated as included on the client device <b>104</b>, functionality of the stream manager module may be spread distributed devices at the location <b>130</b> and even over the network connection, an example of which is illustrated by the stream manager module <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It should be noted that one or more of the entities shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be further divided (e.g., the distribution system <b>102</b> may be implemented by a plurality of servers in a distributed computing system), combined, and so on and thus the environment <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrative of one of a plurality of different environments that may employ the described techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software, firmware, hardware (e.g., fixed-logic circuitry), manual processing, or a combination of these implementations. The terms &#x201c;module&#x201d;, &#x201c;functionality&#x201d;, &#x201c;engine&#x201d; and &#x201c;logic&#x201d; as used herein generally represent software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof In the case of a software implementation, for instance, the module, functionality, or logic represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed on a processor (e.g., CPU or CPUs). The program code can be stored in one or more computer-readable memory devices, e.g., the memory <b>120</b> of the client device <b>104</b>. The features of the techniques to manage streams are platform-independent, meaning that the techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of processors.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example system <b>200</b> showing the distribution system <b>102</b> and the location <b>130</b> that includes the client device <b>104</b> in greater detail. The location <b>130</b> is illustrated as including the client device <b>104</b> as well as a second client device <b>202</b> and a third client device <b>204</b>. The second and third client devices <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> are illustrated with respective stream manager modules <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For IP based client devices, the number of simultaneous streams of content that can be consumed may be limited based on the bandwidth available at the location <b>130</b> through the network connection <b>110</b>. Accordingly, in this example bandwidth management is shared across the client devices at the location <b>130</b> such that each device knows about the streams that other devices are consuming To accomplish this, the respective stream manager modules <b>128</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> may form communications to describe per stream usage by the respective client devices <b>104</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, the stream manager module <b>128</b> of client device <b>104</b> may form a communication that describes per stream usage at the client device <b>104</b>, such as a single stream is currently being used to display live television. Likewise, the stream manager module <b>206</b> of the second client device <b>202</b> may form a communication that describes use of a first stream to output video-on-demand on a first display device of the second client device <b>202</b>. The communication may also describe use of a second stream to output pay-per-view content on a second display device of the second client device <b>202</b>. Thus, this communication may describe multiple streams, although separate communications for each stream are also contemplated. Further, the stream manager module <b>208</b> of the third client device <b>204</b> may form a communication that describes usage of a single stream to display live television.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The communications may then be leveraged by the stream manager modules <b>128</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> to manage bandwidth that is available via the network connection <b>110</b>. For example, assume that the network bandwidth is sufficient to support four streams of content as illustrated by the arrows at the location <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. If the client device <b>104</b> requests access to an additional stream to record content to memory <b>120</b> (e.g., the request of the additional stream is illustrated in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the stream manager modules <b>128</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> of each of the client device <b>104</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> may determine which streams are permitted, e.g., which streams &#x201c;win&#x201d; or &#x201c;lose.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The stream manager modules <b>128</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, for instance, may rely on priorities that are assigned to the different streams so that each of the client devices can make the same decision about which streams will &#x201c;lose&#x201d; in a bandwidth constrained scenario. These priorities can be determined based on the type of stream (e.g., pay-per-view, VOD, or live content), how the stream is being used (e.g., recording or live), based on the last monitored interaction of the user with a respective playback device, and so on. Thus, the network bandwidth may be managed in a way that addresses the ability of one or more of the client devices to consume multiple streams, e.g., for dual screens, to play one stream and record another, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Continuing with the previous example, the request to consume an additional stream at the client device <b>104</b> may cause the stream manager module <b>128</b> to form a communication that describes this intended usage of the stream for transmission to the second and third client device <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>. Therefore, each of the client devices <b>104</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> has matching information regarding the current and intended future state of usage of the network bandwidth at the location <b>130</b>. In an implementation, each of the stream manager modules <b>128</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> is configured to arrive at a matching result regarding the usage, such as to cease reception of the stream that is given the lowest priority. For instance, the stream manager modules <b>128</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> may determine the priority based on type (e.g., recording then video-on-demand then live television) in conjunction with an amount of time that has passed since a user interacted with a respective client device <b>104</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> (e.g., moved a remote control, pressed a button, made a motion in a natural user interface that is detected using a camera, and so on). This priority may then be used to cease and/or override reception of the stream that has the lowest relative priority when compared with the priority of the other streams. Further discussion of content stream management may be found in relation to the following procedures.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example Procedures</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The following discussion describes content stream management techniques that may be implemented utilizing the previously described environment, systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference will be made to the environment <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a procedure <b>300</b> in an example implementation in which per stream usage is determined and communicated to manage network bandwidth usage. Per stream usage of content by a client device that consumes network bandwidth at a location is determined (block <b>302</b>). For example, the stream manager module <b>128</b> may include functionality to determine when a user last interacted with the client device <b>104</b>. A variety of different interactions may be detected, such as movement of a remote control, pressing one or more buttons of the remote control, via a camera (e.g., as a part of a natural user interface (NUI) to detect a user's presence), and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A communication is formed to be communicated to at least one other client device that shares the network bandwidth with the client device and that describes the determined per stream usage by the client device (block <b>304</b>). The communication may be formed in response to a variety of circumstances, such as a status message that is communicated at regular intervals, formed in response to a request to change stream consumption at the client device <b>104</b>, and so on. Additionally, the communication may be formed in a variety of ways, such as for broadcast over a wireless connection for receipt with the location <b>130</b> by other client devices <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, communicated using the network connections within the location <b>130</b> (e.g., using a local router), communicated outside the location <b>130</b> using the distribution system <b>102</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, the communication may describe a variety of different usage of the stream. For example, the communication may describe the type of stream (e.g., VOD versus live television), what the stream is being used for (e.g., live output or recording), user interaction with the stream (e.g., the last time the user interacted with the client device <b>104</b>, was in the room that includes the client device <b>104</b>), and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A communication is examined from the at least one other client device that describes per stream usage of the network bandwidth by the at least one other client device (block <b>306</b>). For example, the stream manager module <b>128</b> of the client device <b>104</b> may receive communications from the second and third client devices <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> that describe per stream usage. This communication may be the same as or different from the communication formed by the client device <b>104</b>. For example, the communication may describe user interaction but not type of content, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Usage of the network bandwidth at the client device and the other client device is managed (block <b>308</b>). For example, stream usage may be managed at the client device based at least in part on a result of the determination and the received communication (block <b>310</b>). The stream manager module <b>128</b> may determine from the communications that a stream that is to be used to record content in memory <b>120</b> has a higher priority than another stream that is consuming bandwidth at the location <b>130</b>, e.g., to stream live television to the third client device <b>204</b>. In an implementation, the client device <b>104</b> may confirm this result with the other client devices at the location <b>130</b> (e.g., the second and third client devices <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>) and begin streaming In another implementation, such a confirmation is not communicated. For instance, each of the client devices <b>104</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> may use similar considerations to arrive at a matching result. Therefore, in this instance each of the client devices <b>104</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> may implement the result (when it relates to the device) without communicating an intent to do so and/or a confirmation. A variety of other examples are also contemplated, another one of which is discussed in relation to the following figure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a procedure <b>400</b> in an example implementation in which network bandwidth management is implemented based on communications communicated between client devices at a location that share network bandwidth. One or more communications are received, respectively, at one of a plurality of client devices from one or more other of the plurality of client devices (block <b>402</b>). The communications may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, the communications may describe per stream usage of network bandwidth to stream content by a respective client device (block <b>404</b>). This description may include a variety of information, such as type of stream, user interaction, and so on as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Additionally, at least one of the communications describes a change to the per stream usage by the respective client device (block <b>404</b>). The communication, for instance, may be formed responsive to a desired change in consumption of content (e.g., to add or remove a stream) by the client device. Other examples are also contemplated, such as to provide the communications at periodic intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A determination is made as to how to portion the network bandwidth between the plurality of client devices that share the network bandwidth (block <b>408</b>). For example, the determination may be based at least in part on a determination of per stream usage by the client device (block <b>410</b>), based on a type of the usage (block <b>412</b>), based on user activity described by usage of the stream (block <b>414</b>), and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The determination is implemented at the client device (block <b>416</b>). For example, if the determination is based on priority and indicates that a stream that is being consumed by the client device has the lowest priority when compared with other streams, reception of the at least one stream at the client device is ceased (block <b>418</b>). However, if another client device is indicated as consuming a lower priority stream, consumption at the client device is maintained (block <b>420</b>). Thus, in this example each client device <b>104</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> at a location <b>130</b> that shares network bandwidth may make a determination as to how the network bandwidth is to be shared. A variety of other examples are also contemplated, such as a centralized determination and subsequent communication.</p>
