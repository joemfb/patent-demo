<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a U.S. National Phase patent application of PCT/SE2011/050066, filed Jan. 21, 2011, which claims priority to the Swedish Patent Application No. 1050129-4, filed Feb. 9, 2010, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in the present disclosure in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a disposable cigarette butt receiving bag according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b> and a method of manufacturing a disposable cigarette butt receiving bag according to the preamble of claim <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">After a cigarette has been used the remaining part of a cigarette, defined as a cigarette butt, is disposed as litter. Often there is no access to an ashtray for extinguishing and disposal of the cigarette butt. As a consequence cigarette butts are often thrown on the ground.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cigarette butts which are thrown on the ground constitute a substantial littering problem. The cigarette butts contain substances that are hazardous to the environment, and they also cause aesthetically unpleasant surroundings and consequently considerable sanitation costs. Further, when disposed of in the open, health-impairing cigarette butts are accessible to children and animals. Also, a glowing cigarette butt may set fire to inflammable material when thrown on the ground, floor or in a bin.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A bag-like portable ashtray is known from JP2003219858. The ashtray comprises an inner bag and an outer bag. A heat insulator is disposed between the inner and the outer bag. The heat insulator consists of a heat insulating material, such as a polymer absorbent in a porous material, which is closed in a separate bag.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One objective problem to be solved by the present invention is to prevent pollution of the environment due to cigarette butts thrown on the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another objective problem to be solved by the present invention is to avoid that cigarette butts are accessible to children and animals.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further problem to be solved by the present invention is to increase safety to fire due to disposed glowing cigarette butts.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further problem to be solved by the present invention is to achieve a cost effective handling of a large number of disposed cigarette butts.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These objective problems are solved by a disposable cigarette butt receiving bag according to claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such a disposable cigarette butt receiving bag prevents pollution of the environment due to cigarette butts thrown on the ground. The butt receiving bag is easy to keep and store into a pocket or a handbag and after the butt has been introduced into the butt receiving bag it may be disposed into a refuse bin or put back into the pocket or the handbag and disposed later.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an embodiment the invention one of the forward or rearward sheets is provided with a foldable closure flap extending from the edge of the opening, and where a pressure sensitive adhesive is arranged along the entire width of the flap to ensure tight sealing of the bag. Since the closure flap seals the butt receiving bag after the cigarette butt has been introduced into the butt receiving bag the cigarette butt is not accessible to children and animals. Also, there is no leakage of hazardous chemicals or substances. In this sense the disposable cigarette butt receiving bag will be made more child proof and animal proof.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a further embodiment of the invention the width of the forward inner layer material and the width of the rearward inner layer material between two longitudinal edges of the respective forward and rearward inner layer material together substantially correspond to a circumference of the cigarette butt. This will increase safety to fire due to disposed glowing cigarette butts, since the ambient air around the cigarette butt in the butt receiving compartment of the disposable cigarette butt receiving bag is minimized, and therefore the glow of the cigarette butt will extinguish immediately when the cigarette butt is introduced into the disposable cigarette butt receiving bag.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above-mentioned objective problems are also solved by a method of manufacturing a disposable cigarette butt receiving bag according to claim <b>11</b>. With such a method of manufacturing a disposable cigarette butt receiving bag a cost effective handling of a large number of disposed cigarette butts is achieved due to the cost effective manufacturing of a disposable cigarette butt receiving bag.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further specific features of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show a disposable cigarette butt receiving bag <b>1</b> of disposable type for receiving and extinguishing glowing cigarettes. The bag <b>1</b> comprises a forward sheet <b>2</b> and a rearward sheet <b>4</b>, which sheets are sealed by a seal <b>5</b> to each other along their outer edges <b>6</b> leaving an edge portion unsealed so as to provide an opening <b>8</b> for receiving a cigarette butt <b>10</b>. A cigarette butt receiving compartment <b>12</b> is formed between said forward and rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>. A fluid <b>14</b> is disposed in two heat insulating volumes <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> within the cigarette butt receiving compartment <b>12</b>. A first heat insulating volume <b>16</b> is delimited by the forward sheet <b>2</b> and a forward inner layer material <b>20</b> which is sealed against the forward sheet <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A second heat insulating volume <b>18</b> is delimited by the rearward sheet <b>4</b> and a rearward inner layer material <b>22</b> which is sealed against the rearward sheet <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show the cigarette butt receiving bag <b>1</b> according to the present invention in perspective views. One of the forward or rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> is provided with a foldable closure flap <b>24</b> extending from the edge of the opening <b>8</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> the rearward sheet <b>4</b> is provided with the foldable closure flap <b>24</b>. A pressure sensitive adhesive <b>26</b> is arranged along the entire width of the flap <b>24</b> to ensure tight sealing of the bag <b>1</b> when the closure flap <b>24</b> is folded down onto the outside of the opposite sheet. Preferably, the adhesive <b>26</b> is a permanent pressure sensitive adhesive <b>26</b> for permanent closure of the bag <b>1</b>, so that the closed bag <b>1</b> will be made more child proof, animal proof and a hindrance of chemical leakage. A pressure-sensitive adhesive <b>26</b> allows the user to easily seal the bag <b>1</b> by folding the closure flap <b>24</b> onto one side of the bag <b>1</b> and applying a light pressure. However, either a removable or a permanent pressure-sensitive adhesive <b>26</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A permanent pressure-sensitive adhesive <b>26</b>, which can exhibit high adhesion values and support kilograms of weigh per square centimetre of contact area, can be used in order to provide an improved child proof and animal proof bag <b>1</b>. In this case, a protective release liner <b>28</b> is placed over the adhesive <b>26</b> area of the closure flap <b>24</b>. The bag <b>1</b> may be delivered with the closure flap <b>24</b> folded in an open position, or with the closure flap <b>24</b> folded in a closed position. Upon usage, the user opens the bag <b>1</b> opening <b>8</b> by pressing the sides of the bag <b>1</b> towards each other, places the item to be disposed off inside the bag <b>1</b>, removes the release liner <b>28</b>, puts it in the bag <b>1</b> and folds the closure flap <b>24</b> over. When the closure flap <b>24</b>, being provided with the permanent pressure-sensitive adhesive <b>26</b>, is pressed onto the side of the bag <b>1</b> the adhesive <b>26</b> cures. Thereafter, the closure flap <b>24</b> cannot be opened without considerable effort and/or by the use off tools such as a knife or scissors. Thus, assuming that relatively tear proof material is used for the bag <b>1</b> and the closure flap <b>24</b>, the obtained bag <b>1</b> will be made more child proof and animal proof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A removable pressure sensitive adhesive <b>26</b>, which is designed to form a temporary bond, entails the advantage that no release liner <b>28</b> is needed and that the bag <b>1</b> may be delivered in a compact closed condition. Upon usage, the user opens the bag <b>1</b> by unfolding the closure flap <b>24</b> against the action of the removable adhesive <b>26</b>. When the cigarette butt <b>10</b> has been placed into the bag <b>1</b>, the closure flap <b>24</b> is reclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is enlarged in order to clearly indicate how the forward sheet <b>2</b>, rearward sheet <b>4</b>, forward inner layer material <b>20</b> and rearward inner layer material <b>22</b> are sealed to each other along their outer edges <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to a preferred embodiment the fluid <b>14</b> is an aqueous heat insulating liquid solution which is free-flowing in the heat insulating volumes <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. The aqueous heat insulating liquid solution comprises water, a consistency agent and a preserving agent. The consistency agent is preferably xanthan, the preserving agent is preferably a mixture of sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate. Other consistency agents and preserving agents may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The forward and rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> are preferably made of a laminate, comprising paper on which metalized polyester film <b>29</b>, such as an aluminium polyester film, is arranged and wherein the forward and rearward inner layer materials <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are made of polyethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the disposable cigarette butt receiving bag <b>1</b> according to the present invention in a perspective view. Upon usage, the user opens the bag <b>1</b> opening <b>8</b> by pressing the sides of the bag <b>1</b> towards each other, which is indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. When pressing the sides of the bag <b>1</b> towards each other the opening <b>8</b> will be large enough to receive a cigarette butt <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> discloses a cross section of the disposable cigarette butt receiving bag <b>1</b> along line II-II in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A cigarette butt <b>10</b> has been placed inside the cigarette butt receiving compartment <b>12</b> of the bag <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> discloses a cross section of the disposable cigarette butt receiving bag <b>1</b> along line II-II in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the user released the pressure on the sides of the bag <b>1</b> so that a clamping or self-closing action of the forward and rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> is obtained. Finally, the user removes the release liner <b>28</b>, puts it in the bag <b>1</b> and folds the closure flap <b>24</b> over.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The relationship of the bag <b>1</b> width and the rigidity of the forward and rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> are preferably chosen so that the above-mentioned clamping or self-closing action is obtained. This clamping or self-closing action is enhanced if the forward and rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> are arranged flat onto each other in the seal area, and if the seals <b>5</b> have a width so that said sheets are rigidly attached to each other along the seals <b>5</b> in a fixed-end manner. Said clamping or self-closing action contributes to the effective extinguishing of the cigarette butt <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The width of the forward inner layer material <b>20</b> and the width of the rearward inner layer material <b>22</b> between two longitudinal edges of the respective forward and rearward inner layer material <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> together substantially correspond to a circumference of the cigarette butt <b>10</b>. This will increase safety to fire due to disposed glowing cigarette butts <b>10</b>, since the ambient air around the cigarette butt <b>10</b> in the butt receiving compartment <b>12</b> of the disposable cigarette butt receiving bag <b>1</b> is minimized, and therefore the glow of the cigarette butt <b>10</b> will extinguish immediately when the cigarette butt <b>10</b> is introduced into the disposable cigarette butt receiving bag <b>1</b>. As a precautionary measure the fluid <b>14</b> will be exposed to the cigarette butt <b>10</b> if the glow burns trough the forward or rearward inner material <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. The fluid <b>14</b> will then extinguish the glow. Therefore, the fluid <b>14</b> act as an additional safety element in extinguishing the glow.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The disposable cigarette butt receiving bag <b>1</b> is arranged as a disposable article for single use and which should be disposed of as combustable litter after use. Because of the fluid <b>14</b> disposed in the insulating volumes <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, the bag <b>1</b> is fireproof, so that it can receive a glowing cigarette butt <b>10</b> and can be thrown away in a refuse bin without setting things on fire. The bag <b>1</b> is also heat-insulating, so that the outside of the bag <b>1</b> is not heated by a glowing cigarette butt <b>10</b> within the bag <b>1</b>. Therefore, a person will not be injured by the bag <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a method of manufacturing the above-mentioned disposable cigarette butt receiving bag <b>1</b> of the present invention. The method comprises the steps of providing a flexible plastic layer material <b>30</b>, forming cavities <b>32</b> in the flexible plastic layer material <b>30</b> in a thermoforming station <b>31</b>, filling the cavities <b>32</b> with a fluid <b>14</b>, providing a laminate <b>34</b>, comprising paper on which metalized polyester film <b>29</b> is arranged, seal the paper laminate <b>34</b> to the flexible plastic layer material <b>30</b>, in a thermo sealing station <b>35</b>, along outer edges <b>6</b> of the cavities <b>32</b> to form heat insulating volumes <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> filled with the fluid <b>14</b>, folding the flexible plastic layer material <b>30</b> and the paper laminate <b>34</b> so that the paper laminate <b>34</b> constitutes forward and rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and the flexible plastic layer material <b>30</b> constitutes forward and rearward inner layer materials <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, whereby the flexible plastic layer material <b>30</b> is clamped in the fold <b>36</b> between the forward and rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and finally sealing the forward and rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and thereby the intermediate forward and rearward inner layer materials <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, to each other along two lines <b>38</b> that are essentially perpendicular to the fold <b>36</b>. It is also possible to apply a seal along the fold <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably the flexible plastic layer material <b>30</b> and the paper laminate <b>34</b> are provided from a respective roll <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, which means that the final manufacturing step before packaging of the bags <b>1</b> is cutting the forward and rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and thereby the intermediate forward and rearward inner layer materials <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> along the lines <b>38</b> that are essentially perpendicular to the fold <b>36</b>. A cutter mechanism <b>48</b> is provided for the cutting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The folding of the flexible plastic layer material <b>30</b> and the paper laminate <b>34</b> may be performed off-centre, leaving additional layer material on the forward or rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, which material constitutes a foldable closure flap <b>24</b> for the bag <b>1</b>. It is also possible to creasing the forward or rearward sheets <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> along a line, so that a crease line <b>44</b> ensuring tight sealing of the bag <b>1</b>, when the closure flap <b>24</b> is folded, is formed. A pressure sensitive adhesive <b>26</b> is arranged along the entire width of the closure flap <b>24</b> to ensure tight sealing of the bag <b>1</b> when the closure flap <b>24</b> is folded. In a hot melt aggregate <b>50</b> the adhesive <b>26</b> is applied on the protective release liner <b>28</b>, which is provided from a roll <b>46</b>. Thereafter the protective release liner <b>28</b> is applied to the closure flap <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As mentioned above, the disposable cigarette butt receiving bag <b>1</b> according to the present invention is of disposable type and prevents pollution of the environment due to cigarette butts <b>10</b> thrown on the ground.
