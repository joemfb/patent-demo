<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/409,923, filed Nov. 3, 2010. The entirety of the above-mentioned patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to portable electronic devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to a portable electronic device capable of signal or power transmission and standing on a surface in a vertical or near-vertical orientation at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Along with the development of technology, portable electronic devices, such as tablet personal computer (tablet PC), electronic reader (E-Reader) and smart phone, have been greatly improved both in function and in product appearance. Currently, in addition to the basic functions of the portable electronic device, the network access function, the audio/video file playing function, the photography function, the video recording function and game-playing function have also become indispensable functions to be fashionable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is to be noted that when the portable electronic device is operating the functions such as, playing an audio/video file, recording a video, network access or playing games, the display area of the portable electronic device is usually faced to the user. At this moment, it is necessary to support the portable electronic device by hands, supporting components, base, wall or the like things enable to support the device to stand and face the display area to the user. In general, it would become inconvenient for a user if the portable electronic device has to be supported as above mentioned for a continually long period of time during enjoying the audio/video file playing, operating the video recording function or operating other functions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, since the things enable to support the portable electronic device are not widely available, the users have to hold the portable electronic device as long as they are watching the audio/video file playing or operating other functions. Thus, it is easy to make users to feel uncomfortable to hold the portable electronic device for such a continually long period of time and it is inconvenient in the use of the portable electronic device in this way.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a portable electronic device including a flat body having a front surface, a rear surface opposite to the front surface, and a through hole passing through the flat body, and the through hole extending from the front surface to the rear surface. Herein the through hole is adapted to couple with an external docking element for signal or power transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention further provides a portable electronic device including a flat body and an external docking element. The flat body has a front surface, a rear surface opposite to the front surface, and a through hole passing through the flat body, and the through hole extending from the front surface to the rear surface. The external docking element has an inserting portion and a stem portion. Herein the external docking element is adapted to couple with the flat body by inserting the inserting portion into the through hole for signal or power transmission and supporting the flat body to stand on a supporting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to make the aforementioned and other features and advantages of the invention more comprehensible, embodiments accompanying figures are described in detail below.</p>
