<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device and a method of driving the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A liquid crystal display device is a flat panel display device having liquid crystal cells arranged in a matrix between an upper substrate and a lower substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The liquid crystal display device forms an electric field by applying a source voltage and a common voltage to a pixel electrode and a common electrode, respectively, of liquid crystal cells selected by a scan pulse, and then controls transmittance of light supplied from a backlight assembly according to arrangement angles of corresponding liquid crystals to display an image.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, the source voltage is a data signal of the liquid crystal display device, and brightness of light emitted by the liquid crystal cells varies depending on the magnitude of the source voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The source voltage is supplied from a source driver (data driver) and is output from a source amplifier (SAP) provided in an output terminal of the source driver to be supplied to a data line.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the rising slope of the source voltage output from the source amplifier is controlled by a source amplifying register (SAP register). The source amplifying register is a register which controls the output of the source amplifier. More specifically, the source amplifying register controls the output of the source amplifier depending on a preset source amplifying set value (SAP value).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, in a conventional liquid crystal display device, driven at room temperature, the source amplifying register controls the output of the source amplifier corresponding to a preset source amplifying set value such that a source on-time for the liquid crystal cells can emit as much light having brightness corresponding to the source voltage as can be secured. For example, the source amplifier may register level 3 or level 4 source amplifying set values from among source amplifying set values between, for example, level 1 and level 5, and control the output of the source amplifier corresponding thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Here, the source on-time means time taken to raise the source voltage to the voltage of the corresponding data and then to maintain the voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">If the source-on time described above is long, the liquid crystal cells may sufficiently represent the brightness corresponding to their relevant data, while power consumption increases as the source on-time becomes longer. Therefore, the source amplifying register designates a rising slope of the source voltage depending on the source amplifying set value, with a level optimized based on brightness representation and power consumption of the liquid crystal display device when driven at room temperature. Here, the source amplifying set value may be designated as a value of rising time or rising slope, and be referred to as a value designated as the rising slope of the source voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, although the source amplifying set value described above is preset, the rising slope of the source voltage output from the source driver may be varied depending on changes in ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">More specifically, since the source amplifying set value is set based on room temperature, it cannot be controlled based on changes to ambient temperature. Therefore, when the ambient temperature of the liquid crystal display device becomes low, the mobility of a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as a TFT) constituting the source amplifier deteriorates to control the source amplifier depending on the fixed source amplifying set value, without reflecting the generated deterioration of the driving capability of the source amplifier. Therefore, since the rising slope of the source voltage is reduced corresponding to the reduction in power consumption generated as the ambient temperature falls, data lines and liquid crystal cells cannot be readily charged with the source voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other words, when the ambient temperature becomes low, the rising slope of the source voltage is reduced, causing the source on-time to be short, thereby causing charge errors of the source voltage from the panel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Vertical line defects are thereby generated from a display unit showing an image. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, Vg represents scan pulse, Vc represents common voltage, and Vs represents source voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In contrast, when the ambient temperature becomes high, the mobility of the TFT constituting the source amplifier increases to cause an increase in the rising slope of the source voltage, thereby causing a problem where current consumption increases.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention provides a liquid crystal display device which controls a rising slope of source voltages, and a method of driving the same.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A first exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a liquid crystal display device, including: a display unit including a plurality of liquid crystal cells at crossing regions of a plurality of data lines and a plurality of gate lines; a source driver for supplying source voltages to the plurality of data lines; and a temperature sensor for sensing an ambient temperature and for outputting an temperature sensing signal corresponding to the ambient temperature, wherein the source driver includes a source amplifying register unit for controlling a rising slope of the source voltages in accordance with the temperature sensing signal.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, certain exemplary embodiments according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic block diagram showing a configuration of a liquid crystal display device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a liquid crystal display device according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a display unit <b>110</b>, a source driver <b>120</b>, a gate driver <b>130</b>, a gamma reference voltage generator <b>140</b>, a backlight assembly <b>150</b>, an inverter <b>160</b>, a common voltage generator <b>170</b>, a gate driving voltage generator <b>180</b>, a timing controller <b>190</b>, and a temperature sensor <b>200</b>. Here, the temperature sensor <b>200</b> is not always provided within the liquid crystal display device, but may be provided in, for example, a cellular phone set on which the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b> may be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The display unit <b>110</b> includes a plurality of liquid crystal cells positioned at crossing regions of data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm and gate lines GL<b>1</b> to GLn. Here, the liquid crystal cells represent pixels, including a liquid crystal capacitor Clc having upper/lower substrates of a liquid crystal display panel (i.e., a common electrode and a pixel electrode formed on the upper/lower substrates) and a liquid crystal layer interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The liquid crystal cells have a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as a TFT) formed at crossing regions of the data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm and the gate lines GL<b>1</b> to GLn, a storage capacitor Cst coupled between a TFT and constant power supply, and a liquid crystal capacitor Clc coupled between a pixel electrode coupled to the TFT and a common electrode for supplying common voltage. Here, the liquid crystal capacitor Clc includes the pixel electrode and the common electrode, and the liquid crystal layer interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The TFT supplies a source voltage (that is, a data signal) from a data line DL corresponding to a scan pulse supplied from a gate line GL to the pixel electrode. To this end, the gate electrode of the TFT is coupled to the gate line GL, the source electrode is coupled to the data line DL, and the drain electrode is coupled to the pixel electrode of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc and the storage capacitor Cst. In other words, if the TFT is turned on in accordance with a scan pulse, the source voltage is supplied to the pixel electrode. Accordingly, an electric field corresponding to the source voltage is formed between the pixel electrode and the common electrode and an arrangement angle of the liquid crystal layer is varied, thereby displaying an image on the display unit <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The source driver <b>120</b> supplies the source voltage to the data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm corresponding to digital video data RGB and data driving control signals DDC supplied from the timing controller <b>190</b>. More specifically, the source driver <b>120</b> latches the digital video data RGB supplied from the timing controller <b>190</b> by performing sampling thereon, and then converts them to analog source voltages that may represent gray levels in the liquid crystal cells of the liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b> based on the gamma reference voltage supplied from the gamma reference voltage generator <b>140</b>. Then, the source driver <b>120</b> amplifies and supplies the analog source voltages to the data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm. To this end, the source driver <b>120</b> has a source amplifier (hereinafter referred to as an SAP unit (not shown)) in its output terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present invention, a rising slope of the source voltages output from the SAP unit is controlled corresponding to the temperature sensing signal St output from the temperature sensor <b>200</b>. As a result, the source voltages output to the data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm may be set within a substantially constant range, irrespective of the ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The gate driver <b>130</b> generates scan pulses (that is, gate pulses) in sequence corresponding to gate driving control signals GDC supplied from the timing controller <b>190</b> and applies the scan pulses to gate lines GL<b>1</b> to GLn. At this time, the gate driver determines high-level voltages and low-level voltages of the scan pulses, respectively, according to a gate high voltage VGH and a gate low voltage VGL supplied from the gate driving voltage generator <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The gamma reference voltage generator <b>140</b> generates a positive polarity gamma reference voltage and a negative polarity gamma reference voltage by receiving high potential power supply voltage VDD, and supplies them to the source driver <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The backlight assembly <b>150</b> is disposed at the rear side of the liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b> and emits light by a driving voltage and/or a driving current supplied from the inverter <b>160</b> to irradiate light to the liquid crystal cells of the liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The inverter (backlight driver) <b>160</b> generates a driving voltage and/or a driving current for driving the backlight assembly <b>150</b>, and supplies them to the backlight assembly <b>150</b>. For example, the inverter <b>160</b> converts a square wave signal into a triangle wave signal and compares the triangle wave signal with direct current power supply voltage VCC supplied from the system, so that the inverter <b>160</b> may generate a burst dimming signal in proportion to the comparative result. If the burst dimming signal is generated, a driving IC (not shown) controlling the generation of alternating current voltage and current in the inverter <b>160</b> controls the alternating current voltage and the current supplied to the backlight assembly <b>150</b> according to the burst dimming signal, thereby making it possible to drive the backlight assembly <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The common voltage generator <b>170</b> generates a common voltage by receiving high potential power supply voltage VDD, and supplies it to a common electrode of the respective liquid crystal cells.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The gate driving voltage generator <b>180</b> generates the gate high voltage VGH and the gate low voltage VGL by receiving the high potential power supply voltage VDD, and supplies them to the gate driver <b>130</b>. Here, the gate driving voltage generator <b>180</b> generates the gate high voltage VGH above a threshold voltage of the TFT provided in each liquid crystal cell, and generates the gate low voltage VGL below the threshold voltage of the TFT. The gate high voltage VGH and the gate low voltage VGL are used for determining the high-level voltages and the low-level voltages of the scan pulses generated by the gate driver <b>130</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The timing controller <b>190</b> supplies the digital video data RGB from a system such as a television receiver or a computer to the source driver <b>120</b>. The timing controller <b>190</b> also generates the data driving control signal DDC and the gate driving control signal GDC using horizontal/vertical synchronization signals H and V and a clock signal CLK, and supplies them to the source driver <b>120</b> and the gate driver <b>130</b>, respectively. Here, the data driving control signal DDC includes a source shift clock SSC, a source start pulse SSP, a polarity control signal POL, and a source output enable signal SOE, and the gate driving control signal GDC includes a gate start pulse GSP and a gate output enable signal GOE.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The temperature sensor <b>200</b> senses ambient temperature, and outputs a temperature sensing signal St corresponding thereto. The temperature sensing signal St is supplied to the source driver <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b> described above, the source voltage and the common voltage are respectively applied to the pixel electrode and the common electrode provided in the liquid crystal cells selected by a scan pulse. An electric field is formed between the pixel electrode and the common electrode, an arrangement angle of the liquid crystal is controlled, and light transmittance supplied from the backlight assembly <b>150</b> is changed accordingly, thereby displaying an image.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Here, the angle of the liquid crystal is determined by the data signal, that is, the source voltage applied to the pixel electrode, so it is desirable that the source voltage is evenly supplied according to each gray level.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">However, the driving devices of the source driver <b>120</b> may be sensitive to temperature. Therefore, the liquid crystal display device according to the present invention controls the output value of the source amplifying register unit (hereinafter referred to as SAP register unit) by sensing ambient temperature, thereby maintaining a substantially constant rising slope of the source voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic block diagram showing a configuration of a source driver according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a source driver <b>120</b> includes a shift register unit <b>121</b>, a latch unit <b>122</b>, a digital-analog converter (hereinafter referred to as a DAC unit) <b>123</b>, an SAP unit <b>124</b>, and an SAP register unit, wherein the SAP register unit <b>125</b> controls the SAP unit <b>124</b> in accordance with a temperature sensing signal St supplied from a temperature sensor <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The shift register unit <b>121</b> generates a sampling signal by shifting source start pulse SSP corresponding to source shift clock SSC, and supplies the generated sampling signal to the latch unit <b>122</b>. To this end, the shift register unit <b>121</b> includes a plurality of shift registers provided in respective channels.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The latch unit <b>122</b> sequentially stores data Data corresponding to the sampling signals supplied from the shift register unit <b>121</b>, and concurrently outputs stored data Data to the DAC unit <b>123</b> in accordance with a source output enable signal SOE. To this end, the latch unit <b>122</b> may include a plurality of sampling and holding latches provided in the respective channels.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The DAC unit <b>123</b> converts the data Data supplied from the latch unit <b>122</b> to positive polarity and/or negative polarity analog source voltages in accordance with a polarity control signal POL and outputs the analog source voltages to the SAP unit <b>124</b>. To this end, the DAC unit <b>123</b> includes a plurality of digital-analog converters DAC provided in the respective channels.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The SAP unit <b>124</b> amplifies the analog source voltages supplied from the DAC unit <b>123</b> and supplies the amplified analog source voltages to the data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm. To this end, the SAP unit <b>124</b> includes a plurality of SAPs provided in the respective channels. At this time, a rising slope of the source voltages output from the SAP unit <b>124</b> is controlled according to a source amplifying set value (hereinafter referred to as an SAP set value) output from the SAP register unit <b>125</b>. In other words, in exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the SAP unit <b>124</b> receives the SAP set value from the SAP register unit <b>125</b>, and generates and outputs source voltages having a corresponding rising slope.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The SAP register unit <b>125</b> outputs the SAP set value to the SAP unit <b>124</b>, thereby controlling the source voltages output from the SAP unit <b>124</b>. In particular, the SAP set value controls the rising slope of the source voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the SAP register unit <b>125</b> automatically changes the SAP set value in accordance with the temperature sensing signal St supplied from the temperature sensor <b>200</b> and supplies the SAP set value to the SAP unit <b>124</b>. Then, the SAP unit <b>124</b> outputs source voltages having a rising slope corresponding to the SAP set value output from the SAP register unit <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In other words, the SAP register unit <b>125</b> controls the rising slope of the source voltages in accordance with the temperature sensing signal St. Specifically, the SAP register <b>125</b> outputs a SAP set value corresponding to a reduction of the rising slope of the source voltages when ambient temperature is lower than a reference temperature (e.g., a preset reference temperature). The SAP register <b>125</b> outputs the SAP set value controlling the rising tilt of the source voltage to be reduced, when ambient temperature is higher than the reference temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">To this end, the SAP register unit <b>125</b> includes an analog-digital converter (ADC unit) <b>1251</b>, a memory <b>1252</b>, a comparator <b>1253</b>, and a controller <b>1254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The ADC unit <b>1251</b> converts the analog temperature sensing signal St supplied from the temperature sensor <b>200</b> to a digital sensing signal and supplies the digital sensing signal to the comparator <b>1253</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The memory <b>1252</b> stores a reference digital value corresponding to the reference temperature. Here, the reference temperature may be set to a certain temperature corresponding to room temperature or a temperature range corresponding to the room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The comparator <b>1253</b> compares the digital sensing signal supplied from the ADC unit <b>1251</b> with the reference digital value stored in the memory <b>1252</b>, and outputs a comparative value corresponding to the results of the comparison. The comparative value output from the comparator <b>1253</b> is supplied to the controller <b>1254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, after comparing the digital sensing signal with the reference digital value, the comparator <b>1253</b> may output a comparative value of 0 (or 00) if the difference between the digital sensing signal and the reference digital value is within a predetermined range. The comparator <b>1253</b> may output a comparative value of 1 (or 01) when the ambient temperature is lower than the reference temperature, and may output a comparative value of 2 (or 10) when the ambient temperature is higher than the reference temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The controller <b>1254</b> maintains or changes the SAP set value (e.g., a preset SAP set value) in accordance with the reference temperature (for example, room temperature) based on the comparative value supplied from the comparator <b>1253</b> and supplies it to the SAP unit <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, when a comparative value of 0 is supplied from the comparator <b>1253</b>, the controller <b>1254</b> may supply a SAP set value (e.g., the preset SAP set value) in accordance with the reference temperature to the SAP unit <b>124</b> without changing it.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When a comparative value of 1 is supplied from the comparator <b>1253</b>, that is, a comparative value corresponding to a low temperature is supplied, the controller <b>1254</b> may change the SAP set value so that the rising slope of the source voltages is increased, and supply the SAP set value to the SAP unit <b>124</b>. Therefore, when the ambient temperature is lower than the reference temperature, the SAP set value is changed, so that a reduction in the rising slope of the source voltages due to a decrease in mobility of the TFT is compensated. Vertical line defects on the display unit may thereby be prevented or reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When a comparative value of 2 is supplied from the comparator <b>1253</b>, that is, a comparative value corresponding to a high temperature is supplied, the controller <b>1254</b> may change the SAP set value so that the rising slope of the source voltages is reduced, and supply the SAP set value to the SAP unit <b>124</b>. Therefore, when the ambient temperature is higher than the reference temperature, the SAP set value is changed, so that an increase in the rising slope of the source voltages due to an increase in mobility of the TFT is offset. An increase in power consumption may thereby be prevented or reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In other words, the controller <b>1254</b> controls the SAP set value corresponding to the comparative value supplied from the comparative unit <b>1253</b> and supplies the SAP set value to the SAP unit <b>124</b>, thereby controlling the rising slope of the source voltages output from the SAP unit <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The operation of controlling the rising slope of the source voltage according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be briefly described. First, the temperature sensor <b>200</b> senses ambient temperature. Then, the source driver <b>120</b> controls the rising slope of source voltages in accordance with the ambient temperature sensed by the temperature sensor <b>200</b>, and supplies the source voltages to the data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">More specifically, the source driver <b>120</b> generates a digital sensing signal corresponding to the ambient temperature. Then, the source driver <b>120</b> compares the digital sensing signal with a reference digital value corresponding to a reference temperature, and generates a SAP set value corresponding to the comparative result. The source driver <b>120</b> described above generates source voltages with rising slope corresponding to the SAP set value, and outputs the source voltages to the data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At this time, if the ambient temperature is lower than the reference temperature, the source driver <b>120</b> generates a SAP set value for controlling the rising slope of the source voltages to be increased. If the ambient temperature is higher than the reference temperature, the source driver <b>120</b> generates a SAP set value controlling the rising slope of the source voltages to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Accordingly, when the ambient temperature is lower than the reference temperature, the reduction in the rising slope of the source voltages due to the reduction in mobility of driving devices may be compensated. When the ambient temperature is higher than the reference temperature, the increase in the rising slope of the source voltages due to the increase in mobility of the driving devices may be offset.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In other words, with the present invention, the rising slope of the source voltages may be maintained, irrespective of the ambient temperature. The reliability of the liquid crystal display device may thereby be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although the exemplary embodiment of the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> describes only three cases in which the SAP value is determined, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the degree of increase or reduction to the SAP value may include a plurality of increments in accordance with the difference between the ambient temperature and the reference temperature, while applying the technical idea of the present invention, so that the rising slope of the source voltages may be more minutely controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">While the present invention has been described in connection with certain exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but is instead intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, and equivalents thereof.</p>
