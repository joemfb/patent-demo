<p id="p-0003" num="0002">N/A</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to improved methods and apparatus for multidimensional analysis, and especially to apparatus involving multi-dimensional liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The invention further provides multidimensional apparatus and methods for the quantitative determination of one or more components comprised in a sample mixture using improved methods of calibration. Apparatus and methods according to the invention are particularly useful for, but not limited to, the analysis of complicated mixtures of peptides and proteins.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Multidimensional analysis methods and apparatus are especially suitable for use with complex biochemical samples. An example of such multidimensional apparatus comprises two chromatographic columns in series, wherein the two columns are typically selected to cause separation of the components according to different physiochemical properties. For example, the first dimension column may be such as to separate components by ion pair chromatography while the second dimension column may be a reverse-phase analytical column. In such a system, components eluting from the first dimension column pass directly into the second dimension column where they are subjected to further separation before arriving at a detector.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although most commonly used with liquid mobile phases and especially for HPLC, multidimensional chromatographic systems for gas chromatography or supercritical fluid chromatography, or combinations of all three, are known.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A limitation of the simple system wherein two or more columns are simply connected in series is that the same mobile phase must pass through both columns. Further, especially in the case of samples comprising many components, there is a danger that once a first batch of components has passed through the first dimension column and is undergoing separation of the second dimension column, some components comprised in a second batch eluting from the first dimension column may pass onto the second dimension column and interfere with the separation thereon of the first batch of components.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These problems can be overcome by interposing one or more traps between the first and second dimension columns. This allows the temporary storage of a second batch of components eluting from the first dimension column while a first batch is undergoing separation on the second dimension column. It also allows the use of different mobile phases for the first and second dimension separations. For example, by means of a suitable arrangement of valves, a first mobile phase may be employed to carry out a first dimension separation and to trap a batch of components, and a second mobile phase may be used to release the trapped components and to carry out a second dimension separation. In some cases, when the first mobile phase is such that it does not cause components to be eluted from the second dimension column, it may be possible to dispense with a separate trap and to trap batches of components at the head of the second dimension column before changing the mobile phase to one which will elute the trapped components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Where provided, a suitable trap may comprise a short chromatographic column capable of trapping at least some of the components entering it in the mobile phase used for the first dimension separation. In some cases it may comprise a chromatographic absorbent similar to that used in the second dimension column, but other types of trap may also be used, for example traps based on affinity or immunological binding. Trapped components may be released from the trap when required by introduction of a different, stronger, mobile phase.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When a trap is provided downstream of the first dimension column, the second dimension column may be replaced by alternative analytical apparatus, for example a mass spectrometer. Using such apparatus, a typical method of analysis may comprise trapping at least some of the components as they elute from the first dimension column and subsequently releasing batches of them into the mass spectrometer for further analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Quantitative calibration of multidimensional analysis systems is more difficult than it is for single dimension systems. For example, an internal standard added to a complex sample analysed on a multidimensional system will typically elute in only one or a few of the batches of sample components which elute from the first dimension column, and therefore can only provide a reference for those batches as they undergo further separation on the second dimension column (or analysis in analytical apparatus such as a mass spectrometer). Unfortunately, it is often impractical to overcome this difficulty by providing many different internal standards, each appropriate for the components of each batch eluting from the first dimension. Consequently, in the past, quantitative calibration of multidimensional chromatographic systems has often been carried out merely by separately running one or more samples comprising a known amount of a component whose concentration in a complex mixture is to be determined, using identical chromatographic conditions. The quantity of the component in the complex mixture may then be determined by comparing the heights or areas of the relevant chromatographic peaks obtained from the calibration sample and the mixture. Such a method is of course less accurate than calibration using an internal standard added to the sample itself because it relies on the chromatographic conditions being identical for the run of the calibration sample and the run of the mixture. In practice, in view of the long time periods typically required for multidimensional chromatography, and the complexity of the methods used, maintaining the conditions sufficiently similar for accurate quantification is very difficult. Other errors may also arise if the matrix in which the calibration sample is comprised is significantly different from that in which the sample is comprised. Use of a mass spectrometer to detect compounds eluting from the chromatographic system, commonplace when complex samples are being analysed, adds further to these quantification problems because its sensitivity can be affected by many other factors that may also vary with time and matrix composition.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Similar difficulties in quantification arise in systems where the second dimension column is omitted and eluent from the trap is fed directly to a mass spectrometer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is therefore a need for multidimensional analysis apparatus and methods in which the problems associated with quantitative calibration are minimized. It is an object of the present invention to provide such apparatus and methods. It is another object of the invention to provide methods and apparatus for quantitative multidimensional analysis that do not require internal standards to be added to a complex sample. It is further object to provide methods and apparatus for quantitative multidimensional analysis that do not rely on comparing chromatographic parameters obtained during different runs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of the invention provides a method of chromatography comprising the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">First, a sample comprising one or more sample components is introduced into a first mobile phase, and the resulting solution is passed through first chromatographic media so that at least some of the sample components are retained on the first chromatographic media. Then, a releasing phase comprising calibration material is passed through the first chromatographic media. The releasing phase is such as to cause at least some of the sample components previously retained on the first chromatographic media to be released from that media into the releasing phase. The calibration material is such that it is not retained on the first chromatographic media in the presence of the releasing phase and may comprise one or more chemical species. The releasing phase comprising the released sample components and the calibration material is passed into second chromatographic media which is capable of separating at least some of the released sample components and the calibration material. The eluent from the second chromatographic media is passed into detector means. The detector means generates signals indicative of the amount of at least some of the sample components and the calibration material present in the eluent. These signals are then processed to yield quantitative information about at least some of the sample components relative to the calibration material.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, only some of the sample components retained on the first chromatographic media are released by the passage of the releasing phase. Once further separation of the released sample components on the second chromatographic media is completed (or sufficiently advanced to ensure there will be no interference), a second batch of sample components may be released from the first chromatographic media by passing another releasing phase into it. This releasing phase may also comprise calibration material, and will typically be stronger than the releasing phase originally used so that a second batch of sample components, more strongly retained on the first chromatographic media, may be released. The releasing phase comprising the second batch of sample components and the calibration material may then be passed into the second chromatographic media and at least some of the sample components therein may be quantitatively determined in the same way as described for the first batch of sample components.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A convenient way of generating different releasing phases is to provide a plurality of reservoirs, each containing a releasing agent as well as the calibration material. Each reservoir may contain a different concentration of releasing agent. The contents of a reservoir may be introduced into the flow of first mobile phase to generate a releasing phase as required. This may be done using the same apparatus provided for introducing a sample into the flow of first mobile phase, for example a sample valve and sample loop similar to those conventionally used in liquid chromatography. For example, if the first chromatographic separation media comprises a strong cation exchange media, the releasing agent may comprise salt solutions having different concentrations in different reservoirs.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The process may be repeated using still stronger releasing phases, each capable of releasing another batch of sample components retained on the first chromatographic media, and each releasing phase comprising calibration material that is not retained on the first chromatographic media. In this way calibration material will elute in every batch of sample components transmitted to the second chromatographic media, allowing quantitative calibration of the sample components. This overcomes the problem inherent in prior multidimensional methods wherein the calibration material elutes only with certain batches of sample components.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a variation, the releasing phases may be modified by the addition of a modifying phase as they exit from the first chromatographic media, thereby generating a second mobile phase that passes to the second chromatographic media. The modifying phase may be selected so that the resultant second mobile phase is more suitable for carrying out the separation on the second chromatographic media than the releasing phases alone. The composition of the modifying phase may be varied with time, permitting gradient elution to be carried out. The flow of releasing phase may be discontinued once the sample components have all passed onto the second chromatographic media so that the additional solvent provides the sole source of mobile phase for the second chromatographic media. A splitting device may also be provided so that only a portion of the releasing phase and/or the modifying phase passes to the second chromatographic media.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It will be appreciated that in the above methods each of the releasing phases used to release sample components from the first chromatographic media enters the second chromatographic media and comprises at least a part of the second mobile phase used to carry out the separations on that media, at least for some of the time during which a separation is being carried out. In certain cases this may degrade the separation, or even be substantially incompatible with it, even if the releasing phase is modified as described. The invention therefore provides methods of quantitative multidimensional analysis having more general applicability. In these methods, batches of sample components released from the first chromatographic media are trapped on trapping media before being passed to a second analysis device. This may comprise a second chromatographic column or an analyzer such as a mass spectrometer. Thus the first mobile phase and/or releasing phases may be used to carry sample components from the first chromatographic media to trapping media rather than directly to the second chromatographic media or analyzer. The trapping media should be capable of trapping thereon at least some of the sample components in the presence of the first mobile phase or releasing phases eluting from the first chromatographic media. During this stage of the methods, the first mobile phase and/or releasing phases may be diverted to waste rather than being passed to the second separation media or analytical device. When a batch of sample components has been trapped on the trapping media, the flow of first mobile phase or releasing phase may be discontinued and a separate supply of a second mobile phase may be used to release at least some of them from the trapping media, to pass them to the second separation means or analytical device. Another separation may then be carried out on the second separation media, or an analysis carried out on the analytical device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The trapping media may be comprised in a separate chromatographic column, and may have properties similar to those of the second chromatographic media where provided. Alternatively, the trapping media may comprise part of the second chromatographic media itself, so that sample components are trapped on the initial portion of the second chromatographic media itself, until the second mobile phase is introduced. This variation requires that the first mobile phase and releasing phases pass through the second chromatographic media and may not always be applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In all cases, however, calibration material is provided in each of the releasing phases. The calibration material, which may comprise one or more chemical species, may be selected so that in the presence of the releasing phase it is either not retained or is only retained for a short time on the first chromatographic media, but is capable of being trapped on the trapping media along with the sample components. Calibration material may then be released by the second mobile phase and may pass with the sample components into the second chromatographic media or analysis device, thereby allowing at least relative quantitative determination of at least some of the sample components in that batch.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The use of intermediate trapping between the first chromatographic media and second chromatographic media or analysis device decouples the first and second dimension separation from the second dimension separation or analysis. This may allow a conventional chromatographic separation to be carried out on the first chromatographic media, in place of the trapping and subsequent batch releasing of sample components described above. In such a case, unresolved groups of sample components eluting from the first chromatographic media may be trapped on the trapping media, and subsequently released by a second mobile phase to pass into the analysis device or second chromatographic media where they may undergo further separation. An aliquot of calibration material may be separately introduced into the first mobile phase. The calibration material, which may comprise one or more chemical species, should not be retained, or be retained only for a short time, on the first chromatographic media, but should be retained on the trapping media along with the sample components. Alternatively, calibration material may be introduced into the second mobile phase.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Calibration material may be introduced into a mobile phase or a releasing phase by means of a sample valve configured to introduce a fixed volume of a solution comprising the calibration material into the flow of the phase. Alternatively, in embodiments where a fixed volume of releasing phase is used to release a batch of trapped sample components, each releasing phase may comprise calibration material. When a fixed volume of the releasing phase is injected into a mobile phase that in the absence of the releasing solvent is incapable of releasing any sample components from the chromatographic or trapping media, this method will introduce a fixed quantity of the calibration material. Typically, several different releasing phases of different strengths are prepared, each containing the calibration material. These different strength phases may then be introduced as required into the mobile phase to release different batches of sample components from the media.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In all the above embodiments, if an absolute quantitative determination of the sample components is required, each releasing phase should comprise a known amount of calibration material. However, if only relative quantification is required, it may only necessary for each releasing phase to comprise the same amount of calibration material.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of a two-dimensional liquid chromatographic apparatus suitable for practicing the invention comprises a first dimension chromatographic column <b>1</b> which contains first chromatographic media <b>23</b>, a second dimension chromatographic column <b>2</b> that contains second chromatographic media <b>24</b>, and a trap column <b>3</b> that contains trapping media <b>25</b>. Two six-port valves <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, a binary liquid chromatograph pump <b>6</b>, a loading pump <b>7</b> and a detector <b>8</b> are also provided.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In use, a sample to be analysed is contained in a reservoir <b>9</b>. With the valve <b>4</b> set to the &#x201c;load&#x201d; position (wherein its ports are connected as indicated by the lines <b>13</b>), a syringe or other suction device <b>10</b> is used to fill a sample loop <b>12</b> by drawing sample from reservoir <b>9</b> through a connecting pipe <b>11</b>. Valve <b>4</b> is then turned to the &#x201c;run&#x201d; position, wherein its ports are connected as shown by the lines <b>14</b>. The loading pump <b>7</b> is then used to pump a first mobile phase from a reservoir <b>15</b> through the sample loop <b>12</b> so that the sample present in the sample loop <b>12</b> in the flow of first mobile phase to the first dimension chromatographic column <b>1</b>. During this step, valve <b>5</b> may be set so that its ports are connected as indicated by lines <b>16</b>, which causes the first mobile phase exiting from the column <b>1</b> to enter the trap column <b>3</b> via the connecting pipe <b>26</b>, and on leaving the trap column <b>3</b> to be discharged to waste via a tee connector <b>19</b>. (Note that the alternative path for the mobile phase from the tee connector <b>19</b> through the second dimension column <b>2</b> presents very high impedance, so the vast majority of the flow passes to waste via valve <b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment especially suitable for peptide or protein analysis, the first dimension column <b>1</b> may be a SCX (strong cation exchange) column, and the trap column <b>3</b> may comprise a short reverse phase column. The first mobile phase (contained in the reservoir <b>15</b>) is pumped by the loading pump <b>7</b> through the valve <b>4</b> (set to the &#x201c;run&#x201d; position, described above) to the first dimension chromatographic column <b>1</b>. The first mobile phase may be selected so that at least some components present in a sample previously loaded into the sample loop <b>12</b> are retained on the first dimension column <b>1</b>. Any sample components that are not retained may pass directly to the trap column <b>3</b> and may be treated as a batch of sample components, as described below. When the column <b>1</b> is an SCX column, the first mobile phase may be a weak solvent that comprises a low concentration of salt.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Means for passing a releasing phase through said first chromatographic separation media, described below, may also be provided. A first batch of sample components may be released from the first dimension column <b>1</b> by setting the valve <b>4</b> to the &#x201c;load&#x201d; position and filling the sample loop <b>12</b> with a first releasing phase from a reservoir <b>17</b> via the pipe <b>11</b>. The first releasing phase may comprise a solvent (typically the first mobile phase) and releasing agent, for example a low percentage (typically 10%) of a salt solution. As described in general terms above, the releasing phase may also comprise calibration material. In the case of a sample comprising peptides, the calibration material may comprise one or more peptides that are not retained on the first dimension column in the presence of the releasing phase. The contents of the sample loop <b>12</b> may then be introduced into the flow of first mobile phase from the loading pump <b>7</b> by setting the valve <b>4</b> to the &#x201c;run&#x201d; position. The &#x201c;slug&#x201d; of releasing phase (comprising the calibration material) present in the sample loop <b>12</b> is then carried to the first dimension column <b>1</b> where it releases a batch of sample components previously retained thereon. These released sample components (together with the calibration material) then pass to the trap column <b>3</b> where they are retained. The first mobile phase and releasing phase (including the salt) continue through the trap column <b>3</b>, the valve <b>5</b> and are discharged to waste, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A second dimension separation of the components trapped on the trap column <b>3</b> may then be carried out by setting valve <b>5</b> to the position where its ports are connected as indicated by the lines <b>18</b>. The binary solvent liquid chromatograph pump <b>6</b> may then be used to deliver a second mobile phase to the trap column <b>3</b> via the connecting pipe <b>26</b>. The second mobile phase should be of sufficient strength to release the trapped components and calibration material from the trap column <b>3</b> and to carry them through the tee connector <b>19</b> to the second dimension column <b>2</b>. (Note that the other exit of the tee connector <b>19</b> is blocked when valve <b>5</b> is set so that its ports are connected as indicated by the lines <b>18</b>, thereby forcing the flow of second mobile phase into the column <b>2</b>). In the present example, the second dimension column <b>2</b> may be a reverse phase analytical column. The pump <b>6</b> may be programmed to generate a solvent gradient of gradually increasing strength to effect a chromatographic separation of the sample components released from the trap column <b>3</b>. The eluent from the second dimension column <b>2</b> is passed to a detector <b>8</b> which may comprise any suitable chromatographic detector, for example a mass spectrometer, UV absorption detector, refractive index detector, or an evaporative light scattering detector. Conveniently, but not essentially, the trapping media <b>25</b> used in trap column <b>3</b> and the media <b>24</b> used in second dimension column <b>2</b> may be similar, so that in effect the separation of the sample components starts on the trap column <b>3</b> and continues on the column <b>2</b> when the second mobile phase is introduced form the pump <b>6</b>. However, the trap column <b>3</b> is generally very short and of greater capacity (in terms of flow rate) than the second dimension column <b>2</b>, permitting the first mobile phase and releasing phase to be pumped through it at a higher flow rate than that used for the second dimension separation, particularly when valve <b>5</b> is set to discharge the eluent from the trap column <b>3</b> to waste. In many practical embodiments, the media <b>25</b> used in the trap column <b>3</b> will comprise larger particles than those comprised in the media <b>24</b> used in the second dimension column <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As explained, the calibration material may be chosen so that it is released from the trap column <b>3</b> along with the sample components. At least one chromatographic peak corresponding to the calibration material will therefore appear in the second dimension chromatogram, and can be used as a reference to quantitatively determine one or more of the sample components that also produce peaks in the chromatogram.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Once the second dimension separation of the first batch of sample components has been completed, the sample loop <b>12</b> may be filled with a different releasing phase (for example, from reservoir <b>20</b>). This releasing phase may be stronger than the first (for example it may comprise a greater concentration of salt) so that it will release a second batch of sample components from the first dimension column <b>1</b>, which components have been more strongly bound on the chromatographic media than the first batch. It may also comprise calibration material that is not retained by the first dimension column, typically but not necessarily the same material used in the first releasing phase. On passing through the first dimension column <b>1</b> this releasing phase will release the second batch of sample components and carry them, along with the calibration material, to the trap column <b>3</b>. The pump <b>6</b> is then used to supply a second mobile phase via the valve <b>5</b> to the trap column <b>3</b>, thereby releasing the second batch of sample components and the calibration material and passing them to the second dimension column <b>2</b>. Typically, the mobile phase used will have the same composition of the second mobile phase used to release the first batch of sample components, as described above. The second batch of sample components then undergo separation of the column <b>2</b>, and the chromatogram produced by detector <b>8</b> will comprise at least one peak from the calibration material, allowing quantitative determination of at least one of the second batch of sample components.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Use of the same calibration material, and the same second mobile phase for the first and second batches of sample components in the second dimension calibration results in the chromatographic peak or peaks due to the calibration material occurring in substantially the same place in each chromatogram. This facilitates identification in a complicated chromatogram.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The process may be repeated to release and separate in the second dimension third, fourth, and subsequent batches of sample components, each batch being released from the first dimension column <b>1</b> by means of stronger releasing phases, selected from the plurality of reservoirs <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, etc. In the example of the SCX first dimension column, these stronger releasing phases may comprise higher concentrations of salt. Each releasing phase may also comprise calibration material, as discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Operation of a two-dimensional chromatographic system in this way overcomes the problem of many prior methods wherein an internal standard added to a sample usually only elutes along with one or a few of the batches of sample components released from the first dimension column, so that it cannot provide a reference for all the batches. Methods as described also represent an improvement over the alternative prior method wherein samples comprising known amounts of a given sample component are separately analysed to provide a calibration curve, because the calibration material passes through both columns with the same mobile phases and releasing phases as the sample components. This reduces errors due to variation in the chromatographic conditions in the same way as does the use of an internal standard in single dimensional chromatography.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, multidimensional analysis apparatus according to another embodiment of the invention comprises a first dimension chromatographic column <b>1</b>, a trap column <b>3</b> and an analysis device <b>27</b>. A suitable analysis device <b>27</b> may comprise a mass spectrometer. The first dimension column <b>1</b> contains first chromatographic media <b>23</b> and the trap column <b>3</b> contains trapping media <b>25</b>. Two six-port valves <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, a binary liquid chromatographic pump <b>6</b>, and a loading pump <b>7</b> are also provided. A restrictor <b>28</b> is also provided between the tee connector <b>19</b> and the analysis device <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In use, a sample may be loaded on the column <b>1</b> using the valve <b>4</b> and its associated components in the same way as described with reference to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment. During this stage, valve <b>5</b> may be set so that the eluent from the trap column <b>3</b> is discharged to waste via the tee connector <b>19</b>. The restrictor <b>28</b> ensures that the impedance of path through valve <b>5</b> to waste is lower than the impedance into the analysis device <b>27</b>, so that at least a major portion of the eluent passes to waste rather than to the analysis device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Batches of sample components may then be released from the trap column <b>3</b> using releasing phases from reservoirs <b>17</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, etc. as described for the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment. Batches required to be analysed by the analysis device <b>27</b> may be admitted into it by setting valve <b>5</b> to block the connection from the tee connector <b>19</b> to waste, so that the eluent from the trap column <b>3</b> (comprising the sample components) passes through the restrictor <b>28</b> to the analysis device <b>27</b>. As in the embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the releasing phases may comprise calibration material that passes through the first dimension column <b>1</b> but is retained, along with the sample components, on the trap column <b>3</b>. Information produced by the analysis device <b>27</b> from the calibration material may then be used as a reference for the quantitative determination of at least some of the sample components present in the batch. Where the analysis device <b>27</b> is a mass spectrometer, the calibration material should be chosen so that its mass spectrum comprises one or more mass peaks that are distinct from those produced by the sample components. For example, it may comprise an isotopically labelled variant of one of the sample components.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An embodiment of the invention in which two trap columns are provided is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, reference numerals also present in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> relate to apparatus previously descried with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> embodiment comprises a first dimension column <b>1</b> containing first chromatographic media <b>23</b>, a second dimension column <b>2</b> containing second chromatographic media <b>24</b>, and two trap columns <b>29</b>, <b>30</b> respectively containing trapping media <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>. Five six-port valves <b>4</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, and <b>36</b>, a loading pump <b>7</b> and a binary liquid chromatograph pump <b>6</b> are also provided.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In use, valves <b>4</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> are initially set to the positions respectively indicated by lines <b>13</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b>. A sample contained in the sample reservoir <b>9</b> is drawn into the sample loop <b>12</b> by the syringe <b>10</b>, as described with reference to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment. Valve <b>4</b> is then changed to the position indicated by the lines <b>14</b> and the loading pump <b>7</b> used to carry a first mobile phase from the reservoir <b>15</b> through the sample loop <b>12</b> and, together with the sample, to the first dimension column <b>1</b>. Eluent from column <b>1</b> is passed to waste through valves <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> (set as indicated by lines <b>37</b> and <b>38</b>, respectively). As in the case of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment, in a particular example, the chromatographic media <b>23</b> in the first dimension column <b>1</b> may be SCX media. At least some sample components will be retained on the first dimension column <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Valve <b>36</b> may then be set to the position indicated by the lines <b>41</b> and an aliquot of a first releasing phase from the reservoir <b>17</b> may be loaded into the sample loop <b>12</b> using the syringe <b>10</b>, as detailed in respect of loading a sample from the reservoir <b>9</b>. Valve <b>4</b> may then be set to the position indicated by the lines <b>13</b> and the loading pump <b>7</b> used to carry the releasing phase through the first dimension column <b>1</b> through valves <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> to the trap column <b>30</b> and then to waste. The passage of the releasing phase through the first dimension column <b>1</b> releases a first batch of sample components that, together with the calibration material comprised in the releasing phase, are retained on the first trap column <b>30</b>. A second dimension separation of these retained components may then be carried out on the second dimension column <b>2</b> using the binary liquid chromatograph pump <b>6</b> to deliver a second mobile phase and by setting valves <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> to the positions indicated by lines <b>42</b> and <b>38</b> respectively. This results in the second mobile phase passing through the trap column <b>30</b> to the column <b>2</b> and thence to the detector <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While this second dimension separation is being carried out, a second releasing phase (from reservoir <b>20</b>, for example) may be loaded into the sample loop <b>12</b> and passed to the first dimension column <b>1</b>. Here it may release a second batch of sample components, which may be carried to the second trap column <b>29</b> by setting valves <b>34</b> and <b>33</b> to the positions indicated by lines <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> respectively. When the second dimension separation of the first batch of sample components is complete, valves <b>35</b> and <b>33</b> may be set to the positions indicated by lines <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> respectively, and the pump <b>6</b> used to deliver a third mobile phase release sample components from the second trap column <b>29</b> and to carry out a second dimension separation of the second batch of sample components on the second dimension column <b>2</b>. Typically, the third mobile phase may have the same composition as the second mobile phase.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Like the first releasing phase, the second releasing phase may comprise calibration material that will be eluted from the second trap column <b>29</b> along with the second batch of sample components and will provide a reference for quantitatively determining at least some of the sample components comprised in the second batch.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be seen that the use of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> allows simultaneous first and second dimension separations to be carried out. This reduces the time taken to carry out a complete multidimensional analysis. By incorporating calibration material into the releasing phases stored in reservoirs <b>17</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, etc, a quantitative calibration of each second dimension separation can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An alternative embodiment of a system incorporating two trap columns is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. An eight-port valve <b>45</b> is used to direct eluent from the first dimension column <b>1</b> to either of two trap columns <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>, and thence to the second dimension column <b>2</b> and detector <b>8</b>. Thus, when valve <b>45</b> is in the position such that its ports are connected as indicated by the lines <b>46</b>, eluent from the first dimension column <b>1</b> flows to the first trap column <b>30</b> and then to waste, permitting a first batch of sample components to be stored on the trap column <b>30</b>. Changing valve <b>45</b> to the position in which its ports are connected as indicated by the lines <b>47</b> allows a second batch of sample components to be stored on the second trap column <b>29</b> while the binary liquid chromatograph pump <b>6</b> supplies a second mobile phase via the trap column <b>30</b> to the second dimension column <b>2</b>, so that a second dimension separation of the sample components previously stored in the trap column <b>30</b> can be carried out. Similarly, a second batch of sample components stored in the trap column <b>29</b> can undergo a second dimension separation using a third mobile phase by setting valve <b>45</b> to the position in which its ports are connected as indicated by lines <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As in the previously described embodiments, releasing phases comprising calibration material are used to transfer batches of sample components from the first dimension column <b>1</b> to the two trap columns <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>. The calibration material, which may comprise one or more chemical species, may be selected so that it is not retained of the first dimension column <b>1</b> in the presence of the retaining phase, but is retained on the trap column until the second or third mobile phase from pump <b>6</b> is introduced to start the second dimension separation. Note that the calibration material does not need to be released immediately on the introduction of the second or third mobile phase. It is required only that it appears at a suitable point in the chromatogram of the second dimension separation, its retention time, like that of the sample components themselves, being determined by the combination of the trap column and the second dimension column.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In particular embodiments, when the first dimension column <b>1</b> is an SCX column, the second dimension column <b>2</b> and the trap columns <b>3</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>, may all comprise reverse phase chromatographic media, and the second and third mobile phases may comprise a solvent gradient of gradually increasing strength, as in many conventional reverse-phase separations. Such a configuration is applicable to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> embodiments, and is especially useful for the analysis of complex mixtures of peptides and proteins. However, it will be appreciated that the methods and apparatus of the invention can equally well be applied with many other combinations of multidimensional analysis techniques, for example where both the first and second dimension columns are reverse phase columns on which different separations are carried out as a result of the use of different mobile phases and releasing phases, or combinations of normal-phase and reverse phase columns. Similarly, it is within the scope of the invention to use a capillary electrophoretic separation for at least one of separation dimensions, or other chromatographic techniques such as size exclusion chromatography or gel permeation chromatography.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In general terms the invention may be used with many other types of multidimensional analysis apparatus, particularly those in which sample components are temporarily stored between the first and second dimension separations. By incorporating calibration material in the releasing phases used to carry sample components from the trap to the second dimension analysis stage, the presence of calibration material in each batch of sample components undergoing a second dimension separation or analysis can be ensured. Use of the invention therefore overcomes the difficulty of quantitative calibration encountered in prior multidimensional analytical techniques wherein an internal standard added to a sample appears in only one or a few of the batches of sample components sent for second dimension analysis.</p>
