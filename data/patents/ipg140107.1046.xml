<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present development concerns a security system employed in point of sale merchandising.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In self service retail establishments, such as drug stores, grocery stores and the like, articles are usually displayed for sale on racks consisting of vertically spaced shelves on which the articles are arranged in rows. Although merchandise in such retail environments in accessible substantially only from the front, the shelves previously employed have permitted free access to the space above the merchandise held on each shelf. In this way, a person who wished to do so could very quickly and easily remove a large number of articles at one time. It is known for thieves to &#x201c;sweep&#x201d; a shelf with their arm, collecting the items into a purse, bag or coat very quickly and exit a store, without drawing attention to themselves. This is particularly a problem with high value goods, such as razor blades, pharmaceuticals, batteries, cigarettes, perfumes and the like. A thief could steal as much as several hundred dollars worth of merchandise with very little effort and without great risk of being detected. Similar theft problems exist for merchandise displayed on hooks mounted on pegboards or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There have been some attempts at minimizing such shoplifting losses by the expedient of partially blocking access to display shelves to prevent a mass removal of articles from the shelves, but, nevertheless, permitting removal of individual articles by a shopper.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One attempt to minimize pilferage of merchandise was by installing a transparent panel in front of each stocked shelf, but blocking access to all but a few of the articles on the shelf. However, if the panel is securely fixed in place on the rack or shelf, the panel also prevents or impedes a restocking of the shelves. Considering the value of a clerk's time, such a security system may cost more in terms of personnel time than the money it saves in reducing theft. On the other hand, if the panel is easily removed or readily moved out of the way, that is, if the manipulations needed for moving the panel out of the way are readily apparent from inspection, then the panel has little value as a security device. Another important consideration is that the security device should be inexpensive and be capable of quick and easy installation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One attempt to solve the theft problem has been the use of dispensing display cabinets which can be stocked through a lockable door at the rear of the cabinet. Such an arrangement, however, is unsuitable for the shelving commonly used in retail establishments, as well as for peg board displays similarly used in such establishments. Another attempt, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,807,779, employs a transparent front wall which leaves the bottom row of product exposed, together with a sliding door that has a pair of spaced access openings, each affording access to one row of product. While this is an adequate solution for the problem of theft, this design necessitates the provision of a separate size of display unit for each size of goods meant to be sold. For every type of merchandise having another shape or configuration, a different size of door and/or opening would be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another design employs a hood or cover which can be mounted above a row of product, so as to impede a thief's ability to grab more than one product at a time from a row of products. However, with this design, a separate such member is necessary for each row of product on each shelf. Moreover, the member is only engageable with a particular type of display unit, in this case, one mounted on a rectangular bar. Such a design is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,304.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Still another design employs a pair of retaining walls, wherein a first retaining wall is shorter in height than is a second retaining wall. This design, illustrated in U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0161420, is said to result in limiting access to product and inhibiting the removal of numerous products at one time. As with the previous design, however, this design necessitates the use of separate second barriers for each row of products and the second barriers may impede access to products more than customers are willing to put up with.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It would be desirable to provide a merchandise security system which will inhibit access to a shelf or pegboard display in such a way as to retard the ability of a thief to &#x201c;sweep&#x201d; the shelf or pegboard display. At the same time, the merchandise should be accessible to shoppers to allow the legitimate purchase of products. Also, the shelf or pegboard display needs to be accessible to store personnel to allow a restocking of merchandise in a row of the shelf or on a pegboard hook in a prompt and efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, there is a need for a new and improved shelf security device or system which overcomes certain difficulties with prior art designs, while providing better and more advantageous overall results.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, a merchandising system comprises a support adapted to be secured to a first associated merchandising structure and a tile mounted to said support. The tile extends away from the support so as to approach a second associated merchandising structure spaced from the first associated merchandising structure. The tile comprises a first portion, a second portion connected to the first portion and selectively slidable in relation to the first portion to change a size of the tile and a protrusion extending from the first portion. The protrusion is connected to the support to enable a movement of the tile in relation to the support, thereby allowing selective access to any desired portion of at least one of the first and second associated merchandising structures.</p>

<?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be understood that the description and drawings herein are merely illustrative and that various modifications and changes can be made in the structures disclosed, without departing from the present disclosure. It should also be appreciated that the various identified components of the merchandise security system discussed herein are merely terms of art and that these may vary from one manufacturer to another. Such terms should not be deemed to limit the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first embodiment of the disclosure includes a tile or a relatively thin, somewhat flat and wide, blocking member or shopper access retarding element A which is slidably supported in a mounting channel or rail B. The tile or blocking member is meant to retard access to merchandise held in a display until the tile is slid out of the way. A set of such tiles can be mounted in a row in front of a merchandise display member.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tile includes a body <b>10</b> comprising a front wall <b>12</b>, a top wall <b>14</b> and a connecting portion <b>16</b> extending therebetween. As is evident, the front wall <b>12</b> is oriented approximately transverse to the top wall <b>14</b>. In this embodiment, the connecting portion <b>16</b> serves to join the top wall <b>14</b> to the front wall <b>12</b>. It is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that the connecting portion <b>16</b> allows the front wall <b>12</b> to be displaced forwardly of the top wall <b>14</b>. With reference now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the front wall includes a lower section <b>20</b> defined by a pair of sidewalls <b>22</b> and a base wall or bottom edge <b>23</b>. It also includes an upper section <b>24</b>, which is wider than the lower section <b>20</b>. A pair of shoulders <b>26</b> are defined at the junction between the upper section <b>24</b> and the lower section <b>20</b>. The reason for this difference in width is for ease of handling by shoppers during movement of the tiles, as will be discussed in detail below. As is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the front wall <b>12</b> can be convex or somewhat curved, as identified by the numeral <b>28</b>. The purpose for curving the tile front wall is to improve its strength or stiffness during handling by shoppers. Of course, the front wall could be concave, as well as convex. Moreover, it could be flat.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, extending away from the top wall <b>14</b> is a tab <b>30</b>. The tab can be somewhat T-shaped and comprises a planar portion <b>32</b> and a stem <b>34</b> which connects the planar portion to the top wall <b>14</b>. As best seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a side wall <b>36</b> can extend between the top wall <b>14</b> and the connecting portion <b>16</b>. It should be evident from a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref> that a side wall <b>36</b> can be provided on both sides of the tile A. If desired, one or more indicia <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can be provided on the front wall <b>12</b>. The indicia may be used to illustrate the two directions in which the tile can be moved or slid in relation to the support rail B. The tile can be made from a suitable known plastic material, such as by injection molding. In one embodiment, the tile or blocking member is transparent so that items of merchandise held on a shelf behind it remain visible.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the support rail B can comprise a body <b>50</b> having a first side wall <b>52</b>, a second side wall <b>54</b> and a base wall <b>56</b> extending therebetween. The base wall can include a first slot <b>58</b> leading to a first channel <b>60</b> defined in the support rail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first slot <b>58</b> can extend longitudinally along the entire length of the support rail B, as can the first channel <b>60</b>. Of course, other designs can also be contemplated where the slot <b>58</b> and the channel <b>60</b> do not extend along the full length of the support rail B. If desired, the bottom wall can be provided with a flange <b>62</b>. Also provided is a top wall <b>64</b> which extends between the pair of side walls <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. A second slot <b>68</b> can extend longitudinally in the top wall <b>64</b>. The second slot can lead to a second channel <b>70</b>, as well as a third channel <b>72</b> defined in the support rail B. The third channel <b>72</b> is separated from the second channel <b>70</b> by a pair of longitudinally extending shoulders <b>74</b>. As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the third channel is disposed directly beneath the second channel. The two channels can extend longitudinally along the full length of the support rail B, if so desired. It should also be apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> that the first and second flanges <b>62</b> and <b>66</b> are disposed on opposed corners of the support rail B. Of course, other designs are also contemplated. The rail can be made of a known suitable plastic, such as a thermoplastic extrusion, or metal, such as an aluminum extrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the tab <b>30</b> of the tile A is shown in the process of being slid into the first channel <b>60</b> of the support rail B. In turn, the support rail is shown as being located beneath a merchandising structure or display member. In this embodiment, the merchandising structure is shown in the form of a shelf C. Of course, other types of known merchandising structures or display members are also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a fastener <b>80</b> is employed in order to secure the support rail B to the shelf C. To this end, the fastener <b>80</b> comprises a head <b>82</b> and a stem <b>84</b> extending therefrom. A suitable conventional threading <b>86</b> can be provided on the stem. The stem of the fastener can cooperate with a nut <b>88</b> which includes a threaded aperture <b>90</b> through which the stem <b>84</b> of the fastener can extend. The nut <b>88</b> is so designed that it can be slid into the second channel <b>70</b> of the support body <b>50</b>. In order to more easily locate the nut <b>88</b> in relation to a set of apertures <b>100</b> extending through a shelf top surface <b>101</b>, there is provided a locating stem <b>102</b> on the nut <b>88</b>. The locating stem is so positioned on the nut <b>88</b>, in relation to the aperture <b>90</b>, as to match the distance between adjacent apertures <b>100</b> on the shelf <b>101</b>. Thus, when the stem <b>102</b> extends through one aperture <b>100</b>, the aperture <b>90</b> of the nut <b>88</b> is aligned with another aperture <b>100</b> of the shelf C. In this way, the fastener <b>80</b> can be more easily secured to the nut <b>88</b>. The portion of the fastener stem <b>84</b> located beneath the nut <b>88</b> extends into the third channel <b>72</b> of the body <b>50</b>. It should be recognized that the shape of the nut <b>88</b> can be altered as may be desirable. Generally, the physical construction of the nut should be such as to allow it to cooperate with the slot formed in the support rail. It should also be recognized that other known connecting arrangements could be employed to secure the support rail B to the shelf C.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the fastener <b>80</b> extends through an aperture <b>100</b> defined in a shelf top surface <b>101</b>. Many conventional shelves have an array of such apertures <b>100</b> located at regular intervals, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. As the head of the fastener abuts the shelf top surface and the fastener is further rotated, the nut <b>88</b> is pulled up against the support rail top wall <b>64</b>. This in turn pulls the support rail up against a bottom surface of the shelf C, thus securing the support rail in place. Once the support rail B has been fastened to the shelf C, the locating stem <b>102</b> can be detached from the nut and removed, as shown. In other words, the major purpose for the locating stem in this embodiment is to serve as a locating means for the nut and the fastener. Of course, other means for securing the rail B to the shelf C are also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While only one fastener is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it should be appreciated that any suitable number of such fasteners can be employed in order to securely mount the support rail B in place on the shelf C. It is contemplated that at least several such fasteners would be employed in order to mount the support rail B to the shelf C. In one embodiment, the tiles A can be premounted on the support rail B before the support rail is fastened to the shelf C, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Alternatively, the tiles could perhaps be mounted to the support rail after it is secured in place. In either case, the tiles A are thus secured in place beneath the shelf C. It is noted that a front wall <b>104</b> of the shelf C extends downwardly by a distance which is smaller than the combined height of the support rail B and the tile connecting portion <b>16</b>. As a result, the tile front wall <b>12</b> can extend forwardly of the shelf front wall <b>104</b>, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, merchandise <b>110</b> is normally supported on a shelf. Many times a front fence <b>112</b> is employed on the shelf to prevent the merchandise from falling off the front of the shelf. Often, the merchandise is separated into columns (sometimes inaccurately termed rows) by a plurality of dividers <b>114</b>. As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, tracks <b>116</b> are often provided between the dividers <b>114</b>. Flat coil springs <b>118</b> can be employed to bias pushers (not visible) to urge the merchandise toward the front fence <b>112</b>. With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, it should be evident that a slot <b>120</b> is defined between adjacent side edges <b>22</b> of two adjacent tiles A. Such slot enables a customer to place his or her fingers between the tiles in order to move or slide the tiles sideways so as to obtain access to a desired column <b>124</b> of merchandise. As mentioned, the tiles can be transparent in order to allow a customer to see what columns of merchandise are displayed behind the security tiles or blocking members.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in this manner, a customer can grasp an item of merchandise <b>126</b> and remove it from the shelf. However, adjacent columns of merchandise are generally blocked by adjacent tiles. In other words, one less tile is provided than the total number of columns of merchandise on the shelf so that only a single column of merchandise is generally accessible for withdrawal of items. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which, at most, two relatively narrow columns of merchandise adjacent each other are accessible. But other columns of merchandise cannot be reached, because of the sliding tiles in front of them. Of course, it should be recognized that the width of the merchandise being held on the shelves and the width of the tiles mounted in front of the merchandise held on the shelves will control the number of columns of merchandise which are accessible with any given design of the shelf security system disclosed herein. The tiles A can be made in any desired height, in order to accommodate the vertical spacing between adjacent shelves. That spacing is usually dictated by the height of the merchandise being displayed on the shelves. Similarly, the tiles can be made in any desired width, as may be dictated by the width of the merchandise meant to be protected from pilferage.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It should be appreciated that the tiles A cooperate with the front fence <b>112</b> to retard access to merchandise held on a shelf C. In other words, the bottom edge <b>23</b> of the tile front wall <b>12</b> does not need to approach the top wall of the subjacent shelf because the front fence retards access to a lower section of the merchandise being held on the subjacent shelf. In one embodiment, the tile front wall bottom edge <b>23</b> overlaps a top edge of the front fence <b>112</b> to completely prevent access to the merchandise, except in the narrow vertically extending slot between the tiles. In another embodiment, the bottom edge <b>23</b> only approaches the top edge of the fence <b>112</b>. Even so, removal of the merchandise <b>126</b> is prevented by the positioning of the tiles A above the front fence <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, the tiles A are positioned such that the tile front wall <b>12</b> is located forwardly of the fence <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, another embodiment of a sliding tile security system is there shown. In this design, the sliding tile security system includes a rail <b>150</b> and a tile or blocking member <b>152</b> which is slidably mounted to the rail. In this embodiment, the rail includes an elongated member <b>154</b> on which are defined a plurality of serrations or teeth <b>156</b>. These are engaged by a resilient finger <b>160</b> which is supported by a pin <b>162</b>. The pin itself can be mounted to the tile <b>152</b> and extend rearwardly therefrom. The reason why the finger <b>160</b> engages the serrations <b>156</b> is to provide an audible signal when the tile <b>152</b> is moved in relation to the rail <b>150</b>. In other words, both the shopper and the merchant will hear any sliding movement of the tile <b>152</b> in relation to the rail <b>150</b>. For some merchants, this may prove useful in alerting them to shopping activity concerning a particularly valuable product or merchandise which is being retailed behind the security system discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref>, another embodiment of the present disclosure is there illustrated. In this embodiment, there is provided a plurality of tiles E and a mounting rail or channel F. Each tile E includes a tile body <b>210</b> which comprises a front wall <b>212</b> and a top wall <b>214</b>, which is oriented approximately perpendicular thereto. Extending upwardly from the top wall is a first connecting arm <b>216</b> having a sidewardly extending flange <b>218</b> and a second connecting arm <b>220</b> having a sidewardly extending flange <b>222</b>. In the design illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, three such connecting arms are illustrated. Two of the arms can be oriented rearwardly, such that the respective flanges <b>218</b> protrude rearwardly. However, the third connecting arm can face forwardly and can be positioned between the two rearwardly facing connecting arms. Also extending from the top wall <b>214</b> can be a pair of hook shaped extensions <b>224</b>. In this embodiment, the tiles each include a first side wall <b>228</b> with a cut out <b>230</b> and a second side wall <b>232</b> with a cut out <b>234</b>. The cut outs provide finger access to shoppers, allowing them to slide the tiles.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The second embodiment of the disclosure also includes a pair of adjacent shelves G. As with the first embodiment, a front fence <b>242</b> can be provided at the front edge of the shelf G in order to retard the possibility that merchandise will fall off the front of the shelf. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, two adjacent, vertically spaced, such shelves G are illustrated. It is noted that the tile front walls <b>212</b> are positioned in front of the front fence <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The tiles E are meant to slide in relation to the support rail F. In this embodiment, the rail or track F can be made of extruded aluminum. The support rail includes a body <b>250</b> comprising a bottom wall <b>256</b>. A slot <b>258</b> is defined in the bottom wall. The respective flanges <b>218</b> and <b>222</b> of the connecting arms <b>216</b> and <b>220</b> are meant to be accommodated in the slot <b>258</b> so as to allow a sideward sliding motion of the tiles E with respect to the support rail F. More particularly, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the connecting arm extends into a longitudinally extending channel <b>260</b> which is defined in the support rail F and communicates with the slot <b>258</b>. As will be appreciated, the channel will accommodate the respective flanges <b>218</b> and <b>222</b>. Due to the resilient nature of the thermoplastic material from which the tiles E can be made, the connecting arms <b>216</b> and <b>220</b> can flex so that the tiles can be snapped into the rail F. Thus, the tiles can be mounted to the rail after the rail is mounted to a shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The support rail body <b>250</b> can include rear and front flanges <b>262</b> and <b>264</b> disposed on either side of the slot <b>258</b>. The rear flange <b>262</b> cooperates with the hook shaped extension <b>224</b> of the tile. Such cooperation enables the tile E to be mounted to the support rail F in a sturdy fashion, thereby reducing the chance of the tile wobbling in relation to the support rail during use. To enable a customer to slide the tiles sidewards as desired, a customer can place a finger between two adjacent tiles via the cooperating cut outs <b>230</b> and <b>234</b>, as is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In this embodiment, the front wall <b>212</b> of the sliding tiles extend in front of the front fence <b>242</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the sliding tiles are meant to cover all but one section of a shelf in order to minimize access to all but one of the several columns of products being held on the shelf. However, by sliding the tiles sideways, any desired section of the shelf, and the set of products being held thereon, is accessible to a potential customer.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref>, a third embodiment of the disclosure is there illustrated. In this embodiment, suitable tiles I are mounted to a pair of shelves J and K via respective support rails L and M. In this embodiment, two such support rails are provided, located at the top and bottom edges of a shelf space. Therefore, in this embodiment, the tiles have suitable cooperating upper and lower connecting elements (not visible) that enable each tile I to be slid sideways in relation to the shelves J and K, on lower and upper support rails L and M. The tiles I each include a body <b>270</b> having a front wall <b>272</b>. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the tile also includes a first side wall <b>274</b> with a cut out <b>276</b> and a similar second side wall and cut out. As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, enough tiles are mounted across the front of each shelf so as to provide a single access opening <b>280</b> through which a product <b>282</b> can be retrieved by a customer. As the tiles are slid sideways, the access opening can move across the full width of the shelf. Also in this embodiment, suitable end closure panels <b>286</b> are provided in order to forestall access to the contents on the shelf from the sides thereof. Closing the two ends or side edges of the shelf also makes difficult the removal of the support rails by unauthorized personnel. As in the previous embodiments, a suitable front fence (not shown) can be employed to prevent the merchandise being held on the shelf from falling off the front edge of the shelf when the access opening <b>280</b> is disposed before a desired column <b>290</b> of products <b>282</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this embodiment, a locking tile <b>300</b> can be installed on the security system in order to close the access opening <b>280</b> and prevent any access to a shelf of merchandise at night, or when the store is closed. The locking tile <b>300</b> can employ a keyed lock <b>302</b> in order to selectively secure the locking tile in place over the access opening <b>280</b> defined between a pair of spaced tiles. Of course, such keyed locks are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-22</figref>, a further embodiment of a merchandise security system is there illustrated. In this embodiment, a connector construction in the form of one or more slide snap modules <b>602</b> is mounted to an extrusion or rail <b>604</b> in any conventional manner. These are fastened to an underside of a shelf <b>605</b> via suitable fasteners (not shown). Tiles <b>608</b> are mounted to the rail <b>604</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, due to the presence of the side snap modules <b>602</b>, the entire rail <b>604</b> can be pivoted forwardly out of the way in order to allow restocking of the shelf being protected by the tiles. In normal use, the tiles can be slid sideways in order to obtain access to products held on the shelf. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, it can be seen that the rail <b>604</b> can pivot in relation to the slide snap modules <b>602</b>. This can occur when a channel <b>610</b> of the module <b>602</b> no longer holds a flange <b>612</b> of the rail <b>604</b>. In order to unlock the rail <b>604</b>, an arm <b>614</b> of the module <b>602</b> is pulled rearwardly. Due to the resilient nature of the material from which the connector or module <b>602</b> is made, it can be pulled rearwardly so as to free the flange <b>612</b> from the channel <b>610</b>. At this point, the rail <b>604</b> can pivot in relation to the module <b>602</b> around a hinge joint <b>620</b> defined between them. Subsequently, the rail <b>604</b> can again be locked to the module <b>602</b> in a use position via the cooperation of the flange <b>612</b> with the channel <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a still further embodiment of a sliding tile security system is there shown. This system is adapted for use on peg boards such as at <b>700</b>. A mounting system <b>702</b> for the sliding tiles includes a front rail or support section <b>704</b>, as well as telescoping side sections <b>706</b> and respective connector elements <b>708</b>. The connector elements <b>708</b> enable the mounting system <b>702</b> to be connected to risers <b>710</b> located on either side of the peg board <b>700</b>. As in the earlier embodiments, the tiles are slid sideways in order to allow access to a column (sometimes called row) of product <b>712</b> being held on a mounting hook <b>714</b>, which is selectively secured to the peg board <b>700</b>. With telescoping side sections <b>706</b>, the front rail can be positioned as desired so that the tiles are located in front of the merchandise <b>712</b> held by the hooks <b>714</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, still another embodiment of the present disclosure is there illustrated. In this embodiment, a rail <b>800</b> has slidably mounted thereto a tile <b>802</b>. The tile <b>802</b> comprises a first section <b>804</b> which can be substantially vertically oriented in one end position and a second section <b>806</b> which is approximately horizontally oriented. These two sections are connected by a hinge <b>808</b>. The tile first section <b>804</b> can thus be rotated in relation to the tile second section <b>806</b>. More particularly, the tile first section <b>804</b> can be rotated forwardly or clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> in relation to the tile second section <b>806</b>, as shown by the arrow. The purpose for such rotation is to allow access to products being held in a merchandise display behind the tile. It should be noted that while the tile can be rotated forward or clockwise, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, it cannot be rotated backward. To prevent such counterclockwise or backwards rotation, a blocking arm <b>810</b> extends from a rear surface of the tile first section <b>804</b>. The blocking arm <b>810</b> abuts a bottom surface <b>812</b> of the tile second section <b>806</b> to prevent a rearward rotation of the tile first section <b>804</b>. As in the previous embodiments, the tile <b>802</b> is slidable in relation to the rail <b>800</b> via cooperating elements engaging the two.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, an inverted tile rail design is there illustrated. In this design, a rail <b>902</b> is connected to a shelf. Extending upwardly from the rail are a plurality of slidable tiles <b>904</b>. More particularly, the rail <b>902</b> is mounted to a lower shelf <b>906</b> and the tiles <b>904</b> extend upwardly towards an upper shelf <b>908</b>. With reference now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the tiles <b>904</b> each include a front wall <b>912</b> and a foot <b>914</b>, angled in relation to a plane of the front wall. Extending away from the foot <b>914</b> is a top flange <b>916</b> and a bottom flange <b>918</b>, spaced therefrom. These two define between them a longitudinally extending slot <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The mounting rail <b>902</b> includes a front wall <b>940</b>. Extending rearwardly from a rear face of the front wall <b>940</b> is a T-shaped protrusion <b>942</b>. It is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> that the protrusion of the rail is accommodated in the slot <b>920</b> of the tile so as to interconnect these two elements. In this way, the tiles <b>904</b> can slide in relation to the rail <b>902</b> in a sideward manner so as to selectively expose a desired column of merchandise being held on the lower shelf <b>906</b>. The rail <b>902</b> also includes a base wall <b>944</b>, which is connected to the front wall <b>940</b>. The base wall, in turn, is connected to a clip portion <b>946</b> of the rail <b>902</b>. The clip portion includes a front leg <b>952</b>, a rear leg <b>954</b> and a connecting leg <b>956</b>. Also provided is a flange <b>958</b>. The clip enables the rail <b>902</b> to be selectively mounted to the lower shelf <b>906</b>. More particularly, the lower shelf <b>906</b> includes a top wall <b>960</b> and a front wall <b>962</b>. The clip front leg <b>952</b> contacts the shelf front wall <b>962</b>. The flange <b>958</b> of the clip contacts a bottom surface of the shelf top wall <b>960</b> in order to stabilize the rail in relation to the shelf and resiliently mount the rail securely to the shelf. In one embodiment, the rail <b>902</b> can be made from a suitable thermoplastic material. Alternatively, it could be made from metal.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, a shelf management system can be mounted on the lower shelf <b>906</b>. The shelf management system can include a front fence <b>970</b> which is suitably secured to the shelf top surface <b>960</b>, as is known in the art. The shelf management system also includes one or more dividers <b>972</b> and one or more tracks <b>974</b>. These can be suitably secured to the shelf <b>906</b> either via the front fence or directly. Each track can accommodate a pusher <b>976</b> which is slidably mounted thereon. Urging the pusher forwardly on its track is a conventional coil spring <b>978</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, disclosed therein is another embodiment of a rail for mounting one or more sliding tiles to a shelf. In the embodiment disclosed, a rail <b>1002</b> accommodates on one face thereof an adhesive strip <b>1004</b>. It should be apparent that the adhesive strip <b>1004</b> can extend the entire length of the rail <b>1002</b>. The adhesive strip has a first or upper adhesive face <b>1006</b> which is meant to be adhered to a suitable surface on a conventional shelf (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>). The adhesive strip also includes a second adhesive face <b>1008</b> which is secured to one face of the rail <b>1002</b>. As in the earlier designs, the rail <b>1002</b> includes a longitudinally extending slot <b>1010</b> which leads to a channel <b>1012</b>. The channel is adapted to accommodate a cooperating protrusion of a suitable sliding tile. It should be appreciated that the adhesive face <b>1006</b> can be secured beneath a shelf so as to be adhered to a lower face of an upper shelf with tiles depending therefrom towards a lower shelf. Alternatively, the adhesive face <b>1006</b> can be secured to a vertically extending front face of a shelf with suitable tiles mounted thereto. As another alternative, the rail can be secured to a top face of a shelf with the tiles extending upwardly therefrom. In such a design, the rail <b>1002</b> could serve somewhat as a front fence for items which are being retailed on the shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, a still further embodiment of a rail is there illustrated. In this embodiment, a rail <b>1102</b> includes a front wall <b>1104</b>, a top wall <b>1106</b> and a bottom wall <b>1108</b>. Extending rearwardly from the top wall <b>1106</b> is a first clip <b>1112</b>. Extending rearwardly from the bottom wall <b>1108</b> is a second clip <b>1114</b>. The two clips are meant to accommodate suitable wires <b>1116</b> and <b>1118</b> of a wire rack type display system, which is known in the merchandising art.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Extending forwardly from the top wall <b>1106</b> is an upper T-shaped protrusion <b>1130</b>. Extending forwardly from the front wall <b>1104</b> is a lower T-shaped protrusion <b>1132</b>. The two protrusions define between them, a slot <b>1134</b> and a channel <b>1136</b>. Mounted to the rail <b>1102</b> is a tile <b>1140</b>. The tile includes a front wall <b>1142</b> and, extending rearwardly therefrom, a tab <b>1144</b>. The tab includes a stem <b>1146</b> and a planar portion <b>1148</b>. The stem protrudes through the slot <b>1134</b> of the rail <b>1102</b> and the planar portion <b>1148</b> is accommodated in the channel <b>1136</b> of the rail. With this design, the tile <b>1140</b> can slide laterally in relation to the rail <b>1102</b> so as to selectively make accessible any column of merchandise being retailed in the wire rack display of the merchant, by a suitable sliding motion of the tile in relation to the retail display.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, disclosed therein is a sliding tile security system comprising one or more tiles <b>1200</b> slidably mounted to a rail <b>1202</b>. A connecting element <b>1204</b> mounts the rail to a shelf <b>1206</b>. More particularly, the connecting element comprises a first section <b>1210</b> and a second section <b>1212</b> which are pivotally mounted to each other via a suitable hinge, such as a piano hinge <b>1214</b>. The first mounting section <b>1210</b> is secured via a threaded fastener <b>1220</b> to the shelf <b>1206</b>. Suitable apertures <b>1222</b> are provided on the shelf for this purpose. The rail <b>1202</b> is secured to the second section <b>1212</b> of the connecting element <b>1204</b> via one or more fasteners <b>1240</b> which can have a threaded stem as at <b>1242</b>. Each fastener <b>1240</b> can cooperate with a nut <b>1250</b> that is slid into a longitudinally extending slot <b>1252</b> defined in the rail <b>1202</b>. A threaded aperture <b>1262</b> can extend through the nut <b>1250</b>. In order to hold the rail <b>1202</b> in a use position, the rail can be provided with a flange <b>1264</b> which can cooperate with a flange <b>1266</b> of the first mounting member <b>1210</b> in a friction fit type arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Another embodiment for selectively securing a rail in an operative position in relation to a shelf is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. It can there be seen that a rail <b>1202</b>&#x2032; is mounted to a shelf <b>1206</b>&#x2032; via a connecting element <b>1204</b>&#x2032;. In this embodiment, the connecting element comprises a first section <b>1260</b> and a second section <b>1262</b>. As in the earlier embodiment, the two sections are connected via a piano hinge <b>1214</b>&#x2032; or the like. Also illustrated is a first fastener <b>1220</b>&#x2032; extending through an aperture <b>1222</b>&#x2032; in the shelf <b>1206</b>&#x2032; and an aligned threaded aperture <b>1230</b>&#x2032; provided in the first member <b>1260</b>. If desired, an aligned opening <b>1232</b>&#x2032; can be provided in the second element <b>1262</b> in order to accommodate a distal end of the fastener <b>1220</b>&#x2032;. In this embodiment, the second member <b>1262</b> is provided with a flange <b>1270</b>, as well as an actuating arm <b>1272</b>. The flange <b>1270</b> cooperates with an L-shaped extension <b>1274</b> of the connecting element first section <b>1260</b> so as to selectively lock the two members <b>1260</b> and <b>1262</b> to each other. However, by suitable actuation of the arm <b>1272</b>, the flange <b>1270</b> can be moved in relation to the L-shaped member <b>1274</b> so as to allow the hinge <b>1214</b>&#x2032; to pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A further embodiment of a locking feature is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. In this embodiment, a connecting member <b>1204</b>&#x2033; includes a first section <b>1280</b> and cooperating therewith a second section <b>1282</b>. The two sections are connected by a hinge <b>1214</b>&#x2033;. The second section is provided with an arm <b>1290</b>. Also provided is a sliding lock <b>1300</b>, which can be slidably mounted to the first section <b>1280</b>. This lock includes a first wall <b>1302</b> which is provided with a finger access tab <b>1304</b> for manual actuation. Depending from the first wall <b>1302</b> is a second wall <b>1310</b>. The second wall includes a flange <b>1312</b>. The arm <b>1290</b> cooperates with the flange <b>1312</b> in a first end position of the sliding lock. However, as shown by the arrow <b>1314</b>, a retraction of the sliding lock <b>1300</b> will enable the rail <b>1202</b>&#x2033; to pivot away from its use position, as illustrated by arrow <b>1316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, another locking member is there illustrated for filling a gap or opening between two adjacent tiles. Such a locking member may be necessary when the merchant is closed in order to forestall any access to articles held on a shelf. In this design, there is provided a sliding tile lock <b>1400</b> positioned in an opening defined between a pair of adjacent tiles <b>1402</b> and <b>1404</b>. The tiles can be supported by a rail <b>1406</b> attached to an upper shelf <b>1408</b> positioned above a lower shelf <b>1410</b>. Both shelves can be provided with a conventional front fence <b>1412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the sliding tile lock <b>1400</b> can include a first section <b>1420</b> and a second section <b>1422</b>. These two sections can be mounted together via suitable hinges <b>1424</b>. Rotatably mounted to the first section is a lock <b>1430</b>. The lock <b>1430</b> includes a distal arm <b>1432</b> which extends transversely to an axis of the lock. The distal arm cooperates with a raised portion <b>1434</b> of the lock second section <b>1422</b>. Provided adjacent the section <b>1434</b> is a slot <b>1436</b> to accommodate the arm <b>1432</b> of the lock when it is in the unlocked position. As can be seen, the arm can rotate 90 degrees from the locked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> to the unlocked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The second section <b>1422</b> can comprise a central portion <b>1440</b> delineated by respective channels <b>1442</b> from respective wings <b>1444</b>. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the first section <b>1420</b> includes a central portion <b>1450</b> and a pair of shoulders <b>1452</b> which are accommodated in the grooves <b>1442</b> of the second section. Also provided are a pair of wings <b>1454</b> which cooperate with the wings <b>1444</b> of the second section. The wings cooperate in order to trap between them the adjacent side portions of a pair of tiles, such as the tiles <b>1402</b> and <b>1404</b>. With such a lock, the tiles are unable to move, since the opening between them has now been filled by the tile lock.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, there is disclosed a yet further embodiment of a tile according to the present disclosure. In this embodiment, the tile includes a body <b>1510</b> which comprises a front wall first section <b>1512</b> and a front wall second section <b>1514</b>. Defined in the front wall first section <b>1512</b> is a first slot <b>1516</b>. In this embodiment, the first slot extends along a generally vertical axis of the tile. However, other embodiments are also contemplated. Cross slots <b>1518</b> are provided at spaced intervals along the first slot <b>1516</b>. A thumb slide <b>1520</b> or protrusion extends through the first slot <b>1516</b>. The protrusion is connected to the front wall second section <b>1514</b>. In this way, the tile second section is allowed to move in relation to the first section <b>1512</b>, as by sliding in relation thereto. Thus, a telescoping tile or barrier design is disclosed. The cross slots define stops for the thumb slide, and hence the front wall second section in relation to the first section. Thus, the tile second section <b>1514</b> can be locked in one of several defined positions in relation to the tile first section <b>1512</b>. In this embodiment, the first and second sections <b>1512</b> and <b>1514</b> are of generally the same width. They can also be of generally the same height. However, it should be appreciated that other size relationships are also contemplated. In other words, the tile first and second sections can be of different sizes and shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The front wall first section also includes a pair of opposed side walls. Disposed in at least one of those side walls is a second slot <b>1522</b>. Extending into the second slot is a wing <b>1524</b> which is connected to the front wall second section <b>1514</b>. In this way, the front wall second section is retarded from falling away from the front wall first section <b>1512</b>. Due to the presence of the second section, the tile or blocking member or shopper access retarding element can be selectively enlarged or reduced in size. Altering or changing the size of the tile may be necessary to accommodate, or better fit the file to a given size of the particular item of merchandise being vended.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, disclosed therein is a tile comprising a body <b>1550</b> which includes a front wall first section <b>1552</b> and a front wall second section <b>1554</b>. In this embodiment, the front wall second section <b>1554</b> is mounted in a slot <b>1558</b> located in the front wall first section. It should be noted that the tile front wall <b>1552</b> has a given thickness so as to enable the slot <b>1558</b> to be located or defined therein. The second section <b>1554</b>, which can be of any desired size, can move sideways, or at an angle generally perpendicular to, a longitudinal axis of the tile first section. In this way, the width of the front wall can be changed as may be necessary to fit the tile to wider products being vended on a shelf. As with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the tile second section <b>1554</b> can be locked in one of several positions in relation to the tile first section <b>1552</b> via a known lock mechanism. The tile <b>1550</b> also includes a top wall <b>1560</b> and a connecting portion <b>1662</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>, there have been disclosed tiles which are changeable in length or width so as to allow the tiles to be sized for a particular type of merchandise which is being sold by a merchant. It should be appreciated that a tile which is changeable in both height and width is also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">One advantage of a tile having overlapping first and second sections is that the tile can be made stiffer due to the presence of overlapping layers of material. Providing a stiffer tile or barrier member is desirable to deter efforts by potential thieves to twist the tile out of the way in order to obtain access to merchandise being vended or offered for sale.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, there is provided a tile having a body <b>1570</b> with a front wall <b>1572</b>, a top wall <b>1574</b> and a connecting portion <b>1576</b>. In this embodiment, the tile includes a lock element <b>1580</b> which may be rotatable in relation to the front wall. The lock serves to selectively secure the tile against movement as by cooperating with the mounting rail of the tile or by cooperating with the shelf from which the tile is suspended. In this connection, it is noted that various lock designs have been disclosed in several earlier embodiments of the instant disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40-42</figref>, disclosed are a variety of tiles which include one or more cut out sections or slots. These designs are useful for reducing the weight of the tile and, hence, the cost of material for forming the tile. Such weight reduction needs to be balanced against the strength considerations necessary for the tile so as to retard a potential thief from breaking the tile or bending it or twisting it out of the way so as to obtain access to merchandise held on a shelf which is being protected by the tile.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">To this end, the tile can be made of a generally stiff thermoplastic material. In addition, if needed, strengthening ribs, flanges or the like can be provided for the tile in order to make it more difficult for a potential thief to bend or break the tile.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">More particularly, and with reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, there is provided a tile including body <b>1600</b> having a front wall <b>1602</b> and a slot or opening <b>1604</b> defined in the front wall. Note that in order to give the tile some additional strength, a flange <b>1606</b> extends rearwardly from the tile along a distal end thereof. Similarly, sidewalls or flanges <b>1608</b> can extend rearwardly from both side edges of the front wall <b>1602</b>. Flanges or ribs can also extend at other locations in order to stiffen the tile.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> discloses a design including a tile comprising a body <b>1620</b> and including a front wall <b>1622</b>. In this embodiment, several spaced slots <b>1624</b> are defined in the tile front wall <b>1622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, a tile includes a body <b>1630</b> comprising a front wall <b>1632</b>. An opening <b>1634</b> is defined in the front wall. Needless to say, the opening can have any desired size and configuration or shape so as to fulfill the goals of weight reduction for the tile while providing adequate strength or stiffness for the tile.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, there is provided a tile comprising a body <b>1650</b> and including a front wall <b>1652</b>. The front wall includes two side edges <b>1654</b> and <b>1656</b>. In this embodiment, recesses <b>1658</b> and <b>1660</b> or finger grips can be provided along one or both sides of the front wall. Such finger grips may be advantageous in order to enable a customer to more easily move the tile, as is required in order to access a particular column of merchandise in front of which the tile is located.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> of the instant application discloses a tile comprising a body <b>1680</b>, including a front wall <b>1682</b>. The front wall comprises a pair of side edges <b>1684</b> and <b>1686</b>. Extending radially away from the side edges are respective wings <b>1688</b> and <b>1690</b>. The wings can be of any desired shape. In the embodiment disclosed, the wings have a wider center portion and narrower end portions.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">It should be appreciated that the wings can be slidable in relation to the front wall <b>1682</b>, as with the embodiment disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, wherein the front wall second section moves or slides in relation to the front wall first section. Thus, it is contemplated that a movement mechanism can be mounted to a rear face of the front wall <b>1682</b> so as to selectively allow a generally sideways movement of the two wings <b>1688</b> and <b>1690</b> in relation to the front wall. A lock assembly can also be provided in order to lock the wings at a desired setting. Thus, the tile can include a pair of opposed movable wings so that a width of the tile can be adjusted as needed in order to change a size of the tile to match a size of the merchandise in from of which the tile is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The present disclosure has been described with reference to several embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon the reading and understanding of the preceding detailed description. It is intended that the present invention be construed as including all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
