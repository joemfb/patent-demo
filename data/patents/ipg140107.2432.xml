<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A laser induced thermal imaging apparatus and a fabricating method of organic light emitting diodes using the same, which laminate an acceptor substrate and a donor film using a magnetic force in vacuum, and are used to form a pixel array on the acceptor substrate. A substrate stage includes a magnet or magnetic substance. The acceptor substrate has a pixel region for forming first, second, and third sub-pixels, and the donor film has an organic light emission layer to be transferred to the pixel region. A laser oscillator irradiates a laser to the donor film. A contact frame is adapted to be disposed between the substrate stage and the laser oscillator, and is used to form a magnetic force with the substrate stage. The contact frame includes an opening through which the laser passes. A contact frame feed mechanism moves the contact frame in a direction of the substrate stage.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a laser induced thermal imaging apparatus and a fabricating method of an organic light emitting diode using the same, and more particularly to a laser induced thermal imaging apparatus and a fabricating method of an organic light emitting diode using the same, which laminate a donor film and an acceptor substrate using magnetic force.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An organic light emitting device includes a light emitting layer formed between the first and second electrodes, and emits light when a voltage is applied between the electrodes. A laser induced thermal imaging (LITI) process may be used to fabricated the organic light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, at least a laser, an acceptor substrate and a donor substrate (or donor film) are needed for the laser induced thermal imaging. In a laser induced thermal imaging method, the laser is radiated to a donor substrate including a base substrate, a light-to-heat conversion layer (LTHC) and a transfer layer (or imaging layer) to convert the laser that passes through the base substrate into heat at the light-to-heat conversion layer, such that the light-to-heat conversion layer is deformed and expanded. This way, the transfer layer adjacent to the light-to-heat conversion layer is also deformed and expanded, and transferred to (or imaged on) the acceptor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When performing the laser induced thermal imaging method, a chamber in which the transfer is performed typically becomes a vacuum state. However, in the prior art, there has been a problem in that the transfer layer is not transferred well because space (or a gap) or impurities are created between the donor substrate and the accepter substrate when a laser-to-heat conversion is performed in the vacuum state. Therefore, in the laser induced thermal imaging method, a method of laminating the donor and accepter substrates is important, and to resolve the problems with the space or the impurities, various methods have been investigated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view that shows a prior art laser induced thermal imaging apparatus <b>10</b> for resolving the above-mentioned problem. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the laser induced thermal imaging apparatus <b>10</b> includes a substrate stage <b>12</b> placed in a chamber <b>11</b> and a laser radiating apparatus <b>13</b> placed at an upper portion of the chamber <b>11</b>. The substrate stage <b>12</b> is a stage for placing an accepter substrate <b>14</b> and a donor film <b>15</b> introduced in the chamber <b>11</b> in turn.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The acceptor substrate <b>14</b> and the donor film <b>15</b> are laminated to each other prior to transferring the transfer layer of the donor film <b>15</b> to the acceptor substrate <b>14</b>. During lamination, the chamber <b>11</b> is typically not maintained in the vacuum state, but a vacuum pump P is used to absorb impurities. Since the chamber is not in a vacuum state during lamination, the reliability or the lifetime of the resulting organic light emitting device can be reduced because of oxygen, moisture, or the like in the chamber <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the other hand, when the chamber <b>11</b> is maintained in the vacuum state during lamination, it is difficult to absolutely prevent creation of impurities <b>1</b> and space between the accepter substrate <b>14</b> and the donor film <b>15</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Here, when one element is described as being connected to another element, that element may be directly connected to another element or indirectly connected to another element via a third element. Further, some of the parts that are not essential to the complete understanding of the invention have been omitted for clarity. Also, like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view showing an embodiment of a laser induced thermal imaging apparatus according to the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the laser induced thermal imaging apparatus <b>100</b> includes a substrate stage <b>110</b>, a laser oscillator <b>120</b>, a contact frame <b>130</b>, a contact frame feed mechanism <b>140</b>, and a chamber <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">First, a chamber for the laser induced thermal imaging apparatus <b>100</b> may be used as the chamber <b>150</b>. The substrate stage <b>110</b> and the contact frame <b>130</b> are mounted inside the chamber <b>150</b>. A donor film <b>200</b> and an acceptor substrate <b>300</b> are fed into the chamber <b>150</b>. For this, a feed mechanism (not shown) for feeding the donor film <b>200</b> and the acceptor substrate <b>300</b> into the chamber <b>150</b> is disposed outside the chamber <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The acceptor substrate <b>300</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention has a pixel definition region (or pixel region) in which first, second, and third sub-pixels are formed in a stripe pattern, the donor film <b>200</b> includes a transfer layer (or imaging layer) for transferring an organic light emitting layer to the pixel defining region of the acceptor substrate <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The substrate stage <b>110</b> is disposed at or near a lower surface of the chamber <b>150</b>. In the described embodiment of the present invention, the substrate stage <b>110</b> is provided with at least one electromagnet (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). However, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a permanent magnet or magnetic substance may be used instead of or in addition to the electromagnet without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The electromagnet included in the substrate stage <b>110</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are plan views respectively showing that electromagnets <b>113</b> are concentrically formed or formed in a plurality of lines in the substrate stage <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, when the electromagnets <b>113</b> of the substrate stage <b>110</b> are concentrically disposed, power is first applied to first electromagnets <b>113</b> that define an innermost concentric circle <b>115</b>. In this state, a power is applied to second electromagnets <b>113</b> that define a second inner concentric circle <b>117</b> encircling the innermost concentric circle <b>115</b>. Next, a power is applied to third electromagnets <b>113</b> that define a concentric circle <b>119</b> outside the second inner concentric circle, with the result that a magnetic attraction with a magnet of a contact frame to be described later is generated to achieve the laminating while minimizing or reducing the occurrence of impurities or space between a donor film <b>200</b><i>a </i>and the acceptor substrate <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, in the described embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, when the electromagnets <b>113</b> of a substrate stage <b>110</b> are formed in a plurality of transverse and longitudinal lines, a power is applied to only the electromagnet <b>113</b> on which a laser is irradiated or only the electromagnets <b>113</b> of a corresponding line, thereby generating a magnetic attraction with a magnet of a contact frame to be described later. Accordingly, a local laminating continues to be achieved between a donor film <b>200</b><i>b </i>and the acceptor substrate <b>300</b> at only parts on which a laser is irradiated, with the result that the laminating is completed while minimizing or reducing the occurrence of space or impurities. An electric wiring for applying a power may be installed at each electromagnet.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The substrate stage <b>110</b> further includes a drive mechanism (not shown) for feeding the substrate stage <b>110</b>. When the substrate stage <b>110</b> is fed, the laser oscillator <b>120</b> can be configured to irradiate a laser in one direction. For example, when a laser is irradiated in a longitudinal direction and the substrate stage <b>110</b> further includes a drive mechanism for feeding the substrate stage <b>110</b>, a laser can be irradiated to an entire surface of the donor film <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Furthermore, the substrate stage <b>110</b> can further include a mounting mechanism for receiving and mounting the acceptor substrate <b>300</b> and the donor film <b>200</b>. The mounting mechanism is used to mount the acceptor substrate <b>300</b>, and the donor film <b>200</b> is fed in the chamber <b>150</b> by a feed mechanism at a determined position of the substrate stage <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the embodiment, the mounting mechanism may include through holes <b>410</b> and <b>510</b>, guide bars <b>420</b> and <b>520</b>, moving plates <b>430</b> and <b>530</b>, support members <b>440</b> and <b>540</b>, and mounting grooves <b>450</b> and <b>550</b>. The guide bars <b>420</b> ascend or descend with the moving plate <b>430</b> and the support member <b>440</b>. The guide bars <b>420</b> ascend through the through holes <b>410</b> to receive the acceptor substrate <b>300</b>. The guide bars <b>420</b> descend to mount the acceptor substrate <b>300</b> in a first mounting groove <b>450</b> formed on the substrate stage <b>110</b>. Those skilled in the art would know how to implement the mounting mechanism based on the disclosure herein. Further, the mounting mechanism can be changed by those skilled in the art, and is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The laser oscillator <b>120</b> may be installed outside or inside a chamber <b>150</b>. The laser oscillator <b>120</b> may be installed such that a laser is provided at an upper part. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> showing a schematic view of the laser oscillator <b>120</b>, CW DN:YAG laser (1604 nm) may be used as the laser oscillator of the embodiment. The laser oscillator includes two galvano meter scanners <b>121</b> and <b>123</b>, a scan lens <b>125</b>, and a cylinder lens <b>127</b>. However, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The contact frame <b>130</b> includes one or more electromagnets, one or more permanent magnets, or magnetic substance. The contact frame <b>130</b> forms a magnetic force with a magnet of the substrate stage <b>110</b>, so that the donor film <b>200</b> and the acceptor substrate <b>300</b> disposed between the substrate stage <b>110</b> and the contact frame <b>130</b> are strongly laminated. The contact frame <b>130</b> includes opening grooves (or openings) <b>133</b> through which a laser passes. Accordingly, the contact frame <b>130</b> also functions as a mask to irradiate the laser at only a predetermined position. In the described embodiment, the magnetic substance includes ferromagnetic substance and/or weak magnetic substance. In the described embodiment, the magnetic layer (or magnetic substance) is formed by one selected from the group consisting of Fe, Ni, Cr, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, magnetic nano particles, and a mixture thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The contact frames include a first frame <b>130</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b>, a second frame <b>130</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b>, and a third frame <b>130</b><i>c</i>_<b>1</b>. First opening grooves <b>133</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b> are formed at the first frame <b>130</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b>. First sub-pixels are formed corresponding to the first opening grooves <b>133</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b> according to an organic light emitting layer to be transferred. Magnets or magnetic substance <b>137</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b> are located at the first frame <b>130</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b>. Second opening grooves <b>133</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b> are formed at the second frame <b>130</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b>. Second sub-pixels are formed corresponding to second opening grooves <b>133</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b> according to an organic light emitting layer to be transferred. Magnets or magnetic substance <b>137</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b> are located at the second frame <b>130</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b>. Third opening grooves <b>133</b><i>c</i>_<b>1</b> are formed at the third frame <b>130</b><i>c</i>_<b>1</b>. Third sub-pixels are formed corresponding to the third opening grooves <b>133</b><i>c</i>_<b>1</b> according to an organic light emitting layer to be transferred. Magnets or magnetic substance <b>137</b><i>c</i>_<b>1</b> are located at the third frame <b>130</b><i>c</i>_<b>1</b>. The first, second, and third frames <b>130</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b>, <b>130</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b>, and <b>130</b><i>c</i>_<b>1</b> are alternately mounted to form an emission layer of organic light emitting diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, an opening groove may be formed at substantially an entire surface of the contact frame. Hence, it can be manufactured to use one contact frame. However, in this case, magnets may be installed at only edges of the contact frame, so that laminating due to a magnetic force between the donor film and the acceptor substrate does not actually occur as described herein. Accordingly, in one embodiment, an area of the magnet is equal to or greater than or equal to at least 50% of that of the contact frame.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref>, <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C show an embodiment of the first, second, and third contact frames, which are alternately mounted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> is a plan view showing a stripe pixel array of organic light emitting diodes formed by the first, second, and third contact frames shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref>, <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A plurality of first opening grooves <b>133</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b> corresponding to which the first sub-pixels are formed, are formed at the first contact frame <b>130</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. A plurality of second opening grooves <b>133</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b> corresponding to which the second sub-pixels are formed, are formed at the second contact frame <b>130</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. A plurality of third opening grooves <b>133</b><i>c</i>_<b>1</b> corresponding to which the third sub-pixels are formed, are formed at the third contact frame <b>130</b><i>c</i>_<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The contact frame feed mechanism <b>140</b> moves or reciprocates the contact frame <b>130</b> in a direction of the substrate stage, and can be manufactured using various different methods. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the contact frame feed mechanism <b>140</b> includes a holder <b>141</b>, connecting bars <b>143</b>, and a drive mechanism <b>145</b> (shown as a block diagram). The holder <b>141</b> includes a holding groove <b>142</b>. The connecting bars <b>143</b> are connected to the holder <b>141</b> at an upper surface of the chamber <b>150</b>. The drive mechanism drives the connecting bars <b>143</b> and the holder <b>141</b> up and down. Here, as shown, when the feed mechanism feeds the contact frame <b>130</b>, the contact frame <b>130</b> is fed in a state that it is mounted on a tray <b>135</b> having a holding projection <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The first contact frame <b>130</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b> and the second contact frame <b>130</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b> are exchanged by an exchange mechanism <b>147</b> (shown as a block diagram) such as a robot arm. After the first sub-pixels are formed by using the first contact frame <b>130</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b> disposed on the holder, the robot arm removes the first contact frame <b>130</b><i>a</i>_<b>1</b> from the holder to an outside, and positions the second contact frame <b>130</b><i>b</i>_<b>1</b> at the holder, thereby achieving the exchange to form the second sub-pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, a method for forming organic light emitting diodes by using the aforementioned laser induced thermal imaging apparatus will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C, and <b>7</b>. A method for fabricating organic light emitting diodes having an emission layer formed between electrodes by the laser induced thermal imaging apparatus includes an acceptor substrate feed step ST<b>100</b>, a first donor film feed step ST<b>200</b>, a first contact frame adhering step ST<b>300</b>, a first sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>400</b>, a first contact frame separating step ST<b>500</b>, a second donor film feed step ST<b>600</b>, a second contact frame adhering step ST<b>700</b>, a second sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>800</b>, a second contact frame separating step ST<b>900</b>, a third donor film feed step ST<b>1000</b>, a third contact frame adhering step ST<b>1100</b>, and a third sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>1200</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Hereinafter, like or the same elements in the fourth embodiment are designated by like or the same numbers as are used in the first embodiment. Since an acceptor substrate and contact frames differ from those of the first embodiment, only the acceptor substrate and the contact frames will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows an embodiment of a contact frame <b>130</b>_<b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is a plan view showing a pixel array of organic light emitting diodes formed by the contact frame <b>130</b>_<b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Furthermore, the contact frame <b>130</b>_<b>4</b> includes opening grooves <b>133</b>_<b>4</b> through which a laser passes.

The opening grooves <b>133</b>_<b>4</b> can be variously set according to a pixel array having an organic light emission layer to be transferred. For example, when only the first and second sub-pixels among the first to third sub-pixels in one pixel is formed by a laser induced thermal imaging method, and a common layer is deposited all over a pixel portion to form a third sub-pixel, opening grooves <b>133</b>_<b>4</b> can be formed at formation positions of the first and second sub-pixels, which are arranged adjacent to each other in the same row.

This causes the number of contact frames to be reduced and a process to be simplified. After the emission layer of the first and second sub-pixels is formed, the acceptor substrate <b>304</b> is fed into a deposition chamber (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>) and third sub-pixels are formed by a thermal deposition.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The acceptor substrate feed step ST<b>5100</b> feeds the acceptor substrate <b>305</b> or <b>306</b> in which an organic light emission layer is formed on the substrate stage <b>110</b> having magnets or magnetic substance. A pixel region is defined at the acceptor substrate <b>305</b> or <b>306</b>. An emission layer to be transferred is formed corresponding to the pixel region. The pixel region of the acceptor substrate <b>305</b> or <b>306</b> is formed so that four sub-pixels constitute one pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The first donor film feed step ST<b>5200</b> feeds a first donor film having an emission layer to be transferred on the acceptor substrate <b>305</b> or <b>306</b>. Here, the emission layer can be configured as one color, for example, red color.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The first contact frame adhering step ST<b>5300</b> adheres the first contact frame to a first donor film using magnetic attraction. The first contact frame includes magnets or magnetic substance. First opening grooves are formed at the first contact frame, and a laser for transferring a first color organic light emission layer passes through the first opening grooves. Here, a contact frame feed mechanism first feeds and adheres the first contact frame on the substrate stage, and then adheres it strongly using magnetic attraction.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The first sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>5400</b> expands and transfers a first color organic light emission layer included in the first donor film on a first sub-pixel region of the acceptor substrate by irradiating a laser on the first donor film through the first opening grooves of the first contact frame. At this time, an irradiation range of the laser can be adjusted so that the laser is irradiated to only the first sub-pixel region among regions corresponding to the opening grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The first contact frame separating step ST<b>5500</b> separates the first contact frame from the first donor film by first separating the first contact frame by a magnetic repulsive force, and then by raising the contact frame to an upper portion of the chamber by the contact frame feed mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The second donor film feed step ST<b>5600</b> removes the first donor film from an upper portion of the acceptor substrate to an outside of the chamber, and feeds a second donor film having a second color organic light emission layer on the acceptor substrate. That is, the donor film feed mechanism substitutes a second donor film for the first donor film.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The first contact frame re-adhering step ST<b>5700</b> again adheres the first contact frame separated from the donor film in step ST<b>5500</b> to a second donor film using magnetic attraction. Here, the contact frame feed mechanism first feeds and adheres the first contact frame on the substrate stage, and then adheres it strongly using magnetic attraction.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The second sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>5800</b> expands and transfers a second color organic light emission layer included in the second donor film on a second sub-pixel region of the acceptor substrate by irradiating a laser on the second donor film through the opening grooves of the first contact frame. At this time, an irradiation range of the laser can be adjusted so that the laser is irradiated to only the second sub-pixel region among regions corresponding to the opening grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The second contact frame exchange step ST<b>5900</b> eliminates a magnetic force or generates a magnetic repulsive force between the first contact frame and the substrate stage to separate the first contact frame from the second donor film, and then substitutes the second contact frame for the first contact frame. The second contact frame has magnets or magnetic substance. Opening grooves are formed at the second contact frame and a laser for transferring a third color organic light emission layer of the third donor film passes through the opening grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The third donor film feed step ST<b>6000</b> removes the second donor film from an upper portion of the acceptor substrate to an outside of the chamber, and feeds a third donor film having a third color organic light emission layer on the acceptor substrate. That is, the donor film feed mechanism substitutes a third donor film for the second donor film.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The third contact frame adhering step ST<b>6100</b> adheres the second contact frame to the third donor film using magnetic attraction. The second contact frame includes magnets or magnetic substance. Second opening grooves are formed at the second contact frame, and a laser for transferring a third color organic light emission layer passes through the third opening grooves. Here, a contact frame feed mechanism first feeds and adheres the second contact frame on the substrate stage, and then adheres it strongly using magnetic attraction.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The third sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>6200</b> expands and transfers a third color organic light emission layer included in the third donor film on a third sub-pixel region of the acceptor substrate by irradiating a laser on the third donor film through opening grooves of the second contact frame. At this time, an irradiation range of the laser can be adjusted so that the laser is irradiated to an entire region of the second contact frame.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">An organic light emission layer can be variously transferred at a pixel definition region in respective transfer steps. A laser irradiation method can vary according to an arrangement of a transfer. For example, the four sub-pixels form a 2&#xd7;2 matrix, and constitutes one pixel, the first color organic light emission layer is transferred to be formed at an upper left end of the pixel in the first sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>5400</b>, and the second color organic light emission layer is transferred to be formed at a left side of the first sub-pixel in the second sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>5800</b>, and the third color organic light emission layer is transferred to be formed under the first and second sub-pixels in the third sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>6200</b>. Further, the first color organic light emission layer is transferred to be formed at an upper left end of the pixel in the first sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>5400</b>, and the second color organic light emission layer is transferred to be formed under the first sub-pixel in the second sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>5800</b>, and the third color organic light emission layer is transferred to be formed at each right side of the first and second sub-pixels in the third sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>6200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the described embodiment, a color defining two sub-pixels is blue. For example, a color of the first color organic light emission layer transferred in the first sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>5400</b> is red, a color of the second color organic light emission layer transferred in the second sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>5800</b> is green, and a color of the first color organic light emission layer transferred in the third sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>6200</b> is blue. Alternatively, a color of the first color organic light emission layer transferred in the first sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>5400</b> may be green, a color of the second color organic light emission layer transferred in the second sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>5800</b> may be red, and a color of the third color organic light emission layer transferred in the third sub-pixel transfer step ST<b>6200</b> is blue.</p>
