<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to methods of synthesizing S-allyl-cysteine analogues and their therapeutic composition and applications in treating myocardial infarction.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Myocardial infarction is irreversible necrosis of heart muscle cells caused by ischemic heart disease, which is characterized by coronary blood flow diminished to the level unsustainable to the metabolic demand of myocardium.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Common symptoms of ischemic heart disease include angina, shortness of breath, or fatigue. Often angina is worsened if the patient exerts after a meal, or walks into a cold weather, or suffers from emotional stress.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The major pathogenesis of myocardial infarction is coronary artery stenosis, leading to myocardial cells starved for oxygen (hypoxia) and glucose, the result of which is death or permanent damage of myocardial cells (myocytes).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The etiologies for coronary artery stenosis are fixed atherosclerotic obstruction, acute plaque rupture, coronary artery thrombosis, and vasospasm. In order to study myocardial infarction, lab models are established by occlusive ligature of coronary artery of experimental animals to reproduce ischemia caused by coronary artery stenosis, or by deprivation oxygen (hypoxia) and glucose supply to cultured myocardial cells.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Morphologically the area of necrotic myocardium corresponds to the area where occluded coronary artery supplies. The myocardial tissue affected turns from pallor to cyanotic, further to softened yellow central area with a hyperemic rim. Eventually the dead myocardial tissue is replaced by a fibrotic white thin scar. The severity of the damage to myocardium is proportional to the area affected by coronary artery stenosis and the time duration of ischemia.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Under microscope the ischemic myocardial cells display various morphological changes ranging from myocytolysis, eosinophilic cell infiltration with intercellular edema of the myocardium, acute inflammation of the myocytes, macrophages removing dead myocytes, granulation tissue, to scar tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Biochemical lab diagnosis provides specific, sensitive and timely results indicating myocardial cell stress, injury, and death. The lab test markers relevant to myocardial muscle cell's current biomedical conditions are creatine kinase sub-fraction MB (CK-MB) level, cardiac troponin levels (troponin-T and troponin-I), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) level and myoglobin level.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Elevation of CK-MB indicates acute myocardial cell injury, since it is a specific enzyme in myocardial cells and a good marker of injury of myocardial cells. Isoforms 1 and 2 of CK-MB can also be tested, and the ratio of the two CK-MB isoforms can provide further information about the injury condition of myocardial cell.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Troponin-T and Troponin-I are proteins in myocardial cells. Elevation of the Troponin-T and Troponin-I indicate that myocardial cells are injured.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Elevation of LDH level is another indicator of myocardial infarction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Myoglobin is structure protein of myocytes. Increase of its level indicates myocardial infarction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Numerous drug treatments to combat coronary heart disease have been developed. Commonly prescribed drugs to treat coronary diseases are beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and antiplatelet coaggregation drugs.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Beta-blockers are prescribed to alleviate the effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. Nitroglycerin dilates coronary blood vessels instantly. Calcium channel blockers prevent blood vessels from constricting and counter coronary artery spasm. ACE inhibitors, such as ramipril reduce the risk of heart attack. Antiplatelet coaggregation drugs, such as aspirin reduce the aggregation of platelets so that they do not clump and stick on blood vessel walls. Some of the drugs are used in combination to prevent or reduce ischemia and to minimize symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Searching for new drugs to treat coronary heart disease has been an on going effort worldwide. Natural resources have been the dependable sources for new drug development for long time. New drugs developed from substances originated from plants are believed less dependent forming, with fewer side effects.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention provides new pharmaceutical compositions and methods of production and application of the pharmaceutical compositions to treat myocardial infarction.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, provided is a pharmaceutical composition for treating myocardial infarction in a subject comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one synthesized compound selected from the group consisting of SEC, SPC, SBC, SPEC, SAC, SAMC, and SPRC, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment, provided is a method of treating myocardial infarction comprising administering a subject the pharmaceutical composition of a therapeutically effective amount of at least one synthesized compound selected from the group consisting of SEC, SPC, SBC, SPEC, SAC, SAMC, and SPRC, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to induce at least one biochemical change in ischemic cardiac muscle cells to improve the ischemic cardiac muscle cells survive rate, reduce LDH leakage from the ischemic cardiac muscle cells, and reduce infarction area of myocardial infarction in the subject.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In yet another embodiment, provided is a method for synthesizing SPRC comprising preparing an NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution containing cysteine by dissolving cysteine hydrochloride in said solution, admixing organic bromine with said solution, synthesizing SPRC in the mixture solution by stirring said solution, extracting SPRC by filtration, purifying SPRC by recrystallisation, and determining SPRC by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) has been used as both foodstuff and medicine for thousands of years. In some cultures, such as Egypt, Greece, Rome, Northern Europe, and China, it is believed in folklores that dietary consumption of garlic can keep people healthy. Some people believe that eating garlic helps suppressing the development of certain diseases such as cancer, common cold and infection.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Various researches have been conducted to study the chemical compositions of garlic and their medicinal use. Some studies are focused on aged garlic extract (AGE), which is produced by aging and extracting organic fresh garlic in water at room temperature for 20 months. The resulting aged garlic extract is high in water-soluble phytochemicals, including cysteine derivatives such as S-allyl cysteine (SAC), S-allyl mercaptocysteine (SAMC) and S-methyl cysteine, and gamma-glutamyl cysteine derivatives. The process increases AGE's phytochemical levels, which is believed to have antioxidant effect and is largely responsible for benefiting human health. Water-soluble cysteine derivatives from AGE are odorless, more chemically stable and safer for human consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A number of cysteine derivatives from AGE have been isolated, and their chemical structures have been determined. For example, S-allyl cysteine (SAC), and its analogous of S-ethyl cysteine (SEC), S-propyl cysteine (SPC), S-butyl cysteine (SBC), S-pentyl-L-cysteine (SPEC), S-allylmercapto cysteine (SAMC), S-propargyl-cysteine (SPRC) are a few phytochemicals that researchers are interested in:</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The research results revealed that the purified phytochemicals have a wide range of health benefits and medicinal applications. Many of the purified phytochemicals have the same antioxidant effects of AGE in the studies. More biomedical researches disclosed further medicinal applications of the purified phytochemicals. For example, SAC, SEC and SPC inhibit cholesterol synthesis by deactivating HMG-CoA reductase (J. Nutr. 132:1129-1134, 2002). Five cysteines from aged garlic extract, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), SAC, SEC, SMC, and SPC, are able to treat hyperlipidemia development in mice consuming a high saturated fat diet (Lipids, 2004, Vol. 39, No. 9, pp. 843-848).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">WO/2001/035972 disclosed a method using a composition containing S-allyl cysteine and S-allyl mercapto cysteine from aged garlic extract with vitamin C and vitamin E for treating sickle cell disease.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another research report disclosed that SAC is used for treating cerebral ischemic injury of neurons due to its antioxidant activity (Free Radical Research, Volume 40, Issue 8 Aug. 2006, pages 827-835).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Yet another research report disclosed that dietary SAC reduces mortality with decreased stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (Biosci Biotechnol Biochem., Vol. 70; No. 8; Page. 1969-1971 (J-STAGE)(2006)).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">SAC is a representative sulfur containing cysteine which can be derived from S-Alk(en)yl cysteine sulfoxides (ACSs) degradation. Previous reports have shown that SAC has antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-hepatotoxic effects. S-propargyl-cysteine (SPRC) is a structural analogue of S-allylcysteine (SAC). It is anticipated that the analogue SPRC has better antioxidant activity in that the SPRC structure is similar to that of SAC's, besides, SPRC has better selectivity to interact with the enzyme cystathionine-&#x3b3;-lyase (CSE).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Interestingly, both SPRC and SAC are found to increase hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) production in cells and induce the enzyme cystathionine-&#x3b3;-lyase (CSE) at both the transcriptional and protein level. These results suggest that SPRC and SAC offer their antioxidant effects via a H<sub>2</sub>S mediated pathways. In addition, SPRC represents a pharmacological agent that can be used to modulate endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S levels in cells. SPRC deserves further studies to assess its effectiveness for ischemic heart diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">However, there is no report that SAC and its analogous of SEC, SPC, SBC, SPEC, SAMC, SPRC can be applied to treat myocardial infarction thus far.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Furthermore, the process to obtain phytochemicals such as SAC and analogues from natural resources is complicate and lengthy, involving at least growing the plants, harvesting the plants, extracting the phytochemicals from the plants, isolating and purificating the phytochemicals. Apparently the process to obtain SAC and analogues from natural resources costs time and money, let alone its impact on the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Therefore, it is necessary to develop some chemical methods to synthesize SAC and analogues, and explore the medicinal application of the SAC and analogues in treating myocardial infarction.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment according to the present invention, SAC and its analogous of SEC, SPC, SBC, SPEC, SAMC, SPRC are artificially synthesized.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The methods to synthesize SAC and its analogous are disclosed as following:</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A solution containing cysteine by dissolving cysteine hydrochloride in an aqueous solution is prepared. For synthesizing SAC, SPC, SBC, SPEC and SPRC the solution is an alkaline solution, preferably a pre-cooled cysteine NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution. For synthesizing SAC, 3-bromopropene is added into a pre-cooled cysteine NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution. For synthesizing SEC, ethyl bromide is added into an aqueous solution containing cysteine at room temperature, with its pH adjusted to 9.5-10 by adding ammonia water. For synthesizing SPC, propyl bromide is added into a pre-cooled cysteine NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution. For synthesizing SBC, butyl bromide is added into a cysteine NH<sub>4</sub>OH ethanol solution in 25 degree C. For synthesizing SPEC, pentyl bromide is added into a cysteine NH<sub>4</sub>OH ethanol solution in 25 degree C. For synthesizing SAMC, allicin is added in small portions into an aqueous solution containing cysteine under vigorous stirring at room temperature. For synthesizing SPRC, propargyl bromide is added to the ice-cooled solution of L-cysteine hydrochloride in NH<sub>4</sub>OH. In order to synthesize corresponding SAC analogues the mixture solutions are stirred vigorously so that the organic bromines react with corresponding cysteine solutions. The synthesized SAC and analogues are extracted by filtration, and the filtered products are concentrated in vacuum, washed in water or ethanol or ethyl ether several times. The chemical structures of purified SAC analogues are determined by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Various SAC analogues may be made from cysteine using a range of chemistries, or from other chemical synthesis. Additionally derivations will be recognized and are routine to those of skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another embodiment, provided is a pharmaceutical composition for treating myocardial infarction in a subject comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one synthesized compound selected from the group consisting of SEC, SPC, SBC, SPEC, SAC, SAMC, and SPRC, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The structures of SAC analogues are capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including acid addition salts and base salts, as well as solvates, such as hydrates and alcoholates. All of these pharmaceutical forms are contemplated by this invention and are included herein.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the composition of SAC analogues include salts derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, and the like, as well as the salts derived from organic acids, such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, etc. Such salts include nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, caprylate, isobutyrate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, phthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, phenylacetate, citrate, lactate, maleate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The phrase &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; is employed herein to refer to compositions and dosage forms suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit versus risk ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The synthesized SAC analogues of the invention may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic excipients or carriers. Common excipients or carriers may be sterile water or saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils from vegetable origin, hydrogenated naphtalenes etc. Such compounds or compositions may be prepared for parenteral administration intraveneously, subcutaneously, and intramuscularly, particularly in the form of liquid solutions or suspensions in aqueous physiological buffer solutions; for oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets or capsules; or for intranasal administration, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols. Sustained release compositions are also encompassed by the present invention. Other suitable administering systems include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes. Compositions for other routes of administration may be prepared as desired using standard methods.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an alternate embodiment, the invention relates to compositions and kits comprising a first therapeutic agent including SAC analogues thereof and at least one of second therapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent is not SAC or its analogues thereof. These compositions or kits are effective to treat myocardial infarction in a subject. Various therapeutic agents, including beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and antiplatelet coaggregation drugs may be used in the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The effectiveness of SAC and its analogues on treating myocardial infarction is determined in both cultured myocardial cells and animal models.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Myocardial cells are deprived from oxygen and glucose for 6 hours, which is a conventional model for ischemic myocardial infarction. The hypoxic myocardial cells are then reperfused with normal amount of oxygen and glucose (hypoxia/reoxygenation process). Several groups of myocardial cells are administered with SAC and its analogues respectively 12 h before hypoxic injury. During hypoxia/reoxygenation process, with one group of hypoxic cells left untreated (No SAC analogues are administered.) as a model control of hypoxia/reoxygenation (Vehicle group) and one normoxic control group of myocardial cells cultured without hypoxia/reoxygenation process (Control group, with normal oxygen supply). The effects of SAC and its analogues inducing biochemical changes in the hypoxic myocardial cells, the survival rate of the hypoxic myocardial cells and the LDH leaking from the ischemic myocardial cells are observed. The results indicate that endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S level in the hypoxic myocardial cells is elevated by the SAC analogues treatments. Endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S contributes to the cardioprotection by metabolic inhibition preconditioning in the rat ventricular myocytes (Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology, Vol. 40, Issue 1, January 2006, Pages 119-130).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Several biochemical markers are assessed to determine the effects of SAC analogues. In hypoxic myocardial cells treated with SAC analogues, LDH leakage (release) from the cells is reduced. The effect of SAC analogues on reducing LDH leakage from hypoxic cells can be reversed by PAG (DL-propargylglycine, a cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) inhibitor inhibiting endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S production). The result indicates that the reduction of LDH leaking rates in SAC and analogue treated cells are correlated with the survival rate of myocardial cell under hypoxia/reoxygenation condition, and is mediated by endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S in the injured myocardial cells.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The activities of SOD (superoxide dismutase) in SAC analogues treated hypoxic cells are elevated. The effect of SAC analogues on elevating SOD activity from hypoxic cells can be reversed by PAG. The result indicates that the elevating SOD activity in SAC analogue treated cells are correlated with the survival rate of myocardial cell under hypoxia/reoxygenation condition, and is mediated by endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S in the injured myocardial cells. SOD subtype studies further reveal that the analogues SPC, SBC and SPEC, which have saturated carbon chain in their molecular structures, are able to elevate the activities of Cu&#x2014;Zn SOD in cytoplasm in myocardial cell under hypoxia/reoxygenation condition. PAG also reverses the effect on elevating SOD activity of SPC, SBC and SPEC. Analogues SPRC and SEC are able to elevate Mn-SOD activity in mitochondria in myocardial cell under hypoxia/reoxygenation condition. PAG also reverses the effect.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Catalase activity in SAC analogues treated hypoxic cells groups is elevated.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Lipid peroxidations in hypoxic cells treated with SAC analogues SEC, SPC, SPRC were inhibited by SAC analogues. SAC analogues can significantly inhibit oxygen free radicals in the cells, thereby inhibiting lipid peroxidation in hypoxic myocardial cells, reducing the level of MDA (malondialdehyde), which is a product of lipid peroxidation. The inhibition effect on lipid peroxidation could be reversed by PAG.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">SAC analogues can inhibit myocardial cell apoptosis, and have great value in application of treating heart disease.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Similar experiments are done on cultured H9c2 cardiac muscle cells groups with the same experiment condition and different dosages of SPRC treatments. The results of the experiments confirm that endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S level in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>injured H9c2 cells is elevated by SPRC treatments. The activities of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and catalase are elevated in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>injured H9c2 cells, SPRC can significantly inhibit oxygen free radicals in the cells, thereby inhibiting lipid peroxidation in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>injured H9c2 cells, reducing the level of MDA (malondialdehyde), which is a product of lipid peroxidation. It is also observed that the apoptosis of hypoxic myocardial cells is decreased, the survival rate of the in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>injured H9c2 cells is increased and the LDH releasing from the in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>injured H9c2 cells are reduced by three dosages of SPRC treatment. The results indicate that the effects of SPRC is concentration dependent.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Animal model for myocardial infarction is employed and effectiveness of SAC analogues in treating MI is tested.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Rats are randomly assigned to 4 experiment groups: Sham operated on and treated with saline group (Sham group, negative control), sham operated on and treated with SPRC and SAC groups (Sham+SPRC and Sham+SAC), ligation operated on and treated with saline group (MI group, model control), ligation operated on and treated with SPRC and SAC groups (MI+SPRC and MI+SAC). Rats in SPRC and SAC groups are pre treated with SPRC and SAC respectively for 7 days.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Rats are operated on and MI is induced according to correspondent experiment groups by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery at approximately 2-3 mm from its origin. The MI model is established when the area of myocardium supplied by the ligated coronary artery turns to pallor, and ECG recording shows the ST segment is elevated. Then the rats are given water and food, returned to their cages according to experiment groups. SPRC and SAC treatment groups are given SPRC and SAC continuously for 2 more days.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Forty eight hours after the surgery, ECG is recorded for each rat in each group. Blood samples are taken from abdominal aorta from each rat in each group. Then the rats are sacrificed and their hearts are taken. The heart tissues from the rats are stained and the myocardial infarction areas are observed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">To evaluate the effect of SPRC and SAC on MI, infarct size of heart tissue are measured after TTC staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). The infarct size/total area of left ventricle was significantly less in rats subjected to SPRC and SAC treatments than in vehicle injected rats. ECG patterns were similar in all groups prior to the start of the treatment as well as one week after treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Serum CK levels and LDH leakages are decreased after SPRC and SAC treatment of the animals. Lipid peroxidation reduced since SPRC and SAC inhibit creation of oxygen free radicals therefore inhibit lipid peroxidation, so that the product of lipid peroxidation MDA content decreased. SOD (superoxide dismutase) activity is elevated in SPRC and SAC treated animals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Plasma levels of H<sub>2</sub>S in animal groups treated with SPRC or SAC are increased. CSE activity in animal groups treated with SPRC or SAC are increased, indicating that CSE mediates the endogenous production of H<sub>2</sub>S in mammals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, B).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Bax expression, which is related to cell injuries and apoptosis, is down regulated in animal groups treated with SPRC or SAC. Bcl-2 expression, which is anti-apoptotic, and CSE protein expression, which CSE mediates the endogenous production of H<sub>2</sub>S in mammals, are up regulated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and CSE mRNAs confirm that the effects of SPRC and SAC on the animals. Similarly, Bax gene expression is down regulated, and CSE gene is up regulated in SPRC and SAC treated group. SPRC and SAC have no effects on gene expression of Bcl-2. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In summary, SAC analogues are effective to treat myocardial infarction by inducing a number of biochemical changes, which is manifested in biochemical marker changes. The mechanism of SAC analogues increases the number of surviving myocardial cells under ischemic condition is mediated by inducing biochemical changes in the cells via modulation of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S level.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The heart sample of 3 day old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat (first generation) was washed in PBS (phosphate balanced solution) under sterilized condition. The sample is digested in 0.08% trypsin solution 37 degree C. for 10 minutes in a flask, wherein the solution was stirred constantly. In order to stop the digestion, serum was added into the flask and mixed with the solution. The digesting process was repeated 8 times, and the supernatant of each digestion was collected. The supernatant was centrifuged 2,000&#xd7;g for 5 minutes, and the myocardial cells were collected each time. The myocardial cell density was adjusted to 10<sup>6</sup>/sample and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 days.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The cultured myocardial cells were divided into the following groups:</p>

Rats were pre-treated for seven days with each SAC analogues respectively via an intraperitoneal injection once daily before they were used for MI model studies.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">MI was induced on day eight by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery at T approximately 2-3 mm from its origin. Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with 7% choral hydrate (60 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection), endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated with room air, respiratory rate 100 breaths/min, tidal volume 2.5 ml with a rodent ventilator (DHX-150, China). ECG was recorded in the anaesthetized animal for a period of one minute using the Animal Mflab200 amplifier (Produced in China). A left thoracotomy was performed and the third intercostal space was exposed. The proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, which supplies blood to left ventricle, was ligated at the position 2-3 mm from the aorta with a 5-0 atraumatic suture that was passed through the superficial layers of myocardium, between the left auricle and the cone of pulmonary artery. The MI model was considered completely established when the area of myocardium supplied by the ligated coronary artery turned to pallor, and ECG recording showed the ST segment was elevated. Then incisions were sutured and the chests were closed. Sham operated rats were prepared in the same manner except the left coronary was not ligated. After completion of the surgical procedures, rats were removed from the ventilator and the endotracheal tube removed. The rats were kept warm, given water and food after they were awake from the anesthesia and kept in different cages according to experiment groups. The rats in correspondent experiment groups were given SPRC or SAC continuously for 2 more days, while the rats in control and MI groups were given no SAC analogues.</p>

The heart tissues from the rats were stained and the myocardial infarction areas are observed.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">To evaluate the effect of SPRC and SAC on MI, infarct size were measured after TTC staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).

However, differences in ECG patterns were similar in all groups prior to the start of the treatment as well as one week after treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), All rats showed significant ST elevation, which is characteristic of MI. ECG charts of rats that underwent the MI procedure recorded on day 10, 48 hr after the induction of MI showed that SAC and SPRC groups had a less elevated ST-segment. In addition, Pathological Q waves which may occur in the early stage of MI were observed in the ECG charts of all treatment groups.</p>
