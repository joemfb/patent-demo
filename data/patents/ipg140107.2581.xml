<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter of application Ser. No. 11/981,389 is incorporated herein by reference. The present application is a Divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/981,389 filed Oct. 30, 2007, which is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/192,409, filed Jul. 10, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,294,873 issued Nov. 13, 2007, which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. JP 2001-210270, filed Jul. 11, 2001. The present application claims priority to these previously filed applications.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an X-Y address type solid state image pickup device in which unit pixels each including an active device for converting a signal charge obtained through photo-electric conversion by a photo-electric conversion device into an electrical signal and outputting the electrical signal are arranged in a matrix form, and a method of producing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Solid state image pickup devices are generally classified into a charge transfer type solid state image pickup device represented by a CCD image sensor and an X-Y address type solid state image pickup device represented by a CMOS image sensor. Of the two types, the X-Y address type solid state image pickup device will be described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> which shows an example of the sectional structure of the CMOS image sensor taken as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the CMOS image sensor has a construction in which a pixel portion <b>100</b> for photo-electric conversion of incident light and a peripheral circuit portion <b>200</b> for reading a signal by driving pixels, processing the signal and outputting the processed signal are integrated on the same chip (substrate). Transistors constituting the pixel portion <b>100</b> and transistors constituting the peripheral circuit portion <b>200</b> have a part of wiring in common.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The pixel portion <b>100</b> includes a photo-diode <b>102</b> provided on the surface of an N type silicon substrate <b>101</b> having a thickness of about several hundreds of &#x3bc;m, and a color filter <b>105</b> and a micro-lens <b>106</b> arranged on the upper side of the photo-diode <b>102</b> with a wiring layer <b>103</b> and a passivation layer <b>104</b> therebetween. The color filter <b>105</b> is provided for obtaining color signals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the pixel portion <b>100</b>, transistors and wirings are present between the photo-diode <b>102</b> and the color filter <b>105</b>. Therefore, in order to enhance the ratio of the incident light on the photo-diode <b>102</b> to the incident light on the pixel portion <b>100</b>, namely, numerical aperture, the incident light is focused on the photo-diode <b>102</b> through the gaps between the wirings by the micro-lens <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the related art of the pixel structure in which the incident light is taken into the photo-diode <b>102</b> through the wiring layer <b>103</b> as mentioned above, a portion of the light focused by the micro-lens <b>106</b> is scattered by the wirings, resulting in various problems as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">{circle around (1)} The amount of light is reduced by the portion scattered by the wirings, so that sensitivity is lowered.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">{circle around (2)} The portion of light scattered by the wirings enter into photo-diodes in the adjacent pixels, resulting in color mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">{circle around (3)} Characteristics are lowered due to limitations on the basis of wiring, such as the limitations that a wiring cannot be disposed on the upper side of the photo-diode <b>102</b> and a thick wiring cannot be laid, and it is difficult to miniaturize the pixels.
<br/>
{circle around (4)} The light is incident skewly on pixels and the ratio of the light portion scattered to the entire amount of the incident light is increased in a peripheral area, so that dark shading occurs heavily at the pixels in the peripheral area.
<br/>
{circle around (5)} It is difficult to produce a COMS image sensor by an advanced CMOS process with an increased number of wiring layers, because the distance from the micro-lens <b>106</b> to the photo-diode <b>102</b> is increased.
<br/>
{circle around (6)} A library of advanced CMOS processes cannot be used due to {circle around (5)} above, a change in layout of the circuit in the library is needed, and an increase in area is caused by limitations on the wiring layer, so that production cost is raised and pixel area per pixel is enlarged.
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, when light with a long wavelength such as red color light undergoes photo-electric conversion in a P well <b>107</b> located deeper than the photo-diode <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the electrons generated diffuse through the P well <b>107</b>, to enter into photo-diodes at other positions, resulting in color mixture. In addition, if the electrons enter into a pixel shielded from light for detection of black, a black level may be detected erroneously.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Besides, in the CMOS image sensors in recent years, there is the tendency that the functions which have been provided on different chips, such as a camera signal processing circuit and a DSP (Digital Signal Processor), are mounted on the same chip as the pixel portion. Because the process generation is advanced in the manner of 0.4 &#x3bc;m&#x2192;0.25 &#x3bc;m&#x2192;0.18 &#x3bc;m&#x2192;0.13 &#x3bc;m, if the CMOS image sensors themselves cannot cope with these new processes, they cannot share in the benefit of miniaturization, and cannot utilize the rich CMOS circuit library and IP.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the degree of multilayer property of the wiring structure advances as the process generation advances; for example, three-layer wiring is used in the 0.4 &#x3bc;m process, and, on the other hand, eight-layer wiring is used in the 0.13 &#x3bc;m process. Besides, the thickness of wiring is also increased, and the distance from the micro-lens <b>106</b> to the photo-diode <b>102</b> is increased by a factor of three to five. Therefore, with the face side irradiation type pixel structure in which light is led to the light-receiving surface of the photo-diode <b>102</b> through the wiring layer according to the related art, it has come to be impossible to efficiently focus the light on the light-receiving surface of the photo-diode <b>102</b>, and, as a result, the above-mentioned problems {circle around (1)} to {circle around (6)} have come to be conspicuous.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">On the other hand, the charge transfer type solid state image pickup devices include the back side light reception type frame transfer CCD image sensor which receives light from the back side. In the back side light reception type frame transfer CCD image sensor, a silicon substrate is thinned to receive light on the rear side (back side), a signal charge obtained through photo-electric conversion inside silicon is caught by a depletion layer extending from the face side, is accumulated in a potential well on the face side and is outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An example of the sectional structure of a photo-diode in the back side light reception type frame transfer CCD image sensor is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this example, the photo-diode is composed of a P type region <b>303</b> at the surface on the side of an oxide film <b>302</b> provided with wirings or the like with respect to the silicon substrate <b>301</b>, and is covered by an N type well (epi layer) <b>304</b> through a depletion layer <b>305</b>. A reflective film <b>306</b> of aluminum is provided on the oxide film <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the case of the back side light reception type CCD image sensor having the above-mentioned structure, there is the problem that the sensitivity to blue light for which absorbance is high is lowered. In addition, the signal charge generated upon photoelectric conversion at a shallow position of the light incident on the rear side diffuses, to enter into photo-diodes in the surroundings at a certain ratio. In addition to these problems, the CCD image sensor is characterized in that the height of the wiring layer need not be enlarged because system-on-chip is not conducted, focusing by an on-chip lens is easy because a light-shielding film can be dropped into the surroundings of the photo-diode owing to an exclusive process, the above-mentioned problems {circle around (1)} to {circle around (6)} are not generated, and it is unnecessary to adopt the back side light reception structure. For these reasons, the back side light reception type CCD image sensor is rarely used at present.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the other hand, in the case of the CMOS image sensor, the process used is one obtained by minor modifications of a standard CMOS process, so that adoption of the back side light reception structure offers the merits that the process is not affected by a wiring step and the newest process can always be used, which merits cannot be obtained with the CCD image sensor. However, as contrasted to the CCD image sensor, the wirings are present in many layers in the form of crossing lines, so that the above-mentioned problems {circle around (1)} to {circle around (6)} appear conspicuously as the problems peculiar to the CMOS image sensor (and hence the X-Y address type solid state image pickup device represented by this).</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above-mentioned problems. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an X-Y address type solid state image pickup device represented by a CMOS image sensor in which miniaturization of pixels and a higher numerical aperture are made possible by adopting a back side light reception structure, and a method of producing the same.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Now, an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below referring to the drawings. In the present embodiment, a CMOS image sensor is taken as an example of the X-Y address type solid state image pickup device and will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a general constitutional diagram showing an example of the CMOS image sensor according to one embodiment of the present invention. As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this CMOS image sensor forms a pixel portion <b>11</b>, a vertical (V) selection circuit <b>12</b>, an S/H (Sample/Hold) &#x26; CDS (Correlated Double Sampling) circuit <b>13</b>, a horizontal (H) selection circuit <b>14</b>, a timing generator (TG) <b>15</b>, an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit <b>16</b>, an A/D converter circuit <b>17</b>, a digital amplifier <b>18</b> and the like, which are mounted on the same substrate (chip) <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The pixel portion <b>11</b> composes a multiplicity of unit pixels (described later) arranged in a matrix form, and wirings include address conductors and the like disposed on a row basis and vertical signal conductors disposed on a column basis. The vertical selection circuit <b>12</b> sequentially selects pixels on a row basis, and pixel signals are read from individual pixels in the selected row into the S/H &#x26; CDS circuit <b>13</b>. The S/H &#x26; CDS circuit <b>13</b> subtracts zero level from a signal level for each of the pixel signals read out, removes fixed pattern dispersion (noise) on a pixel basis, and holds the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The horizontal selection circuit <b>14</b> sequentially take out the pixel signals held in the S/H &#x26; CDS circuit <b>13</b>, and transfers the pixel signals to the AGC circuit <b>16</b>. The AGC circuit <b>16</b> amplifies the signals with an appropriate gain, and transfers the amplified signals to the A/D converter circuit <b>17</b>. The A/D converter circuit <b>17</b> converts the analog signals into digital signals, and transfers the digital signals to the digital amplifier <b>18</b>. The digital amplifier <b>18</b> amplifies the digital signals appropriately, and outputs the amplified digital signals. The operations of the vertical selection circuit <b>12</b>, the S/H &#x26; CDS circuit <b>13</b>, the horizontal selection circuit <b>14</b>, the AGC circuit <b>16</b>, the A/D converter circuit <b>17</b> and the digital amplifier <b>18</b> are performed based on various timing signals generated by the timing generator <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An example of circuit constitution of the unit pixel, which is a part peculiar to this CMOS image sensor, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As is clear from the figure, the unit pixel includes, for example, a photo-diode <b>21</b> as a photo-electric conversion device, and for the single photo-diode <b>21</b>, the unit pixel includes four transistors, namely, a transfer transistor <b>22</b>, an amplifying transistor <b>23</b>, an address transistor <b>24</b> and a reset transistor <b>25</b> as active devices.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The photo-diode <b>21</b> has its anode grounded, and performs photo-electric conversion for converting the incident light into an amount of charge (here, electrons) according to the amount of light. The transfer transistor <b>22</b> is connected between the cathode of the photo-diode <b>21</b> and a floating diffusion FD, and its gate is supplied with a transfer signal through a transfer wiring <b>26</b>, thereby transferring the electrons generated upon photo-electric conversion by the photo-diode <b>21</b> to the floating diffusion FD.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To the floating diffusion FD is connected the gate of the amplifying transistor <b>23</b>. The amplifying transistor <b>23</b> is connected to the vertical signal conductor <b>27</b> through the address transistor <b>24</b>, and constitutes a source follower together with a fixed current source I which is provided outside the pixel portion. When an address signal is given to the gate of the address transistor <b>24</b> through the address wiring <b>28</b> and the address transistor <b>24</b> is turned ON, the amplifying transistor <b>23</b> amplifies the potential of the floating diffusion FD and output a voltage according to the potential to the vertical signal conductor <b>27</b>. The vertical signal conductor <b>27</b> transmits the voltage outputted from each pixel to the S/H &#x26; CDS circuit <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The reset transistor <b>25</b> is connected between a power source Vdd and the floating diffusion FD, and its gate is supplied with a reset signal through a reset conductor <b>29</b>, thereby resetting the potential of the floating diffusion FD to the potential of the power source Vdd. These operations are conducted simultaneously for the individual pixels in one row, because the wirings <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> connected respectively to the gates of the transfer transistor <b>22</b>, the address transistor <b>24</b> and the reset transistor <b>25</b> are arranged on a row basis.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Here, as the wirings for the unit pixel, there are provided three wirings in the horizontal direction, namely, the transfer wiring <b>26</b>, the address wiring <b>28</b> and the reset wiring <b>29</b>, one wiring in the vertical direction, namely, the vertical signal conductor <b>27</b>, and, further, a Vdd supply wiring, an internal wiring for connecting the floating diffusion FD with the gate of the amplifying transistor <b>23</b>, and a two-dimensional wiring (not shown) used for a light-shielding film for a pixel boundary portion and a black level detecting pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view showing an example of the structures of the pixel portion and the peripheral circuit portion. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by polishing a wafer by CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing), a silicon (Si) layer (device layer) <b>31</b> having a thickness of about 10 to 20 &#x3bc;m is formed. The desirable range of the thickness is 5 to 15 &#x3bc;m for visible rays, 15 to 50 &#x3bc;m for infrared rays, and 3 to 7 &#x3bc;m for ultraviolet rays. The light-shielding film <b>33</b> is provided on one side of the silicon layer <b>31</b>, with an SiO2 film <b>32</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Different from the wirings, the light-shielding film <b>33</b> is laid out taking only optical elements into account. The light-shielding film <b>33</b> is provided with an opening portion <b>33</b>A. A silicon nitride film (SiN) <b>34</b> is provided on the light-shielding film <b>33</b> as a passivation film, and a color filter <b>35</b> and a micro-lens <b>36</b> are provided on the upper side of the opening portion <b>33</b>A. Namely, in this pixel structure, the light incident from one side of the silicon layer <b>31</b> is led to a light-receiving surface of the photo-diode <b>37</b> (described later) provided at the silicon layer <b>31</b> through the micro-lens <b>36</b> and the color filter <b>35</b>. A wiring layer <b>38</b> including transistors and metallic wirings therein is provided on the other side of the silicon layer <b>31</b>, and a substrate support member <b>39</b> is adhered to the lower side of the wiring layer <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Here, in the CMOS image sensor according to the related art, the face side light reception type pixel structure has been adopted in which the wiring layer is on the face side and incident light is taken in from the wiring layer side. On the other hand, in the CMOS image sensor according to the present embodiment, the back side light reception type pixel structure is adopted in which the incident light is taken in from the side (back side) opposite to the wiring layer <b>38</b>. As is clear from the back side light reception type pixel structure, only the light-shielding layer <b>33</b> is present as a metallic layer in the range from the micro-lens <b>36</b> to the photo-diode <b>37</b>, and the height of the light-shielding layer <b>33</b> from the photo-diode <b>37</b> is as small as the thickness of the SiO2 film <b>32</b> (for example, about 0.5 &#x3bc;m), so that limitations on focusing due to the scattering by metallic layers can be obviated.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional structural view showing an example of a well structure of the silicon layer <b>31</b>, in which the same portions as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are denoted by the same symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this example, an N type substrate <b>41</b> is used. The thickness of the silicon layer <b>31</b> is desirably 5 to 15 &#x3bc;m for visible rays, as described above; in this example, it is 10 &#x3bc;m. By this, good photo-electric conversion of visible rays can be achieved. On one side of the silicon layer <b>31</b>, a shallow P<sup>+</sup> layer <b>42</b> is provided over the entire area of the pixel portion. A pixel isolation region is formed of a deep P well <b>43</b>, which is connected to the P<sup>+</sup> layer <b>42</b> on the one side.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The photo-diode <b>37</b> is formed by utilizing the N type substrate <b>41</b>, namely, by not providing the P well there. This N<sup>&#x2212;</sup> type region (substrate) <b>41</b> is the photo-electric conversion region, and it is completely depleted because it is small in area and concentration. An N<sup>+</sup> region <b>44</b> for accumulating the signal charge (in this example, electrons) is provided on the N<sup>&#x2212;</sup> type region (substrate) <b>41</b>, and, further, a P<sup>+</sup> layer <b>45</b> for forming an embedded photo-diode is provided thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the photo-diode <b>37</b> is so formed as to be greater in surface area on the light-receiving surface side than on the side of the wiring layer <b>38</b>. With this structure, the incident light can be taken in efficiently. The signal charge obtained through photo-electric conversion by the photo-diode <b>37</b> and accumulated in the N<sup>+</sup> region <b>44</b> is transferred to the FD (floating diffusion) <b>47</b> composed of N<sup>+</sup> type region by a transfer transistor <b>46</b> (the transfer transistor <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The photo-diode <b>37</b> side and the FD <b>47</b> are electrically isolated from each other by a P<sup>&#x2212;</sup> layer <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The other transistors (the amplifying transistor <b>23</b>, the address transistor <b>24</b> and the reset transistor <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) than the transfer transistor <b>46</b> in the pixel are formed in the deep P well <b>43</b>, in the same manner as usual. On the other hand, as for the peripheral circuit region, a P well <b>49</b> is formed with such a depth as not to reach the P<sup>+</sup> layer <b>42</b> on the back side, an N well <b>50</b> is further formed inside the P well <b>49</b>, and a CMOS circuit is formed in the region of these wells <b>49</b>, <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, an example of layout of the pixels will be described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the same portions as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are denoted by the same symbols. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a plan pattern diagram showing active regions (regions of gate oxide film), gate (polysilicon) electrodes, and contact portions of both of them. As is clear from the figure, one photo-diode (PD) <b>21</b> and four transistors <b>22</b> to <b>25</b> exist per unit pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a plan pattern diagram showing metallic wirings above the gate electrodes and contact portions therebetween, together with the active regions. Here, the metallic wirings (for example, aluminum wirings) have a three-layer structure, in which the first layer is used as in-pixel wirings, the second layer is used as wirings in the vertical direction, namely, as vertical signal conductors <b>27</b> and drain conductors, and the third layer is used as wirings in the horizontal direction, namely, transfer wirings <b>26</b>, address wirings <b>28</b>, and reset wirings <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As is clear from the wiring pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the vertical signal conductor <b>27</b>, the transfer wiring <b>26</b>, the address wiring <b>28</b> and the reset wiring <b>29</b> are arranged on the photo-diode region. In the conventional pixel structure, namely, in the face side light reception type pixel structure in which light is taken in from the wiring layer side, these wirings have been laid out by avoiding the photo-diode region. On the other hand, in the pixel structure according to this embodiment, as is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the back side light reception type pixel structure is adopted in which the light is taken in from the opposite side (back side) of the wiring layer, so that the wirings can be laid out on the photo-diode region.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As has been described above, in the X-Y address type solid state image pickup device represented by the CMOS image sensor, the back side light reception type pixel structure is adopted in which visible light is received from the back side of the photo-diodes <b>37</b>. Therefore, the need for wiring by taking the light-receiving surface into account as in the conventional face side light reception type pixel structure is eliminated, so that the degree of freedom in wiring for pixels is enhanced, miniaturization of the pixels can be contrived, and the system can be produced by an advanced CMOS process with an increased number of wiring layers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, since the photo-diode <b>37</b> is formed with such a depth as to reach the P<sup>+</sup> layer <b>45</b> on the back side, the sensitivity to blue light for which absorbance is high is enhanced. Besides, since photo-electric conversion at a deeper portion than the photo-diode <b>37</b> does not occur, it is possible to obviate color mixture and erroneous detection of black level which might otherwise be generated. Further, as is clear particularly from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the wiring layer <b>38</b> is not present on the light-receiving surface side, so that it is possible to provide the light-shielding film <b>33</b>, the color filter <b>35</b> and the micro-lens <b>36</b> at lower positions relative to the light-receiving surface. Accordingly, the problems of lowering of sensitivity, color mixture, and reduction of light amount at peripheral areas as encountered in the related art can be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, the process for fabricating the CMOS image sensor having the back side light reception type pixel structure constituted as described above will be described referring to the step diagrams shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">First, a device isolator and a gate electrode (polysilicon electrode) are formed at a surface of an N<sup>&#x2212;</sup> type substrate <b>51</b>, then the deep P well <b>43</b> at the pixel portion, the shallow P<sup>+</sup> layer <b>42</b> at the photo-diode portion, the shallow P well <b>49</b> at the peripheral circuit portion and the N well <b>50</b> as above-mentioned are formed by ion implantation, and, further, transistors and pixel active regions and the like are formed by the same step as that for the conventional CMOS image sensor (Step 1). At this time, the substrate <b>51</b> is trenched by about several tens of &#x3bc;m for forming a register mark for the back side.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, the first to third layers of metallic wiring (<b>1</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>A<b>1</b>), a pad (PAD) <b>52</b> and an interlayer insulating film <b>53</b> are provided on the surface of the substrate <b>51</b> (Step 2). At this time, for example, tungsten (W) or aluminum (Al) is embedded in the register mark portion for back side which has been trenched in Step 1, thereby forming the register mark <b>54</b>. Subsequently, a first substrate support member (for example, glass, silicon, an organic film or the like) <b>55</b>A is made to flow on the upper surface of the wiring layer in a thickness of several hundreds of &#x3bc;m (Step 3). At this time, the upper side of the pad <b>52</b> is preliminarily masked with a resist <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, the resist <b>56</b> on the upper side of the pad <b>52</b> is removed, and a surface treatment is conducted to cause a metal to flow into the bump thus formed (Step 4). Subsequently, an electrical conductor <b>57</b> is caused to flow into the bump opening on the upper side of the pad <b>52</b> and on the surface of the first substrate support member <b>55</b>A (Step 5). Thereafter, the electrical conductor <b>57</b> on the surface of the substrate support member <b>55</b> is removed, leaving only the portion on the upper side of the pad <b>52</b> (Step 6). The left portion becomes a pad <b>52</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, a second substrate support member <b>55</b>B is caused to flow for protecting the pad <b>52</b>&#x2032; during processing of the back side and for planarization of the surface, then polishing is conducted, the wafer is turned upside down, and polishing is conducted by CMP until the thickness of the substrate <b>51</b> becomes about 10 &#x3bc;m (Step 7). Subsequently, an SiO2 film is formed in a thickness of about 10 nm by CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition), then a resist is applied according to the register mark <b>54</b>, and the entire surface of the pixel portion is dosed with boron so that the SiO2 interface is filled with positive holes (Step 8). In Step 8, further, an SiO2 film <b>58</b> is formed by CVD on the back side in a thickness of about 500 nm, then a light-shielding film <b>59</b> is formed by use of Al or W, and thereafter a plasma SiN film is formed as a passivation film <b>60</b> by CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, a color filter <b>61</b> and a micro-lens <b>62</b> are formed by the same method as in the case of the conventional CMOS image sensor (Step 9). At this time, stepper registration is conducted by use of the register mark <b>54</b> or by use of the light-shielding film <b>59</b>. Subsequently, the second substrate support member <b>55</b>B on the pad <b>52</b>&#x2032; is removed by etching, to expose the pad <b>52</b>&#x2032; (Step 10). In this case, if required, the second substrate support member <b>55</b>B is polished to a desired thickness for registration of the micro-lens <b>62</b> and for planarization of the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the method described above, the back side light reception type pixel structure can be produced easily. In addition, a structure in which the pad <b>52</b>&#x2032; is exposed on the side opposite to the light-receiving surface. Therefore, the present CMOS image sensor can be mounted directly on the substrate in the condition where the light-receiving surface is directed upwards.</p>
