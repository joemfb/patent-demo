<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The following generally relates to an optical detection system and is described with a particular application to DNA analysis. However, the following is also amenable to other applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A micro-channel device includes one or more micro (sub-millimeter) channels through which one or more small volumes of samples are routed for processing and/or analysis. An example of such a device includes a sample carrier such as a biochip, a lab-on-a-chip, and/or other micro-channel device. An application in which a micro-channel device has been used is DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing generally is a method for determining an order of nucleotide bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine) of DNA in a sample of DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For DNA sequencing, the DNA in the sample is lysed, producing fragments of sequences of the four nucleotides. The fragments are replicated through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and labeled with target specific fluorescent dyes (e.g., one for each nucleotide base), each dye having a different spectral emission characteristic (e.g., wavelength, frequency, energy and color). The labeled fragments are separated by size through electrophoresis. The DNA fragments are sequenced based on the spectral characteristics of the dyes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such sequencing has included using an optical detection system to illuminate the fragments with an excitation signal and detect fluoresced radiation from the dyes of the fragments. The detected spectral information is used to identify the nucleotides and sequence the DNA. However, only about five percent (5%) of the excitation signal is absorbed by the dyes; the other ninety-five percent (95%) traverses the sample carrier and can produce background signal, stray light, and noise inside the optical system, which may be detected along with the fluoresced radiation, which may negatively impact DNA sequencing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One approach to mitigating the above includes placing a mirror behind the sample carrier to direct excitation signal traversing the sample carrier towards a &#x201c;black box&#x201d; collector, where the signal is collected and trapped. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example in which a portion <b>102</b> of an excitation signal <b>104</b> traversing a sample carrier <b>106</b> is directed by a mirror <b>108</b> to a collector <b>110</b>. Emission <b>112</b> represents signal emitted by a sample (carried by the sample carrier <b>106</b>) in response to absorbing the excitation signal <b>104</b>. Unfortunately, the mirror <b>108</b> and the collector <b>110</b> consume space. For example, in one instance, the mirror <b>108</b> and the collector <b>110</b> collectively occupy a volume on the order of about two inches by two inches by a half an inch (2&#x2033;&#xd7;2&#x2033;&#xd7;0.5&#x2033;). Furthermore, the mirror <b>108</b> and the collector <b>110</b> increase overall system cost. At least in view of the foregoing, there is an unresolved need for other approaches for mitigating the excitation signal traversing the sample carrier without being absorbed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects of the application address the above matters, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, an optical detection system includes a sample carrier receiving region that receives a sample carrier carrying a sample. The system further includes a source that emits an excitation signal having a wavelength within a predetermined wavelength range. The excitation signal illuminates the sample carrier. A first sub-portion of the excitation signal is absorbed by the sample, which emits characteristic radiation in response thereto. A second sub-portion of the excitation signal traverses the sample carrier. The system further includes a detector that detects the characteristic radiation. The system further includes an absorber that absorbs the excitation signal traversing the sample carrier without being absorbed by the sample or sample carrier. The absorber absorbs at least 95% of the excitation signal traversing the sample carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, a method includes illuminating a sample carrier with an excitation signal. The sample carrier carries a sample. A first sub-portion of the excitation signal is absorbed by the sample, which emits characteristic radiation in response thereto. A second sub-portion of the excitation signal traverses the sample carrier. The method further includes detecting, via a detector, the characteristic radiation. The method further includes absorbing via an absorber the excitation signal traversing the sample carrier. The absorber absorbs at least 95% of the excitation signal traversing the sample carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, a device configured to sequence DNA includes an optical detection system with a source that emits an excitation signal that illuminates a sample carrier carrying a plurality of DNA fragments labeled with amino acid specific fluorescent dyes, wherein a first sub-portion of the excitation signal is absorbed by the dyes, which emit characteristic radiation in response thereto, and a second sub-portion of the excitation signal traverses the sample carrier and an absorber that absorbs a portion of the excitation signal that traverses the sample carrier without being absorbed, wherein the absorber has a reflectance of less than a half a percent.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example optical detection system <b>200</b>. The optical detection system <b>200</b> may be a stand alone system or part of another system such as a sample processor and/or analyzer, including, but not limited to, a DNA sequencer and/or other apparatus. The optical detection system <b>200</b> includes a sample carrier support region <b>202</b>, which is configured to receive and support a sample carrier <b>204</b> for processing sample carried thereby. Examples of a suitable sample carrier include, but are not limited to, micro-channel devices such as a lab-on-a-chip (LOC), a biochip, micro-fluidic arrays, and/or other micro-channel devices and/or sample carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The sample carrier <b>204</b> is configured to carry one or more samples for processing. A non-limiting example of a suitable sample includes a bio-sample such as one or more labeled DNA fragment and/or other sample. A suitable label includes a fluorescent or other material that absorbs an incident excitation signal (electromagnetic radiation) and emits a corresponding characteristic signal. In the context of DNA analysis, the label may include at least four different fluorescent dyes, each dye being target specific, binding to a different one of the four nucleotide bases (adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T)), and emitting or fluorescing characteristic radiation. One or more other dyes may also be included. For example, a calibration dye may also be included.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An electromagnetic radiation source (source) <b>206</b> generates and transmits an excitation signal <b>208</b> (electromagnetic radiation). An example of a suitable source <b>206</b> is a laser that transmits within a known electromagnetic radiation range (e.g., 488 nm, 532 nm, etc.). Other sources, including non-laser sources such as a light emitting diode (LED), an incandescent light, etc. are also contemplated herein. A source controller <b>210</b> controls the source <b>206</b>, including activating the source <b>206</b> to transmit, adjusting the output power of the source <b>206</b>, pulsing transmission, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A beam reflector <b>212</b> such as a mirror or other reflector directs the transmitted signal <b>208</b> along a transmission path <b>214</b> from the reflector <b>212</b> to the sample carrier <b>204</b>, for example, to a channel of the sample carrier <b>204</b> carrying a sample. The reflector <b>212</b> is movably mounted, and a reflector controller <b>216</b> is configured to controllably rotate, pivot or tilt the reflector <b>212</b> to scan or move the transmission path <b>214</b> across the sample carrier <b>204</b>. In one non-limiting instance, the reflector <b>212</b> is mounted on an end of a rotary shaft and the controller <b>216</b> includes an electromagnetic device such as a closed loop Galvanometer that controllably deflects the shaft to move the reflector <b>212</b> and scan over the sample carrier <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A lens <b>218</b> is disposed between the sample carrier <b>204</b> and the reflector <b>212</b> in the transmission path <b>214</b> and is configured to focus the excitation signal <b>208</b> at the sample carrier <b>204</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the lens <b>218</b> focuses the excitation signal <b>208</b> such that it travels in a direction perpendicular towards the sample carrier <b>204</b>. The lens <b>218</b> also collects fluorescent radiation emitted from the sample carrier <b>204</b> back along a signal collection path <b>220</b>. The illustrated lens <b>218</b> includes a biconvex lens. However, other lenses such as a plano-convex or other lens that can suitably focus the excitation signal are also contemplated herein. Moreover, the lens <b>218</b> may include more than one lens. Furthermore, in another embodiment, the lens <b>218</b> is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A filter <b>222</b> is disposed between the lens <b>218</b> and the reflector <b>212</b> in the transmission and collection paths <b>214</b> and <b>220</b>. The filter <b>222</b> is configured to filter radiation traversing the transmission path <b>212</b> such that substantially only excitation electromagnetic radiation having predetermined spectral characteristics of interest passes through the filter <b>222</b>. The filter <b>222</b> is also configured to filter radiation traversing the collection path <b>220</b> such that substantially only electromagnetic radiation having predetermined spectral characteristics of interest is directed along the collection path <b>220</b>. An example of a suitable filter includes a dichroic filter, band-pass filter, or other filter that selectively passes electromagnetic radiation based on spectral characteristics while reflecting other electromagnetic radiation based on spectral characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An absorber <b>224</b> includes a material that absorbs a portion <b>226</b> of the excitation signal <b>214</b> that traverses through the sample carrier <b>204</b> without being absorbed. As described in greater detail below, the absorber <b>224</b> is angularly oriented with respect to a direction of the excitation signal <b>226</b> traversing the sample carrier without being absorbed such that a predetermined amount (e.g., 90%, 95%, 99% or other percent) of the excitation signal <b>226</b> that traverses through the sample carrier <b>204</b> without being absorbed is absorbed by the absorber <b>224</b>. In one instance, this allows for removing a substantial amount (e.g., 90%, 95%, 99%, etc.) of signal that might cause background, stray light, and/or noise in the optical detection system <b>200</b>, mitigating the negative affects therefrom. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the absorber <b>224</b> requires less space and is less expensive than a configuration in which the system <b>200</b> includes a conventional mirror and black box collector.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A detector <b>228</b> is configured to detect electromagnetic radiation having spectral properties of interest and traversing the collection path <b>220</b> and to generate a signal indicative thereof. The detector <b>228</b> may include a photo-multiplier tube (PMT), a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, or the like, and may be tunable or fixed. As described herein, the radiation characteristic of the sample carried by the sample carrier <b>204</b> is of interest and thus the detector <b>228</b> is configured to detect radiation having spectral properties corresponding to those of the sample carried by the sample carrier <b>204</b>. In one embodiment, the detector <b>228</b> includes a plurality of sub-detectors, each configured to detect different bands of radiation within the range of interest. A detector controller <b>230</b> controls the detector <b>228</b>. Such control includes, but is not limited to, adjusting the gain, activating and deactivating channels of the detector <b>228</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A lens <b>232</b> is disposed between the filter <b>222</b> and the detector <b>228</b>. The lens <b>232</b> focuses the radiation with respect to the detector <b>228</b>. Similar to the lens <b>218</b>, the lens <b>232</b> includes a biconvex lens, but alternatively can include other lenses such as a plano-convex or other lens that suitably focuses the radiation with respect to the detector <b>228</b>. A filter <b>234</b> is disposed between the lens <b>232</b> and the filter <b>222</b>. The filter <b>234</b> is configured to pass the radiation traversing the collection path and having predetermined spectral characteristics of interest and attenuate and/or reflect other electromagnetic radiation. In another embodiment, the filter <b>234</b> can be omitted. The collection path <b>220</b> is shown only for the particular scan location.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A processor <b>236</b> controls the detector controller <b>230</b>, the source controller <b>210</b>, and/or the reflector controller <b>216</b>. The processor <b>236</b> and/or one or more processor local to the system <b>200</b>, local to an apparatus including the system <b>200</b>, and/or external and remote from the system may be configured to process detected signals, which can be stored in storage <b>238</b>. In the context of processing samples, this may include sequencing DNA for DNA samples, and/or other processing.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically illustrates an example of the absorber <b>224</b> in connection with the sample carrier <b>206</b> and the excitation radiation <b>226</b> traversing the sample carrier <b>206</b> without being absorbed by a sample carried by the sample carrier <b>206</b> for a particular excitation signal wavelength and absorber geometry. However, it is to be understood that this example is provided for explanatory purposes and is not limiting, and other excitation signal wavelengths and/or absorbers are contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrated embodiment, the source <b>206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) includes a narrow beam (e.g., 10 to 100 micron diameter) 488 nanometer (&#xb1;5 nm) <b>200</b> (&#x2dc;160) milliwatt laser. The excitation signal is linearly polarized and the polarization orientation is parallel to a plane of incidence of the absorber <b>224</b>. The sample carrier <b>206</b> has length <b>300</b> of approximately 3.2 millimeters long and includes 16 channels, each configured to carry a sample. Sample carriers having other geometry and/or with more or less channels are also contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The illustrated absorber <b>224</b> includes silicon (Si) with a refraction (n) at 488 nm of: n=4.422+0.0163i, where 4.422 is the refraction index and 0.0163 corresponds to an absorption coefficient of silicon. A geometry of the illustrated absorber <b>224</b> is approximately 10 mm long by 20 mm wide by one millimeter thick (10&#xd7;20&#xd7;1 mm). Such geometry is substantially smaller than that of a conventional mirror and collector sub-system (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In other embodiments, the absorber <b>224</b> has other geometry. The illustrated absorber <b>224</b> can dissipate one or more watts of laser power.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this example, the absorber <b>224</b> is oriented such that an angle &#x3b1; is about seventy-seven and four tenths (77.4) degrees. Note that the angle &#x3b1; is an angle between the excitation signal <b>226</b> and a normal to a surface <b>308</b> of incidence of the absorber <b>224</b>. In this configuration, more than 99% of the excitation radiation <b>226</b> traversing the sample carrier without being absorbed by the sample is absorbed in the absorber <b>224</b> as shown at <b>304</b> and less then 1% of the excitation radiation portion <b>226</b> is reflected as shown at <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Various approaches can be utilized to determine cc. The following discusses a theoretical approach based on Maxwell's and Fresnel's equations. From these equations, when light moves from a medium of a given refractive index n<sub>1 </sub>into a second medium with a given refractive index n<sub>2</sub>, both reflection and refraction of the light may occur. The angles that the incident, reflected and refracted rays make to a normal of the interface between the media can be represented as &#x3b8;<sub>i</sub>, &#x3b8;<sub>r </sub>and &#x3b8;<sub>t</sub>, respectively. The relationship between these angles is given by the law of reflection: &#x3b8;<sub>i</sub>=&#x3b8;<sub>r</sub>; and Snell's law: sin(&#x3b8;<sub>i</sub>)/sin(&#x3b8;<sub>t</sub>)=n<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The fraction of the incident power that is reflected from the interface is given by the reflectance R and the fraction that is refracted is given by the transmittance T. For this example, the media are assumed to be non-magnetic. The calculations of R and T depend on polarization of the incident ray. If the light is polarized with the electric field of the light perpendicular to the plane of the incidence (s-polarized), the reflection coefficient R can be determined by Equations 1:</p>

For this example, the media are air (with a refraction index is n=1) and the silicon absorber <b>224</b> (with the complex refraction index of n=4.422+0.0163i, again, where 4.422 is refraction index and 0.0163 is the absorption coefficient of silicon at 488 nm).
</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The reflectance of 488 nm wavelength of light from the surface <b>308</b> varies with incident angle. An example of this is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, where a y-axis <b>402</b> represents reflectance and an x-axis <b>404</b> represents angle of incidence. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a P-polarization component <b>406</b> has a minimal reflectance <b>408</b> of approximately 0.2%, at incident angle of approximately 77.4 degrees, and an S-polarization component <b>410</b> has a reflectance that increases with incident angle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the same information, except that a y-axis <b>502</b> is represented in a logarithmic scale instead of a linear scale like the y-axis <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Variations are discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> show examples where the material of the absorber <b>224</b> is silicon, other materials are also contemplated herein. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, materials with a minimal reflectance of less than five percent (5.0%) such as less than two percent (2.0%), less than one percent (1.0%), less than a half a percent (0.5%) or less than any other percent between zero (0.0%) and five percent (5.0%) for an angle &#x3b1; in an angular range from 0 to 90 degrees. The actual reflectance of various materials is determined by EQUATIONS 1 and 2.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the above, the reflectance of a 488 nm wavelength of light from the silicon surface <b>308</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> as a function of incident angle. Equations 1 and 2 can also be utilized to determine the reflectance for other wavelengths. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows how reflectance of 532 nm light from the silicon surface. Here, a P-polarization component <b>602</b> has a minimal reflectance <b>604</b> of approximately 0.2% at incident angle of approximately 76.0 degrees, and an S-polarization component <b>606</b> reflectance increases with incident angle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the same information, except that a y-axis <b>702</b> is represented in a logarithmic scale instead of a linear scale like the y-axis <b>602</b>. Note that the angle at which minimal reflectance occurs shift s with laser wavelength (77.4 degrees for 488 nm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>), and 76.0 degrees fro 532 nm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>)).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the absorber <b>224</b> is angularly oriented in accordance with the minimal reflectance of approximately 77.4 degrees. However, the absorber <b>224</b> does not have to be orientated as such and can alternatively be angularly oriented from 0 to 90 degrees with respect to the axis. Thus, where the minimal reflectance is not achievable or not desired, another angle can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the system <b>200</b> is configured for a 488 nm laser and a silicon absorber <b>224</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a system <b>800</b>, which is substantially similar to the system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the source <b>206</b> is controllable so that it can emit at one of a plurality different wavelengths and the absorber <b>224</b> is configured so that it can pivot or rotate under control of the absorber controller <b>802</b>. In this embodiment, a user can identify a particular wavelength of interests to use through a user input <b>804</b>. The processor <b>236</b> then accesses a look up table (LUT) <b>806</b> to determine an appropriate angle for the absorber <b>224</b> based on the selected wavelength. The processor <b>236</b> conveys a signal to the absorber controller <b>802</b>, which pivots or rotates the absorber <b>224</b> based on the angle. In another embodiment, the processor <b>236</b> uses Equations 1 and 2 to dynamically calculate the angle on the fly in real time or off line.</p>
