<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to drilling holes in composite materials such as carboresin laminates and particularly laminates having a resin reinforced with carbon fibers of graphic structure and laminates called carboresins formed by graphite fibers embedded in a matrix of epoxy resin. Materials of the beforementioned type are widely used in the aircraft industry to drill clean holes without de-lamination. Such a drill is used to form a multitude of relatively small diameter holes in building aircraft and heretofore drills used for forming holes in laminate used in that industry have short effective working life. Thus there is not only a need for a drill capable of rapidly forming clean small diameter holes in carboresins and the like materials, but also a need for such a drill which has a long effective working life.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The illustrated drill using this invention has four helical flutes and four lands having a left hand helix between 5 and 9 degrees. The herein illustrated drill is a 12 centimeter diameter drill with flutes and lands extending 90 centimeters from the cutting tip of the drill to its shank. In the illustrated embodiment of the invention, a pair of diametrically opposite lands terminate at the 120 degree tip of the drill in a pair of cutting edges extending radially outward in opposite directions from near the center of the drill in substantially parallel axial planes. The cutting edges slope rearwardly and radially outward from the tip of the drill to diametrically opposite lands at an angle of approximately 60 degrees to the drill axis thereby providing a 120 degree point or tip angle. Axial movement of cut material from the cutting edges is facilitated by a pair of passageways or notches formed by flat axially extending surfaces which slope extending axially rearwardly from the cutting edges of the drill and substantially flat slope surfaces at an obtuse angle of 120&#xb0; angles to the, respective, axially extending surfaces. The slope surfaces extend axially rearwardly from the tip at 40&#xb0; angles, respectively, to a plane through the drill axis at right angle to the parallel cutting edges. The slope surfaces junction with diametrical opposite flutes, respectively. At the cutting end of the drill, the lands slope to the cutting edges of the tip in a reduced diameter fashion at a slope radius as great as 20 inches. The junction area of the sloping segments with the non sloping segments of the lands results in a somewhat uneven radially outward facing contour. The uneven contour is smoothly contoured by surface machining the junction area at a greater radius than the slope radius. The hereinafter described construction of the working end of the drill results in a drill which cuts clean holes in carboresin laminates and with minimal wear of the drill. The cutting capability of the drill together with its superior ability to efficiently move the cut material axially, greatly reduces the time required for forming the holes. The improved cutting action and the efficient movement of cut material reduces the heat generation of the drilling operation and results in greatly increased the working life of the drill. Users of the drill have reported drill life of 5 or more times that achieved with other drills sold for use in forming holes in the same carboresin material.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a prior art drill <b>19</b> having a conventional tip <b>20</b> and a straight line taper <b>21</b> from the uniform diameter body portion <b>22</b> of the drill <b>19</b> to the 120 degree tip <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the working end of the drill <b>19</b>&#x2032; of the present invention wherein the transition on taper or transition portion <b>21</b>&#x2032; from its uniform body diameter portion <b>22</b>&#x2032; to its 120 degree tip <b>20</b>&#x2032; is curved radially on a radius R, which accelerates enlargement of the hole being drilled. The before mentioned feature of this invention is further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> wherein the transition area <b>23</b> between the tip and the uniform or constant body diameter portion <b>22</b>&#x2032; is further modified by machining the outer diameter of the drill at the junction area between the constant diameter portion <b>19</b> and the transition portion <b>21</b>&#x2032; at a radius R&#x2032; to remove material <b>23</b> to make the rate of increase in the diameter of cut more gradual, thereby more evenly distributing the cutting generated heat at the junction area with a resulting increase in working life of the drill.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show the four lands <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> and the four flutes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> of the drill <b>19</b>&#x2032;. The lands have a 5 degree helix angle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows land <b>31</b> and its radial rake angle <b>41</b>, its margin <b>42</b> and its margin relief angle <b>43</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> shows a &#xbd; inch diameter drill <b>19</b>&#x2032; of the present invention, which has a 3 inch long shank <b>46</b> and lands <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> extending axially 3 inches from the shank <b>46</b> to the unique cutting tip <b>20</b>&#x2032;. Lands <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> of the drill taper radially inward toward the cutting end of the drill <b>19</b>&#x2032; and terminate in a pair of cutting blades <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> presenting cutting edges <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> lying in parallel axially extending planes. The cutting edges <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> are interconnected by a very short transverse chisel edge <b>56</b> intersecting the drill axis <b>57</b>. Material cut by the cutting edges <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> is transferred to flutes <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> by notches <b>62</b>, <b>61</b> formed between the cutting edges <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> and the flutes <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 10</figref>, the notch <b>61</b> is formed by a flat face <b>67</b> extending axially rearwardly from the cutting edge <b>54</b> and a flat ramp <b>68</b> extending from the flat face <b>67</b> at an obtuse angle of 120 degrees and sloping axially from near the bit tip <b>56</b> of the flute <b>38</b> at a 45&#xb0; angle. Notch <b>62</b> is formed in a similar manner by flat face <b>66</b> and inclined flat ramp <b>69</b> thereby providing a large passageward for movement of material cut by the cutting edge <b>53</b> to the flute <b>36</b>. Formation of the notches <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> with their flat ramps <b>68</b>, <b>69</b> removes part of the forward ends of the lands <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and thus the lands <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> do not help in initiating the formation of a drilled hole but do assist in enlarging the opening formed by cutting edges <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> to the hole size created by full insertion of the drill <b>19</b>&#x2032; in the hole being formed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The herein disclosed drill has proven to be an efficient durable tool for forming holes in carboresin materials used in the manufacture of aircraft. The working life of this tool greatly exceeds that of drills marketed by other manufactures. The improved cutting action of the tip, the efficient transfer of cut material to the flutes and the improved cutting action of transition portion of the lands to the constant diameter portion of the drill contribute to more efficient cutting and conveying of cut material which results in reduced drill temperature and greatly increased drill life.</p>
