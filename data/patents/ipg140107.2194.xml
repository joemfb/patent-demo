<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to the field of immunotherapeutics. More specifically, the invention relates to antigens for generating monoclonal antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies that can neutralize autoimmune and cancer cells, and can neutralize the inflammatory response.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various publications, including patents, published applications, technical articles and scholarly articles are cited throughout the specification. Each of these cited publications is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety and for all purposes</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several disease-associated antigens are currently being targeted using therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) because of their unique pharmacological and safety profiles. Among the disease-associated target antigens are CD20, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors (EGFR), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was originally discovered as a protein with the capacity to generate both granulocyte and macrophage colonies from precursor cells in mouse bone marrow, and was accordingly named (Burgess et al. (1980) Blood 56:947-58.). Subsequent studies have demonstrated a role of GM-CSF in potentiating the function of mature macrophages and granulocytes (Handman and Burgess (1979) J. Immunol. 122:1134-1137; Hamilton et al. (1980) J. Cell Physiol. 103:435-445; Gamble et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:8667-8671), suggesting a role for GM-CSF in inflammatory responses (Hamilton et al. (1980) J. Cell Physiol. 103:435-445). As the molecule was studied it became clear that GM-CSF has other functions arising from its ability to affect the properties of more mature myeloid cells such as granulocytes, macrophages and eosinophils. The functions of GM-CSF are mediated by binding to CD116, the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor, also known as colony stimulating factor 2 receptor alpha that binds GM-CSF with low affinity. The beta subunit, called CD131, which is also shared with the IL3 and IL5 receptors, has no detectable binding activity for GM-CSF by itself but is necessary for high affinity binding when in association with the alpha subunit and plays a fundamental role in signal transduction. The GM-CSF receptors are found on myeloid progenitors and mature myeloid cells including neutrophils, eosinophils, mononuclear phagocytes, and monocytes. In addition, GM-CSF receptor subunits have been shown to be present in normal, non-hematopoietic tissues such as human placenta, endothelium, and oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">GM-CSF plays a major biological role in the generation of granulocytes and macrophages from early bone marrow progenitors within the bone marrow. What was not appreciated at first but later uncovered was additional physiological functions of GM-CSF in host responses to external stimuli and in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. In very early studies, GM-CSF was purified from lung tissue-conditioned medium following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection into mice (Burgess et al. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252:1998-2003). GM-CSF is considered by many investigators to be one of the major regulators of granulocyte, macrophage and eosinophil lineage cell number and activation state under normal physiological conditions. However, it has also been hypothesized that aberrant expression of GM-CSF may lead to altered immune and inflammatory responses with associated pathologic consequences. It was suggested several years ago that GM-CSF should be viewed as a proinflammatory cytokine (Hamilton et al., 1980, J. Cell Physiol. 103:435-445). Furthermore, GM-CSF may play a role in the diathesis of a multitude of human inflammatory pathologies, such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune pathologies, inflammatory renal disease and inflammatory lung disorders such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Interestingly, it has been proposed that there is a link between multiple sclerosis and GM-CSF (McQualter et al. (2001) J. Exp. Med., 194:873-881). In an experimental model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis, GM-CSF was found to be involved in the autoimmune-mediated demyelination.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In vivo studies following monocyte, macrophage and neutrophil treatment with GM-CSF have demonstrated that GM-CSF can activate these cell types and prolong their survival characteristics. Moreover, GM-CSF exposure results in release of inflammatory mediators from these cell types, and further studies have demonstrated the ability of these cells to kill certain organisms and even tumor cells (Hamilton (1993) Immunol. Today 14:18-24; Hamilton, (1993) Lancet 342:536-539; Takahashi, (1993) Blood 81:357-364). To determine if the in vivo studies were indicative of the function of GM-CSF in vivo, systemic administration was performed with rodents. It was shown that artificially increasing circulating levels of GM-CSF by intraperitoneal administration of the protein did result in increased numbers of both circulating neutrophils and cycling peritoneal macrophages and that there was an increase in the development and differentiation of CD5+ macrophages in the peritoneal cavity of rodents (Metcalf et al., (1987) Exp. Hematol. 15:1-9).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has also been shown that GM-CSF can &#x201c;prime&#x201d; cells to respond in a more robust, synergistic manner to a second stimulus, such as LPS or interferon-gamma (Hart et al., 1988, J. Immunol. 141:1516-1521). Mice can be primed both in vitro as well as in vivo with GM-CSF so that they produce increased levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines following subsequent challenge with LPS or TNF-alpha.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a clinical setting, administration of GM-CSF into peritoneal dialysis patients resulted in a marked recruitment of macrophages (Selgas et al., 1996, Kidney Int. 50:2070-2078). Interestingly, and as predicted from the rodent studies, administration of GM-CSF in a clinical setting can result in accentuated production of inflammatory cytokines and potential unwanted side effects. For example, when patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with GM-CSF to correct the neutropenia associated with Felty's syndrome, their arthritis was exacerbated (Hazenberg et al., 1991, Blood 74:2769-2770). In another clinical setting, following cancer chemotherapy, GM-CSF treatment made rheumatoid arthritis worse (de Vries et al., (1991) J. Immunol. 163: 4985-4993). Systemic administration of GM-CSF to human donors increased the ability of isolated granulocytes to produce superoxide, and both accentuated the cytotoxicity of circulating monocytes as well as led to an increase in the number of monocytes (Perkins et al., 1993, Am J. Hematol. 43:279-285). Aberrant expression of GM-CSF is associated with disease of the lung in human as well. For example, it appears that upregulation of GM-CSF in the lung by minor irritants, endotoxins or infections predisposes towards TH2 immune deviation and asthma (Eisenbarth et al. (2002) J. Exp. Med. 196:1645-1651). The studies summarized above suggest that GM-CSF plays a role in the activation of the inflammatory process through cell recruitment, increased cell survival and/or priming for activation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Several association and experimental data suggest a role for GM-CSF in asthma. The use of neutralizing antibodies in a mouse model of asthma have demonstrated the ability to suppress asthmatic phenotypes (Yamashita (2002) Cell Immunol. 219:92), while several studies measuring cytokines in BAL fluid of asthmatic patients have found an increase in GM-CSF (Gajewska (2003) Curr Drug Targets Inflamm Allergy 2:279).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease for which there is ample evidence that GM-CSF may be involved. GM-CSF has been found at elevated levels in RA lesions (Xu et al. (1989) J. Clin. Invest. 83:876) and is produced in vitro by resident joint cells (chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts) following their stimulation with inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha (Leizer et al. (1990) Blood 76:1989). Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in the mouse is an autoimmune model of RA that is dependent upon both humoral and cellular immune responses to type II collagen (CII) (Seki et al. (1988) J. Immunol. 140,1477). Historically this RA phenotype is restricted to mouse strains bearing the H-2q or H-2r haplotypes and is generally performed in DBA/1 mice (Wooley (1988) Methods Enzymol. 162:361). A series of studies were performed in transgenic mice that were homozygous null for the murine GM-CSF locus (Stanley et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:5592). Interestingly, the GM-CSF-deficient mice are resistant to the induction of collagen-induced arthritis as compared to their wild-type control litter mates (Campbell et al. (1998) J. Immunol. 161:3639-3644).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Of further interest is that GM-CSF null mice have impaired surfactant clearance that leads to murine pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), which closely mimics the human condition as described herein. Moreover, the PAP phenotype can be corrected by lung-specific delivery of the GM-CSF gene (Zsengaller et al. (1998) Hum. Gene Ther. 9:2101-2109), aerosolization of GM-CSF or bone marrow transplantation for hematopoeitic reconstitution (Reed et al. (1999) Am. J. Physiol. 276:L556-L563; Nishinakamura et al. (1996) J. Exp. Med. 183:2657-2662).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Adult human pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease characterized by the accumulation of phospholipids and surfactant proteins in the alveoli. It has been hypothesized that PAP is due to the inability of the alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cells to clear excess surfactant (Mazzone et al. (2001) Clev. Clin. J. Med. 68:977-992). The diagnosis of PAP generally requires an open lung biopsy and the standard therapy for the disease is physical removal of the accumulated surfactant by whole-lung lavage (Shah et al. (2000) Thorax 55:67-77). Furthermore, patients with PAP have been shown to have circulating, neutralizing antibodies to GM-CSF, thereby implicating this cytokine as causative of the disease. Whether this autoimmune response is specific for GM-CSF is unclear. However, it has been shown that a subset of PAP patients improve with GM-CSF therapy, supporting the hypothesis that the absence of GM-CSF either by gene disruption or antibody-mediated neutralization results in the development of PAP.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">There is also evidence to support a role for GM-CSF in cancer. For example, GM-CSF plays a role in the genesis and progression of leukemias, such as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML); Emanuel P D (2004) Curr. Hematol. Rep. 3:203-209). JMML is characterized by disruption of normal hemopoiesis resulting in excessive, inappropriate proliferation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow. These proliferating hematopoietic cancer cells can metastasize to the spleen and liver. Interestingly, patients with JMML are hypersensitive to GM-CSF and exhibit pathologic features similar to those in transgenic mice that over-express GM-CSF (Lang et al. (1987) 51:675-86). Furthermore, GM-CSF has been shown to promote JMML cell growth and survival (Emanuel et al. (1991) Blood 77:925-9). In the transgenic mouse model of JMML, blockade of GM-CSF reduced JMML cell burden in the bone marrow, blood and spleen (Iversen et al. (1997) Blood, 90:4910-7).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is clear from murine disease models in which GM-CSF is knocked-out as well as human diseases such as PAP in which circulating antibodies are generated in the systemic circulation to GM-CSF that this cytokine is an important mediator of pathology. Therefore an approach to develop a drug that can antagonize the activity of GM-CSF, either by developing an antibody to the cytokine itself or by blockade of the GM-CSF receptor, may be a valuable human therapeutic. Several polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been generated to the recombinant GM-CSF molecule. For example, Beffy et al. ((1994), Hybridoma 13:457-468), generated polyclonal antibodies to recombinant human GM-CSF in New Zealand White rabbits and monoclonal antibodies in Balb/c mice. These rabbit and some of the murine monoclonal antibodies were capable of neutralizing the activity of GM-CSF in an in vitro cell proliferation assay with MO7e cells. In further studies, Nice et al. (1990, Growth Factors 3, 159-169) epitope-mapped the binding site of one neutralizing murine anti-GM-CSF antibody, LMM102. A well-defined epitope was delineated by generating a series of digestion products from recombinant, human GM-CSF, using reverse phase HPLC fractionation to separate the fragments, followed by additional <i>S. aureus </i>V8 digestion of the tryptic fragments to define a product comprising two peptides linked by a disulphide bond. Three murine antibodies to human GM-CSF were generated by Dempsey et al. (1990, Hybridoma 9, 545-558) that neutralized GM-CSF in an in vitro assay system with an EC50 in the 0.1 to 1.7 nanomolar range. These antibodies did not react with murine GM-CSF or other related cytokines. All of the above-described antibodies are useful reagents for the detection of GM-CSF in human serum as well as for in vitro assays to inhibit GM-CSF signaling. However, all of these antibodies have little value as therapeutics due to the fact that they are derived from either a murine or rabbit system. Attempts have been made to generate chimeric antibodies from murine counterparts by subcloning the variable domain from the murine anti-GM-CSF antibody into a human backbone. This strategy has led to a chimeric antibody that can neutralize GM-CSF in vitro and may be useful as a therapeutic (WO 03/068924 A2).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An important aspect of a therapeutic antibody is its ability to elicit immune effector functions, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Rodent MAbs, for example, have been shown to poorly mediate effector functions in humans because of sequence differences in the Fc region and therefore chimerization or humanization are required to gain optimal pharmacological properties. In addition, MAbs with fully human sequences may still fail to support ADCC if they are produced in non-human host cells that may alter native glycosylation pattern of MAbs (Shinkawa et al. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278:3466-73).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In view of these facts, production of therapeutic antibodies by human B-cells is preferred. Methods for generation of hybridomas secreting human MAbs have been previously reported (WO2004/046330). Therapeutic MAbs generated by human B-cells are able to exert human effector functions and have very limited immunogenicity because of their native human structure. The generation of hybridoma or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid lines derived from human B-cells has been previously reported (Kirman et al. (2002) Hybrid Hybridomics 21:405-14; Boerner et al., (1991) J. Immunol. 147:86-95; Zafiropoulos et al. (1997) J. Immunol. Methods 200:181-90); however, information on the characterization of these antibodies and the lines with respect to their long term stability, suitability to manufacturing processes, and the antibody's pharmacological properties is limited (van Dijk et al. (2001) Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 5:368-74).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">There is thus a need for therapeutic human antibodies for the treatment of inflammation associated with infectious, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, and other diseases such as cancer. It is further desired that such antibodies would elicit immune effector functions, as well as be well-tolerated in human patients. The present invention addresses these and other long felt needs.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the antigen panel ELISA for selection of antigen-specific human MAbs. Three GM-CSF-specific human MAbs (E5, G7, E10), reacted with human GM-CSF and none of the other antigens in the panel. Antibody 215 is a murine MAb that binds to human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF) and murine GM-CSF (mGM-CSF).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate the high specificity of human MAbs to native human GM-CSF. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, soluble human GM-CSF was bound to murine hybridoma cells presenting cell surface immunoglobulin (Ig) to human GM-CSF. MAb E5 was subsequently added to the reaction and its binding to human GM-CSF measured using FITC-conjugated goat anti-human Ig. E5 did not bind any of the surface proteins expressed by the murine hybridoma cells (middle panel) but only bound soluble GM-CSF captured by the cell surface Ig (lower panel). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled human GM-CSF (PE-GM) can react to Ig expressed on E10 cell surface. Excess of unlabeled GM-CSF (bottom panel) competed for PE-GM binding.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> demonstrates secretion of antigen-binding IgG by class-switched hybridoma cells. Hybridoma E5 cells (parent) were treated as described in Materials and Methods. Hybridoma clones that had class-switched (switched) were identified using an ELISPOT-based screening method. An ELISA measuring specific binding to human GM-CSF coated onto plates was carried out to assess binding of either IgM or IgG. Switched IgG MAbs exhibited comparable binding to antigen as the parental IgM.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> demonstrates GM-CSF-dependent growth inhibition of TF-1 cell lines with fully human MAbs. The human GM-CSF-dependent human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 (ATCC, VA) was grown in complete RPMI 1640 containing 10 ng/mL recombinant human GM-CSF (PeproTech, N.J.). On the day preceding the experiment, TF-1 cells were grown in 0.1% FBS in the absence of GM-CSF. The starved TF-1 cells were harvested and washed twice with assay medium (plain RPMI with 0.5% BSA). Cells were resuspended in assay medium and seeded in 96-well microplates at a concentration of 10,000 cell/well. Wells contained either assay medium, 100 pg/mL GM-CSF, or GM-CSF pre-incubated for one hour with test or isotype control Igs at concentrations indicated in the figure. After 3 days, 40 &#x3bc;L of Cell Titer reagent (Promega, Wis.) was added to each well, and plates were further incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. Optical density (O.D.) was measured at 490 nm in spectrophotometer and medium background was subtracted from samples. Percentage of GM-CSF neutralization was calculated as follows: 100&#x2212;[O.D. with Ig/O.D. without Ig)&#xd7;100].</p>

Subclones (X1-X10) derived from 3D2 cells via limiting dilution were randomly chosen and their Ig production measured using an ELISA-based assay. Absorbance at 405 nm was normalized for colony size by visual inspection of the cell-containing wells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> demonstrates that the specific productivity measured during the log phase was 24 pg/cell/day following inoculation of 3D2 cells in a stirred bioreactor containing 1 liter of serum-free medium and Ig production and recordation of number of viable cells on day 1 through 5.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows results of an example of a single nucleotide deletion in the BAT marker found in E5 hybridoma cells treated with mismatch repair inhibitors. Dotted lines crossing the central peak in the histogram represent the size of wild type (wt) or contracted (&#x2212;1 nt) fragment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, parental and mismatch repair-inhibited cells were seeded in microplates to yield 3,763 and 2,437 Ig-secreting clones (O.D. &#x3e;0.2), respectively. Ig concentrations were determined by ELISA and the frequency of clones with O.D. values greater than 1 was recorded and expressed as percentage of total number of clones screened.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">&#x201c;Conservatively modified variants&#x201d; applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are &#x201c;silent variations,&#x201d; which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence with respect to the expression product, but not with respect to actual probe sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">&#x201c;Recombinant&#x201d; when used with reference, e.g., to a cell, or nucleic acid, protein, or vector, indicates that the cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector, has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic acid or protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under expressed or not expressed at all.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The phrase &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; or &#x201c;polynucleotide sequence&#x201d; refers to a single or double-stranded polymer of deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide bases read from the 5&#x2032; to the 3&#x2032; end. Nucleic acids can also include modified nucleotides that permit correct read through by a polymerase and do not alter expression of a polypeptide encoded by that nucleic acid, including, for example, conservatively modified variants.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">&#x201c;Polypeptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino acid polymers. Polypeptides of the invention include conservatively modified variants. One of skill will recognize that substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alter, add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a &#x201c;conservatively modified variant&#x201d; where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the invention. The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G); 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W); 7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and 8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) (33). The term &#x201c;conservative substitution&#x201d; also includes the use of a substituted amino acid in place of an unsubstituted parent amino acid provided that such a polypeptide also displays the requisite binding activity.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">&#x201c;Amino acid&#x201d; refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, &#x3b3;-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. &#x201c;Amino acid analog&#x201d; refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an &#x3b1; carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. &#x201c;Amino acid mimetic&#x201d; refers to a chemical compound having a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">&#x201c;Immunoglobulin&#x201d; or &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; is used broadly to refer to both antibody molecules and a variety of antibody-derived molecules and includes any member of a group of glycoproteins occurring in higher mammals that are major components of the immune system. The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and single-chain molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab&#x2032;)2, and Fv), so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. An immunoglobulin molecule includes antigen binding domains, which each include the light chains and the end-terminal portion of the heavy chain, and the Fc region, which is necessary for a variety of functions, such as complement fixation. There are five classes of immunoglobulins wherein the primary structure of the heavy chain, in the Fc region, determines the immunoglobulin class. Specifically, the alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu chains correspond to IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, respectively. As used herein &#x201c;immunoglobulin&#x201d; or &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; includes all subclasses of alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu and also refers to any natural (e.g., IgA and IgM) or synthetic multimers of the four-chain immunoglobulin structure. Antibodies non-covalently, specifically, and reversibly bind an antigen.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that can be present in minor amounts. For example, monoclonal antibodies may be produced by a single clone of antibody-producing cells. Unlike polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies are monospecific (e.g., specific for a single epitope of a single antigen). The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention can be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., <i>Nature, </i>256: 495, 1975, or can be made by recombinant DNA methods. The &#x201c;monoclonal antibodies&#x201d; can also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Marks et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>222: 581-597, 1991, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As used herein &#x201c;chimerized&#x201d; refers to an immunoglobulin, wherein the heavy and light chain variable regions are not of human origin and wherein the constant regions of the heavy and light chains are of human origin.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">&#x201c;Humanized&#x201d; refers to an immunoglobulin such as an antibody, wherein the amino acids directly involved in antigen binding, the complementarity determining regions (CDR), of the heavy and light chains are not of human origin, while the rest of the immunoglobulin molecule, the framework regions of the variable heavy and light chains and the constant regions of the heavy and light chains, are of human origin.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">&#x201c;Fully human&#x201d; refers to an immunoglobulin, such as an antibody, where the whole molecule is of human origin or consists of an amino acid sequence identical to a human form of the antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">&#x201c;Epitope&#x201d; refers to an immunological determinant of an antigen that serves as an antibody-binding site. As used herein, the term &#x201c;conformational epitope&#x201d; refers to a discontinuous epitope formed by a spatial relationship between amino acids of an antigen other than an unbroken series of amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">&#x201c;Hybridoma&#x201d; refers to the product of a cell-fusion between a cultured neoplastic lymphocyte and a primed B- or T-lymphocyte which expresses the specific immune potential of the parent cell.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">&#x201c;GM-CSF&#x201d; refers to a family of glycoprotein growth factors that control the production, differentiation, and function of granulocytes and monocytes-macrophages. Exemplary, but by no means the only form of such molecules, can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,007 (34), incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As used herein the term &#x201c;biomolecule&#x201d; refers to any molecule that can be conjugated to, coadministered with, administered before or after administering an antibody, or otherwise used in association with an antibody of the invention. Biomolecules include, but are not limited to, enzymes, proteins, peptides, amino acids, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and fragments, homologs, analogs, or derivatives, and combinations thereof. Examples of biomolecules include but are not limited to interleukin-2, interferon alpha, interferon beta, interferon gamma, rituxan, zevalin, herceptin, erbitux, and avastin. The biomolecules can be native, recombinant, or synthesized, and may be modified from their native form with, for example, glycosylations, acetylations, phosphorylations, myristylations, and the like. The term biomolecule as it is used herein is not limited to naturally occurring molecules, and includes synthetic molecules having no biological origin.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Polypeptides in accordance with the present invention can be synthesized from amino acids by techniques known to those skilled in the polypeptide art. In general, these methods comprise the sequential addition of one or more amino acid residues or suitably protected amino acid residues to a growing peptide chain. Normally, either the amino or carboxyl group of the first amino acid residue is protected by a suitable, selectively removable protecting group. A different, selectively removable protecting group is utilized for amino acids containing a reactive side group (e.g., lysine).</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Amino acid residue linkers are usually at least one residue and can be 40 or more residues, more often 1 to 10 residues. Typical amino acid residues used for linking are tyrosine, cysteine, lysine, glutamic and aspartic acid, or the like. In addition, a polypeptide sequence of this invention can differ from the natural sequence by the sequence being modified by terminal-NH<sub>2 </sub>acylation, e.g., acetylation, or thioglycolic acid amidation, terminal-carboxylamidation, e.g., ammonia, methylamine, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">While it is appreciated that many useful polypeptides disclosed herein, e.g., SEQ ID NOs:1-5, it is also true that a wide variety of other molecules, including uncommon but naturally occurring amino acids, metabolites and catabolites of natural amino acids, substituted amino acids, and amino acid analogs, as well as amino acids in the &#x201c;D&#x201d; configuration, are useful in molecules and compositions of the present invention. In addition, &#x201c;designed&#x201d; amino acid derivatives, analogs and mimetics are also useful in various compounds, compositions and methods of the present invention, as well as polymers including backbone structures composed of non-amide linkages.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As used herein, &#x201c;analogs&#x201d; and &#x201c;derivatives&#x201d; of polypeptides and amino acid residues are intended to encompass metabolites and catabolites of amino acids, as well as molecules which include linkages, backbones, side-chains or side-groups which differ from those ordinarily found in what are termed &#x201c;naturally-occurring&#x201d; L-form amino acids. (The terms &#x201c;analog&#x201d; and &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; can also conveniently be used interchangeably herein.). Thus, D-amino acids, molecules which mimic amino acids and amino acids with &#x201c;designed&#x201d; side chains (i.e., that can substitute for one or more amino acids in a molecule having surfactant activity) are also encompassed by the terms &#x201c;analogs&#x201d; and &#x201c;derivatives&#x201d; herein.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, in addition to the L-amino acids listed in Table 1, amino acid metabolites such as homoarginine, citrulline, ornithine, and &#x3b1;-aminobutanoic acid are also useful in molecules and compositions of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In another variation, one can wish to construct a molecule that adopts a more &#x201c;rigid&#x201d; conformation; one means of accomplishing this would be to add methyl or other groups to the &#x3b1; carbon atom of the amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, substituted amino acids which are not generally derived from proteins, but which are known in nature, are useful as disclosed herein, include the following examples: L-canavanine; 1-methyl-L-histidine; 3-methyl-L-histidine; 2-methyl L-histidine; &#x3b1;,&#x3b5;-diaminopimelic acid (L form, meso form, or both); sarcosine; L-ornithine betaine; betaine of histidine (herzynine); L-citrulline; L-phosphoarginine; D-octopine; o-carbamyl-D-serine; &#x3b3;-aminobutanoic acid; and &#x3b2;-lysine. D-amino acids and D-amino acid analogs, including the following, are also useful in proteins, peptides and compositions of the present invention: D-alanine, D-serine, D-valine, D-leucine, D-isoleucine, D-alloisoleucine, D-phenylalanine, D-glutamic acid, D-proline, and D-allohydroxyproline, and the like. The foregoing can also be used in GM-CSF polypeptides according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should also be appreciated that the present invention encompasses a wide variety of modified amino acids, including analogs, metabolites, catabolites, and derivatives, irrespective of the time or location at which modification occurs. In essence, one can place modified amino acids into three categories: (1) catabolites and metabolites of amino acids; (2) modified amino acids generated via posttranslational modification (e.g., modification of side chains); and (3) modifications made to amino acids via non-metabolic or non-catabolic processes (e.g., the synthesis of modified amino acids or derivatives in the laboratory).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The present invention also contemplates that one can readily design side chains of the amino acids of residue units that include longer or shortened side chains by adding or subtracting methylene groups in either linear, branched chain, or hydrocarbon or heterocyclic ring arrangements. The linear and branched chain structures can also contain non-carbon atoms such as S, O, or N. Fatty acids can also be useful constituents of surfactant molecules herein. The designed side chains can terminate with (R&#x2032;) or without (R) charged or polar group appendages.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Analogs, including molecules resulting from the use of different linkers, are also useful in the peptides of the invention. Molecules with side chains linked together via linkages other than the amide linkage, e.g., molecules containing amino acid side chains or other side chains (R- or R&#x2032;-) wherein the components are linked via carboxy- or phospho-esters, ethylene, methylene, ketone or ether linkages, to name a few examples, are also useful as disclosed herein. In essence, any amino acid side chain, R or R&#x2032; group-containing molecule can be useful as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The present invention also contemplates molecules comprising peptide dimers joined by an appropriate linker, e.g., peptide dimers linked by cysteine molecules. (As those of skill in the art are aware, two cysteine molecules can be linked together by a disulfide bridge formed by oxidation of their thiol groups.). Such linkers or bridges can thus cross-link different polypeptide chains, dimers, trimers, and the like. Other useful linkers which can be used to connect peptide dimers and/or other peptide multimers include those listed above, e.g., carboxy- or phospho-ester, ethylene, methylene, ketone or ether linkages, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">One of skill in the art will appreciate that one can make a variety of modifications to individual amino acids, to the linkages, and/or to the chain itself, which modifications will produce molecules falling within the scope of the present invention, as long as the resulting molecule possesses biological (e.g., antigenic) activity as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Preferred antigenic polypeptides of the invention are antigenic peptides of GM-CSF (SEQ ID NO:1), and preferably of mature GM-CSF (SEQ ID NO:2).

In some embodiments, the antigen is generated by denaturing the mature protein.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Previously reported methods for generation of hybridomas secreting human MAbs (WO2004/046330) using primary human B-cells were employed herein. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, preferably human PBMCs, are immunized ex vivo in the presence of target antigen and then immortalized via cell fusion with donor cells. Alternatively, selected PBMCs are identified whose sera have high immune reactivity to antigen of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Hybrid cells derived from the donor cells are screened for secretion of target antigen-specific MAbs. In some embodiments are provided methods for producing hybridoma cells producing monoclonal antibodies against a target antigen from ex vivo immunized immunoglobulin-producing cells comprising: (a) combining peripheral blood mononuclear cells comprising immunoglobulin-producing cells with a target antigen ex vivo; (b) fusing the immunoglobulin-producing cells with donor cells to form hybridoma cells; (c) determining binding of antigen by antibodies produced from the hybridoma cells; and (d) selecting hybridoma cells that produce antibodies that bind the target antigen; thereby generating hybridoma cells that produce antibodies against the target antigen. In a preferred embodiment, the PBMCs are from healthy donors. The target antigen is preferably GM-CSF and more preferably comprises an amino acid sequence of one of SEQ ID NOs:35-38.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Alternatively, methods for generating hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies against target disease-associated antigen comprise the steps of: (a) fusing ex vivo peripheral blood mononuclear cells comprising immunoglobulin-producing B-cells derived from a patient having a disease or an antigen-exposed donor with donor cells to form hybridoma cells; (b) determining binding by the antibodies produced from the hybridoma cells to target antigen; and (c) selecting hybridoma cells that produce antibodies that bind to the target antigen; thereby producing hybridoma cells that express antibodies against the target disease. Preferably, the target antigen is a disease-associated antigen, and preferably is associated with cancer, an infectious disease, or an autoimmune disease. More preferably, the disease associated antigen is GM-CSF. The target antigen is preferably GM-CSF and more preferably comprises an amino acid sequence of one of SEQ ID NOs:35-38.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, the donor (e.g., myeloma) cells express a protein inhibitor of mismatch repair. In some aspects, the hybridoma cells express a protein inhibitor of mismatch repair. In some embodiments of the method of the invention, the protein inhibitor of mismatch repair is introduced into the hybridoma cell after the fusion of the myeloma with the immunoglobulin-producing cells. In other embodiments, the protein inhibitor of mismatch repair is introduced into the donor or myeloma cell prior to the fusion with the immunoglobulin-producing cells. In still other embodiments, the donor or myeloma cells or antibody producing cells are naturally deficient in mismatch repair.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Protein inhibitors of mismatch repair include dominant negative alleles of mismatch repair genes. Dominant negative alleles of mismatch repair genes include but are not limited to dominant negative alleles of PMS2, PMS1, PMSR3, PMSR2, PMSR6, MLH1, GTBP, MSH3, MSH2, MLH3, or MSH1, and homologs of mutL and mutS genes. In addition, polypeptides capable of interfering in mismatch repair may be used. For example, a dominant negative allele of mutL PMS2 comprises the first 133 amino acids PMS2. Further delineation of amino acids in mutL homologs reveals amino acids LSTAVKELVENSLDAGATNIDLKLKDYGVDLIEVSDNGCGVEEENFE (SEQ ID NO:6) and LRQVLSNLLDNAIKYTPEGGEITVSLERDGDHLEITVEDNGPGIPEEDLE (SEQ ID NO:7) or fragments thereof. Protein inhibitors of mismatch repair thus include polypeptides of SEQ ID NOs: 6 and 7 and fragments thereof. In preferred embodiments, the protein inhibitor of mismatch repair is inactivated. For example, the protein inhibitor of mismatch repair may be inactivated before or after identification of a hybridoma cell that generates monoclonal antibodies to the target antigen. Inactivation of the protein inhibitor of mismatch repair may be by any means known in the art, for example, removal of an inducer or removal of the protein inhibitor of mismatch repair from the cell (i.e., curing the cell of the protein inhibitor of mismatch repair). Inactivation of the inhibitor of mismatch repair stabilizes the genome of the hypermutated hybridoma.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Those of skill in the art will recognize that antibody specificity is primarily determined by the six CDR regions, especially H chain CDR3 (Kala M et al. (2002) J.

Antibody framework regions, however, can play a role in antigen-antibody interactions (Panka D J et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:3080-4), particularly with respect to their role in conformation of CDR loops (Foote J et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224:487-99). Thus, the inventive antibodies can comprise any combination of H or L chain CDR or FWR regions that confer antibody specificity for GM-CSF. Domain shuffling experiments, which are routinely carried out in the art (Jirholt P et al. (1998) Gene 215:471-6; Soderlind E et al. (2000) Nature Biotechnology 18:852-6), can be employed to generate antibodies that specifically bind GM-CSF according to the specifications described and exemplified herein.

Such an expectation is due in part to the degeneracy of the genetic code, as well as to the known evolutionary success of conservative amino acid sequence variations, which do not appreciably alter the nature of the encoded protein.

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Recombinant expression vectors of the invention include synthetic, genomic, or cDNA-derived nucleic acid fragments that encode at least one recombinant protein which may be operably linked to suitable regulatory elements. Such regulatory elements may include a transcriptional promoter, sequences encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences that control the termination of transcription and translation.

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Selection markers that can be used in the system include those known in the art, such as positive and negative selection markers, such as but not limited to antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., neomycin resistance gene, a hygromycin resistance gene, a kanamycin resistance gene, a tetracycline resistance gene, a penicillin resistance gene), HSV-TK, HSV-TK derivatives for ganciclovir selection, or bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylase gene for 6-methylpurine selection (Gadi et al. (2000) <i>Gene Ther. </i>7:1738-1743). [0034] A nucleic acid sequence encoding a selection marker or the cloning site therefor may be upstream or downstream of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest or cloning site therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments, the vector includes one or more promoters, such as but not limited to a constitutive, inducible, host-specific, and/or tissue-specific promoter. For example, commonly used promoters and enhancers are derived from human cytomegalovirus (CMV), Adenovirus 2, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), and Polyoma. Viral genomic promoters, control and/or signal sequences may be utilized to drive expression which are dependent upon compatible host cells. Promoters derived from house-keeping genes can also be used (e.g., the &#x3b2;-globin, thymidine kinase, and the EF-1&#x3b1; promoters), depending on the identity of the cell type in which the vector is to be expressed. In some embodiments, a promoter is upstream of a nucleic acid sequence encoding one or more polypeptides of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Vectors of the invention may contain one or more Internal Ribosome Entry Site(s) (IRES). Inclusion of an IRES sequence into fusion vectors may be beneficial for enhancing expression of some proteins.</p>

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Vector components may be contiguously linked, or arranged in a manner that provides optimal spacing for expressing the gene products (i.e., by the introduction of &#x201c;spacer&#x201d; nucleotides between the ORFs), or positioned in another way. Regulatory elements, such as the IRES motif, can also be arranged to provide optimal spacing for expression.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Cells transfected with expression vectors of the invention can be selected under positive selection conditions and/or screened for recombinant protein expression. Recombinant-positive cells are expanded and screened for subclones exhibiting a desired phenotype.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Cells, including eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, can be transformed with the expression vectors of the invention. Accordingly, another embodiment of the invention provides a host cell transformed with an expression vector of the instant invention. Cells of the invention are preferably eukaryotic cells, more preferably cells of plant, rodent, or human origin, for example but not limited to NSO, CHO, perC.6, Tk-ts13, BHK, HEK293 cells, COS-7, T98G, CV-1/EBNA, L cells, C127, 3T3, HeLa, NS1, Sp2/0 myeloma cells, and BHK cell lines, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In general, transfection will be carried out using a suspension of cells, or a single cell, although other methods can also be applied to the extent that sufficient fraction of the treated cells or tissue incorporates the polynucleotide, thereby allowing transfected cells to be grown and utilized. Techniques for transfection are well known. Several transformation protocols are known in the art. See, e.g., Kaufman (1988) <i>Meth. Enzymology </i>185:537. As is readily understood by those skilled in the art, the appropriate transformation protocol is determined by the host cell type and the nature of the gene of interest. The basic components of any such protocol include introducing nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein of interest into a suitable host cell, and then identifying and isolating host cells which have incorporated the vector DNA in a stable, expressible manner. Techniques for introducing polynucleotides include but are not limited to electroporation, transduction, cell fusion, the use of calcium chloride, and packaging of the polynucleotide together with lipid for fusion with the cells of interest. If the transfection is stable, such that the selectable marker gene is expressed at a consistent level for multiple cell generations, then a cell line results.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">One common method for transfection into mammalian cells in particular is calcium phosphate precipitation. Another method is polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced fusion of bacterial protoplasts with mammalian cells. Schaffner et al. (1980) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>77:2163. Yet another method is electroporation, which can also be used to introduce DNA directly into the cytoplasm of a host cell, as described, for example, in Potter et al. (1988) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>81:7161.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Transfection of DNA can also be carried out using polyliposome reagents such as Lipofectin and Lipofectamine (available from Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) which form lipid-nucleic acid complexes (or liposomes), which, when applied to cultured cells, facilitate uptake of the nucleic acid into the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Once a cell expressing the desired protein is identified, it can be expanded and selected. Transfected cells may be selected in a number of ways. For example, cells may be selected for expression of the polypeptide of interest. For cells in which the vector also contains an antibiotic resistance gene, the cells may be selected for antibiotic resistance, which positively selects for cells containing the vector. In other embodiments, the cells may be allowed to grow under selective conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Once a clone producing a protein is identified, the line can be further screened to identify subclones having one or more desired phenotypes, such as but not limited to cells that exhibit high-titer expression, enhanced growth properties, and/or the ability to yield proteins with desired biochemical characteristics, for example, due to protein modification and/or altered post-translational modifications. These phenotypes may be due to inherent properties of a given subclone or to mutagenesis. Mutagenesis can be effected through the use of chemicals, UV-wavelength light, radiation, viruses, insertional mutagens, defective DNA repair, or a combination of such methods.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Another aspect of the invention features pharmaceuticals composition of antibodies of the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions may be used to treat a disease, for example, cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease in a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more MAbs for the treatment of disease, such as but not limited to cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease, formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In prophylactic applications, pharmaceutical compositions are administered to a patient susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of a disease or condition (e.g., cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease) in a prophylactically effective amount. At-risk individuals include, but are not limited to, individuals with a family history of cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease, individuals who have previously been treated for cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease, and individuals presenting any other clinical indicia suggesting that they have an increased likelihood of developing cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease. Alternatively stated, an at-risk individual is any individual who is believed to be at a higher risk than the general population for developing cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease. The term &#x201c;prophylactically effective amount&#x201d; is meant to refer to an amount of a formulation which produces an effect observed as the prevention of the onset or recurrence of cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease. Prophylactically effective amounts of a formulation are typically determined by the effect they have compared to the effect observed when a second formulation lacking the active agent is administered to a similarly situated individual.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient suspected of, or already suffering from such a disease in a therapeutically effective amount sufficient to cure, or at least partially arrest, the symptoms of the disease (biochemical and/or histological), including its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes in development of the disease.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In both prophylactic and therapeutic regimes, agents are usually administered in several dosages until a sufficient response has been achieved. Typically, the response is monitored and repeated dosages are given if the response starts to wane.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Effective doses of a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of disease, e.g., cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease, as described herein, vary depending upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, whether the patient is human or an animal, other medications administered, and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Usually, the patient is a human but nonhuman mammals can also be treated.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from days to several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of a patient or subject. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages can vary depending on the relative potency of individual antibodies and, in the case of concomitant administration, the relative potency of known drugs used in the treatment of disease. Optimum dosages can generally be estimated based on EC50s found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In general, dosage is from 0.01 &#x3bc;g to 100 g per kg of body weight and can be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or even once every 2 to 20 years. The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications, a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Although individual needs can vary, determination of optimal ranges for effective amounts of formulations is within the skill of the art. Human doses can be extrapolated from animal studies (R<smallcaps>EMINGTON'S </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>HARMACEUTICAL </smallcaps>S<smallcaps>CIENCES, </smallcaps>20<smallcaps>TH ED</smallcaps>., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 2000). Generally the dosage required to provide an effective amount of a formulation, which can be adjusted by one skilled in the art, will vary depending on the age, health, physical condition, weight, type and extent of the disease or disorder of the recipient, frequency of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any) and the nature and scope of the desired effect(s).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include water, PBS, salt solution (such as Ringer's solution), alcohols, oils, gelatins, and carbohydrates, such as lactose, amylose, or starch, fatty acid esters, hydroxymethylcellulose, and polyvinyl pyrrolidine. Such preparations can be sterilized, and if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents such as lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, and coloring. Pharmaceutical carriers suitable for use in the present invention are known in the art (R<smallcaps>EMINGTON'S </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>HARMACEUTICAL </smallcaps>S<smallcaps>CIENCES, </smallcaps>20<smallcaps>TH ED</smallcaps>., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 2000).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The pharmaceutical formulations, which can conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, can be prepared according to conventional techniques well known in the pharmaceutical industry. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the pharmaceutical carrier(s). In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. The formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a frozen or freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of sterile liquid carrier immediately prior to use.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The pharmaceutical compositions are generally formulated as sterile, substantially isotonic and in full compliance with all Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>

<p id="p-0155" num="0154">When used as a pharmaceutical treatment, the compositions of the present invention can be administered either alone or co-administered with other compounds or compositions that are used in the treatment of disease, for cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease. Examples of such compounds, referred to herein as &#x201c;supplemental compounds,&#x201d; or &#x201c;supplemental compositions,&#x201d; include, but are not limited to, antibiotics, anti-cytokines, anti-asthma drugs, antiphospholipases (e.g., inhibitors of phospholipase), vasodilators (e.g., adenosine, beta-adrenergic agonists or antagonists, &#x3b2;-adrenergic blockers, &#x3b1;-adrenergic blockers, diuretics, smooth muscle vasodilators, nitrates, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), biomolecules, cytostatic agents, and chemotherapeutic agents. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may comprise, for example, one or more supplemental compounds. In some embodiments, the antibody is conjugated to the supplemental compound.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">According to yet another aspect of the invention, kits are provided, for example, for the treatment of cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The kits of the invention comprise antibody or an antibody composition of the invention and instructions for using the kit in a method for treating cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease in a patient or for inhibiting the biological activity of target antigen (e.g., GM-CSF). The kit may comprise at least one supplemental compound. The kit may comprise instructions and/or means for administering the antibody or antibody composition, for example, by injection.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Antibodies of the invention may be used to detect antigen in a biological sample such as but not limited to blood serum. Any method known in the art may be used, such as but not limited to flow cytometry. For example, a biological sample may be incubated with antibody of the invention followed by washing and incubation with a labelled secondary antibody. For example, the secondary antibody may be directed to the light chain and conjugated to either FITC or phycoerythrin for purpose of detection.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Antigen neutralizing activity of antibodies of the invention may be tested in an antigen neutralization assay by any method known in the art. For example, neutralization activity of the antibodies may be assessed using antigen-dependent cell lines. Examples of GM-CSF-dependent cell lines include but are not limited to TF-1 and AML-193.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In a first antigen neutralization assay, antigen-dependent cells are suspended in assay medium, assay medium, antigen, or antigen pre-incubated for one hour with test or isotype control antibodies. Following the incubation period, growth inhibition is evaluated by any method known in the art. For example, Cell Titer reagent (Promega, Wis.) may be added followed by further incubation and measurement of optical density (O.D.) at 490 nm in a spectrophotometer and subtraction of medium background from samples. Percentage of antigen neutralization is calculated as follows: 100&#x2212;[O.D. with Ig/O.D. without Ig)&#xd7;100].</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In another neutralization assay, antigen is mixed with anti-antigen antibodies of the invention. Antigen-dependent cells are added to the mixture, followed by incubation. After this incubation period, growth inhibition is measured. For example, the DNA proliferation marker MTS may be added followed by measurement of dye incorporation. Decreased dye incorporation in the presence of antibody relative to that in the absence of the anti-antigen antibody indicates neutralization of antigen.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Alternatively, antigen-dependent cells are grown in the presence of antigen followed by addition of increasing amounts of antibody to the culture media and assessment of neutralizing activity as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Therapeutic methods of the invention include methods of inhibiting the biological activity of a target antigen, for example, GM-CSF and methods of treating a disease such as but not limited to cancer, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease by administering the pharmaceutical compositions of the antibodies of the invention to a patient or subject in need thereof. Biological activity of GM-CSF includes but is not limited to binding to the GM-CSF receptor.

Cells were passed at a 1:5 dilution every three to four days in fresh media with or without morphocene and after three weeks cells were harvested and resuspended at 2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL in FACS buffer (PBS with 1% BSA). Cells were stained with 10 &#x3bc;g/mL FITC-conjugated goat anti-human Ig (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 minutes on ice. Cells were washed with 10 mL ice cold FACS buffer and resuspended in 3 mL FACS buffer. 10 &#x3bc;L Viaprobe (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) was added for 5 minutes on ice and viable cells were sorted for high Ig surface staining on a FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). The gate was set to sort cells representing the 5% subpopulation with the highest Ig surface staining. For selection of clones with enhanced titers, FACS sorted cells were seeded in U-bottom 96 well plates and incubated for one week at 37&#xb0; C. in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Fifty &#x3bc;L of supernatants were harvested from wells and analyzed for IgM production via ELISA using goat anti-human IgM+G coated plates. As an internal control, 3 wells of each ELISA plate were seeded with 50 &#x3bc;L of 10 ng/mL human IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch). O.D. values obtained at 450 nm were normalized to the mean values of internal control wells. Wells exhibiting high IgM signals were expanded for further analysis. For microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis, DNA was extracted from parental or morphocene-treated cells using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen). The BAT poly A repeat marker (7) was amplified using the D4 fluorescent-labeled BAT-26-F (5&#x2032;-tcaccatccattgcacagtt-3&#x2032;) (SEQ ID NO:20) and BAT-26-R (5&#x2032;-ctgcgagaaggtactcaccc-3&#x2032;) (SEQ ID NO:21) primers, pfuUltra&#x2122; high-fidelity polymerase (Stratagene, Calif.), and reactions incubated as follows: 5 min. at 95&#xb0; C.; 9 cycles of 1 min. at 94&#xb0; C., 1 min. at 60&#xb0; C. and 2 min. at 72&#xb0; C., with the annealing temperature decreasing by 1&#xb0; C. each cycle; 30 cycles of 1 min. at 94&#xb0; C., 1 min. at 52&#xb0; C., and 2 min. at 72&#xb0; C.; final extension of 10 min. at 72&#xb0; C. Single-copies of the marker allele were obtained by using a dilution of DNA that yielded an amplicon in only 50% of the PCR reactions.

<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Generation of Antigen-Specific Human MAbs.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Ex-vivo immunizations were carried out using cryo-preserved B-cells obtained from volunteer subjects (healthy donors) as described above. Alternatively, B-cells were obtained from human subjects whose sera contained high titers of MAbs specific to an antigen of interest. The rationale of the latter approach stems from the possibility that some antigen-specific MAbs could result from an abnormal immune response (as in the case of autoimmune patients), or derive from an in vivo immune response to tumor, microbial, or vaccine antigens.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Several antigen-reacting human MAbs were identified after fusion of ex-vivo immunized cells and from hybridoma libraries generated from PAP patients B-cells. Four hybridoma lines, E5 (IgM), G7 (IgM), E10 (IgG), and G9 (IgG) were selected for further studies and the human MAbs they produce were tested for specificity by ELISA. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that E5, G7, and E10 human MAbs only reacted with human GM-CSF and none of the other ten unrelated antigens tested, including murine GM-CSF, which shares a 53% identity with the human homolog. Similar results were obtained for the G9 hybridoma. FACS analyses were carried out to confirm specificity of these human MAbs. Human GM-CSF was allowed to bind to the surface of mouse hybridoma cells, which express membrane bound-MAbs specific to human GM-CSF at a different epitope. E5 MAb bound the surface of these cells under these conditions, as indicated by the fluorescence intensity shift (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, bottom panel). This result demonstrates the ability of E5 MAb to bind native human GM-CSF. In absence of cell-bound GM-CSF, E5 MAb did not cross-react with any of the membrane bound proteins expressed by these hybridoma cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, middle panel). Similarly, E10 MAb showed high specificity via FACS analysis. In addition, since E10 MAb was found associated to the hybridoma cell membrane, its ability to bind soluble, phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled GM-CSF was shown by FACS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, middle panel). Binding specificity was demonstrated by pre-incubation of the E10 hybridoma cells with an excess of unlabeled GM-CSF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, lower panel).</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">De Novo Class-Switch of Human MAbs.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Using the two strategies described above, IgG and IgM human MAbs to a variety of human and nonhuman antigens have been generated. Although most therapeutic antibodies in the market are of the IgG isotype, cancer trials testing potentially therapeutic IgM MAbs have shown regression of tumors in vivo (16, 17). These clinical responses can be attributable to the ability of IgM to strongly fix and activate the complement pathway and effectively kill tumor cells. IgG binds to the Fc receptors on macrophages and NK cells and thus can mediate ADCC activity against tumor cells. Both IgG and IgM with identical specificity (same antigen and epitope) can be tested for best pharmacological activity in vivo. In the case where an IgG isotype is preferred, a quick robust procedure (see Materials and Methods) for de novo class-switching of IgM has been followed. Using the E5 line as an example, a subset of cells that had class-switched to an IgG isotype under the growth conditions used was identified. The E5 IgG showed identical nucleotide sequence in its variable region and similar reactivity to GM-CSF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) as the parental E5 IgM.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Biological Activities of Human MAbs.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Pharmacological properties sought for therapeutic MAbs that target soluble mediators of disease include the ability to neutralize growth factors. As mentioned above, one such example is GM-CSF as a mediator of RA (9-11). The ability of the human MAbs to block GM-CSF function using a cell-based assay whereby the growth of human erythroblastoid cells (TF1) is dependent on the presence of this cytokine in their culture medium was assessed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, both E10 and G9 significantly inhibited GM-CSF-dependent cell growth, whereas the human IgG isotype control showed no effect. The difference in potency seen between E10 and G9 correlates well with their apparent affinities of 870 and 14 picomolar, respectively. The E5 MAb only showed minimal neutralizing activity consistent with its lower affinity (5 nM).</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Assessment of Titers and Stability of Hybridomas Secreting Human MAbs.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">An important property of a MAb manufacturing line is stability of Ig secretion during the entire batch manufacturing cycle. In one scenario where the cycle duration is about two months, a line doubling every 24 hours would go through about 60 generations from thawing to harvest. An E5 line was used as a model for testing MAb titers and production stability of hybridoma generated using our method. A clone derived from this line, 3D2, showed a doubling time of 24 hours and was re-cloned by limiting dilutions after more than two months of continuous culturing. The frequency of producing clones was determined via ELISA, measuring Ig concentrations in their conditioned media normalized for cell densities. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows that all E5-3D2 subclones tested secrete high levels of Ig, demonstrating homogeneous retention of Ig production in this cell population after 60 generations. Ig production was then assessed using a small scale (15 mL) hollow fiber system. Cells were inoculated in a hollow fiber cartridge and continuously fed using an inline reservoir containing one liter of fresh medium. Starting on day 5, all conditioned medium from the cartridge (15 mL) was harvested daily and replaced with fresh medium. Fermentation was carried out for additional 4 days, while daily Ig titers were determined by ELISA using an Ig standard of known concentration. A cumulative titer of 1.2 g/L during the 4-day run was recorded. Between day 8 and 9, glucose consumption was at its peak (2 gram/L a day), indicating that cells tolerated well the extremely high cell densities. Production performance was also evaluated in a 1-liter scale fed-batch run using a stirred bioreactor system. Cells from a frozen ampule were first thawed and inoculated in a shake flask and later seeded in stirred bioreactor (Bauer) containing 1 liter of serum-free medium. Fermentation was carried out until cell viability dropped below 60% (day 6). Ig production and cell densities were recorded between day 1 and 5 and are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. During the log phase (day 1-4), a specific productivity of 24 pg/cell/day with a doubling time averaging 23.4 hours was measured, suggesting good scalability of these cells from flask to bioreactor while maintaining higher titers.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Genetic Optimization of Hybridoma Secreting Human MAbs Via Mismatch Repair Regulation.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The usefulness of improving the quality of MAb-producing cell lines using a process, termed morphogenics, which entails the transient regulation of MMR has been previously demonstrated (Nicolaides et al. (1995) Genomics 30:195-206; and, Nicolaides et al. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol. 18:1635-41.). After increasing the genetic diversity of the cell pool using this method, high throughput screenings were carried out to identify subclones exhibiting higher titer, affinity (Grasso et al. (2004) Bioprocess Int. 2:58-64; and, Nicolaides et al. (2005) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1059:1-11), or enhanced growth rates (Grasso, L. personal observation). E5 cells were subjected to morphogenics to demonstrate the ability to increase phenotypic diversity in the MAb-secreting lines generated using our hybridoma strategy. MMR inhibition was monitored by detecting microsatellite instability (MSI) in the BAT poly-A repeat marker. Of the 24 BAT alleles analyzed in cells exposed to the morphogenics process, 3 alleles showed alterations that included single nucleotide deletions, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, and insertions. No MSI was detected in any of the 24 BAT alleles in parental cells. Subsequently, parental or morphogenics-treated cells were seeded by limiting dilutions in microplates. Cell clones were allowed to secret MAbs for one week and their conditioned medium analyzed for Ig concentrations by ELISA. The frequency of clones with O.D. greater than 1 (high Ig secretion) was determined from the total number of clones screened (3,763 for parental and 2,437 for morphocene pool) and found to have increased by 260% (p=0.0014) in the morphogenics-treated population (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Summary</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">This study represents a viable strategy for developing human MAbs for immunotherapies using an optimized ex-vivo immunization and human B-cell immortalization process combined with inhibition of mismatch repair. With this approach, highly specific and biologically active MAbs secreted by stable hybridoma lines can be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">According to the methods of the invention, stable MAb production for over 60 doublings and production of over 1 gram of MAb per liter during a 4-day hollow fiber fermentation run has been achieved, suggesting that hybridoma cells generated by the present methods are suited for perfusion systems and potentially large scale manufacturing. Moreover, hybridomas generated by this process have performed well in fed-batch bioreactor runs, suggesting a potential use of these lines for commercial applications. In summary, the platform process presented here offers an alternative approach for a rapid and cost-effective development of good quality, fully human antibodies for immunotherapeutic use.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Generation of Fully Human Anti-GM-CSF Antibody; Isolation of Pap Cells</heading>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Patients with adult human pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) accumulate phospholipids and surfactant proteins in the alveoli. It has been hypothesized that PAP is due to the inability of the alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cells to clear excess surfactant. As described above, the role for GM-CSF in the control of lung surfactant homeostasis has been established in the murine model and by extension is causative of the human pathology. Furthermore, patients with PAP have been shown to have circulating, neutralizing antibodies to GM-CSF, thereby implicating this cytokine as causative of the disease. Whether this autoimmune response is specific for GM-CSF is unclear. However, it has been shown that a subset of PAP patients improve with GM-CSF therapy, supporting the hypothesis that the absence of GM-CSF either by gene disruption or antibody-mediated neutralization results in the development of PAP.</p>

The B cells and fusion partner cells should have good viability (&#x2267;90% viable and in log phase). Both cell types in their original medium were counted and mixed in 15 ml tubes at 1:1 ratio, followed by centrifugation at 1,000 RPM for 6 min at 4&#xb0; C. Cells were washed 3 times using 10-15 ml cold CPFM (CYTOPULSE fusion medium, Cyto Pulse Sciences, Md. USA). The final pellet was resuspended in 10&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml CPFM. Electro-fusion was performed using CYTOPULSE CEEF-50 (Cyto Pulse Sciences, Md. USA). Fusion parameters were optimized following manufacturer and empirical guidelines, and fusion efficiency averaged one hybrid in 5,000 cells pulsed. After fusion, cells were seeded in flat-bottom 96-well microplates at &#x2dc;5,000 cell/well in complete RPMI containing 10% heat inactivated FBS, 100 &#x3bc;M hypoxanthine, 0.4 &#x3bc;M aminopterin, and 16 &#x3bc;M thymidine (HAT, Sigma, Mo. USA). Medium was replaced weekly and HAT selection was maintained until completion of antigen reactivity.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">ELISA Screening Assay.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">For the identification of antigen-reacting MAbs, ELISA-based screenings were performed robotically using a BIOMEK FX liquid handling system integrated with plate washer and spectrophotometer. Briefly, microtiter plates were coated at room temperature for 6 hours with 50 &#x3bc;L/well of in-house produced recombinant antigens (1 &#x3bc;g/mL GM-CSF) diluted in coating buffer (50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate, pH 9.4). Plates were then blocked with binding buffer (PBS containing 3% BSA (Sigma, Mo.) and 0.05% Tween 20 (BioRad, Calif.)) for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were washed once with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and 50 &#x3bc;L/well of hybridoma supernatant was transferred into the ELISA plates. Binding reaction was carried out at room temperature for 2 hours. Subsequently, plates were washed 4 times and 100 &#x3bc;L of HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG+M (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Pa.) diluted 1:10,000 in binding buffer was added and reactions carried out at room temperature for 1.5 hours. Finally, plates were washed 4 times and 100 &#x3bc;L/well of SUREBLUE substrate (KPL, MD) was added for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 50 &#x3bc;L/well of 1 N sulfuric acid and the absorbance was determined at 450 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">FACS Analysis and Sorting.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">In every study, Ig binding and cell washing steps were conducted using ice-cold binding buffer (DPBS without calcium or magnesium, 0.5% BSA). The PBMC or hybridoma cells were washed and seeded at 500,000 cell/well. The FITC and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-human CD3, CD19, CD20 (SouthernBiotech, Ala.), and PE-labeled GM-CSF (R&#x26;D System, Minn.) were added (10-100 diluted), and incubated on ice for one hour. The cells were then washed three times with binding buffer, and analyzed or sorted using a FACSARIA apparatus (BD Biosciences, N.J.). Results of isotype analysis of Mab E10 are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. To determine the isotype of E10, a standard analysis was performed using anti-human IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgM, L&#x3ba;, and L&#x3bb; Fc specific antibodies to derive the isotype.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">GM-CSF Neutralization Bioassay.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The human GM-CSF-dependent human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 (ATCC, VA) was grown in complete RPMI 1640 (see above) containing 10 ng/mL recombinant human GM-CSF (PeproTech, N.J.). On the day preceding the experiment, TF-1 cells were grown in 0.5% FBS in the absence of GM-CSF. The starved TF-1 cells were harvested and washed twice with assay medium (plain RPMI with 0.5% BSA). Cells were resuspended in assay medium and seeded in 96-well microplates at a concentration of 10,000 cells/well. Wells contained either assay medium, 100 pg/mL GM-CSF, or GM-CSF pre-incubated for one hour with test or isotype control Igs at concentrations indicated in the figure. After 3 days, 40 &#x3bc;L of Cell Titer reagent (Promega, Wis.) was added to each well, and plates were further incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. Optical density (O.D.) was measured at 490 nm in a spectrophotometer and medium background was subtracted from all samples. Percentage of GM-CSF neutralization was calculated as follows: 100&#x2212;[(O.D. with Ig/O.D. without Ig)&#xd7;100)]. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> demonstrates GM-CSF-dependent growth inhibition of TF-1 cell lines with fully human MAbs.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Inhibition of Mismatch Repair to Increase Genetic Diversity of Hybridoma Cell Lines.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Inhibition of mismatch repair can lead to genetically diverse sibling cells with enhanced production, cell growth, or antibody activity. To improve MAb activity and cell growth, hybridoma cells were grown in complete RPMI (negative control) or complete RPMI containing 250 &#x3bc;M or 500 uM of the mismatch repair inhibitor morphocene (9,10-dimethyl anthracene, MP Biomedicals, Calif.). Cells were passed at a 1:5 dilution every three to four days in fresh media with or without morphocene and after three weeks cells were harvested and resuspended at 2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL in FACS buffer (PBS with 1% BSA). Cells were stained with 10 &#x3bc;g/mL FITC-conjugated goat anti-human Ig (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 minutes on ice. Cells were washed with 10 mL ice cold FACS buffer and resuspended in 3 mL FACS buffer. 10 &#x3bc;L VIAPROBE (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) was added for 5 minutes on ice and viable cells were sorted for high Ig surface staining on a FACSARIA cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). The gate was set to sort cells representing the 5% sub-population with the highest Ig surface staining. This population was expanded for one week in the presence or absence of chemical inhibitor of mismatch repair (MMR) and the procedure repeated two additional times. For selection of clones with enhanced titers, FACS sorted cells were seeded in U-bottom 96 well plates at 0.8 cells/well in 200 &#x3bc;L complete RPMI. Plates were incubated for one week at 37&#xb0; C. in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. 50 &#x3bc;L of supernatants were harvested from wells and analyzed for IgM production via ELISA using goat anti-human IgM+G coated plates. As an internal control, 3 wells of each ELISA plate were seeded with 50 &#x3bc;L of 10 ng/mL human IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch). O.D. values obtained at 450 nm were normalized to the mean values of internal control wells. Wells exhibiting high IgM signals were expanded for further analysis. For MSI analysis, DNA was extracted from parental or MMR inhibitor-treated cells using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen). The BAT poly A repeat marker was amplified using the D4 fluorescent-labeled mBAT-26-F (5&#x2032;-tcaccatccattgcacagtt-3&#x2032;) (SEQ ID NO:20) and mBAT-26-R (5&#x2032;-ctgcgagaaggtactcaccc-3&#x2032;) (SEQ ID NO:21) primers, pfuUltra&#x2122; high-fidelity polymerase (Stratagene, Calif.), and reactions incubated as follows: 5 min. at 95&#xb0; C.; 9 cycles of 1 min. at 94&#xb0; C., 1 min. at 60&#xb0; C. and 2 min. at 72&#xb0; C., with the annealing temperature decreasing by 1&#xb0; C. each cycle; 30 cycles of 1 min. at 94&#xb0; C., 1 min. at 52&#xb0; C., and 2 min. at 72&#xb0; C.; final extension of 10 min. at 72&#xb0; C. Single-copy of the marker's alleles were obtained by using a dilution of DNA that yielded an amplicon in only 50% of the PCR reactions. PCR products were diluted 1:10 with CEQ sample load solution and then loaded into the Beckman CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System for fragment analysis. (Blake et al.

<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Several antibodies were derived from B-cells of patients with PAP. These antibodies were of the IgM, IgG isotype. Each of these antibodies were found to specifically bind to GM-CSF using the assays for specificity described herein.

<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Blood from a PAP patient (91 ml whole blood) was used to isolate a total of 49.5 million PBMCs. The viability of these cells was 99.0%. The results from a FACS analysis are shown in Table 2. The B cells were expanded by culturing approximately 25 million PBMCs in cRPMI1640 (10 ml) with IL-4 2 ng/ml (PeproTech), transferrin 50 ug/ml (Sigma), PMA 5 ng/ml (Sigma), and cyclosporine A 0.5 ug/ml (Sigma) with feeder cells. After 11 days of culture, 12 million cells remained and were subsequently fused with a myeloma cell by electro-fusion (CytoPulse CEEF-50). FACS analysis results are set forth in Table 2.</p>

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Epitope Mapping of Anti-GM-CSF Antibody</heading>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">To map the epitope of GM-CSF to which G9 binds, a series of overlapping peptides were generated that span the length of human GM-CSF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Briefly, twenty-five overlapping 12-mer peptides encompassing the human GM-CSF sequence (GenBank Accession # AAA52578, residues 14 to 144) were designed to contain 7 amino acid overlaps. Peptides were generated as individual 3.7 mm&#xd7;3.7 mm spots by solid phase synthesis via attachment of the C-terminus of each peptide to the surface of a derivatized cellulose membrane (SPOTs technology, Sigma Genosys). A standard Western blot analysis was employed to determine which peptides cross-react with G9 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The cellulose membrane was wetted in methanol and blocked in Blocking Solution (5% BSA, 1&#xd7; TBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% NaN3) overnight at 4&#xb0; C. Fresh Blocking Solution containing 1 mg/ml purified 10G9 antibody was added, and the blot was incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. The blot was washed three times, 5 min each, in TBS-T (1&#xd7;TBS, 0.1% Tween-20), and incubated for one hour in a 1:10,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch cat. 109-035-088) in diluent (5% BSA, 1&#xd7;TBS, 0.1% Tween-20). The blot was developed using SuperSignal West Femto ECL Substrate Kit (Pierce cat. 34095), followed by a one second exposure to BioMAX film (Kodak). By this method, peptides #6, 13, 14, 15, and possibly peptide #23 were specifically recognized by the G9 antibody, which correspond to SEQ ID NO: 35, SEQ ID NO: 36, SEQ ID NO: 37, SEQ ID NO: 38, and SEQ ID NO: 39, respectively.</p>
