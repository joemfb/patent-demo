<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention concerns a feeding device with motorized rollers for overlying bands (two or more than two), of paper or not, with a different length and bound between them in a transversal sense, constituted of a driving roller and a pressure roller, eliminating the twisting of the upper band or bands in correspondence with the final point of transversal bonding with respect to the sense of advancement, in that inside the two points (initial and final) of transversal bonding, with the extension of the upper part being greater than that of the lower (base) part, a greater running speed is necessary than for that at the lower base.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">To pull material in the form of a band, use is made of a feeding device which, normally, is composed of two rollers held in contact between them and connected to a motorized system; there are various methods relative to the creation of such devices:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">

        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0004">B) a main roller R<b>1</b>, usually of metal, connected to the transmission (mechanical or electro-mechanical) and the pressure roller R<b>2</b> covered with an elastic material (rubber) connected by driving means to the main roller R<b>1</b>. One of such devices is described in GB-771687. Said device has the disadvantage that, in the presence of bands one overlying the other, of different lengths and bound in a transversal direction between them, the twisting of the upper band or bands takes place in correspondence with the lower base band (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>).</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0005">C) U.S. Pat. No. 2,715,024 describes a driving roller from a rubber pressure material or anyway a relatively soft material (the upper roller in FIG. 1) and a pressure roller (the lower roller in FIG. 1). Both the upper and lower rollers of the device are driven, namely by the meshing gear (23, 24) in FIG. 2.</li>

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0006">To avoid the twisting of the upper band or bands in correspondence with the transversal binding point with the lower base band, the present invention utilizes two independent brushless motors that are driven by an electronic driving means which adapts the speed of the pressure roller by acting on a second motor connected to said pressure roller.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0007">The invention is therefore created, preferably but not exclusively, by a feeding device with motorized rollers for bands of paper or other materials, one overlying the other, of different lengths and bound in a transversal direction between them, constituted of a driving roller and of a pressure roller, wherein the feeding roller is driven by a first brushless motor and by the fact that the pressure roller is driven by a second brushless motor, characterised by the fact that said feeding device is driven by an electronic driving means that permits the pressure roller to turn at a greater speed than the driving roller, according to as much as is allowed by the bands, one overlying the other, of interposing material, permitting the movement of the overlying band placed above the lower base band during the advance feed, maintaining the necessary tension constant and eliminating the twisting of the overlying band or bands in correspondence with the transversal bonding with the lower base band.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0008">Another characteristic is given by the fact that the electronic driving means that controls the first brushless motor connected to the main driving roller allows the operator to determine the speed and the power with which to make the lower base band advance, maintaining it as constant during the working cycle, and that the electronic driving means that controls the second brushless motor connected to the rubber-covered pressure roller allows the operator to determine and maintain as constant the power necessary so that the rubber-covered pressure roller has the possibility of turning at a higher peripheral speed than the speed of advance feed of the lower base band, said difference being determined and controlled by the sliding of the quantity of excess upper band with respect to that of the lower base band.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0009">Another characteristic is given by the fact that the power assigned to the second brushless motor is determined by the operator on the basis of the dimensions and characteristics of the material being worked.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">Another characteristic is given by the fact that the first brushless motor connected to the driving roller is controlled under a given tension at the maximum torque, determining the speed of rotation of the same roller and, therefore, the speed of advancement of the lower base band being worked.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0011">Another characteristic is given by the fact that the second brushless motor connected to the pressure roller is controlled under a given current, this permitting the same to turn at any speed from zero to its permitted maximum, with the possibility of regulating the torque necessary for each single phase of work.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0012">Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will appear clear from the description, here following, of a method of creation, given by the illustrations as a non-limiting example.</p>
