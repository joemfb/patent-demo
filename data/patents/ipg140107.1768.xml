<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to improvements to a method, article and apparatus for use in medical and dental procedures, and particularly to improvements to a method and apparatus in the form of a retractor vibrator and the article in the form of a disposable tip for reducing or minimizing pain during tissue or skin puncturing procedures, such as, administration by injection, into the gums, skin or other tissue of a patient, of a liquid, such as, and in particular, an anesthetic.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As described in former applications, in the prior art, the normal procedure for reducing the pain when injecting a liquid, such as, an anesthetic, serum, vitamins, vaccine, or other medical or dental efficacious liquids is either to (a) place a very cold material against the skin or flesh of the patient at the injection site, (b) to apply a topical treatment to the skin or flesh at the injection site, which temporarily numbs the skin or flesh or (c) rapidly manually massaging the skin or tissue at the injection site while performing the injection. Although these procedures have some effect, they are either cumbersome, require some time to complete or are of limited effect and do not reduce the pain to a satisfactory level. The invention described in the former applications provided a unique and novel apparatus and method for reducing pain during skin puncturing procedures, particularly involving dentistry.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is a general object of the present invention to provide improvements to the inventions described in the former applications, especially regarding the retractor vibrator and single use or disposable tip described. Through the use of the improvements described and claimed herein further disadvantages will be overcome when injecting an anesthetic, serum, vitamins, vaccine, or other medical or dental efficacious liquids. In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide improvements to the apparatus, article and method previously described that can be easily and inexpensively utilized during a medical, veterinary or dental procedure to almost completely or substantially eliminate the pain attendant an injection as it punctures the skin or flesh of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In keeping with the objects of the present invention, the present invention comprises an improved method, an improved article in the form of a disposable tip and an improved hand-held apparatus, in its preferred form of a retractor vibrator, for vibrating a skin or tissue area, and preferably at least two skin or tissue areas or a circular skin or tissue area, immediately at an injection site simultaneously with injection by needle of a liquid, such as, an anesthesia, serum, vitamins, vaccine, or other medical or dental efficacious liquids, into the skin or tissue at the injection site in a more effective and sanitary manner. The region of interest for a dentist is the entire oral mucosa area and underlying bone whereas the region of interest for a medical doctor is the whole body and underlying bone. Such a typical injection procedure may involve an injection of Lidocaine into a patient's gum or other tissue during a dental procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly it is an object of the invention to provide an improved instrument for minimizing pain during administration by injection of a liquid, such as, an anesthetic comprising a main body, a single use detachable tip (novel article) cantilever mounted on the main body in a unique manner to prevent re-use of the tip and a vibration unit mounted in the main body when initiated to cause the tip to vibrate in a unique and novel manner. The tip is vibrated and has a free end characterized by a bifurcation to form two spaced projections defining a space between them, whereby the spaced projections can be placed in proximity to a preselected injection site on a human or animal and the tissue at said preselected injection site vibrated while an injection is given, and then continuing the vibration to massage the tissue to dissipate the injected liquid into the tissue and prevent tissue distension and swelling of the tissue. Preferably, the subsequent vibration is effected with more pressure on the tissue by the person injecting to effect better massaging. The subsequent vibration is most effective if the pressure applied is sufficient to sound bone beneath the tissue. An ordinarily skilled-in-the-art dentist can sense when he is applying pressure to tissue, such as the gums, and his instrument is touching the gums is in good contact or effectively hitting on underlying bone. When tissue or bone contact is sensed, the pressure is maintained for 1 to 90 seconds. The area of the injection site is lighted by the instrument in a unique way. Also, improved performance is obtained by pulsing the vibrations according to a preferred duty cycle, such about one second on and about 1/10<sup>th </sup>of a second off.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a further improvement, the article in the form of a single use or disposable tip is comprised of a tip sleeve composed of a hard plastic such as polycarbonate, for mounting on the forward portion of an instrument by means of a detachable connection, such as a bayonet type, and a forked tip member, also composed of a hard plastic, which parts are held together in a slightly spaced relation by an overmold of rubber or a thermoplastic elastomer having a preselected durometer. The forked tip member has a plastic cup formed in its base that is mounted on the vibrated lightpipe that projects out from the front of the instrument. A lens formed in the end of the cup shines light from the lightpipe onto the injection site. The prongs of the forked tip member extend forwardly and bend downwardly at an angle of approximately 55 degrees. An O-ring holds the lightpipe centered in the forward part of the instrument while allowing the lightpipe to vibrate freely.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As further objects of the invention an improved instrument as above can be arranged wherein the detachable tip includes a surface to act as a retractor, a control switch can be provided on the main body for on/off control of the vibration unit. Also, the tip can include an element that coacts with the improved instrument so that when placed on the improved instrument, the element activates a switch or contacts to turn the improved instrument on. When the tip is removed by the necessary manipulation, the overmold of rubber or a thermoplastic elastomer is torn drastically so that reuse of the tip is impossible. As in the previous instrument, the improved instrument can include a music player in the main body for playing music through a speaker. Further the main body can include rechargeable batteries as a power source to drive the vibration unit. Still further a light source is provided on the main body directed toward the space defined between the spaced projections to light the area being injected to provide better visibility.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, another object of the invention includes a method comprising the steps of vibrating tissue of a human or animal in a unique manner that maintains the vibration fresh and effective in proximity to a preselected injection site while simultaneously injecting by a needle or like instrument a liquid at the preselected injection site, and then continuing the vibration with more pressure applied to massage the injection site to dissipate the injected liquid and distribute it into the surrounding tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The objects of the invention are accomplished by an instrument for minimizing pain during administration by injection of a liquid, such as, an anesthetic comprising a main body having a forward end, a light-transmitting rod or lightpipe mounted in said body freely for vibration and projecting out of said forward end, a tip composed of a tip sleeve removably mounted on the forward end of said main body and a pronged tip member having a forward bifurcation defining a preselected injection site on a human or animal removably mounted on the lightpipe. The tip sleeve and pronged tip member are covered and held together by an elastic overmold while allowing light from said light rod to illuminate the injection site, a vibration unit mounted in the main body and coupled to said light rod such that when initiated imparts vibrations via said light rod to said pronged tip member. The instrument can comprise means for controlling the vibration unit for an on-off duty cycle; the duty cycle can be about 1 second on and about 1/10 second off. The pronged tip member may include at least one surface to act as a retractor. The tip sleeve and main body can include mutually coacting members to prevent reuse of said tip. A music player may be included in the main body for playing music through a speaker. The light rod is preferably composed of polycarbonate and the light rod is held by an O-ring at the forward end in order to be vibrated freely.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The objects of the invention are further accomplished by providing an instrument for minimizing pain during administration by injection of a liquid, such as, an anesthetic comprising a main body having a forward end, a light rod mounted in said body extending toward said forward end, a single use disposable tip composed of a tip sleeve removably mounted on the forward end of said main body and a pronged tip member having a forward bifurcation defining a space that brackets a preselected injection site on a human or animal removably mounted on the light rod, said tip sleeve and pronged tip member being covered and held together by an elastic overmold while allowing light from said light rod to illuminate the injection site, a vibration unit mounted in the main body and coupled to said light rod such that when initiated imparts vibrations to said pronged tip member via said light rod, said tip and main body having mutually coacting elements such that once the tip is placed on said main body, its removal automatically prevents reuse of said tip. The instrument can include means for controlling the vibration unit for an on-off duty cycle, which is preferably set for a duty cycle is about 1 second on and about 1/10 second off. The pronged tip member can include at least one surface to act as a retractor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The objects of the invention with respect to a method may comprise the steps of vibrating tissue of a human or animal in proximity to, adjacent to and bracketing a preselected injection site while simultaneously illuminating an injection site and injecting by a needle or like instrument a liquid at the preselected injection site, wherein the vibration is pulsed. The pulsing is preferably about 1 second on and about 1/10 second off.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The objects of the invention with respect to an article comprise providing a single use disposable tip for use with an instrument that includes a vibration unit and a lightpipe (transparent or translucent rod that transmits light) that is vibrated by the vibration unit, the lightpipe projecting out of the forward end of the instrument, the tip comprising a tip sleeve for removably mounting on the forward end of instrument and a pronged tip member for removably mounting on the projecting lightpipe. The pronged tip member has a forward bifurcation defining a preselected injection site on a human or animal. The tip sleeve and pronged tip member are covered and held together by an elastic overmold that enables the pronged tip member to vibrate freely with respect to the tip sleeve and light from the lightpipe to illuminate the injection site. The single use disposable tip, i.e. the tip sleeve and the pronged tip member are spaced apart and an annular space between them is covered with overmold. The pronged tip member comprises a cup and an integrally formed pair of longitudinally extending prongs with the overmold of the prongs having a wider portion to provide at least one retraction surface and on the underside grooves to collect saliva to insure that the disposable tip is not reused. At least one longitudinal groove may be formed in the wider portion of the overmold. Also, the overmold at the ends of the prongs is preferably bulbous. The forward end of the tip sleeve preferably defines an alternate groove and rib and the overmold fills the groove and anchors in the rib.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of the improved retractor vibrator is shown generally designated as <b>10</b> for performing the functions of the present invention, as will be explained hereinafter. In particular, retractor vibrator <b>10</b> is a handheld apparatus comprising a main body or handle <b>12</b> in the shape of a tube having a battery cover and an end closure that is threaded to screw onto the open end of handle <b>12</b> in a complementary fit. This is as described in WO/2010/111611, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Further as described in WO/2010/111611 handle <b>12</b> is composed of hard plastic and partially receives a chassis, the uncovered portion of which is covered by a battery cover. Rechargeable batteries, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, are located in a battery compartment of the chassis. An induction coil is mounted on the end of chassis and positioned in the battery cover to couple to a charge device in a conventional manner. A motor <b>24</b> shown schematically in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> drives eccentrically a cam <b>26</b> in phantom and is housed in the handle <b>12</b>. Cam <b>26</b> includes a ball socket whose axis is offset from the motor drive axis by from about 0.010 inches to about 0.025 inches, with an offset of about 0.020 inches being preferred. The vibration induced by the cam <b>26</b> and follower <b>100</b> fixed to rod <b>30</b> via a fitting <b>31</b> at its rear end is transmitted via polycarbonate light rod <b>30</b> to polycarbonate tip <b>50</b> firmly engaged with rod <b>30</b> at its forward end. The vibrations produced at the free ends of the two bifurcated legs <b>42</b> of tip <b>50</b> will have amplitude of about 0.5 mm (0.020 inches). During vibration, the light rod <b>30</b> is free from all other structure except the cam <b>26</b> at its rear end and tip <b>50</b> at its forward end so that it can vibrate freely by pivoting about resilient ring <b>29</b> (rubber or plastic O-ring) mounted in a groove <b>14</b> formed in rod <b>30</b> spaced from the forward end of rod <b>30</b>. The rod <b>30</b> has projections <b>16</b> on the rear side of the groove <b>14</b> to assist in holding the O-ring <b>29</b> in correct position. The forward end of the rod <b>30</b> firmly engaged with tip <b>50</b>. Also as in the structure described in WO/2010/111611, a PCB board containing electrical and electronic circuitry is mounted on the chassis (not shown). The battery (not shown) is connected via the circuitry to control the motor in the manner described in WO/2010/111611 here incorporated by reference. When the motor <b>24</b> is driven, vibration produced by the cam <b>26</b> is coupled to polycarbonate light rod <b>30</b> via a coupling fitting and cam follower <b>100</b>. A light <b>36</b>, preferably an LED, is positioned at the rear end of the rod <b>30</b> and powered by the battery and circuitry, as described in WO/2010/111611.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The forward end of the handle <b>12</b> is provided with 4 recessed bolt mountings <b>32</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A handle sleeve <b>34</b> has a flange <b>35</b> at its rear end provided with 4 bolt openings <b>37</b> to receive bolts <b>39</b> to fix the handle sleeve <b>34</b> in a recessed position to the handle <b>12</b>. A cover annulus <b>41</b> is fitted into the handle <b>12</b> to close the opening and cover the bolts <b>39</b>. The light rod <b>30</b> passes through the handle sleeve <b>34</b> and projects outwardly from it. The O-ring <b>29</b> resiliently engages the inner surface of the handle sleeve <b>34</b> near its forward end.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The handle sleeve <b>34</b> receives a single use disposable tip <b>40</b> comprised of three components, namely, a forward plastic tip <b>50</b> that is firmly but detachably mounted on the end of light rod <b>30</b>, a tip sleeve <b>62</b> for detachably and rigidly being mounted on handle sleeve <b>34</b> and a resilient (rubber or plastic) overmold <b>52</b> that covers the plastic tip <b>50</b> and holds tip <b>50</b> and tip sleeve <b>62</b> together in a spaced relationship that enables tip <b>50</b> to vibrate freely relative to tip sleeve <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each component of the disposable tip <b>40</b> will now be described in more detail. The plastic tip <b>50</b> consists of a cup <b>51</b> with its closed end defining a lens <b>53</b>. Two curved protrusions or legs <b>55</b> extend from the sides of the cup <b>51</b> bracketing the lens <b>53</b>, extending forwardly and terminating in free ends <b>57</b> that are rounded. The cup <b>51</b> has a cutout <b>59</b> and two tongues <b>61</b>, one on each side of the cutout <b>59</b> that extend rearward. Diametrically opposite cutout <b>59</b> is a small cutout <b>63</b>. The rod <b>30</b> enters into the cup <b>51</b> and firmly engages the cup <b>51</b> and the forward end of the rod is closely juxtaposed to the lens <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tip sleeve <b>62</b> consists of a tube having at its forward end a ridge <b>65</b> and behind it a groove <b>67</b>. At its rear end, tip sleeve <b>62</b> increases in diameter conically and terminates in a flange <b>69</b>. Adjacent its rear end, a rectangular through opening <b>71</b> is formed in the shell of the tip sleeve <b>62</b>. On the forward side of the opening <b>71</b> the inside of the tip sleeve <b>62</b> is thickened at <b>73</b> to form a flat shelf <b>75</b> generally the circumferential width of the opening <b>71</b>. On the rear side of the opening <b>71</b> the inside of the tip sleeve is thickened to form an inwardly extending plate <b>77</b> also generally the circumferential width of the opening <b>71</b>. Plate <b>77</b> has a v-notch <b>79</b> formed at its inmost extent. Reinforcing ribs <b>78</b> is on the exterior of the tip sleeve <b>62</b> extending from the conical section to the flange <b>69</b></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The overmold <b>52</b> is hollow and the forward portion has two longitudinally extending arms <b>81</b> that fit over the longitudinally extending legs <b>55</b>. The overmold is composed of rubber or a thermoplastic elastomer having a durometer of preferably about 40 A but may vary from about 30 A to about 50 A. The portion <b>91</b> of the overmold fits over the cup <b>51</b> and has a hole <b>83</b> that fits around the lens <b>53</b> to let the light shine through. The two arms <b>81</b> have a series of transversely extending, longitudinally spaced grooves <b>85</b> on the underside to trap saliva so reuse of the disposable tip will not be attempted. An intermediate portion <b>87</b> is enlarged transversely on both arms <b>81</b> of the overmold <b>52</b> to collectively form a retractor surface <b>89</b> to help press away or retract tissue. The rear portion <b>92</b> of the overmold <b>52</b> has a reduced thinned section <b>93</b> that at the rear is integral with a terminal section <b>95</b> complementary in configuration to the forward end of the tip sleeve <b>62</b> to fit over the ridge <b>65</b> and behind it in the groove <b>67</b> to anchor the overmold <b>52</b> to the tip sleeve <b>62</b> and holds it spaced from the tip <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The handle sleeve <b>34</b> is a longitudinally extending tube and has at its forward end, spaced slightly rearward, a circumferential flange <b>101</b>. A tapered protrusion or tooth <b>103</b> extends axially or longitudinally forward level with the inner surface of the sleeve <b>34</b>. Inward arcuate projections <b>105</b> are formed adjacent the forward end of the handle sleeve <b>34</b>, longitudinally spaced apart to serve as constraints to hold the O-ring <b>29</b> and the light rod <b>30</b> in position within the forward end of handle sleeve <b>34</b>. As noted, only the O-ring <b>29</b> engages the inner surrounding surface of handle tip <b>34</b>. The rod <b>30</b> held by the O-ring <b>29</b> is otherwise completely free to vibrate. The handle sleeve <b>34</b> at its rear end is of larger diameter with a transition conical section <b>111</b> between the front end and rear end. The rear end terminates in flange <b>35</b> having bolt opening <b>37</b>. Spaced forward of the flange <b>35</b> is a surface portion <b>127</b> of the conical section <b>111</b> that is of fixed diameter. An arcuate ridge <b>113</b> is formed that extends circumferentially from a point <b>125</b> of larger diameter than portion <b>127</b> circumferentially for about 60 to 90 degrees and terminates at point <b>121</b>. Ridge <b>113</b> is narrowed by cutout <b>115</b> on its right side as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and has a dip <b>117</b> to enable a bolt to pass through to a bolt opening <b>37</b>. The ridge <b>113</b> defines a groove <b>119</b> on its rear side, due to surface <b>127</b> having a fixed diameter and a low rib <b>123</b> extends longitudinally in groove <b>119</b> to the rear of cutout <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each of tip sleeve <b>62</b>, handle sleeve <b>34</b> and handle <b>12</b> have indicia to show how the parts line up. Handle <b>12</b> has an arrowhead <b>131</b> pointing forward on its front end aligned with the control button <b>132</b> to turn the power on and off. Handle sleeve <b>34</b> has an arrowhead <b>133</b> pointing forward just behind the flange <b>35</b>. The disposable tip <b>40</b> has an arrowhead <b>135</b> on tip sleeve <b>62</b> pointing rearward so that when the disposable tip <b>40</b> is pushed longitudinally onto the handle sleeve, the tooth <b>103</b> will partially be inserted or protrude into the cutout <b>59</b> of the plastic tip <b>50</b>, but with clearance from both the plastic tip <b>50</b> and light rod <b>30</b> so that their vibration is not in any way interfered with. As the disposable tip <b>40</b> is being pushed onto the handle sleeve <b>34</b> in a linear longitudinal direction, the thickened area at <b>73</b> that forms a flat shelf <b>75</b> causes the inwardly extending plate <b>77</b> to ride over the ridge <b>113</b> at cutout <b>115</b> and go behind into the groove <b>119</b>, whereupon the flat shelf <b>75</b> drops down onto the surface <b>127</b>, the rectangular through opening <b>71</b> straddles the ridge <b>113</b> at the cutout <b>115</b> and the plate <b>77</b> drops onto the rib <b>123</b> with the v-notch <b>93</b> engaging the rib <b>123</b>. At this point, the disposable tip <b>40</b> is latched onto the handle sleeve <b>34</b> and cannot be pulled off. Also, the tooth <b>103</b> is positioned partially in the cutout <b>59</b> but with suitable clearance regarding the rod <b>30</b> and the cup <b>51</b> of the tip <b>50</b>. The tooth will, at this time, be lying in the same plane normal to the longitudinal axis of the instrument, the handle sleeve and cup <b>50</b> as the cutout and the tabs <b>61</b>. To remove the disposable tip <b>40</b> from the handle sleeve <b>34</b>, it is necessary for the tip sleeve <b>62</b> to be rotated relative to the handle sleeve from adjacent point <b>125</b> toward the terminal point <b>121</b> until the plate <b>77</b> clears this point <b>121</b>, at which time, the disposable tip <b>40</b> can be removed by longitudinally pulling forward. However, during the relative rotary motion between the tip sleeve <b>62</b> and handle sleeve <b>34</b>, the plastic tip <b>50</b> will quickly engage the tooth <b>103</b>, either by the side walls of the cutout <b>59</b> or the tabs <b>61</b> or both and the tip <b>50</b> will then be held stationary. The tip sleeve <b>62</b> will still be rotatable relative to the handle sleeve <b>34</b> so it can be removed, and in this process as the tip sleeve is rotated, a torsion force will be imparted to the overmold <b>52</b> and the elastic limit of the overmold <b>52</b> at the thinned section <b>93</b> will quickly be exceeded and the overmold will experience a severe tearing of the thinned section <b>93</b> of overmold <b>52</b> over about 60 to 90 degrees or more, thereby rendering disposable tip (<b>40</b>) unfit for further use and destroying effectively its utility and/or its ability to be reused.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described, the fitting member <b>31</b> attached to the end of the light rod <b>30</b> includes a projecting stub with ball end <b>100</b> as a cam follower for contacting and following the cam <b>26</b> to impart the vibratory motion of the cam <b>26</b> to the light rod <b>30</b>. The end of the light rod <b>30</b> is in alignment with the LED <b>36</b> as previously described. Although continuous pulsing can be used, it has been discovered that a pulsed vibration sequence is more effective. A pulsed sequence of about one second on and then about a tenth of a second off, is sufficient to pulse the vibration without allowing the vibration of the tip to ever drop down to zero. In this manner, the device or instrument pulses about every second, re-stimulating the nerves in the area, and apparently the brain never gets used to it, so the vibrations remain effective. To this end the electronics controlling the pulsing is modified to include the necessary means for pulsing and obtaining the desired on/off duty cycle as noted. The motor is energized using 110 volt AC (50-300 Hz frequency). The frequency can vary from about 50 Hz to about 300 Hz. The vibration at the free ends of the prongs or forks <b>42</b> can vary from about 0.1 mm to about 1.5 mm. The duty cycle on pulsing is about 0.908 Hz (cycle time=about 1.1 sec.) with a pulse off of about 0.1 sec. The off portion of the cycle should not be greater than about 0.5 sec.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The novel instrument exhibits enhanced amplitude and percusses the tissue contacted, causes a deeper penetration of the vibratory stimulus into the oral mucosa of a dental patient, thereby stimulating the nerve receptors, A-beta nerve receptors, which are located deep within the tissue. Also, vibration is sent out in a full 360 degrees around the disposable tip <b>40</b>, mainly, from three places off of the tip, namely, from each free end of the curved downwardly arms, as well as, from the paddle or retractor portion <b>87</b>. Also the joint with tip sleeve <b>62</b> at times will stimulate the lip or cheek or bone when resting against it. The enhanced vibration is not limited to just the area at the ends of the curved downward arms. Alternative tip free end shapes are shown in WO/2010/111611.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As previously described in WO/2010/111611 a plastic sleeve or wrapper can be placed around the instrument to protect its sterility and avoid contamination during use. The plastic sleeve or wrapper has a hole punched in it so it can fit over the handle sleeve <b>34</b>, and the disposable tip <b>40</b> can be mounted over the handle sleeve <b>34</b> as described. To this end, the flange at the rear of the disposable tip <b>40</b> is spaced slightly from the face of the instrument to provide a slot to accommodate the plastic sleeve or wrapper in between the instrument and the tip.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">If the device or instrument is to be used for a medical application, that is, to some part of the body other than the mouth, the disposable tip <b>40</b> will curve upwardly, 180 degrees opposite from the dental application described above, and the legs of the tip member <b>50</b>, or other tip member shape, can be coated or uncoated by the overmold with the overmold <b>260</b> bridging and holding together the cup of the tip member and the ribbed end of the tip sleeve <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be apparent to one skilled in the art, from the above description that the present invention can be utilized in a variety of procedures requiring a skin or flesh puncture. Such other procedures include such things as inoculations, shots to give patients medication, etc. Such skin punctures procedures can be performed on any portion of the body such as the arm, legs, buttocks, torso, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The method of the invention consists in vibrating tissue of a human or animal in proximity to a preselected injection site on the human or animal body while simultaneously injecting by a needle or like instrument a liquid at the preselected injection site. The vibration is most effective if transmitted to a cylindrical volume of tissue and underlying bone at the injection site, and particularly on opposite sides of or surrounding the injection site. Also, it is preferred that a noise generator be mounted in the main body of the instrument so that the vibration is accompanied by noise that will provide a distraction. In the most preferred embodiment of the method, a pulsed vibration sequence is used. A pulsed sequence of one second on and then a tenth of a second off, was sufficient to pulse the vibration without allowing the vibration of the tip to ever drop down to zero. In this manner, the device or instrument pulses every second, re-stimulating the nerves in the area, and apparently the brain never gets used to it, so the vibrations remain effective.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The tip is vibrated and has a free end characterized by a shape to induce vibrations in the tissue and underlying bone, whereby the free end can be placed in proximity to a preselected injection site on a human or animal and the tissue and underlying bone at said preselected injection site is vibrated while an injection is given. The vibrations are continued even after the injection has been completed to massage the tissue to dissipate the injected liquid into the tissue and prevent tissue distension and swelling of the tissue, which is a source of pain.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably, the subsequent vibration is effected with more pressure on the tissue by the person injecting to effect better massaging. The subsequent vibration can be more effective in certain areas of the mouth if the pressure applied is sufficient to sound bone beneath the tissue. An ordinarily skilled-in-the-art dentist can sense when he is applying pressure to tissue, such as the gums, and his instrument is effectively touching and in good contact or hitting on underlying bone. When such bone contact is sensed, the pressure is maintained for at least 1 up to about 90 seconds or until any tissue distension is no longer observed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the present invention has been shown and described herein in what are conceived to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is recognized that departures, modifications, adaptations and variations may be made therefrom without departing from the intended scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.</p>
