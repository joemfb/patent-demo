<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application entitled &#x201c;Carpeted Automotive Vehicle Load Floor Having a Living Hinge&#x201d; filed Apr. 23, 2012 and having U.S. Ser. No. 13/453,201.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates, in general, to the field of automotive vehicle load floors and, in particular, to such load floors which are carpeted and have a pivotable cover.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sandwich-type composite panels having cores have very important characteristics because of their light weight and high strength. Conventionally, such panels are constructed by sandwiching a core having a large number of cavities and having low strength characteristics between two outer layers or skins, each of which is much thinner than the core but has excellent mechanical characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The prior art discloses a method of making a panel of sandwich-type composite structure having a cellular core in a single processing step. In that method, the panel is made by subjecting a stack of layers of material to cold-pressing in a mold. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the stack is made up of: at least a first skin made of a stampable reinforced thermoplastics material, a cellular core made of a thermoplastics material, and a second skin also made of a stampable reinforced thermoplastics material. The stack may also include one or more external covering layers made of a woven or nonwoven thermoplastic material. The skins may be pre-heated outside the mold or heated inside the mold to a softening temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such a method is particularly advantageous because of the fact that it makes it possible, in a single operation, to generate cohesion and bonding between the various layers of the composite structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and to shape the resulting panel while preserving all of the mechanical properties imparted by the cellular-core sandwich structure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Panels of sandwich-type composition structure having a cellular core have rigidity characteristics sufficient to enable mechanical structures subjected to large stresses to be reinforced structurally without making them too heavy. Such panels are in common use in shipbuilding, aircraft construction, and rail vehicle construction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To maximize the functionality of such panels, it is known, in particular, that hinges can be added so that the panels can be hinged to other panels. Such hinges are separate parts that are fixed to the panels by gluing, welding, riveting, or some other fastening technique.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such hinges are fixed to the sandwich-structure composite panels in a separate and subsequent operation, after said panels have been formed. That subsequent operation requires an additional workstation, be it automated or otherwise, which increases, in particular, the manufacturing time and the manufacturing cost of the finished parts.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the fact that separate external parts are mounted on a composite panel of the sandwich-type is a source of quality defects, and thus adds to the cost of making such panels.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Published U.S. Patent Application 2005/0189674 discloses a method of making a composite panel of sandwich structure provided with a hinge. The panel includes a stack made up of a first skin of a reinforced thermoplastics material, a cellular core made of a thermoplastics material, and a second skin made of a reinforced thermoplastics material. The panel is formed by pressing the stack in a mold. The first and second skins are preheated to a softening temperature. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, after the panel has formed, an incision is made at a determined place in the panel so as to cut through one of the first and second skins, and substantially through the entire thickness of the cellular core, while leaving the other skin intact so that it forms a living hinge between two portions of the incised panel.</p>

Nos. 5,298,694; 5,502,930; 5,915,445; 5,979,962; 6,050,630; 6,102,464; 6,435,577; 6,537,413; 6,631,785; 6,655,299; 6,659,223; 6,682,675; 6,793,747; 6,748,876; 6,790,026; 6,682,676; 6,823,803; 6,843,525; 6,890,023; 6,981,863; 7,014,259; 7,090,274; 7,093,879; 7,264,685; 7,320,739; 7,402,537; 7,419,713; 7,837,009; 7,909,379; 7,918,313; 7,919,031; 8,117,972; 2006/0255611; 2008/0185866 and 2011/0315310.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One problem associated with prior art load floors is that the load floors typically require many assembly stops often involving costly labor. Also, the material making up such load floors is often non-recyclable.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A problem associated with carpeted load floors having covers which cover a storage area in an automotive vehicle is that loose items or objects in the storage area can cause relatively loud, undesirable noises during vehicle travel. Also, when the cover is in its open position the underside of the cover is not particularly visually appealing.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, one embodiment of a carpeted automotive vehicle load floor, generally indicated at <b>13</b>, includes a pair of carpeted, compression-molded, sandwich-type composite hinged panels <b>10</b>. Each panel <b>10</b> has a living hinge <b>12</b> and forms a separate part of the vehicle load floor <b>13</b>. However, it is to be understood that one or more hinged panels <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention may be used in a wide variety of environments besides the automotive vehicle environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Each hinged panel <b>10</b> is typically manufactured by providing a stack of material located or positioned within a mold. The stack includes first and second reinforced thermoplastic skins or outer layers <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, respectively, a core having a large number of cavities such as a thermoplastic cellular core <b>20</b> disposed between and bonded to the skins <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> by press molding. A substantially continuous covering or carpet layer, generally indicated at <b>21</b>, made of thermoplastics material covers the first skin <b>16</b>. The skins <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are heated typically outside of the mold to a softening temperature. The mold is preferably a low-pressure, compression mold which performs a thermo-compression process on the stack of materials.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A portion <b>32</b> of the composite panel <b>10</b> is crushed at a predetermined location simultaneously with the step of applying the pressure to compact and reduce the thickness of the cellular core <b>20</b> at the predetermined location for form a depression <b>34</b> which receives a carpeted cover, generally indicated at <b>36</b>, of the hinged panel <b>10</b> at a pair of use positions as indicated by phantom lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The thickness of the carpeted cover <b>36</b> is substantially equal to the depth of the depression <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The thermoplastic carpet layer <b>21</b> not only covers the first skin <b>18</b>, but also covers and is bonded to a skin <b>38</b> of a panel, generally indicated at <b>40</b>, of the cover <b>36</b>. An intermediate portion <b>42</b> of the layer <b>21</b> is not bonded to either the skin <b>16</b> or the skin <b>38</b> to form a living hinge, generally indicated at <b>44</b> (or <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The living hinge <b>44</b> allows the carpeted cover <b>36</b> to pivot between the different use positions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The carpet layer <b>21</b> may be a resin carpet and the resin may be polypropylene. One side or both sides of the cover <b>36</b> of the hinged panel <b>10</b> may be covered with the carpet layer <b>21</b> which may be made of a woven or nonwoven material (typically of the carpet type).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the panel <b>40</b> also includes a skin <b>46</b> and a cellular core <b>48</b> disposed between and bonded to the skins <b>38</b> and <b>46</b>. A bottom layer of the covering layer <b>21</b> extends from the top layer of the layer <b>21</b> and is bonded to and covers the top surface of the skin <b>46</b> to cover the bottom surface of the cover <b>36</b>. The bottom layer of the cover <b>21</b> is a decorative, noise-management, covering layer bonded to the bottom surface of the cover <b>36</b> to provide sound insulation in the closed position of the cover <b>36</b> and an aesthetically pleasing appearance to the bottom of the cover <b>26</b> in its open position. In other words, the covering layer reduces the level of undesirable noise in a passenger compartment of the vehicle in the closed position of the cover <b>36</b>. A portion <b>50</b> of the covering layer not bonded to the cover <b>36</b> is bonded to the intermediate portion <b>42</b> of the top layer of the covering <b>21</b> to further form the living hinge <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The cellular core <b>48</b> (as well as the core <b>20</b>) may be a honeycomb core. In this example, the cellular core <b>48</b> and the core <b>20</b> have an open-celled structure of the type made up of tubes or a honeycomb, and it is made mainly of polyolefin and preferably of polypropylene. It is also possible to use a cellular structure having closed cells of the foam type. Alternatively, the panel <b>40</b> may be made of a solid material, such as a solid plastic part, to which the top and bottom layers of the layer <b>21</b> are bonded.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each of the skins <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> (as well as the skins <b>38</b> and <b>46</b>) may be fiber reinforced. The thermoplastic of the skins <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>46</b>, the covering layer <b>21</b> and the cores <b>20</b> and <b>48</b> may be polypropylene. At least one of the skins <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>46</b> may be woven skin, such as polypropylene skin. Each of the skins <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>46</b> may be reinforced with fibers, e.g., glass fibers, carbon fibers or natural fibers. At least one of the skins <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>46</b> may advantageously be made up of woven glass fiber fabric and of a thermoplastics material.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The resulting hinged panel <b>10</b> may have a thickness in the range of 5 to 25 mm and the crushed portion of the panel <b>10</b> may have a thickness in the range of 3 to 15 mm. The depression <b>34</b> may have a depth in the range of 2 to 10 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one example method of making the hinged panel <b>10</b> including the panel <b>40</b>, stacks of material may be pressed in a low pressure cold-forming mold <b>22</b>. With respect to a part of the hinged panel <b>10</b>, the stack is made up of the first skin <b>16</b>, the cellular core <b>20</b>, the second skin <b>18</b> and a portion of the covering layer <b>21</b>, and is pressed at a pressure lying in the range of 10&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>Pa. to 30&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>Pa. The first and second skins <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are preferably pre-heated to make them malleable and stretchable. Advantageously, in order to soften the first and second skins <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, respectively, heat is applied to a pre-assembly constituted by the stack made up of at least the first skin <b>16</b>, of the cellular core <b>20</b>, and the second skin <b>18</b> so that, while a part of the panel <b>10</b> is being formed in the mold, the first and second skins <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> have a forming temperature lying approximately in the range of 160&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C., and, in this example, about 180&#xb0; C. In like fashion, the cover <b>36</b> may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An end portion <b>52</b> of the bottom layer of the layer <b>21</b> is also bonded to the top surface of the skin <b>16</b> and helps to support the carpeted cover <b>36</b> in one of the use positions of the cover <b>36</b>, as indicated in phantom at <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the position <b>54</b>, the cover <b>36</b> encloses a storage area <b>56</b> between the panel <b>10</b> and another composite panel <b>58</b> having a depression <b>60</b> to receive a free end portion <b>62</b> of the cover <b>36</b>. The panel <b>58</b> may also be a carpeted composite panel similar in construction to the hinged panel <b>10</b> having the cover <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another use position, indicated at <b>64</b> by phantom lines, the cover <b>36</b> is completely received within the depression <b>34</b> to allow access to the storage area <b>56</b> without having to hold the cover <b>36</b> open as indicated by the solid line position of the cover <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The covering layer <b>21</b> including its top and bottom layers is substantially continuous and may be formed from separate pieces of thermoplastic resin carpet which are subsequently bonded or fused together, such as by heat and/or pressure to carpet the entire top surface of the hinged panel <b>10</b> as well as the bottom surface of the cover <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a second embodiment of a carpeted, sandwich-type, composite hinged panel is shown. The panels have substantially the same structure and function as the panels <b>10</b> of the first embodiment except instead of a bottom layer of thermoplastic resin carpet, the bottom layer of the cover <b>36</b>&#x2032; is made of a nonwoven scrim <b>70</b> of fine denier, spunbond thermoplastic (i.e., polypropylene and/or polyester) fibers in the form of a sheet and having a weight in a range of 8 to 100 gsm (i.e., grams per square meter). Preferably, the weight is in a range of 17 to 60 gms. Also, preferably, the denier is in a range of 1.8 to 2.2.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The scrim <b>70</b> has an open mesh of nonwoven synthetic thermoplastic fibers including a plurality of adjacent openings. The scrim <b>70</b> both transmits light to the underlying layer and reflects light while reducing the level of undesirable noise from a storage area to a passenger compartment of the vehicle. The scrim <b>70</b> may be manufactured in a color which is substantially the same, complements or is in contrast with the color of the upper carpet. Also, the cover <b>36</b>&#x2032; including the underlying scrim layer <b>70</b> can be made in a single compression molding step as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While exemplary embodiments are described above, it is not intended that these embodiments describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Additionally, the features of various implementing embodiments may be combined to form further embodiments of the invention.</p>
