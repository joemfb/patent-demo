<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT RE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a system and method for measuring sheet resistance of a thin film.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In electrical systems, at times, it is necessary to utilize a sheet of film that is resistant to electrical current. To fabricate these resistive films, tests must be conducted on the resistive films to ensure that sheet resistant throughout the film is at a certain level and is consistent throughout the entire film. Technology currently exists to test sheet resistance of the film. Unfortunately, existing technology suffers from certain deficiencies. In particular, existing technologies either (1) contact the film and destroy the same or (2) does not contact the film for testing but is inaccurate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved method and system for testing sheet resistance of a resistive film (i.e., thin film coated with a resistive coating).</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The system and method disclosed herein for testing sheet resistance of a resistive film addresses the needs discussed above, discussed below and those that are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The testing system includes first and second waveguides gapped apart from each other. The resistive film is disposed between the first and second waveguides and does not contact the waveguides. As such, the film is not damaged through testing. The film may be held between two rollers that are advanced in unison so that the entire roll of film may be tested. The first and second waveguides are gapped apart sufficiently from each other so that the film does not contact the waveguides when the rollers are being advanced during testing. Moreover, it is preferable that the first and second waveguides be placed as close to each other as possible to the extent that the film does not contact the waveguides during advancement and testing of the film to facilitate more accurate readings.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The system may include one or two probe stations each comprising first and second waveguides. These two probe stations measure the E-field and H-field of the film. In order to ensure that the waveguides test the entire width of the roll of film, the first and second waveguides may each be divided into first and second rows of waveguides. The first row of waveguides are aligned to each other across the width of the film. Any gap between the waveguides of the first row is covered by the waveguides of the second row. In this manner, the entire width of the film is tested.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">More particularly, a measurement system for testing a resistive film is disclosed. The system may comprise a first waveguide, a second waveguide and a network analyzer. The second waveguide may be gaped away from the first waveguide. The film may be disposed between the first and second waveguides and spaced away from the first and second waveguides. The network analyzer may be in electrical communication with the first and second waveguides for measuring S parameters of the film wherein the measured S parameters of the film are converted to a sheet resistance value to determine whether the sheet resistance of the film is within tolerance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first and second waveguides may be oriented vertically so that the film is placed in a horizontal orientation between the first and second waveguides. The first and second waveguides may be mounted to a bench. The system may also further comprise first and second stepper motors mounted to the bench with the stepper motors operative to unwind a roll of the film between the first and second waveguides for non destructive testing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first and second waveguides may be gaped away from each other about 0.030 inches to about one (1) inch. Preferably, the first and second waveguides are gaped away from each other about 0.030 inches to about 0.300 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The system may further comprise an array of first waveguides. The array of first waveguides may have upstream and downstream rows of first waveguides. The upstream row of first waveguides may be disposed at a gap formed between two waveguides of the downstream row of first waveguides. The measurement system may also further comprise an array of second waveguides corresponding to the array of first waveguides. The array of second waveguides may be disposed opposite the film.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The measurement system may further comprise an E field set of first and second waveguides and an H field set of first and second waveguides which may be mounted to the bench.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, a method of measuring resistivity of a resistive film is disclosed. The method may comprise the steps of disposing the resistive film between first and second waveguides; adjusting the film so that the film is spaced away from the first and second waveguides; measuring sheet resistance of the film with the first and second waveguides while the film is spaced away from the first and second waveguides; and feeding the film between the first and second waveguides without touching the first and second waveguides.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The measuring step may comprise the steps of: measuring an E field with an E field set of first and second waveguides; and measuring an H field with an H field set of first and second waveguides in order to detect any form of damage on the film.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the drawings, a RF non-contact thin film measurement system <b>10</b> using a two port waveguide is shown. A resistive film <b>12</b> may be disposed between two waveguide <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>. The waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>are gapped away from each other by distance <b>16</b>. The film <b>12</b> is disposed between the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>and does not touch the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>. The waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>transmit electromagnetic forces to the film <b>12</b>. S-parameters of the film <b>12</b> are measured by a vector network analyzer <b>18</b> and sent to a computer <b>20</b> to derive a sheet resistance value of the area of the film <b>12</b> being measured to determine whether the resistivity of the film <b>12</b> is within tolerance. Beneficially, the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>do not contact the film <b>12</b> and do not destroy the film <b>12</b>, and damage to the film <b>12</b> is detected. Accordingly, a resistive film <b>12</b> having a long length is achievable since the film <b>12</b> is not destroyed along the entire length of the roll <b>22</b> of film <b>12</b> as the roll <b>22</b> of film <b>12</b> is being tested.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>10</b> may include a stand <b>24</b>. The roll <b>22</b> of film <b>12</b> may be mounted to a roller <b>26</b>. The roller <b>26</b> may be incrementally advanced by way of stepper motor <b>28</b>. The film <b>12</b> may be hand fed through an upper array <b>30</b> of waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and a lower array <b>32</b> of waveguides <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. The film <b>12</b> may be passed through a set of rollers <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>to guide the film <b>12</b> to roller <b>36</b>. The roller <b>36</b> may also be advanced by way of stepper motor <b>38</b>. As discussed above, the film <b>12</b> does not contact the upper and lower arrays <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. The stepper motors <b>28</b>, <b>38</b> advance film <b>12</b> in unison so that the film <b>12</b> does not sag too much thereby touching the lower array <b>32</b> of the waveguides <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>or place too much tension in the film <b>12</b> thereby causing the film <b>12</b> to contact the upper array <b>30</b> of the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the distal end <b>40</b> of the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and the distal ends <b>40</b> of the waveguides <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>define the distance <b>16</b>. The upper array <b>30</b> of the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be adjusted further away or closer to the lower array <b>32</b> of the waveguides <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>by way of adjustment nut <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). By turning the adjustment nuts <b>42</b>, the upper and lower arrays <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be adjusted closer to or away from each other. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the adjustment nuts <b>42</b> adjust the vertical height of the waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The distance <b>16</b> may be large enough so that the film <b>12</b> does not contact the upper or lower arrays <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> as the film <b>12</b> is being fed therebetween but also close enough to provide a sufficiently accurate resistance value of the film <b>12</b>. By way of example and not limitation, the distance <b>16</b> may be between about 0.030 inch to about 1 inch. Preferably, the distance <b>16</b> is adjusted to be between about 0.030 inch to about 0.300 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the upper array <b>30</b> of waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>is shown. Only waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are identified. However, the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be set up so as to extend across the entire width <b>44</b> of the film <b>12</b>. A plurality of waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be set up in two different rows <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. The first row <b>46</b> of waveguides <b>14</b><i>a, c, n </i>may be positioned adjacent to each other. Due to physical constraints of the waveguide <b>14</b><i>a, c, n</i>, there is a gap <b>50</b> between each adjacent waveguide <b>14</b><i>a, c</i>, etc. The waveguide <b>14</b><i>a </i>measures the resistivity of the film <b>12</b> only at the footprint of the waveguide <b>14</b><i>a </i>on the film <b>12</b>. The resistivity of the film <b>12</b> is not measured at the gap <b>50</b> by the first row <b>46</b> of waveguides <b>14</b><i>a, c</i>-<i>n</i>. Accordingly, any defects in the film <b>12</b> along this area of the film <b>12</b> are not detected by the first row <b>46</b> of waveguides <b>14</b><i>a, c</i>-<i>n</i>. To catch defects within the gap area <b>50</b> of the film <b>12</b>, the second row <b>48</b> of waveguides <b>14</b><i>b, d</i>-<i>n </i>are positioned at the gap <b>50</b> and overlap with the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a, c</i>-<i>n </i>of the first row <b>46</b>. In this manner, the entire width <b>44</b> of the film <b>12</b> is tested. If the film <b>12</b> width <b>44</b> is wider, then additional waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be set up across the width of the stand <b>24</b> so that the entire width <b>44</b> is covered by waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The lower array <b>32</b> of waveguides <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be set up immediately below the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>.

The waveguide <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may define a first probe station and may be set up so as to measure the H field of the film <b>12</b>.

The lower array <b>32</b> of waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are not shown but may be placed immediately below the upper array <b>50</b> of the waveguides <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>.

The first row <b>56</b> of waveguides <b>54</b><i>a, c</i>-<i>n </i>may be positioned adjacent to each other. Additionally, the adjacent waveguides <b>54</b><i>a, c</i>-<i>n </i>of the first row <b>56</b> may be gapped apart <b>60</b>. The waveguides <b>54</b><i>b, d</i>-<i>n </i>of the second row <b>58</b> may be placed at the gaps <b>60</b> in order to measure resistivity of the film <b>12</b>. The waveguides <b>55</b>a-n may be positioned immediately below corresponding waveguides <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. The waveguides <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>of the first and second rows <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may span the entire width <b>44</b> of the film <b>12</b>. The waveguides <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are set up to measure an orthogonal field, namely the E field of the film <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the waveguides <b>15</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> of the upper and lower arrays <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may each be attached to a waveguide coax transition <b>62</b>. The waveguide coax transition <b>62</b> may be connected to the vector network analyzer <b>18</b> by way of a coaxial cable <b>64</b>. The vector network analyzer <b>18</b> measures the S-parameters of the film <b>12</b> and stores the data in computer <b>66</b>. The computer <b>66</b> and the vector network analyzer <b>18</b> are in communication with each other via an interface bus <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each of the waveguides <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and <b>55</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be electrically connected to the vector network analyzer <b>18</b> by way of a switch assembly <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>. The switch assembly <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> may be an SPNT solid state switch assembly in which the switch assembly <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> activates one set of waveguides such as <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>or <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>55</b><i>a </i>at a time. When activated, the vector network analyzer <b>18</b> measures the S-parameter of the film <b>12</b> at the location of the activated waveguide. The S-parameters are sent to the computer <b>66</b> by way of interface bus <b>67</b>. The S-parameters for the various waveguides are stored in the computer <b>66</b>.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In operation, the system <b>10</b> is used to non-destructively test a resistive film <b>12</b>. The system <b>10</b> may be set up with one (1) or two (2) sets of upper and lower arrays <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>52</b> of waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> depending on whether the E field, H field or both fields of the resistive film <b>12</b> is to be tested by the system <b>10</b>. The film <b>12</b> is fed between the upper and lower arrays <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>52</b> of waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> and mounted to both rollers <b>26</b>, <b>36</b> which are advanceable in unison by stepper motors <b>28</b>, <b>38</b>. The rollers <b>26</b>, <b>36</b> pull the film <b>12</b> taut therebetween to suspend the film <b>12</b> between the upper and lower arrays <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>52</b> of the waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> without touching the waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The distance <b>16</b> between the waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> can be adjusted by way of adjustment nuts <b>42</b>. Preferably, the distance <b>16</b> between the waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> are brought as close together to each other as possible to the extent that the film <b>12</b> does not contact the waveguide <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> when the film <b>12</b> is being tested or when the film <b>12</b> is being advanced.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Once the film <b>12</b> is set up, the vector network analyzer <b>18</b> and computer <b>20</b> test the film <b>12</b> to determine the sheet resistance. The film <b>12</b> is not moved at the time the tests are conducted. The film <b>12</b> is only being tested at the local area of the foot print of the waveguide <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>. After testing, the data is sent by the vector network analyzer <b>18</b> to the computer <b>20</b>. The stepper motors <b>28</b>, <b>38</b> advance film <b>12</b> through the upper and lower arrays <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>52</b> a predetermined distance (e.g., 12&#x2033;, 24&#x2033;, 36&#x2033;, x&#x2033;). The film <b>12</b> is retested after being advanced x&#x2033;. The film <b>12</b> is tested until the film <b>12</b> is transferred from the roller <b>26</b> to the roller <b>36</b>. Throughout the testing phase, it is possible to test the entire roll of film <b>12</b> without destroying the film's resistivity characteristics since the waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> do not contact the film <b>12</b> during testing. Accordingly, it is possible to produce resistive film <b>12</b> of longer length.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> may be a waveguide straight. The waveguides may also have other configurations such as square, round, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The film <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is tested in a horizontal orientation. However, it is also contemplated that the system <b>10</b> may be fabricated so that the waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> provide a vertical opening instead of a horizontal opening. In this manner, the film <b>12</b> may be tested while in a vertical orientation. Other orientations are also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> extend across the width of the film <b>12</b>. The size of the waveguide <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> or the waveguide's footprint may first be determined. If a smaller waveguide is utilized for testing, then the number of waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> may be increased to ensure coverage of the width of the film <b>12</b>. If a larger waveguide is utilized for testing, then the number of waveguides <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> may be decreased yet still cover the width of the film <b>12</b>. It is contemplated that the size or footprint of the waveguide may dictate the selection of the waveguide and the RF frequency to be tested. Alternatively, the selection of the waveguide may be a function of the desired RF frequency to be tested. In other words, the desired RF frequency to be tested may dictate the selection of the waveguide to be used in the system.</p>
