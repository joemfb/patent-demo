<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/209,368 filed Mar. 6, 2009, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein it its entirety.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to building materials and more particularly to a building material that covers an exterior portion of a building and which generates electrical power when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the world's population increases, so too does the amount of energy being consumed. Unfortunately, this increased energy consumption has several undesirable consequences. One such consequence involves the introduction of pathogens and pollutants into the atmosphere from the burning of traditional fuel sources, such as coal, oil and natural gas. These pathogens and pollutants have a deleterious effect on both people and the environment. For example, the burning of fossil fuels generates greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which build up in the upper portion of the atmosphere. When sunlight is incident on the earth, these gases allow the sunlight to enter the atmosphere freely. The sunlight strikes the earths' surface where some of it is reflected back towards space as infrared radiation (i.e. heat). This infrared radiation is then trapped within the atmosphere by the greenhouse gases that have built up in the atmosphere causing an increase in global temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another such consequence involves the cost of the fuel being used to generate the increased amount of energy. As mentioned hereinabove, fossil fuels are used to generate the energy required by the majority of the world's population and include oil, natural and coal. However, because fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy resource having finite global reserves, the cost of locating and extracting these fuels increase as these reserves are depleted. These costs are then passed onto the consumer. Additionally, methods for extracting these fuels not only create undesirable ecological consequences, but in some cases they are dangerous. One way to address these issues is to develop products that use less energy, but that achieve the same result. Unfortunately, while advances have been made in this area, they have not been sufficient enough to accomplish the needed reduction in the demand for increased energy. Another way to address these consequences is to take advantage of other naturally occurring and non-toxic sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power and water power.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One such attempt at addressing these issues includes the use of solar collectors to harness and convert the energy of sunlight into electrical energy. And although several devices that employ solar cells (collectors) have been develop for application to surfaces that are exposed to sunlight (such as rooftop solar cells), these devices are not easy to use and require the use of drilling a large number of holes through the surface to connect to a power handler device. This is undesirable due to the large number of connection points and thus, wires resulting in a large number of possible failure points.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As disclosed herein with regards to an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides an improvement in an article and system for converting solar energy into electrical energy. It should be appreciated that the present invention may be utilized with both individual solar cells or solar panels (i.e. a collection of solar cells) where the cells and/or panels may be flexible (such as via a rollable sheet) or non-flexible (such as a rigid panel). As such, the solar shingle may include solar panels, individual solar cells and/or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the present invention may be used with other materials that have solar collection characteristics, such as a coating or other material that have properties similar to solar collectors. For example, materials that have heat absorbing characteristics may be used with thermocouple devices. Moreover, although the invention is described herein as being connected in a series fashion, it is contemplated that the solar cells/panels may be connected in a parallel fashion as well.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be appreciated that although the wireless solar shingle is described herein as being installed using conventional methods for installing roofing shingles, the wireless solar shingle may be installed using any method suitable to the desired end purpose. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, conventional methods for installing roofing shingles, or associating the roofing shingles with the roof of a structure, may be used and includes laying out and attaching a first roofing shingle having a size of 36 inches in length and 12 inches in width to the bottom portion of a roof. As known, this may be accomplished via roofing nails or any other suitable anchoring device or method. A second roofing shingle having a size of 30 inches in length and 12 inches in width is then located on the roof to cover a portion of the width of the first roofing shingle, a third roofing shingle having a size of 24 inches in length and 12 inches in width is located on the roof to cover a portion of the width of the second roofing shingle, a fourth roofing shingle having a size of 18 inches in length and 12 inches in width is located on the roof to cover a portion of the width of the third roofing shingle, a fifth roofing shingle having a size of 12 inches in length and 12 inches in width is located on the roof to cover a portion of the width of the fourth roofing shingle and a sixth roofing shingle having a size of 6 inches in length and 12 inches in width is located on the roof to cover a portion of the width of the fifth roofing shingle. The resultant pattern is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. This approach is repeated until the width and height of the roof is completely covered in roofing shingles.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a wireless solar shingle system <b>700</b> is provided and includes at least one base shingle <b>702</b>, at least one continuity shingle <b>704</b> and at least one jumper shingle <b>706</b>, each of which has a top side <b>708</b> and a bottom side <b>710</b> and is divided into an upper portion <b>712</b> and a lower portion <b>714</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the base shingle <b>702</b> is shown and includes a first trace <b>716</b> and a second trace <b>718</b> on the upper portion <b>712</b> of the top side <b>708</b> and a third trace <b>720</b> and a fourth trace <b>722</b> on the lower portion <b>714</b> of the bottom side <b>710</b>. It should be appreciated that although the first trace <b>716</b> and the second trace <b>718</b> are shown as being located towards the top of the upper portion <b>712</b> to avoid the nail line (used to nail the shingle to a roof), they may be located on the top side <b>708</b> as desired. It should also be appreciated that the traces may be sized (in width) such that if located in the nail like, electrical continuity of the trace would not be compromised. Additionally, although the third trace <b>720</b> and the fourth trace <b>722</b> are shown as being located towards the top of the lower portion <b>714</b>, they too may be located on the bottom side <b>710</b> as desired. However, they should be located on the bottom side <b>710</b> such that when the shingle is associated with other like shingles, the third trace <b>720</b> and fourth trace <b>722</b> are aligned with the first trace and second trace of the associated like shingles.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is contemplated that the base shingle <b>702</b> may be supplied with a solar panel attached or may be configured such that a solar panel may be attached in the future as desired (i.e. after installation). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a base shingle <b>702</b> having a plurality of solar panels is shown and includes a first solar panel <b>724</b>, a second solar panel <b>726</b> and a third solar panel <b>728</b>, wherein each of the solar panels <b>724</b>, <b>726</b>, <b>728</b> include a first connection lead <b>727</b> and a second connection lead <b>729</b>. When solar energy is incident on the solar panels <b>724</b>, <b>726</b>, <b>728</b>, an electrical potential difference is present between the first connection lead <b>727</b> and the second connection lead <b>729</b>. As shown, the solar panels <b>724</b>, <b>726</b>, <b>728</b> are attached to the base shingle and the first connection lead <b>727</b> and the second connection lead <b>729</b> are connected to the second trace <b>718</b>. Note that the second trace <b>718</b> has numerous &#x2018;breaks&#x2019; or discontinuities to prevent shorting of the first connection leads <b>727</b> and the second connection leads <b>729</b> of each of the solar panels <b>724</b>, <b>726</b>, <b>728</b>. Accordingly, solar panels <b>724</b>, <b>726</b>, <b>728</b> are electrically connected in series. it should be appreciated that the base shingle <b>702</b> may include one or more solar cell panels <b>724</b>, wherein the second trace <b>718</b> may be configured responsive to the number of panels by simply cutting and removing the unwanted conductive pieces of trace.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the wireless solar shingle system <b>700</b> may be implemented accordingly to one embodiment by positioning a first base shingle <b>750</b> having a 36&#x2033; length on the roof of a structure, such as in bottom corner of the roof, and nailing the base shingle <b>702</b> to the roof, as shown. The first base shingle <b>702</b> is then connected to the roof using conventional methods, such as nails. A second base shingle <b>752</b> having a 24&#x2033; inch length is then positioned over and toward the center of the first base shingle <b>750</b> such that the third trace <b>720</b> and the fourth trace <b>722</b> of the second base shingle <b>752</b> overlay and contact the first trace <b>716</b> and second trace <b>718</b> of the first shingle <b>750</b>, respectively. As shown, it should be appreciated that the fourth trace <b>722</b> of the second base shingle <b>752</b> should be configured as discussed hereinabove to not short circuit the solar panels <b>724</b>, <b>726</b>, <b>728</b> on the first base shingle <b>750</b>. For example, in this case the fourth trace <b>722</b> can be removed altogether. A 12&#x2033; length first continuity shingle <b>754</b> is then positioned to the side of the second base shingle <b>752</b> to overlay a portion of the second base shingle <b>752</b> such that the bottom continuity trace <b>732</b> overlays and contacts first trace <b>716</b> and second trace <b>718</b> of first base shingle <b>750</b>. This connects the circuit between first trace <b>716</b> and second trace <b>718</b>. A first jumper shingle <b>756</b> is then positioned to the side (opposite the continuity shingle <b>754</b>) of the second base shingle <b>752</b> to overlay a portion of the second base shingle <b>752</b> such that the third jumper trace <b>738</b> overlays and contacts first trace <b>716</b>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, a third base shingle <b>758</b> may then be associated with the second base shingle <b>752</b> in the same fashion that that second base shingle <b>752</b> is associated with the first base shingle <b>750</b>. Although for these purposes, the third base shingle <b>758</b> is shown as being 24&#x2033; in length, the third base shingle <b>758</b> may of any size desired. The third base shingle <b>758</b> is positioned over the second base shingle <b>752</b> such that the third trace <b>720</b> and the fourth trace <b>722</b> of the third base shingle <b>758</b> overlays and contacts the first trace <b>716</b> and second trace <b>718</b> of the second base shingle <b>752</b>, respectively. As before, the fourth trace <b>722</b> of the third base shingle <b>758</b> should be configured to ensure the circuit connection between the first jumper shingle <b>756</b>, the second base shingle <b>752</b> and the first continuity shingle <b>754</b> and to not cause a short of the solar panels on the second base shingle <b>752</b>. A 6&#x2033; length second continuity shingle <b>760</b> is then positioned to the side of the third base shingle <b>758</b> to overlay a portion of the second base shingle <b>758</b> such that the bottom continuity trace <b>732</b> overlays and contacts the first trace <b>716</b> and the second trace <b>718</b> of the second base shingle <b>752</b>.

The second jumper shingle <b>762</b> is sized as desired. Accordingly, all of the solar panels in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> are electrically connected in series such that a potential difference exists between Point A and Point B. This process can be repeated until the roof is shingled. The &#x2018;flow&#x2019; of electricity through the shingles is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> as arrows showing a series circuit connection such that a potential difference (i.e. voltage) exists between point A and point B.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, one embodiment of a method <b>900</b> for implementing the wireless solar shingle system <b>700</b> is illustrated and includes creating a first row of shingles by positioning and anchoring a first base shingle, as shown in operational block <b>902</b>. This is typically a 36&#x2033; shingle, but may be any sized shingle as desired. Depending upon the size of the roof that is being shingled, additional base shingles may be associated with the first base shingle, wherein each of the base shingles may be electrically connected together via continuity shingles and wherein a jumper shingle is used to create a continuous circuit, as shown in operational blocks <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> and <b>908</b>, where the traces are configured to electrically connect the traces on the two shingles (and thus any solar panels if present) in series fashion. This allows the first layer of shingles to be electrically connected to subsequent layers of shingles. The process may then be repeated until the roof is shingled and/or the desired solar panel circuit is achieved, as shown in operational blocks <b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be appreciated that the connection points between traces on adjacent shingles may be weak or subject to environmental conditions. For example, if an overlying shingle <b>770</b> is used to make a connection between traces on two underlying shingles <b>772</b>, <b>774</b> and the overlying shingle <b>770</b> is warped (for example due to environment or age), that connection may not be reliable. Accordingly, one embodiment includes a resilient connection member <b>776</b> in electrical communication with the traces may be used to account for that warping of the overlying shingle <b>770</b>. The resiliency of the connection member <b>776</b> is such that it will ensure the connection between the traces, but will not cause the overlying shingle <b>770</b> to be raised significantly if at all. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Another embodiment includes traces that have a plurality of protrusions <b>780</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, where the plurality of protrusions are sized and space such that when a like trace <b>782</b> is positioned on top of a trace <b>784</b>, the protrusions of one trace securingly and snugly fit into the spaces around the protrusions of the like trace, in a LEGO&#xae; like fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should be appreciated that the base shingles, continuity shingles and jumper shingles of the invention may be configured as desired responsive to the layout of the shingles on a roof. The traces on the base shingles, continuity shingles and jumper shingles may be configured to complete the circuit of the solar panels as desired. It should also be appreciated that the shingles may only include the traces without the solar panels, where the solar panels can be attached at a later time or not at all. Additionally, the solar panels may be integrated with the shingles or they may be associated with the shingles during or after installation of the shingles, where the solar panels may be connected to the shingles via any method suitable to the desired end purpose, such as via a soldered wire connection, adhesive, friction or via a plug-in connection. It should also be appreciated that the solar panels may be raised from the shingle surface to provide airflow over and under the solar panel. This may be accomplished using any method or device suitable to the desired end purpose, such as by using a spacer between the solar panel and the shingle (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>) or by using a flexible solar panel and installing the panel in a bowed fashion (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, it is further contemplated that the solar panel may include a condensation collector having a pocket which is configured to retain water (or other coolant fluid) to help dissipate heat from the solar cell. In one embodiment the condensation collector <b>801</b> may be configured to collect water flowing down a roof over the shingles, where the water remains in the pocket and dissipates heat via contact cooling or radiant cooling.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, in one embodiment the wireless solar shingle system <b>800</b> may be implemented by positioning a base shingle <b>802</b> on the roof <b>1000</b> of a structure, such as in bottom corner of the roof <b>1000</b>, and nailing the base shingle <b>802</b> to the roof <b>1000</b>, as shown. The traces are located at the top and middle portions of the base shingle <b>802</b> (and connecting shingles <b>821</b>) to ensure that the anchoring nails do not contact the traces.
