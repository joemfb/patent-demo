<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to ultrasound probes and more particularly pertains to a new support for ultrasonic probe for providing highly configurable support of a probe.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure describes a new support for ultrasonic probe which may be utilized for providing highly configurable support of a probe that facilitates insertion of the probe in cavities of animals and particularly livestock.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to a support for an ultrasound probe device including a probe housing enclosing an ultrasound transducer and a cord extending from the probe housing to connect the transducer to a signal receiving unit. The support may comprise a handle portion at a first end and providing a hand hold, with the handle portion being elongated with a first longitudinal axis. The support may also comprise a pocket portion at a second end opposite of the handle portion, with the pocket portion being elongated with a second longitudinal axis. The support may also comprise a middle portion positioned between the handle portion and the pocket portion, with the middle portion being flexible to change and retain an angle between the first longitudinal axis and the second longitudinal axis. A cord channel may be formed in the handle portion, the pocket portion and the middle portion to receive a cord of the probe device. A probe pocket may be formed in the pocket portion to receive the probe housing of the probe device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another aspect, the present disclosure relates to an ultrasound system that may include an ultrasound probe device comprising a probe housing enclosing an ultrasound transducer and a cord extending from the probe housing for connecting the transducer to a signal receiving unit. The system may also include a support having the probe device removably mounted thereon. The support may include a handle portion at a first end and providing a hand hold, with the handle portion being elongated with a first longitudinal axis. The support may also comprise a pocket portion at a second end opposite of the handle portion, with the pocket portion being elongated with a second longitudinal axis. The support may also comprise a middle portion positioned between the handle portion and the pocket portion, with the middle portion being flexible to change and retain an angle between the first longitudinal axis and the second longitudinal axis. A cord channel may be formed in the handle portion, the pocket portion and the middle portion to receive a cord of the probe device. A probe pocket may be formed in the pocket portion to receive the probe housing of the probe device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, some of the more important elements of the disclosure in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional elements of the disclosure that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment or implementation in greater detail, it is to be understood that the scope of the disclosure is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The disclosure is capable of other embodiments and implementations and is thus capable of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present disclosure. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The advantages of the various embodiments of the present disclosure, along with the various features of novelty that characterize the disclosure, are disclosed in the following descriptive matter and accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one aspect, the disclosure relates an ultrasound system <b>10</b> that is useful for detecting various conditions in animals such as livestock and horses and other animals. The system may be adapted to be at least partially insertable into the rectum of a cow to detect pregnancy in the cow, although it may be employed for other uses.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The system <b>10</b> may include an ultrasound probe device <b>12</b> that may be utilized to emanate and detect ultrasonic waves. One suitable probe device is available under the tradename Ibex L6.2 transducer (part no. 290406) from E.I. Medical Imaging, 348 North Jefferson, Loveland, Colo. 80537. The probe device <b>12</b> may comprise a probe housing <b>13</b> that encloses an ultrasound transducer <b>14</b> that generates, emanates, and detects or senses the ultrasonic waves. The probe housing <b>13</b> may be relatively elongated along a longitudinal axis, and the transducer may be oriented to radiate the waves in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the housing. The probe device <b>12</b> may also include a cord <b>16</b> that extends from the probe housing <b>13</b> and connects the transducer to a signal receiving unit <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A significant aspect of the system is a support <b>20</b> that may have the probe device <b>12</b> removably mounted thereon, and may be highly suitable for moving the probe device <b>12</b> into a cavity or canal of an animal. In general, the support <b>20</b> may comprise a handle portion <b>22</b>, a pocket portion <b>40</b>, and a middle portion <b>50</b> positioned between the handle and probe portions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In greater detail, the handle portion <b>22</b> is located at a first end <b>24</b> of the support that provides a hand hold for a user of the system. The handle portion <b>22</b> may be elongated with a first longitudinal axis <b>26</b> along the length of the portion <b>22</b>. The handle portion has an exterior surface which has a first end face <b>28</b> positioned on the first end <b>24</b>. The handle portion <b>22</b> may extend between the end face <b>28</b> at the first end and a first intermediate end face <b>30</b>.</p>

The loop <b>38</b> may be pivotally mounted on the central shaft, and may comprise a carabiner loop.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pocket portion <b>40</b> of the support <b>29</b> is located at a second end <b>42</b> of the support and opposite of the handle portion <b>22</b>. The pocket portion <b>40</b> may be elongated with a second longitudinal axis <b>44</b> along the length of the pocket portion. The pocket portion has an exterior surface which has a second end face <b>46</b> positioned on the second end <b>42</b>. The second end face <b>46</b> may be semi-spherical in shape. The pocket portion <b>40</b> extends between the second end face at the second end and a second intermediate end face <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The middle portion <b>50</b> is positioned adjacent to the handle portion <b>22</b> and the pocket portion <b>40</b>. The middle portion may be flexible to change and retain an angle between the first longitudinal axis <b>26</b> and the second longitudinal axis <b>44</b>. The middle portion may be positioned adjacent to the first intermediate end face <b>30</b> of the handle portion and the second intermediate end face <b>48</b> of the pocket portion. The middle portion <b>50</b> may comprise a bendable core <b>52</b> that is capable of being bent by hand-applied force and retaining the bend until the further application of hand-applied force. The bendable core <b>52</b> may comprise a strap, and the strap may comprise a metal that is relatively easily bendable with the application of hand force to the strap. In some embodiments, the metal comprises copper. A first end portion <b>54</b> of the core <b>62</b> may be inserted into a cavity in the handle portion <b>22</b> and a second end portion <b>56</b> of the core may be inserted into a cavity in the pocket portion <b>40</b>. The middle portion may further comprise a flexible sheath <b>58</b> that at least partially covers the core. A first end portion <b>60</b> of the sheath <b>58</b> may extend over a portion of the exterior surface of the handle portion <b>22</b> and a second end portion <b>62</b> of the sheath may extend over a portion of the exterior surface of the pocket portion <b>40</b>. The sheath <b>58</b> may have an exterior surface, which may have a plurality of alternating circumferential grooves <b>64</b> and circumferential ridges <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The support <b>20</b> may comprise a cord channel <b>68</b> that is formed in the handle portion <b>22</b>, the pocket portion <b>40</b> and the middle portion <b>50</b> to removably receive a portion of the cord <b>16</b> of the probe device. In some embodiments, the cord channel <b>68</b> may comprise a pair of opposite side wall surfaces <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and a bottom wall surface <b>74</b> that extends between the side wall surfaces. The side wall surfaces may be oriented substantially parallel to each other, and the bottom wall surface may be substantially semi-cylindrical with portions that transition into the side wall surfaces. A slot may be formed by the intersection of the side wall surfaces with the respective exterior surfaces. The slot may extend along a common side of the respective portions. A plurality of cord retaining protrusions <b>76</b> may extend into the channel <b>68</b> to resist removal of the cord from the channel once the cord has been forced past the protrusions into the base of the channel. The protrusions may protrude from the side wall surfaces into the channel. The plurality of cord retaining protrusions <b>76</b> may comprise pairs of the protrusions extending from the opposite side wall surfaces and are positioned in substantial opposition to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The support <b>20</b> may also comprise a probe pocket <b>78</b> that is formed in the pocket portion <b>40</b> and is configured to receive the probe housing <b>13</b> of the probe device. The pocket <b>78</b> may extend into the pocket portion from the exterior surface. The interior surface forming the probe pocket may be sized and shaped to closely fit about the probe to removably hold the probe housing in the cavity. In the illustrative embodiments, the probe pocket is elongated and rounded at the ends of the pocket. The probe pocket <b>78</b> may be in communication with the cord channel <b>68</b>, and the cord channel may extend from one end of the probe pocket. In some embodiments, the probe pocket extends through the pocket portion to the opposite side of the pocket portion, so that two holes are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">By inclusion of the cord channel <b>68</b> and probe pocket <b>78</b>, the probe device <b>12</b> may be mounted on the support <b>20</b> when the use of the support <b>20</b> is needed for the administration of an ultrasound test on an animal, such as be rectal insertion. The probe housing <b>13</b> may be inserted into the probe pocket, and the cord <b>16</b> may be inserted into the cord channel <b>68</b> along the length of the support so that the cord extends out of the first end <b>24</b> of the handle portion. After administration of the test, the probe device <b>12</b> may be removed from the support <b>20</b> by removing the probe housing from the probe pocket and the cord from the channel. The exterior surface of the portions of the support may be fabricated in a manner that is easily cleaned for repeated usages.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">During administration of the testing, the angle (A) between the first longitudinal axis <b>26</b> of the handle portion <b>22</b> and the second longitudinal axis <b>44</b> of the pocket portion <b>40</b> may be varied to better fit the shape of the canal into which the support <b>20</b> is to be inserted, as the shape of the canal may vary upon the species, size, and age of the animal, as well as other factors, and the user is able to vary the angle to best fit the animal. In many of the most preferred embodiments, the angle between the axes <b>26</b>, <b>44</b> may be varied from approximately 0 degrees to approximately 45 degrees, although greater ranges may be utilized although this preferred range is believed to accommodate most animals. The support may subsequently be straightened out so that the axes of the handle and pocket portions are again parallel and substantially collinear.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The dimensions of the support <b>20</b> may be significant for the proper usage of the system <b>10</b>, such as being large enough to accept an ultrasonic probe device <b>12</b> of the type indentified above and typically used by a veterinarian in treating animals. Thus, in some embodiments the overall length of the support from first end to second end may be suitable to reach the portions of the body of the animal with the probe housing <b>13</b> and transducer <b>14</b> for testing. Further, the support may have a major width dimension, such as a diameter, large enough to form a pocket of a size suitable to receive the probe housing <b>13</b>, as well as strong and durable enough to withstand repeated insertions in a livestock confinement environment in which multiple animals my need to be serially tested. In the illustrative embodiments, the handle portion <b>22</b> have a length that is longer in length then the pocket portion, although this relationship is not critical. Illustratively, on the assembled support <b>20</b>, the length of the handle portion may be approximately 13.5 inches (approximately 34 cm), the middle portion has a length of approximately 10.25 inches (approximately 26 cm), and the pocket portion has a length of approximately 8 inches (approximately 20 cm), although these parts may have different lengths when disassembled from the support.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the disclosed embodiments and implementations, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art in light of the foregoing disclosure, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosed subject matter to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to that fall within the scope of the claims.</p>
