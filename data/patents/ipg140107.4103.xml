<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an image reading device and an image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, with the background of environmental issues, there is an image reading device that employs an LED as a light source.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such an image reading device that employs an LED, for example, there is an image reading device that is configured to dispose a plurality of LEDs in a main scanning direction at a predetermined interval.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the image reading device that requires a plurality of LEDs has been disadvantageous in terms of cost performance in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In contrast, as another image reading device that employs an LED as a light source, there is an image reading device that disposes a high-intensity LED on one end side in a main scanning direction, in which a long stick-like light guiding member composed of acryl or polycarbonate is disposed to extend in the main scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such a case, only a single (or a small number of) LED(s) is required, which brings about advantage in terms of cost performance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in order to uniformly irradiate an original with light in the image reading device, the stick-like light guiding member needs to be positioned with high accuracy, by taking into consideration a positional relationship thereof with a reflecting member that is a related member.</p>

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">As described above, both ends in the main scanning direction Y of the light guiding member <b>340</b> are held to the holding member <b>420</b> by the second holding portion <b>423</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the light guiding member <b>340</b> is positioned and held to the holding member <b>420</b> in a state of being separated from the light reflecting portion <b>421</b>. Only both ends of the light guiding member <b>340</b> are in contact with the holding member <b>420</b>, and an intermediate portion of the light guiding member <b>340</b> is maintained in a state of being separated from the holding member <b>420</b>. Accordingly, even in a case in which the light guiding member <b>340</b> is deformed due to thermal expansion or the like, contact of the light guiding member <b>340</b> with the light reflecting portion <b>421</b> is suppressed. As a result, deformation of the light reflecting portion <b>421</b> due to thermal expansion of the light guiding member <b>340</b> is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In the present embodiment, the LED <b>410</b> is positioned and held to the holding member <b>420</b> by the first holding portion <b>422</b> via the LED substrate <b>430</b>. Moreover, the light guiding member <b>340</b> is positioned and held to the holding member <b>420</b> by the second holding portion <b>423</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In other words, the holding member <b>420</b> positions and holds the LED <b>410</b> and the light guiding member <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In addition, the holding member <b>420</b> is held and positioned to the body frame <b>311</b><i>a </i>(the first frame body <b>311</b>) by the positioning pin <b>511</b> and the positioning protrusion <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">As a result, such a simple configuration provides the image reading device <b>300</b> (the light emitting unit <b>400</b>), in which the LED <b>410</b> and the light guiding member <b>340</b> are positioned with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Next, descriptions are provided for assembly procedures of the light emitting unit <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Firstly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, with the tip end <b>340</b><i>b </i>on the front side, an operator inserts the light guiding member <b>340</b> into the base end hole portion <b>423</b><i>a </i>of the holding member <b>420</b>. More specifically, the operator inserts the tip end <b>340</b><i>b </i>into the base end hole portion <b>423</b><i>a </i>such that the convex portion <b>342</b> is fitted into the guiding groove <b>4231</b>. As a result, the image reading device <b>300</b> (the light emitting unit <b>400</b>) improves the workability in assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Subsequently, the operator further inserts the light guiding member <b>340</b> in a direction of an arrow F. In addition, the operator fits the tip end <b>340</b><i>b </i>of the light guiding member <b>340</b> into the tip end hole portion <b>423</b><i>b</i>, and fits the base end <b>340</b><i>a </i>into the base end hole portion <b>423</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">As a result, the light guiding member <b>340</b> is positioned and held to the holding member <b>420</b>, in a state where the positional relationship with the light reflecting portion <b>421</b> and the orientation of the light irradiating portion <b>341</b> have been adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Subsequently, the operator attaches the LED substrate <b>430</b> to the holding member <b>420</b>. More specifically, the operator attaches the LED substrate <b>430</b> to the holding member <b>420</b> by fitting the positioning holes <b>435</b><i>a </i>and <b>435</b><i>b </i>formed in the LED substrate <b>430</b> on the positioning protrusions <b>422</b><i>a </i>and <b>422</b><i>b </i>(the first holding portion <b>422</b>) formed on the holding member <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As a result, the LED <b>410</b> is positioned and held via the LED substrate <b>430</b>, in a state where the light emitting face faces the end face on the tip end <b>340</b><i>b </i>side of the light guiding member <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Subsequently, the operator attaches the holding member <b>420</b>, which positions and holds the LED <b>410</b> and the light guiding member <b>340</b>, to the body frame <b>311</b><i>a </i>(the first frame body <b>311</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the operator places the holding member <b>420</b> on the outer wall portions <b>3111</b> and <b>3112</b> of the body frame <b>311</b><i>a </i>of the first frame body <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the operator fits the positioning hole <b>426</b>, which is formed on the base end <b>340</b><i>a </i>side of the holding member <b>420</b>, on the positioning pin <b>511</b> of the outer wall portions <b>3111</b>, and fits the notch portion <b>428</b>, which is formed on the tip end <b>340</b><i>b </i>side, on the positioning protrusion <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As a result, the holding member <b>420</b> is positioned and held to the body frame <b>311</b><i>a </i>(the first frame body <b>311</b>) with high accuracy and stability.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the operator disposes the two cover members <b>311</b><i>b </i>and <b>311</b><i>c </i>so as to cover the upper opening of the body frame <b>311</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In this way, the light emitting unit <b>400</b> in the present embodiment is assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">It should be noted that, in the light emitting unit according to the present disclosure, the structure in which the case member positions the holding member is not limited to the structure described in the aforementioned embodiment. For example, in the aforementioned embodiment, the first frame body <b>311</b> as the case member has the outer wall portions <b>3111</b> and <b>3112</b> that extend in the vertical direction, and the holding member <b>420</b> is positioned by engaging the positioning pin <b>511</b> and the positioning protrusion <b>512</b> formed on the outer wall portion <b>3111</b> and <b>3112</b> with the positioning hole <b>426</b> and the positioning notch portion <b>428</b> at the both ends of the holding member <b>420</b>; however, instead of such an engagement structure of the pin and protrusion, a structure such as a plurality of abutting faces may achieve such positioning.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Moreover, the structure for positioning the holding member to the case member may be a fastening structure utilizing screw-fixing.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Furthermore, the holding of the light guiding member by the holding member may be achieved by a structure that holds only one end instead of both ends described in the aforementioned embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Moreover, although the LED <b>410</b> is attached to the holding member <b>420</b> via the LED substrate <b>430</b> in the present embodiment, such attachment is not limited thereto, and the LED <b>410</b> may be directly attached to the holding member <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In addition, the image forming apparatus of the present disclosure is not particularly limited, and can be a copy machine, a printer, a facsimile machine, or a multi-functional printer having functions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The sheet-shaped transferred material is not limited to paper, and may be a film sheet, for example.</p>
