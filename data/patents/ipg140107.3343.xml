<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to semiconductor devices having integrated circuits, i.e., semiconductor elements, mounted on substrates and, in particular, to a method for supplying electric power to a semiconductor device applicable to a driving circuit of a thin-shaped image display device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, thin-shaped image display devices have been practically used which are constituted by using thin-shaped image display panels such as liquid crystal display panels, plasma image display panel, EL (electroluminescent) image display panels, etc. as image display elements.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">These image display devices contain electric circuits in which heat is generated for example from integrated circuits including output-stage transistors, semiconductors, resistors, and transformers. That is, heat is generated intensively from electronic components with great electric power of electrothermal conversion. Along with high definition or ultra-high definition, a recent image display device has risen in drive frequency at which display signals are supplied to a large number of pixels of the panel. For this reason, in particular, there has been an unignorably large increase in self-heating of an integrated circuit driving the source lines of a display device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique for, in order to reduce the chip size of an integrated circuit, wiring a power supply without drawing inner power wires to power pads surrounding a chip. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a schematic view of the layout of a liquid crystal driver (source driver). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing the arrangement of output cells and power wires in the liquid crystal driver, which is an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The liquid crystal driver has a large number of output cells <b>101</b> arranged for driving source lines of liquid crystals. Further, each of the output cells <b>101</b> has, as its components, a latch circuit <b>102</b>, a level shifter <b>103</b>, a DAC circuit <b>104</b>, an operational amplifier <b>105</b>, and a pad <b>106</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The latch circuit <b>102</b> retains data in accordance with which a display is carried out. The level shifter <b>103</b> shifts the latched data to a liquid crystal driving power supply level. The DAC circuit <b>104</b> outputs a drive voltage corresponding to the data. The operational amplifier <b>105</b> makes an impedance conversion of the voltage outputted from the DAC circuit <b>104</b> and outputs the voltage. The pad <b>106</b> connects the integrated circuit, i.e., the liquid crystal driver, to wires of a package. Each of the output cells <b>101</b> has its components linearly arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the components of each of the output cells <b>101</b> need to be supplied with electric power, the integrated circuit has power pads <b>108</b> disposed therearound. In the case of such disposition of the power pads <b>108</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is necessary to lead wires from the output cells <b>101</b> to the power pads <b>108</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, two power pads <b>108</b> are provided to which the operational amplifiers <b>105</b> are connected through a wire <b>109</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the DAC circuits <b>104</b> are connected to the power pads <b>108</b> through a wire <b>109</b><i>b</i>, and the level shifters <b>103</b> are connected to the power pads <b>108</b> through a wire <b>109</b><i>c</i>. A power supply for the latch circuits <b>102</b> is separate from the power pads <b>108</b>, and as such, is not described here. In this way, each type of component is supplied with electric power through a separate wire. Such wiring prevents noise attributed to the operation of one type of component from affecting another type of component.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the shape of a film package in which a liquid crystal driver has been mounted. The liquid crystal driver shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a liquid crystal driver <b>113</b> mounted on a film package substrate <b>110</b>. The film package has an output terminal <b>111</b> formed in such a way as to extend along one long side of the film package substrate <b>110</b>, and has an input terminal <b>112</b> formed in such a way as to extend along the other long side of the film package substrate <b>110</b>. The input terminal <b>112</b> includes package power terminals connected to the power pads <b>108</b> of the liquid crystal driver <b>113</b> through wires <b>114</b>, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> omits to illustrate other input and output wires.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The lead wires <b>109</b><i>a </i>to <b>109</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> need to be low in resistance, and as such, need to be great in line width. In particular, the wire <b>109</b><i>a </i>for the operational amplifier section generates big switching noise because it is necessary to charge and discharge capacitive loads such as the pixels of a liquid crystal panel through the wire <b>109</b><i>a</i>. For this reason, it is necessary to connect the operational amplifier section to the power supply through a low-resistance power wire.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram of bypassing of a power wire using the technique of Patent Literature 1. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a bypass wire <b>201</b> provided on a tape substrate and a power supply line <b>109</b><i>a </i>for the operational amplifiers are connected to each other through bumps <b>202</b> disposed on the power supply line <b>109</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the state of a film package in which a liquid crystal driver has been mounted. The film package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> has a bypass wire <b>201</b> added as a wire on the film package substrate <b>110</b> in addition to the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The bypass wire <b>201</b> has bumps <b>202</b> provided for use in the power wire for the operational amplifiers. The bypass wire <b>201</b> is connected to the same power input terminals of the input terminal <b>112</b> as the power wires <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The foregoing configuration can reduce the resistance of the wires to the power supply from the power pads to the operational amplifier section of the output cells, and as such, can quickly absorb switching noise.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Since, as mentioned above, recent improvements in integrity of integrated circuits have invited a decrease in chip size and an increase in the number of outputs in liquid crystal drivers, too, the generation of heat from drivers per se has become an issue. Such heat generation occurs when an electric current passed through a power wire by operating a driver is discharged in the form of heat due to the resistance of the power wire. Such an operating current is large at the time of switching of a transistor. For this reason, completion of the switching is delayed unless the power supply is stable, with the result that a more electric current flows and leads to the generation of heat from the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The configuration of Patent Literature 1 is intended to reduce the number of wires of a semiconductor element and hence reduce the size and weight of a semiconductor device by forming a bypass wire on a film substrate instead of conventionally leading a power wire in the semiconductor element. Further, the bypass wire allows a larger reduction in resistance than a wire formed in the semiconductor element, whereby the power supply is more stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, according to the configuration of Patent Literature 1, it has been believed that a reduction in switching noise and hence suppression of heat generation are achieved through stabilization of the power supply. However, such stabilization of the power supply is not sufficient to reduce the generation of heat from an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device having an integrated circuit (semiconductor element) mounted on a substrate, wherein the generation of heat in the integrated circuit is suppressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to solve the foregoing problems, the present invention is directed to a semiconductor device having a semiconductor element mounted on a substrate, the semiconductor element including: a plurality of output cells having plural types of component; and a plurality of power wires through which electric power is supplied to the types of component of all of the output cells, respectively, the substrate including a bypass wire, the bypass wire being connected to at least one of the power wires and having connection terminals for each separate one of those components of substantially all of the output cells which are connected to the at least one of the power wires.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Since, according to the foregoing configuration, the bypass wire is formed on the substrate on which the semiconductor element is mounted, the bypass wire allows a larger reduction in resistance than the power wires formed in the semiconductor element. Moreover, since the bypass wire having connection terminals for each separate one of those components of all of the output cells which are connected to the at least one of the power wires, an electric current that flows when the components of the output cells operate is mostly supplied from the power supply through the bypass wire. This makes it possible to effectively suppress the generation of heat in power wires formed in conventional semiconductor elements. Further, the bypass wire allows efficient heat dissipation because it is greater in width and larger in surface area than the wires on the semiconductor element.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An embodiment of the present invention is described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>. The present invention is not to be limited to the description of the embodiment below. Further, conditions for each step for use in the present embodiment and the like are the same as those for the usual step of mounting a semiconductor device, and as such, are not described in detail below unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic view of the layout of a liquid crystal driver (which is a source driver here) according to the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing the arrangement of output cells and power wires in the liquid crystal driver, which is an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The liquid crystal driver has a large number of output cells <b>101</b> arranged for driving source lines of liquid crystals. Further, each of the output cells <b>101</b> has, as its components, a latch circuit <b>102</b>, a level shifter <b>103</b>, a DAC circuit <b>104</b>, an operational amplifier <b>105</b>, and a pad <b>106</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Since the components of each of the output cells <b>101</b> need to be supplied with electric power, the integrated circuit has power pads <b>108</b> disposed therearound, and wires are led from the output cells <b>101</b> to the power pads <b>108</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two power pads <b>108</b> are provided to which the operational amplifiers <b>105</b> are connected through a wire <b>109</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the DAC circuits <b>104</b> are connected to the power pads <b>108</b> through a wire <b>109</b><i>b</i>, and the level shifters <b>103</b> are connected to the power pads <b>108</b> through a wire <b>109</b><i>c</i>. A power supply for the latch circuits <b>102</b> is separate from the power pads <b>108</b>, and as such, is not described here. In this way, each type of component is supplied with electric power through a separate wire. The wires <b>109</b><i>a </i>to <b>109</b><i>c </i>are wires formed in the integrated circuit, which is a liquid crystal driver, i.e., in a semiconductor element. These components are the same as those of the conventional liquid crystal driver shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the shape of a film package in which a liquid crystal driver has been mounted. The liquid crystal driver shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a liquid crystal driver <b>113</b> mounted on a film package substrate <b>110</b>. The film package has an output terminal <b>111</b> formed in such a way as to extend along one long side of the film package substrate <b>110</b>, and has an input terminal <b>112</b> formed in such a way as to extend along the other long side of the film package substrate <b>110</b>. The input terminal <b>112</b> includes package power terminals connected to the power pads <b>108</b> of the liquid crystal driver <b>113</b> through wires <b>114</b>, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> omits to illustrate other input and output wires.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, the film package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has its bypass wire <b>201</b> added as a wire on the film package substrate <b>110</b>, and the bypass wire <b>201</b> has bumps <b>203</b> through which the bypass wire <b>201</b> formed on the film package substrate <b>110</b> and the wires <b>109</b> formed in the liquid crystal driver <b>113</b> are electrically connected. An example of the bypass wire <b>201</b> here is one provided to the power wire <b>109</b><i>a </i>for the operational amplifiers <b>105</b>. The bypass wire <b>201</b> is connected to the same power input terminals of the input terminal <b>112</b> as the power wires <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the configuration of the present embodiment, the bumps <b>203</b> are provided for each separate one of all of the output cells. That is, in a case where the liquid crystal driver <b>113</b> has n output cells, there are provided n bumps <b>203</b>, too. In other words, the bypass wire <b>201</b> has bumps <b>203</b> for each separate one of the operational amplifiers <b>105</b> of all of the output cells, and is connected to the power wire <b>109</b><i>a</i>. This allows the power supply of each output buffer to be connected to the bypass wire <b>201</b>. However, in the present invention, the bypass wire does not necessarily need to be connected to each separate one of the components of all of the output cells. There may be some output cells that do not have bumps (that is, the bypass wire may be connected to each separate one of the components of substantially all of the output cells).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram taking into account the wiring resistance of the power wires in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. An electric current I that flows when operational amplifiers <b>102</b> operate is mostly supplied from the power supply through the bypass wire <b>201</b>. This is because the bypass wire <b>201</b> formed on the package is lower in resistance than the wire <b>109</b><i>a </i>formed in the liquid crystal driver <b>113</b>, which is a semiconductor element. As a specific example, the bypass wire <b>201</b> can be configured to have a resistance value smaller than 1/10 the resistance value of the wire <b>109</b><i>a </i>so that less heat is generated in the bypass wire <b>201</b>. Further, the bypass wire <b>201</b> allows efficient heat dissipation because it is greater in width and larger in surface area than the wires on the integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although, in the present embodiment, the measures against heat by the bypass wire are taken only for the power wire for the operational amplifiers, such measures can be taken for all of the power wires on the liquid crystal driver. However, this makes it necessary, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to form bumps in substantially all of the output cells, and such formation of bumps causes some increase in chip size. For this reason, such measures should be taken especially for a power wire through which a large current flows during switching. In the case of a liquid crystal driver, such measures are effectively taken for buffer circuits of output operational amplifiers. Further, in the case of an operational amplifier, such measures can be taken only for a power wire for an output buffer of the last stage.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a typical rail-to-rail operational amplifier. It should be noted that the operational amplifier in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a well-known component that is commonly used in a liquid crystal driver, and as such, is not described in detail as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Since, in the case of a liquid crystal driver, the output cells are elongated as described above, the circuitry of each operational amplifier is often constituted by two transistors that are large in transistor size, namely a transistor Q<b>1</b> and a transistor Q<b>2</b>. In this case, the operational amplifier has its power supply VDD divided into a power supply VDD<b>2</b> connected to the transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> of the output stage and a power supply VDD<b>1</b> connected to the other members. In the case of such division, the measures against heat by the bypass wire is effectively taken for the power supply VDD<b>2</b>, which drives the loads of a liquid crystal panel.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, examples of results of measurements of devices in which measures were taken against heat as described in the present embodiment are shown below in Table 1. It should be noted that in the results below, Devices A and B are devices (comparative examples) in which such measures were not taken against heat, and Device C is a device in which such measures were taken against heat. Further, assuming the chip size of Device A is 100, the ratio of chip size of Device B to Device A is 53 and the ratio of chip size of Device C to Device A is 46. The measurement results were obtained by causing the liquid crystal drivers to carry out such driving that a display pattern most likely to cause heat generation was displayed and by finding saturation temperatures reached when no measures were taken to dissipate heat.</p>
