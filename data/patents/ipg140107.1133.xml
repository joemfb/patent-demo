<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This patent specification relates to systems and methods for the monitoring and control of energy-consuming systems or other resource-consuming systems. More particularly, this patent specification relates to control units that govern the operation of energy-consuming systems, household devices, or other resource-consuming systems, including methods for activating electronic displays for thermostats that govern the operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While substantial effort and attention continues toward the development of newer and more sustainable energy supplies, the conservation of energy by increased energy efficiency remains crucial to the world's energy future. According to an October 2010 report from the U.S. Department of Energy, heating and cooling account for 56% of the energy use in a typical U.S. home, making it the largest energy expense for most homes. Along with improvements in the physical plant associated with home heating and cooling (e.g., improved insulation, higher efficiency furnaces), substantial increases in energy efficiency can be achieved by better control and regulation of home heating and cooling equipment. By activating heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment for judiciously selected time intervals and carefully chosen operating levels, substantial energy can be saved while at the same time keeping the living space suitably comfortable for its occupants.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Programmable thermostats have become more prevalent in recent years in view of Energy Star (US) and TCO (Europe) standards, and which have progressed considerably in the number of different settings for an HVAC system that can be individually manipulated. Some programmable thermostats have standard default programs built in. Additionally, users are able to adjust the manufacturer defaults to optimize their own energy usage. Ideally, a schedule is used that accurately reflects the usual behavior of the occupants in terms of sleeping, waking and periods of non-occupancy. Due to difficulty in programming many thermostats, however, may schedules do not accurately reflect the usual behavior of the occupants. For example, the schedule may not account for some usual periods of non-occupancy. Additionally, even when a suitable schedule is programmed into the thermostat, inevitably there are departures from usual behavior. The user can manually set back the thermostat when leaving the house and then resume the schedule upon returning, but many users never or very seldom perform these tasks. Thus an opportunity for energy and cost savings exist if a thermostat can automatically set back the setpoint temperature during time of non-occupancy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0019051 A1 discusses overriding of nonoccupancy status in a thermostat device based upon analysis or recent patterns of occupancy. The publication discusses a &#x201c;safety time,&#x201d; for example during the nighttime hours in a hotel or motel room, during which requirements to maintain a condition of occupancy are relaxed based on pattern recognition analysis. A &#x201c;hysteresis&#x201d; period of typically less than a few minutes can be built into the motion sensor to establish occupancy for some period after any motion is detected or signaled. An increased hysteresis period can be used during safety times such as during the evening and night hours. The focus is mainly on reliably detecting when occupants return from an absence.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Important issues arise, however, at the interface between (i) energy-saving technologies that might be achievable using known sensing and processing methods, and (ii) the actual widespread user adoption of devices that implement such energy-saving technologies and the integration of those devices into their daily routines and environment. It has been found especially important that the &#x201c;first contact&#x201d; between a user and an energy-saving device, and the first couple of days/weeks of the user experience with that energy-saving device, constitute a particularly easy, enjoyable, and pleasant experience, or else the user can quickly &#x201c;turn off&#x201d; or &#x201c;tune out&#x201d; to the device and its energy-saving advantages, such as by de-activating the advanced features (for example, setting their thermostat to a &#x201c;temporary&#x201d; manual-override mode on a permanent basis) or even taking it back to the seller and replacing it with their old device or a &#x201c;less complicated&#x201d; device. More bluntly stated, the roadways of green technology are littered with the skulls of devices and systems that promised to save energy but that no homeowners wanted to use. One or more issues arises in the context of providing an intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected, energy-saving device for adoption into the home in an easy, pleasant, and user-friendly manner that is at least partially addressed by one or more of the embodiments described further hereinbelow. Other issues arise as would be apparent to a person skilled in the art in view of the present teachings.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, a thermostat may be presented. The thermostat may include a housing and a processing system disposed within the housing. The processing may be coupled to a user interface and configured to be in operative communication with one or more temperature sensors for determining an ambient air temperature. The processing system may also be in operative communication with one or more input devices, including the user interface, for determining a setpoint temperature value. The processing system may be in still further operative communication with a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to control the HVAC system based at least in part on a comparison of a measured ambient temperature and the setpoint temperature value.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The thermostat may also include at least one occupancy sensor in operative communication with the processing system. The thermostat may include an away-state feature in which the thermostat enters into an away-state mode of operation upon a determination by the processing system based on readings acquired by the at least one occupancy sensor that an away-state criterion indicative of a non-occupancy condition for an enclosure in which the thermostat has been installed has been satisfied, where the away-state mode of operation can include an automated setpoint temperature setback mode.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the processing system can be further configured to automatically determine, without requiring user input, whether to activate the away-state feature for the enclosure in which the thermostat has been installed. This may include receiving readings from the at least one occupancy sensor during a trial period; comparing information derived from the trial period readings to a threshold criterion to establish whether sufficiently true indications of occupancy conditions were sensed by the at least one occupancy sensor during the trial period; and enabling the away-state feature of the thermostat only if it is determined that the sufficiently true indications of occupancy conditions were sensed during the trial period.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, a method of qualifying a thermostat to activate an away-state feature may be presented. The method may include receiving readings from at least one occupancy sensor during a trial period, where the at least one occupancy sensor can be in operative communication with a processing system. In one embodiment, the processing system is disposed within a thermostat housing and coupled to a user interface, the processing system being configured to be in operative communication with one or more temperature sensors for determining an ambient air temperature, in operative communication with one or more input devices including the user interface for determining a setpoint temperature value, and in still further operative communication with a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to control the HVAC system based at least in part on a comparison of a measured ambient temperature and the setpoint temperature value.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method may also include comparing information derived from the trial period readings to threshold criterion to establish whether sufficiently true indications of occupancy conditions were sensed by the at least one occupancy sensor during the trial period. The method may additionally include determining automatically, without requiring user input, whether to activate the away-state feature for an enclosure in which the thermostat has been installed. In one embodiment, the away-state feature causes the thermostat to enter into an away-state mode of operation upon a determination by the processing system based on the readings acquired by the at least one occupancy sensor that an away-state criterion indicative of a non-occupancy condition for the enclosure in which the thermostat has been installed has been satisfied, where the away-state mode of operation may include an automated setpoint temperature setback mode. The method may further include enabling the away-state feature of the thermostat only if it is determined that the sufficiently true indications of occupancy conditions were sensed during the trial period.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another embodiment, another thermostat may be presented. The thermostat may include a housing and an occupancy sensor that is disposed within the housing and configured to detect physical presences of users within a responsive area of the occupancy sensor. The thermostat may also include a processing system that is disposed within the housing and in operative communication with the occupancy sensor, the processing system being configured to determine after a trial period whether to activate an away-state feature. This determination may include storing indications of how often the occupancy sensor detected physical presences of users during the trial period; computing an occupancy level for the trial period based on the stored indications; comparing the occupancy level to a threshold criterion; determining whether sufficiently true indications of occupancy conditions were sensed by the occupancy sensor during the trial period based on the comparison; and enabling the away-state feature of the thermostat only if it is determined that the sufficiently true indications of occupancy conditions were sensed during the trial period.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the drawings. Also note that other embodiments may be described in the following disclosure and claims.</p>

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Exemplary Thermostat Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Provided according to one or more embodiments are systems, methods, and computer program products for controlling one or more HVAC systems based on one or more versatile sensing and control units (VSCU units), each VSCU unit being configured and adapted to provide sophisticated, customized, energy-saving HVAC control functionality while at the same time being visually appealing, non-intimidating, and easy to use. A VSCU may also be referred to herein simply as a &#x201c;control unit.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;thermostat&#x201d; is used herein below to represent a particular type of control unit that is particularly applicable for HVAC control in an enclosure. Although &#x201c;thermostat&#x201d; and &#x201c;control unit&#x201d; may be seen as generally interchangeable for the contexts of HVAC control of an enclosure, it is within the scope of the present teachings for each of the embodiments herein to be applied to control units having control functionality over measurable characteristics other than temperature (e.g., pressure, flow rate, height, position, velocity, acceleration, capacity, power, loudness, brightness) for any of a variety of different control systems involving the governance of one or more measurable characteristics of one or more physical systems, and/or the governance of other energy or resource consuming systems such as water usage systems, air usage systems, systems involving the usage of other natural resources, and systems involving the usage of various other forms of energy.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> and the descriptions in relation thereto provide exemplary embodiments of thermostat hardware and/or software that can be used to implement the specific embodiments of the appended claims. This thermostat hardware and/or software is not meant to be limiting, and is presented to provide an enabling disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a thermostat <b>100</b>, according to one embodiment. In this specific embodiment, the thermostat <b>100</b> can be controlled by at least two types of user input, the first being a rotation of the outer ring <b>112</b>, and the second being an inward push on an outer cap <b>108</b> until an audible and/or tactile &#x201c;click&#x201d; occurs. As used herein, these two types of user inputs, may be referred to as &#x201c;manipulating&#x201d; the thermostat. In other embodiments, manipulating the thermostat may also include pressing keys on a keypad, voice recognition commands, and/or any other type of input that can be used to change or adjust settings on the thermostat <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For this embodiment, the outer cap <b>108</b> can comprise an assembly that includes the outer ring <b>112</b>, a cover <b>114</b>, an electronic display <b>116</b>, and a metallic portion <b>124</b>. Each of these elements, or the combination of these elements, may be referred to as a &#x201c;housing&#x201d; for the thermostat <b>100</b>. Simultaneously, each of these elements, or the combination of these elements, may also form a user interface. The user interface may specifically include the electronic display <b>116</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the user interface <b>116</b> may be said to operate in an active display mode. The active display mode may include providing a backlight for the electronic display <b>116</b>. In other embodiments, the active display mode may increase the intensity and/or light output of the electronic display <b>116</b> such that a user can easily see displayed settings of the thermostat <b>100</b>, such as a current temperature, a setpoint temperature, an HVAC function, and/or the like. The active display mode may be contrasted with an inactive display mode (not shown). The inactive display mode can disable a backlight, reduce the amount of information displayed, lessen the intensity of the display, and/or altogether turn off the electronic display <b>116</b>, depending on the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Depending on the settings of the thermostat <b>100</b>, the active display mode and the inactive display mode of the electronic display <b>116</b> may also or instead be characterized by the relative power usage of each mode. In one embodiment, the active display mode may generally require substantially more electrical power than the inactive display mode. In some embodiments, different operating modes of the electronic display <b>116</b> may instead be characterized completely by their power usage. In these embodiments, the different operating modes of the electronic display <b>116</b> may be referred to as a first mode and a second mode, where the user interface requires more power when operating in the first mode than when operating in the second mode.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to some embodiments the electronic display <b>116</b> may comprise a dot-matrix layout (individually addressable) such that arbitrary shapes can be generated, rather than being a segmented layout. According to some embodiments, a combination of dot-matrix layout and segmented layout is employed. According to some embodiments, electronic display <b>116</b> may be a backlit color liquid crystal display (LCD). An example of information displayed on the electronic display <b>116</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and includes central numerals <b>120</b> that are representative of a current setpoint temperature. According to some embodiments, metallic portion <b>124</b> can have a number of slot-like openings so as to facilitate the use of a sensors <b>130</b>, such as a passive infrared motion sensor (PIR), mounted beneath the slot-like openings.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to some embodiments, the thermostat <b>100</b> can include additional components, such as a processing system <b>160</b>, display driver <b>164</b>, and a wireless communications system <b>166</b>. The processing system <b>160</b> can adapted or configured to cause the display driver <b>164</b> to cause the electronic display <b>116</b> to display information to the user. The processing system <b>160</b> can also be configured to receive user input via the rotatable ring <b>112</b>. These additional components, including the processing system <b>160</b>, can be enclosed within the housing, as displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. These additional components are described in further detail herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The processing system <b>160</b>, according to some embodiments, is capable of carrying out the governance of the thermostat's operation. For example, processing system <b>160</b> can be further programmed and/or configured to maintain and update a thermodynamic model for the enclosure in which the HVAC system is installed. According to some embodiments, the wireless communications system <b>166</b> can be used to communicate with devices such as personal computers, remote servers, handheld devices, smart phones, and/or other thermostats or HVAC system components. These communications can be peer-to-peer communications, communications through one or more servers located on a private network, or and/or communications through a cloud-based service.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Motion sensing as well as other techniques can be use used in the detection and/or prediction of occupancy, as is described further in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 12/881,430, supra. According to some embodiments, occupancy information can be a used in generating an effective and efficient scheduled program. For example, an active proximity sensor <b>170</b>A can be provided to detect an approaching user by infrared light reflection, and an ambient light sensor <b>170</b>B can be provided to sense visible light. The proximity sensor <b>170</b>A can be used in conjunction with a plurality of other sensors to detect proximity in the range of about one meter so that the thermostat <b>100</b> can initiate &#x201c;waking up&#x201d; when the user is approaching the thermostat and prior to the user touching the thermostat. Such use of proximity sensing is useful for enhancing the user experience by being &#x201c;ready&#x201d; for interaction as soon as, or very soon after the user is ready to interact with the thermostat. Further, the wake-up-on-proximity functionality also allows for energy savings within the thermostat by &#x201c;sleeping&#x201d; when no user interaction is taking place or about to take place. The various types of sensors that may be used, as well as the operation of the &#x201c;wake up&#x201d; function are described in much greater detail throughout the remainder of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the thermostat can be physically and/or functionally divided into at least two different units. Throughout this disclosure, these two units can be referred to as a head unit and a backplate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view <b>200</b> of a thermostat <b>208</b> having a head unit <b>210</b> and a backplate <b>212</b>, according to one embodiment. Physically, this arrangement may be advantageous during an installation process. In this embodiment, the backplate <b>212</b> can first be attached to a wall, and the HVAC wires can be attached to a plurality of HVAC connectors on the backplate <b>212</b>. Next, the head unit <b>210</b> can be connected to the backplate <b>212</b> in order to complete the installation of the thermostat <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view <b>300</b><i>a </i>of a head unit <b>330</b> with respect to its primary components, according to one embodiment. Here, the head unit <b>330</b> may include an electronic display <b>360</b>. According to this embodiment, the electronic display <b>360</b> may comprise an LCD module. Furthermore, the head unit <b>330</b> may include a mounting assembly <b>350</b> used to secure the primary components in a completely assembled head unit <b>330</b>. The head unit <b>330</b> may further include a circuit board <b>340</b> that can be used to integrate various electronic components described further below. In this particular embodiment, the circuit board <b>340</b> of the head unit <b>330</b> can include a manipulation sensor <b>342</b> to detect user manipulations of the thermostat. In embodiments using a rotatable ring, the manipulation sensor <b>342</b> may comprise an optical finger navigation module as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. A rechargeable battery <b>344</b> may also be included in the assembly of the head unit <b>330</b>. In one preferred embodiment, rechargeable battery <b>344</b> can be a Lithium-Ion battery, which may have a nominal voltage of 3.7 volts and a nominal capacity of 560 mAh.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view <b>300</b><i>b </i>of a backplate <b>332</b> with respect to its primary components, according to one embodiment. The backplate <b>332</b> may include a frame <b>310</b> that can be used to mount, protect, or house a backplate circuit board <b>320</b>. The backplate circuit board <b>320</b> may be used to mount electronic components, including one or more processing functions, and/or one or more HVAC wire connectors <b>322</b>. The one or more HVAC wire connectors <b>322</b> may include integrated wire insertion sensing circuitry configured to determine whether or not a wire is mechanically and/or electrically connected to each of the one or more HVAC wire connectors <b>322</b>. In this particular embodiment, two relatively large capacitors <b>324</b> are a part of power stealing circuitry that can be mounted to the backplate circuit board <b>320</b>. The power stealing circuitry is discussed further herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition to physical divisions within the thermostat that simplify installation process, the thermostat may also be divided functionally between the head unit and the backplate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a simplified functional block diagram <b>400</b><i>a </i>for a head unit, according to one embodiment. The functions embodied by block diagram <b>400</b><i>a </i>are largely self-explanatory, and may be implemented using one or more processing functions. As used herein, the term &#x201c;processing function&#x201d; may refer to any combination of hardware and/or software. For example, a processing function may include a microprocessor, a microcontroller, distributed processors, a lookup table, digital logic, logical/arithmetic functions implemented in analog circuitry, and/or the like. A processing function may also be referred to as a processing system, a processing circuit, or simply a circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this embodiment, a processing function on the head unit may be implemented by an ARM processor. The head unit processing function may interface with the electronic display <b>402</b>, an audio system <b>404</b>, and a manipulation sensor <b>406</b> as a part of a user interface <b>408</b>. The head unit processing function may also facilitate wireless communications <b>410</b> by interfacing with various wireless modules, such as a Wi-Fi module <b>412</b> and/or a ZigBee module <b>414</b>. Furthermore, the head unit processing function may be configured to control the core thermostat operations <b>416</b>, such as operating the HVAC system. The head unit processing function may further be configured to determine or sense occupancy <b>418</b> of a physical location, and to determine building characteristics <b>420</b> that can be used to determine time-to-temperature characteristics. Using the occupancy sensing <b>418</b>, the processing function on the head unit may also be configured to learn and manage operational schedules <b>422</b>, such as diurnal heat and cooling schedules. A power management module <b>462</b> may be used to interface with a corresponding power management module on the back plate, the rechargeable battery, and a power control circuit <b>464</b> on the back plate.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additionally, the head unit processing function may include and/or be communicatively coupled to one or more memories. The one or more memories may include one or more sets of instructions that cause the processing function to operate as described above. The one or more memories may also include a sensor history and global state objects <b>424</b>. The one or more memories may be integrated with the processing function, such as a flash memory or RAM memory available on many commercial microprocessors. The head unit processing function may also be configured to interface with a cloud management system <b>426</b>, and may also operate to conserve energy wherever appropriate <b>428</b>. An interface <b>432</b> to a backplate processing function <b>430</b> may also be included, and may be implemented using a hardware connector.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates a simplified functional block diagram for a backplate, according to one embodiment. Using an interface <b>436</b> that is matched to the interface <b>432</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the backplate processing function can communicate with the head unit processing function <b>438</b>. The backplate processing function can include wire insertion sensing <b>440</b> that is coupled to external circuitry <b>442</b> configured to provide signals based on different wire connection states. The backplate processing function may be configured to manage the HVAC switch actuation <b>444</b> by driving power FET circuitry <b>446</b> to control the HVAC system.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The backplate processing function may also include a sensor polling interface <b>448</b> to interface with a plurality of sensors. In this particular embodiment, the plurality of sensors may include a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a PIR sensor, a proximity sensor, an ambient light sensor, and or other sensors not specifically listed. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. Other types of sensors may be used depending on the particular embodiment and application, such as sound sensors, flame sensors, smoke detectors, and/or the like. The sensor polling interface <b>448</b> may be communicatively coupled to a sensor reading memory <b>450</b>. The sensor reading memory <b>450</b> can store sensor readings and may be located internally or externally to a microcontroller or microprocessor.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Finally, the backplate processing function can include a power management unit <b>460</b> that is used to control various digital and/or analog components integrated with the backplate and used to manage the power system of the thermostat. Although one having skill in the art will recognize many different implementations of a power management system, the power management system of this particular embodiment can include a bootstrap regulator <b>462</b>, a power stealing circuit <b>464</b>, a buck converter <b>466</b>, and/or a battery controller <b>468</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a simplified circuit diagram <b>500</b> of a system for managing the power consumed by a thermostat, according to one embodiment. The powering circuitry <b>510</b> comprises a full-wave bridge rectifier <b>520</b>, a storage and waveform-smoothing bridge output capacitor <b>522</b> (which can be, for example, on the order of 30 microfarads), a buck regulator circuit <b>524</b>, a power-and-battery (PAB) regulation circuit <b>528</b>, and a rechargeable lithium-ion battery <b>530</b>. In conjunction with other control circuitry including backplate power management circuitry <b>527</b>, head unit power management circuitry <b>529</b>, and the microcontroller <b>508</b>, the powering circuitry <b>510</b> can be configured and adapted to have the characteristics and functionality described herein below. Description of further details of the powering circuitry <b>510</b> and associated components can be found elsewhere in the instant disclosure and/or in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13/034,678, supra, and U.S. Ser. No. 13/267,871, supra.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">By virtue of the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when there is a &#x201c;C&#x201d; wire presented upon installation, the powering circuitry <b>510</b> operates as a relatively high-powered, rechargeable-battery-assisted AC-to-DC converting power supply. When there is not a &#x201c;C&#x201d; wire presented, the powering circuitry <b>510</b> operates as a power-stealing, rechargeable-battery-assisted AC-to-DC converting power supply. The powering circuitry <b>510</b> generally serves to provide the voltage Vcc MAIN that is used by the various electrical components of the thermostat, which in one embodiment can be about 4.0 volts. For the case in which the &#x201c;C&#x201d; wire is present, there is no need to worry about accidentally tripping (as there is in inactive power stealing) or untripping (for active power stealing) an HVAC call relay, and therefore relatively large amounts of power can be assumed to be available. Generally, the power supplied by the &#x201c;C&#x201d; wire will be greater than the instantaneous power required at any time by the remaining circuits in the thermostat.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">However, a &#x201c;C&#x201d; wire will typically only be present in about 20% of homes. Therefore, the powering circuitry <b>510</b> may also be configured to &#x201c;steal&#x201d; power from one of the other HVAC wires in the absence of a &#x201c;C&#x201d; wire. As used herein, &#x201c;inactive power stealing&#x201d; refers to the power stealing that is performed during periods in which there is no active call in place based on the lead from which power is being stolen. Thus, for cases where it is the &#x201c;Y&#x201d; lead from which power is stolen, &#x201c;inactive power stealing&#x201d; refers to the power stealing that is performed when there is no active cooling call in place. As used herein, &#x201c;active power stealing&#x201d; refers to the power stealing that is performed during periods in which there is an active call in place based on the lead from which power is being stolen. Thus, for cases where it is the &#x201c;Y&#x201d; lead from which power is stolen, &#x201c;active power stealing&#x201d; refers to the power stealing that is performed when there is an active cooling call in place. During inactive or active power stealing, power can be stolen from a selected one of the available call relay wires. While a complete description of the power stealing circuitry <b>510</b> can be found in the commonly assigned applications that have been previously incorporated herein by reference, the following brief explanation is sufficient for purposes of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Some components in the thermostat, such as the head unit processing function, the user interface, and/or the electronic display may consume more instantaneous power than can be provided by power stealing alone. When these more power-hungry components are actively operating, the power supplied by power stealing can be supplemented with the rechargeable battery <b>530</b>. In other words, when the thermostat is engaged in operations, such as when the electronic display is in an active display mode, power may be supplied by both power stealing and the rechargeable battery <b>530</b>. In order to preserve the power stored in the rechargeable battery <b>530</b>, and to give the rechargeable battery <b>530</b> an opportunity to recharge, some embodiments optimize the amount of time that the head unit processing function and the electronic display are operating in an active mode. In other words, it may be advantageous in some embodiments to keep the head unit processing function in a sleep mode or low power mode and to keep the electronic display in an inactive display mode as long as possible without affecting the user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the head unit processing function and the electronic display are in an inactive or sleep mode, the power consumed by the thermostat is generally less than the power provided by power stealing. Therefore, the power that is not consumed by the thermostat can be used to recharge the rechargeable battery <b>530</b>. In this embodiment, the backplate processing function <b>508</b> (MSP430) can be configured to monitor the environmental sensors in a low-power mode, and then wake the head unit processing function <b>532</b> (AM3703) when needed to control the HVAC system, etc. Similarly, the backplate processing function <b>508</b> can be used to monitor sensors used to detect the closeness of a user, and wake the head unit processing system <b>532</b> and/or the electronic display when it is determined that a user intends to interface with the thermostat.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It will be understood by one having skill in the art that the various thermostat embodiments depicted and described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> are merely exemplary and not meant to be limiting. Many other hardware and/or software configurations may be used to implement a thermostat and the various functions described herein below. These embodiments should be seen as an exemplary platform in which the following embodiments can be implemented to provide an enabling disclosure. Of course, the following methods, systems, and/or software program products could also be implemented using different types of thermostats, different hardware, and/or different software.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Enabling an Away-State Feature</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In modern network-enabled homes, many different types of devices can be used to control various aspects of the homes environment, including air temperature, humidity, fan speed, music, television, appliances, and/or the like. Many embodiments of the present invention enable these devices to be configured to operate in one mode when the home is occupied and to operate in a second mode when the home is unoccupied. For example, when the home is occupied, devices can be configured to activate user interfaces, maintain certain levels of temperature and/or humidity, provide predetermined volume levels, and detect user movements for recording and determining user profiles. On the other hand, when the home is unoccupied, devices can be configured to turn off user interfaces, conserve power by altering normal levels of temperature and humidity, turn off appliances, and otherwise reduce the power usage of the home when no one is there.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Users may find it inconvenient to manually program devices according to their home and away schedules. Users may also simply forget to change settings on control devices in their homes before they leave, causing the control devices to operate in the user's absence as though they were home. Alternatively, users may simply forget to change settings on control devices when they arrive home, causing uncomfortable living conditions and general dissatisfaction with the control devices. Therefore, embodiments described herein provide methods and systems designed to enable an away-state feature that automatically changes the operating mode of a control device when it is determined that an enclosure in which the control device is installed is no longer occupied.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Some embodiments may use occupancy sensors associated with a control device to determine whether an enclosure is occupied or not. As used herein, the term &#x201c;occupancy sensor&#x201d; may include any sensor configured to determine whether an enclosure is physically occupied. In one embodiment, an occupancy sensor may include a Passive Infrared sensor (PIR). In another embodiment, an occupancy sensor may include a sensor configured to emit electromagnetic radiation and to receive reflections of electromagnetic radiation. In yet another embodiment, an occupancy sensor may include a near-range PIR. Other examples of occupancy sensors may include microphones, CCD cameras, magnetic switches, microwave systems, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An enclosure occupancy state can be continuously and automatically sensed using the occupancy sensors, the currently sensed state being classified as occupied (or &#x201c;home&#x201d; or &#x201c;activity sensed&#x201d;) or unoccupied (or &#x201c;away&#x201d; or &#x201c;inactive&#x201d;). If the currently sensed occupancy state has been &#x201c;inactive&#x201d; for a predetermined minimum interval, termed herein an away-state confidence window (ASCW), then an away-state mode of operation can be triggered in which an actual operating setpoint is changed to a predetermined energy-saving away-state value, regardless of a setpoint value indicated by the normal control settings and/or schedule. The purpose of the away-state mode of operation is to avoid unnecessarily using energy when there are no occupants present to actually experience or enjoy the comfort of the enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the specific control device comprises a thermostat, the away-state value may comprise a temperature, and may be set, by way of example, to a default predetermined value of 62 degrees for winter periods (or outside temperatures that would call for heating) and 84 degrees for summer periods (or outside temperatures that would call for cooling). Specific details of the away-state feature can also be found in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/627,996 filed Oct. 21, 2011 that was previously incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The away-state confidence window (ASCW) corresponds to a time interval of sensed non-occupancy after which a reasonably reliable operating assumption can be made, with a reasonable degree of statistical accuracy, that there are indeed no occupants in the enclosure. According to one embodiment, it has been found that a predetermined period in the range of 90-180 minutes can be a suitable period for the ASCW to accommodate for common situations such as quiet book reading, working in the yard, short naps, etc. in which there is no sensed movement or related indication for the occupancy sensors to detect.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The effectiveness of the away-state feature may in part depend upon how reliably the control unit can determine whether or not the enclosure is occupied. In one sense, this reliability may depend in part on the reliability of the occupancy sensors to detect a physical presence within a responsive area of the occupancy sensors. In another sense, this reliability may also depend in part on where the control unit has been placed in the enclosure, as well as the living patterns of the inhabitants. For example, a control unit may be placed in an area of an enclosure where is not easy for the occupancy sensors to detect whether someone is in the home or not, such as in a closet, a rarely-used hallway, a basement, or even in a high-traffic location that is obscured by other household objects. Of course, it is difficult for the control unit itself to determine whether it is located in one of these non-ideal areas of an enclosure. It may also be difficult rely on deliberate user inputs (i.e. user-entered location information) to make this determination, as users may enter this data incorrectly if at all.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, in order to efficiently and correctly use an away-state feature, a control unit may make a determination as to a level of &#x201c;sensor confidence&#x201d; before it relies on the occupancy sensors to enable the away-state feature. Specifically, some embodiments herein may not enable the away-state feature upon installation. Instead, these embodiments may evaluate sensor responses during a trial period in order to establish a level of sensor confidence. If the level of sensor confidence is sufficient, and exceeds a predetermined threshold, the away-state feature can be enabled. Otherwise, to avoid creating an uncomfortable environment within an occupied enclosure, the away-state feature can remain disabled until such a level of sensor confidence is established.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to one embodiment, sensor confidence can be established by monitoring the readings from one or more occupancy sensors, and determining whether they have detected a threshold level of occupancy events. Simply, if the occupancy sensors detect a physical presence within their responsive areas during a large portion of the operating time, it can be assumed that the control unit is disposed at a location within the enclosure that can reliably detect whether the enclosure is occupied or not. In this case, a high level of sensor confidence can be assumed, such that the occupancy sensors can be relied upon to determine when the away-state feature should be activated. On the other hand, if the occupancy sensors only detect a physical presence within their responsive areas during a relatively small portion of the operating time, it can be assumed that the control unit is disposed at a location within the enclosure that cannot reliably detect whether the enclosure is occupied or not. In this case, only a low level of sensor confidence can be assumed, and thus the occupancy sensors may not necessarily be relied upon to determine when the away-state feature should be activated. In one embodiment, the away-state feature will not be enabled unless a requisite level of sensor confidence is established.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As various methods and systems for determining whether the away-state features can be enabled, it will be understood that the ensuing discussion can apply to any control unit as described above. However, throughout the remainder of this disclosure a specific type of implementation will be used, namely a thermostat. It will be understood that the principles described using thermostat hardware and software can be easily applied to other control units by one having skill in the art in light of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Specific to a thermostat, the away-state feature can be used to determine when a home is unoccupied, and in response, to activate an automated setpoint temperature setback mode where a predetermined setpoint temperature is set on the thermostat. For example, for an unoccupied home in the summertime, the setpoint temperature may be higher than the setpoint temperature would otherwise be in an occupied home. Likewise, for an unoccupied home in the wintertime, the setpoint temperature may be lower than the setpoint temperature would otherwise be in an occupied home. It will be understood that various permutations of these conditions may apply depending on the climate and user preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Provided according to one preferred embodiment is a self-qualification algorithm by which the thermostat determines whether it can, or cannot, reliably go into an away-state mode to save energy, i.e., whether it has &#x201c;sensor confidence&#x201d; for its occupancy sensor measurements. For one preferred embodiment, the away-state feature is disabled for a predetermined period such as 7 days after device startup (i.e., initial installation or factory reset). On the days following startup within the predetermined time period (or another empirically predetermined suitable sample time period), the occupancy sensor activity can be tracked by discrete sequential &#x201c;time buckets&#x201d; of activity, such as 5-minute buckets, where a bucket is either empty (if no occupancy event is sensed in that interval) or full (if one or more occupancy events is sensed in that interval). Out of the total number of buckets for that time period, if there is greater than a predetermined threshold percentage of buckets that are full, then &#x201c;sensor confidence&#x201d; is established, and if there is less than that percentage of full buckets, then there is no sensor confidence established. The predetermined threshold can be empirically determined for a particular model, version, or setting of the thermostat. In one example, it has been found that 3.5% is a suitable threshold, i.e., if there are 30 or more full buckets for the three-day sample, then &#x201c;sensor confidence&#x201d; is established, although this will vary for different devices, models, and settings.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates an overhead view <b>600</b><i>a </i>of an area monitored by a thermostat <b>602</b>, according to one embodiment. The area monitored by the thermostat <b>602</b> may comprise a room within a building, a hallway, an open living area, and/or the like. The temperature sensors of thermostat <b>602</b> may be configured to detect the ambient temperature of the area being monitored. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, various sensors of the thermostat <b>602</b> may have different responsive areas. For example, an occupancy sensor may include a responsive area <b>604</b> denoted by the set of dashed lines. As used herein, the term &#x201c;responsive area&#x201d; may include an area in which a phenomenon that a sensor is configured to detect will generate a response by the sensor. For example, a motion detector associated with responsive area <b>604</b> could detect motion within the responsive area <b>604</b> of an object meeting the specifications of the motion detector. It should be noted that some objects may not meet the specifications of the motion detector, such as stationary objects, objects that do not emit a sufficient level of infrared radiation, or smaller objects such as pets.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Merely generating a response from a sensor may not be sufficient to infer that a physical presence is detected. The actual response generated by a sensor when an event occurs within its associated responsive area will in many cases be dependent on the intensity of the event or the distance of the event from the thermostat. For example, if an event occurs along the periphery of the associated responsive area, the response of the sensor may be small. However, if an event occurs closer to the thermostat, the response of the sensor may be larger. Therefore, some embodiments may determine a threshold for a sensor response in order to qualify as a physical presence.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Generally, a threshold can correspond to a voltage/current output, a digital readout, the frequency, or other similar electrical output of a sensor. The threshold may correspond to a certain distance, such as distance <b>608</b> for an event having a known intensity. For example, a user approaching the thermostat <b>602</b> with a PIR sensor associated with responsive area <b>604</b> could trip a threshold when coming within distance <b>608</b> of the thermostat <b>602</b>. Larger persons or persons moving rapidly may trip the threshold nearer or farther than distance <b>608</b> at the same threshold. It should be noted, that in one embodiment, no threshold need be used, and any activity registered by the occupancy sensor may be sufficient to infer a physical presence.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The overhead view <b>600</b><i>a </i>illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows an example of a thermostat <b>602</b> that is installed in a location where a high level of sensor confidence may be established. This may correspond to a living room, a kitchen, or a busy hallway. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates an overhead view <b>600</b><i>b </i>of another area monitored by thermostat. In this embodiment, the thermostat <b>602</b> is installed in a location that may not see enough user traffic to establish a high level of user confidence. The responsive area <b>604</b> of the occupancy sensor may be targeted in a direction that will not capture the physical presence of occupants of the home very often. Additionally, obstacles, such as a plant <b>610</b> may it secure the view of the thermostat <b>602</b>. Finally, the thermostat <b>602</b> may be installed in an enclosure inside the home, such as a closet or nook. Any or all of these factors may reduce the level of sensor confidence such that the away-state feature should not be enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In order to determine whether the thermostat <b>602</b> is installed in a high-confidence location such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, various evaluation methods may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a state diagram <b>700</b> for determining whether sufficient sensor confidence can be established for enabling and away-state feature, according to one embodiment. Here, a trial period can be used to train the thermostat. During the trial period, occupancy sensor readings may be recorded and evaluated. At the end of the trial period, the occupancy sensor readings can be analyzed to determine whether a threshold criterion has been met, and if so, the away-state feature can be enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The operations in state diagram <b>700</b> begin when the thermostat is installed, reset, or otherwise caused to default to a set of factory settings. At this point, the thermostat may enter into a training state <b>702</b>. The thermostat may stay in the training state <b>702</b> throughout the trial period. While in the training state <b>702</b>, the thermostat may record any and all measurements provided by one or more occupancy sensors. In one embodiment, the occupancy sensor measurements can be time stamped and/or recorded based on a portion of the trial period in which they occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">At the end of the trial period, the thermostat may enter an evaluation state <b>704</b> where it can be determined whether a threshold criterion has been met. In one embodiment, the thermostat can use the comparison to the threshold criterion to establish whether sufficiently true indications of occupancy conditions were sensed by the occupancy sensors during the trial period. In other words, the thermostat can analyze all of the occupancy sensor responses that were recorded during the trial period, and can then determine whether there were enough occupancy sensor responses to characterize the responses as true indications of occupancy. In one embodiment, too few occupancy sensor responses may indicate that the thermostat is not truly sensing the occupancy of the enclosure because it may be assumed that if placed in a better location the thermostat would receive more occupancy sensor responses. On the other hand, sufficient occupancy sensor responses may be characterized as a true indication that the thermostat can correctly determine the occupancy of the enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">If the threshold criterion is met, then the thermostat can move into an enabled state <b>706</b> where the away-state feature is enabled. Afterwards, when the thermostat detects that the enclosure is no longer occupied, the thermostat may enter into and away-state mode of operation <b>708</b>. This determination may be made by a processing system based on readings acquired by the occupancy sensors, and the away-state mode of operation may include an automated setback temperature setback mode. In one embodiment, the away-state feature may be enabled throughout the remaining service period of the thermostat, or until it is installed in a new location, reset, or loses power.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In another embodiment (not shown) certain conditions may exist wherein the thermostat can disable the away-state feature. For example, after the away-state feature is enabled, the thermostat can return to the training state <b>702</b> if long periods of non-occupancy are detected. After the trial period ends again, the thermostat could again determine whether the threshold criterion is met and whether the away-state feature should be disabled or continue to be enabled. In some embodiments, the training period may be re-entered and repeated in perpetuity throughout the life of the thermostat.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one embodiment, the trial period may be repeated only a few times after installation. In some cases, users may interact with thermostat more than usual in the weeks following installation in order to make sure that it is working properly, or to fine tune the user-adjustable features. Therefore, occupancy sensor readings during the weeks immediately following installation may not be truly indicative of the real level of sensor confidence throughout the lifetime of the thermostat. In order to solve this problem, the trial period may be repeated one or more times after installation. For example, the trial period may be repeated one, two, three, four, five or, six times, and so forth, depending upon the embodiment in particular installation characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Returning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if while in the evaluation state <b>704</b> and the thermostat determines that the threshold criterion is not met or satisfied, then the thermostat may return to the training state <b>702</b> and repeat the trial period. In one embodiment, the trial period can be repeated by clearing a memory storing the occupancy sensor readings and starting over. In another embodiment, the trial period may be considered a sliding window, wherein the oldest sensor readings may be removed and replaced by newer sensor readings as they are obtained. For example, an entire day's worth of the oldest sensor readings could be removed and replaced by the current day's sensor readings. The length of the trial period may also be adjusted in this embodiment such that one week's worth of sensor measurements are evaluated at the end of each day after a least one week of sensor measurements are obtained. Of course, the trial period lasting one week is merely exemplary, and the trial period may also last one day, ten days, one month, two weeks, and so forth. If at the end of any successful trial period the threshold criterion is determined to be met, the thermostat can transition into the enabled state <b>706</b> and the away-state feature may be enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a graph <b>800</b> of various sensors responses during a trial period, according to one embodiment. First, graph <b>800</b> illustrates how a trial period may be divided into a plurality of time windows, or &#x201c;time buckets.&#x201d; Instead of storing an indication every time an occupancy sensor detects a physical presence, a single indication of whether a physical presence was detected can be stored for each time window. This may simplify calculations, reduce the amount of memory required, and/or make it easier to correlate sensor measurements with other events. For example, the timeline in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates at least a portion of a trial period. This portion of the trial period can be divided up into various time windows, such as windows <b>824</b>, <b>826</b>, <b>828</b>, and <b>830</b>. In one embodiment, each of the time windows is approximately 5 minutes long. In other embodiments, each of the time windows can be between 3 and 7 minutes, approximately 10 minutes, 1 minute, and so forth. In some embodiments each of the time windows may have a uniform length, while in other embodiments each of the time windows may have different lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also illustrates a number of sensor responses. Response <b>806</b> may correspond to an occupancy sensor, such as a PIR sensor or an active proximity sensor. Response <b>806</b> illustrates a number of distinct response types that correspond to whether or not a physical presence is detected within the sensor's responsive area. Section <b>817</b> of response <b>806</b> illustrates a response characteristic of a physical presence detected within the responsive area of the occupancy sensor. Similarly, section <b>822</b> illustrates another response characteristic of a physical presence having a somewhat longer duration than the response of section <b>817</b>. Section <b>816</b> of response <b>806</b> illustrates a response characteristic of an occupancy sensor that does not detect a physical presence within its responsive area.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Occupancy sensor responses indicative of a physical presence may be confined to a single time window or may span several time windows. Generally, a threshold may be used, such as threshold <b>834</b> to determine whether a sensor response is sufficient to indicate a physical presence. In one embodiment, any time window recording a sensor response that satisfies the threshold may be recorded in the time window during which occupancy was sensed. In this particular example, section <b>817</b> would record an occupancy response during time window <b>824</b>. Section <b>822</b>, however, would record an occupancy response during both time window <b>828</b> and time window <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Other sensor types may be used to determine whether a detected physical response should be used to qualify the thermostat for enabling the away-state feature. In one embodiment, it may be desirable to only record a physical presence when a user does not interact with the thermostat. The operating theory in this embodiment is that even if the thermostat is placed in a location that is unsuitable to establish sufficient sensor confidence, a number of physical presence events may still be detected when users interact with the thermostat. Some embodiments of the thermostat discussed above may include so-called &#x201c;learning thermostats&#x201d; that learn user behaviors such that actual interactions or minimized after an initial period of acclamation. Therefore, occupancy may need to be detected during conditions where users rarely interact with the thermostat. If the trial period for determining whether the away-state feature can be enabled takes place shortly after installation, many of the physical presence events sensed by the occupancy sensors may correspond to interactions with the thermostat before it learns user behavior, and thus may not be truly indicative of the level of sensor confidence needed to correctly determine occupancy.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">To solve this problem, one embodiment may use various interaction sensors to determine when a user interacts with the thermostat. The responses of these interaction sensors can be correlated with the responses of the occupancy sensors in order to eliminate the occupancy sensor responses that coincide with interactions. Interaction sensors may include near-range PIR sensors, near-range active proximity sensors, sound sensors, light sensors, and/or the like. In a preferred embodiment, an interaction sensor includes sensors configured to detect a physical manipulation of a user interface of the thermostat. These sensors may be referred to herein as &#x201c;manipulation sensors.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, response <b>802</b> may represent the output of a manipulation sensor, such as an optical sensor coupled to a rotatable ring disposed around an outer perimeter of the thermostat housing. The optical sensor may provide an output whenever a rotation of the outer ring takes place, or when the user otherwise manipulates the user interface. As shown, response <b>802</b> includes section <b>820</b> representing a physical manipulation of the thermostat. Note that section <b>820</b> of response <b>802</b> coincides with section <b>822</b> of response <b>806</b> from the occupancy sensor. Therefore, section <b>822</b> of response <b>806</b> can be excluded by some embodiments from the readings recorded during the trial period. In contrast, there is no corresponding manipulation event for section <b>817</b> of response <b>806</b>, and thus time window <b>820</b> may record a record physical presence event.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some cases, manipulation events may not precisely coincide with physical presence events as detected by these two types of sensors. In one embodiment, whenever a manipulation event is detected, physical presence events may be disregarded that occurred within the same time window. In another embodiment, physical presence events may be disregarded that occurred within one, two, or three time windows of the manipulation event.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">At the conclusion of the trial period, the recorded sensor responses can be analyzed. In one embodiment, the sensor response for each time window may be stored within a data structure. Generating a metric characterizing the occupancy during the time period may comprise determining the percentage of time windows during which at least one physical presence was detected compared to the number of time windows during which no physical presence was detected. From this, a percentage of occupancy may be obtained. This metric may be referred to as an &#x201c;occupancy level&#x201d; and may represent the percentage of time windows during which physical presences were detected.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Other more sophisticated means of computing an occupancy level may also be used. In some embodiments, it may be useful to store metrics that differentiate between weekends and weekdays. Some embodiments may also store metrics that represents physical presence events detected during the same time window during each day.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a graph <b>900</b> depicting one method of storing occupancy sensor measurements, according to one embodiment. For convenience, response <b>902</b>, response <b>906</b>, as well as sections <b>916</b>, <b>920</b>, and <b>922</b> are similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Response <b>908</b> can represent how the various responses are stored in a data structure within a memory. In this particular embodiment, time windows <b>924</b>, <b>926</b>, <b>928</b>, and <b>930</b> may represent time windows that occur daily. For example, time window <b>924</b> may represent 9:00 AM through 9:05 AM during each weekday. When a physical presence event is detected by the occupancy sensor, such as section <b>916</b> of response <b>906</b>, the value stored in the memory location for time window <b>924</b> can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this particular example, the value stored in the memory location for each time window represents the percentage of days during the time period that a physical presence event was detected during the time window. As shown by response <b>908</b>, the value <b>910</b> stored for time window <b>924</b> can represent 100% if response <b>906</b> occurs in the first day of the trial period. Notice also that values <b>912</b> and <b>914</b> represent 0% because section <b>922</b> of response <b>906</b> corresponds with a manipulation event.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a graph <b>1000</b> depicting storage of occupancy sensor measurements during the trial period, according to one embodiment. Trace <b>1002</b> represents the value stored for each time window during the previous days of the trial period. In this example, a physical presence event occurred during time window <b>1026</b> during every previous day during the trial period. Similarly, a physical presence event occurred during time window <b>1030</b> during a proximally 50% of the previous days during the trial period. Trace <b>1004</b> represents sensor responses during a current day of the trial period. In this example, a physical presence event was detected during time windows <b>1014</b>, <b>1016</b>, and <b>1018</b>. Note that other physical presence events may have occurred during other time windows, such as time window <b>1032</b>; however these physical presence events may have been excluded because of other sensor responses, such as responses from manipulation sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Trace <b>1006</b> represents the value stored for each time window after the current day's physical presence events have been recorded. In other words, trace <b>1006</b> is the result of applying trace <b>1004</b> to trace <b>1002</b>. In this example, because a physical presence event <b>1014</b> was detected on the current day, the value stored for time window <b>1026</b> remains at 100%. Similarly, physical presence event <b>1016</b> was detected on the current day, and thus the value stored for time window <b>1028</b> changes from 0% to 33%. It can be inferred from this calculation that the values represented by trace <b>1002</b> represent the cumulative effects of two previous days. Therefore value <b>1022</b> of 33% represents two previous days without physical presence events combined with the physical presence event of the current day. Likewise, physical presence event <b>1018</b> can be added to the 50% value previously stored for time window <b>1030</b> to generate a new value of 66%. Time window <b>1032</b> does not show a physical presence event on the current day or on any previous days. Therefore, the value for time window <b>1032</b> remains at 0%.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to this example, each time window may represent a bucket of time that reoccurs throughout the trial period. Although 24 hours has been used as the reoccurrence period, it will be clear in light of this disclosure that any other period could also be used. Some embodiments may store measurements according to every hour, or according to every 12 hour cycle. Other embodiments may store measurements that repeat weekly.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As discussed previously, if the trial period ends and it is determined that the threshold criterion is not met, the thermostat may again enter the training mode and begin a new trial period. When a new trial period begins, the memory locations for each time window may be reset to zero. In another embodiment, the values currently stored in the memory locations for each time window may be retained, and the percentage may continue to be adjusted over the new trial period. Other embodiments may discount the value of previously stored in the memory locations such that it is weighed less than new values acquired during the new trial period.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In embodiments where the value stored for each time window represents sensor measurements obtained during time intervals that repeat daily, it may be advantageous to treat the values for weekdays differently than weekends. It has been observed that user patterns of occupancy tend to follow a first pattern during weekdays and a second pattern during weekends when the homes are traditionally more occupied.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a representation of occupancy levels for each day in one week, according to one embodiment. Here, occupancy levels <b>1106</b>, <b>1108</b>, <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b>, <b>1116</b>, and <b>1118</b> have been generated for each day by combining the occupancy levels for each time window occurring for that day. This may be done by simply adding the time intervals during a day in which a physical presence was detected and comparing it to the number of time intervals during the day in which no physical presence was detected.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In order to generate a single occupancy level statistic, the occupancy levels for each day can be combined. In one embodiment, a total weekday occupancy level <b>1102</b> can be generated by combining the occupancy levels from each weekday. Similarly, a total weekend occupancy level <b>1104</b> can be generated by combining the occupancy levels from Saturday and Sunday. The weekday occupancy level <b>1102</b> can be combined with the weekend occupancy level <b>1104</b> by combining the two statistics proportionally. In one embodiment, the weekday occupancy level <b>1102</b> can be multiplied by 5/7 and the weekend occupancy level <b>1104</b> can be multiplied by 2/7 and added together to generate a final occupancy level.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the embodiment illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> where the time windows repeat daily, this process can be simplified. For example, a single data structure may be used for a single set of time windows during weekdays, and a single data structure may be used for a single set of time windows during weekends. These the weekday time windows can be combined to generate a weekday occupancy level, and the weekend time windows can be combined to generate a weekend occupancy level. The weekend occupancy level can be combined with the weekday occupancy level as described above to generate a final occupancy level.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In other embodiments (not shown) different time windows can be combined using different weights. In one embodiment, a morning occupancy level can be generated and combined with an evening occupancy level. In another embodiment, a mealtime occupancy level can be generated and combined with a non-mealtime occupancy level. These different time windows can be combined using different weights. For example, a mealtime occupancy level may be weighted more heavily than a non-mealtime occupancy level when combined. It will be understood in light of this disclosure that many other types of combinations and repeating sequences of time windows may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a flowchart <b>1200</b> of a method for determining whether an away-state feature should be enabled, according to one embodiment. The method may include installing or resetting the thermostat (<b>1201</b>). A reset may be manually initiated by a user, or may be remotely instructed by a control server. The method may also include recording sensor readings (<b>1202</b>). In one embodiment, the sensor readings may be from occupancy sensor(s) that are disposed within the housing of the thermostat and configured to detect physical presences of users within a responsive area of the occupancy sensor(s). The occupancy sensor may be in operative communication with a processing system. In one embodiment, the occupancy sensor(s) may comprise a PIR sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A processing system may be disposed within the housing and coupled to a user interface. The processing system may be configured to be in operative communication with one or more temperature sensors for determining an ambient air temperature, and in operative communication with one or more input devices including the user interface for determining a setpoint temperature value, and in still further operative communication with a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to control the HVAC system based at least in part on a comparison of a measured ambient temperature and the setpoint temperature value.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The sensor readings may be acquired during a trial period. In one embodiment, the trial period begins upon installation and/or reset of the thermostat. The trial period may be in any interval of time, including between five and eight days, as well as one week. The acquired sensor readings may, in one embodiment, be stored according to a plurality of time windows. The trial period may be divided into the plurality of time windows, wherein each of the readings from the occupancy sensors are stored in a corresponding one of the plurality of time windows during which the reading occurs. In one embodiment, sensor readings may be excluded that also correspond with manipulation or an inferred intent to interact with or view the thermostat.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The method may also include determining the end of the trial period (<b>1204</b>). At the end of the trial period, an occupancy level may be computed for the trial period based on the stored sensor readings, or the stored indications of how often the occupancy sensor(s) detected physical presences of users during the trial period. In one embodiment, stored indications that correspond to a weekday can be treated differently when computing the occupancy level than a subset of the stored indications that corresponds to a weekend.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In one embodiment, the processing system may comprise a head unit processor and a backplate processor as described above. The backplate processor may receive, store, and manage the occupancy sensor(s) readings. In one embodiment, the readings may be sent to the head unit processor at the end of the trial period in order to generate an occupancy level and to determine whether the occupancy level satisfies the threshold criterion. In another embodiment, the backplate processor may perform all of these functions without waking the head unit processor.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The method may additionally include determining whether a threshold criterion is satisfied (<b>1206</b>). In the away-state feature, the thermostat enters into an away-state mode of operation upon a determination by the processing system based upon readings acquired by the occupancy sensor(s) that an away-stay criterion indicative of a non-occupancy condition for an enclosure in which the thermostat has been installed has been satisfied. The away-mode of operation may include an automated setpoint temperature setback mode.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In one embodiment, the threshold criterion may be designed to establish whether the thermostat is placed in a location in the enclosure where occupancy information is readily sensed by the occupancy sensor(s) of the thermostat. In one embodiment, the threshold criterion represents an occupancy level of between approximately 0.02 and 0.10. In another embodiment, the threshold criterion represents an occupancy level of approximately 0.035.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Determining whether the threshold criterion is satisfied may include comparing the occupancy level for the trial period to the threshold criterion. In another embodiment, this determination may comprise comparing information derived from the trial period readings to the threshold criterion to establish whether sufficiently true indications of occupancy conditions were sensed by the occupancy sensor(s) during the trial period.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The method may further include enabling the away-state feature of the thermostat if it is determined that the sufficiently true indications of occupancy conditions were sensed during the trial period (<b>1208</b>). In one embodiment, the processing system can be further configured to determine whether to activate the away-state feature after a second trial period. The second trial period may be instituted in response to a failure to satisfy the threshold criterion. In other words, the second trial period may be instituted after a determination that the sufficiently true indications of occupancy conditions were not sensed during the first trial period. If is determined that the away-state feature should not be enabled, then method may again begin recording new occupancy sensor readings during a new trial period (<b>1210</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">It will be understood that details disclosed in other sections of this disclosure may also be incorporated into the method described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. For example, the trial period may be divided into repeating time windows and stored in memory locations that are later combined according to various methods disclosed herein to compute an occupancy level. Other similar features may be incorporated into the method above.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">It should be appreciated that the specific steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> provide particular methods of determining whether an away-state feature should be enabled according to various embodiments of the present invention. Other sequences of steps may also be performed according to alternative embodiments. For example, alternative embodiments of the present invention may perform the steps outlined above in a different order. Moreover, the individual steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> may include multiple sub-steps that may be performed in various sequences as appropriate to the individual step. Furthermore, additional steps may be added or removed depending on the particular applications. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Thus, provided according to one or more of the embodiments is a device (which in some particularly advantageous embodiments is a thermostat), its related user interfaces, and related methods and systems that facilitate a user-friendly, enjoyable, pleasant experience during the crucial &#x201c;first contact&#x201d; period and equally crucial first couple of days and/or weeks thereafter in that (a) the user is not bothered with the need to decide whether to allow (activate) or to not allow (not activate) the automatic away-state functionality when they are setting up the device, while at the same time (b) the device will not trigger into the automatic away-state unless it determines itself to be &#x201c;qualified&#x201d; to make that decision, thereby avoiding (or substantially lessening the likelihood) of a case in which the device triggers into the auto-away state (e.g., turning down the setpoint temperature during wintertime) while the user is actually still occupying the premises. Whereas many alterations and modifications of the present invention will no doubt become apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art after having read the foregoing description, it is to be understood that the particular embodiments shown and described by way of illustration are in no way intended to be considered limiting.</p>
