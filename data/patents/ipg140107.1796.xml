<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention claim priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/255,132, filed on Oct. 27, 2009. The disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety in this application.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an implantable port. In particular, the present invention relates to an implantable port that includes a pivotably coupled stem.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vascular access devices such as subcutaneous implantable ports are often implanted in a patient to provide access to a major vein for a period of months or years so that blood can be repeatedly drawn or so that medication and nutrients can be injected into the patient's bloodstream on a regular basis. Subcutaneous implantable ports, which are also sometimes referred to as subcutaneous access ports, may be used for giving chemotherapy, providing blood transfusions, taking blood samples, delivering intravenous (IV) fluids, providing IV medicines, and the like. Known ports have an attached catheter which is typically a soft tube that is implanted into a patient's blood vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">After providing a local anesthetic or some other numbing medicine, at least two incisions are made. The distal end of the catheter of the known subcutaneous implantable port is inserted through a peel-apart vascular sheath and guided to desirable location of the vasculature. The proximal end of the catheter is tunneled under the skin between the two incisions. The subcutaneous implantable port is attached to the proximal end of the catheter by a locking collar and placed in a space created under the skin often referred to as a subcutaneous port pocket. The implantable port with the catheter properly connected can be sutured in the subcutaneous port pocket.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, during removal of the peel-apart sheath or during final positioning of the port within the subcutaneous pocket with the catheter attached, the catheter can become kinked. The peel-apart sheath usage exposes the patient to the risks of bleeding and air embolism.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is a need in the art for an implantable port that avoids, at least, the risks associated with kinking of the catheter and using the peel-apart sheath.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, one aspect of the invention may provide an implantable port. The implantable port includes a body with a reservoir in the body, a tunnel extending from the reservoir to an outer surface of the body, a pivoting coupling connected to the body near the tunnel on the outer surface, and a stem connected to the pivoting coupling.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following specification. Accordingly, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that changes or modifications may be made to the below described embodiments without departing from the broad inventive concepts of the invention. It should therefore be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein, but is intended to include all changes and modifications that are within the scope and spirit of the invention. The words &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; and &#x201c;distal&#x201d; refer to directions away from and closer to the insertion tip, respectively, of a catheter of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, the present invention provides an implantable port <b>100</b> that includes a pivotably coupled stem <b>102</b>. The stem <b>102</b> is pivotably coupled at one end to a body <b>104</b> of the port <b>100</b>, and at the opposite end, the stem <b>102</b> is adapted to be mated to a catheter (not shown). The stem <b>102</b> can be selectively placed in a first position wherein the stem <b>102</b> is not coupled to the body <b>104</b> of the port <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> or in a second position wherein the stem <b>102</b> is coupled to the body <b>104</b> of the port <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In the first position, a guide wire can be inserted into the stem <b>102</b> to unkink a catheter mated to the stem <b>102</b>. Also, the port <b>100</b> can avoid the use of a sheath by placing over a guide wire. Thus, the port <b>100</b> avoids, at least, the risks associated with kinking of the catheter and the vascular sheath.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The body <b>104</b> can have one or more hollows within the body <b>104</b>. At least one of the hollows provides a reservoir <b>106</b> to receive fluid, such as IV fluids, IV medicines, blood, or some other such fluid. The implantable port <b>100</b> can also have a septum <b>108</b> (not shown) that extends from an outer surface of the body <b>104</b> to the reservoir <b>106</b>. The septum <b>108</b> allows an appropriate needle, such as a Huber needle, to access the reservoir <b>106</b>, thus the septum <b>108</b> can be self-scaling after the needle is removed and can be punctured repeatedly before substantially weakening. The body <b>104</b> may have a tunnel <b>110</b> that provides a pathway between the reservoir <b>106</b> and an outer surface of the body <b>104</b>. The tunnel <b>110</b> may be flush with a surface of the body <b>104</b> or may protrude away from the body <b>104</b>, as shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, the body <b>104</b> has a generally cylindrical-like shape with a single reservoir <b>106</b>. However, the body <b>104</b> can have any suitable shape including, but not limited to, substantially spherical, conical, ovoidal, combinations of the aforementioned, or some other shape that provides at least one hollow within the body <b>104</b>. Also, the single body <b>104</b> or the single reservoir <b>106</b> shown is not meant to be limiting to the invention. In other embodiments, more than one reservoir <b>106</b> can be disposed in the body <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, the implantable port <b>100</b> can have more than one body <b>104</b>, and more than one reservoir can be disposed in each of the bodies. The exact number of bodies <b>104</b> and reservoirs <b>106</b> is determined by, for example, the purpose of the implantable port <b>100</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the tunnel <b>110</b> has a substantially circular cross-section, but in other embodiments, the tunnel <b>110</b> can have any other suitable cross-sectional shape, such as elliptical, triangular, square, trapezoidal, polygonal, combinations of the aforementioned, or some other suitable shape.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The body <b>104</b> can be made from plastic such as biocompatible, medical grade polymers such as polysulfone, metal such as titanium, alloys such as stainless steel, rubber, synthetic rubber, glass, ceramic, combinations of the aforementioned, or some other suitable material. The body <b>104</b> can be made from a single material, a single material with one or more coatings of another material, or a single material with at least one plating of another material. The body <b>104</b> can be substantially rigid such that the reservoir <b>106</b> generally retains its shape and can resist penetration by a needle, such as the type generally used to access an implantable port (e.g., Huber needle). The septum <b>108</b> is made from a self-sealing material, such as silicone rubber, that can be punctured many times before weakening significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The stem <b>102</b> mates with the catheter and is pivotably coupled to the body <b>104</b> such that the stem <b>102</b> selectively provides a pathway for fluid or some other matter between the catheter and the body <b>104</b>. The stem <b>102</b> includes, at least, a tubular member <b>112</b>. The tubular member <b>112</b> provides a pathway for fluid or some other matter between the catheter and the tunnel <b>110</b> that leads to the reservoir <b>106</b>. Thus, the tubular member <b>112</b> may have a tapered end <b>114</b> at an end that engages the tunnel <b>110</b> to minimize stubbing between an end of the tubular member <b>112</b> and the surface around the tunnel <b>110</b>. The stem <b>102</b> can also include a catheter coupling <b>116</b> that couples to one end of the tubular member <b>112</b>. The catheter coupling <b>116</b> is adapted to couple the catheter to one end of the tubular member <b>112</b>. The catheter coupling <b>116</b> can have a surface that is ridged or knurled so that the catheter coupling <b>116</b> can better mate to the catheter or the tubular member <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The stem <b>102</b> is pivotably coupled to the body <b>104</b> by a pivoting coupling <b>118</b>. The pivoting coupling <b>118</b> allows the stem <b>102</b> to pivot relative to the body <b>104</b>. The pivoting coupling <b>118</b> can be, but not limited to, a ball and socket joint, a condyloid joint, a saddle joint, a hinge joint, a pivot joint, and the like. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, the body <b>104</b> includes at least two arms <b>120</b> that extend from an outer surface of the body <b>104</b> near the tunnel <b>110</b>. Each arm <b>120</b> has an aperture <b>122</b> that mates with a protrusion <b>124</b> that extends from the stem <b>102</b>. Thus, the stem <b>102</b> can pivot with respect to the arms <b>120</b> through its protrusions <b>124</b> rotating within the aperture <b>122</b> of each arm <b>120</b>, and because the arms <b>120</b> are substantially stationary with respect to the body <b>104</b>, the stem <b>102</b> can pivot with respect to the body <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, the stem <b>102</b> includes the tubular member <b>112</b> with the tapered end <b>114</b> at one end and the catheter coupling <b>116</b> at the opposite end. The stem <b>102</b> further includes a collar <b>126</b> that substantially wraps around a generally middle portion of the tubular member <b>112</b> and a hood <b>128</b> that substantially extends around the collar <b>126</b> and the tapered end <b>114</b>. The collar <b>126</b> is rigidly fixed to the tubular member <b>112</b> and has at least a first surface <b>130</b> and a second surface <b>132</b>. The first surface <b>130</b> abuts against the catheter coupling <b>116</b>; thus the catheter coupling <b>116</b> cannot slide past the collar <b>126</b> and slip over the tapered end <b>114</b> of the tubular member <b>112</b>. The second surface <b>132</b> abuts against the surface around the tunnel <b>110</b>; thus the tubular member <b>112</b> cannot be inserted further into the tunnel <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The hood <b>128</b> is disposed spaced apart from the tapered end <b>114</b> of the tubular member <b>112</b> and extends substantially over the tapered end <b>114</b>. The hood <b>128</b> may also couple the catheter coupling <b>116</b> and the tubular member <b>112</b>. The hood <b>128</b> includes two protrusions <b>124</b> disposed generally opposite to each other and positioned to mate with the apertures <b>122</b> of the arms <b>120</b>. Although the embodiment depicted has two sets of protrusions <b>124</b> and apertures <b>122</b>, in other embodiments, the port <b>100</b> may have more or less than the two sets shown.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, with the depicted construction, the stem <b>102</b> including the tubular member <b>112</b>, the catheter coupling <b>116</b>, and the hood <b>128</b> pivot together. When the stem <b>102</b> is pivoted such that the tubular member <b>112</b> and the hood <b>128</b> are generally aligned with the tunnel <b>110</b>, the tubular member <b>112</b> can be pushed or inserted into the tunnel <b>110</b>. Because of the tapered end <b>114</b> of the tubular member <b>112</b>, the tubular member <b>112</b> generally avoids stubbing with the surface around the opening to the tunnel <b>110</b>. Once the tubular member <b>112</b> is inserted into the tunnel <b>110</b>, the tubular member <b>112</b> is retained in the tunnel <b>110</b> by the O-ring.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, the tunnel <b>110</b> may include a fluid seal <b>134</b> and a fluid seal retainer <b>136</b>. The fluid seal <b>134</b> provides a substantially fluid-tight seal between the tubular member <b>112</b> and the tunnel <b>110</b>. The fluid seal <b>134</b> can be, for example, an O-ring, an adhesive, tape, or some other substantially fluid-proof seal. The fluid seal retainer <b>136</b> generally maintains the fluid seal <b>134</b> within the tunnel <b>110</b>. The fluid seal retainer <b>136</b> can be, but is not limited to, a washer, an O-ring, an adhesive, tape, and the like. In the embodiment shown, the fluid seal <b>134</b> is a single O-ring, but the fluid seal <b>134</b> can be multiple O-rings or a combination of different fluid seals <b>134</b>. Once the tubular member <b>112</b> is inserted into the tunnel <b>110</b>, the tubular member <b>112</b> is retained in the tunnel <b>110</b> by the O-ring. In other embodiments, the tubular member <b>112</b> can be retained in the tunnel <b>110</b> by pressure fitting, friction fitting, mating threads, ridges, knurls, or some other suitable mating. Also, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, the fluid seal retainer <b>136</b> is a single washer, but in other embodiments, the fluid seal retainer <b>136</b> can be more than one washer or a combination of a washer, an O-ring, an adhesive, tape, and the like. The implantable port of the present invention can be made to be compatible with power injection.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A method of using the implantable port <b>100</b> begins with gaining access to a blood vessel. For example, for venous access, a micropuncture technique can be utilized. Through the access to the blood vessel, a first guide wire is inserted, and a dilator or a sheath is placed over the first guide wire. In one embodiment, the dilator is disposed within the sheath. The sheath can have an inner lumen of approximately 0.035 inches to approximately 0.038 inches. The sheath may be sized for a second guide wire. The micropuncture guide wire and dilator are removed and a large 0.035&#x2033;-0.038&#x2033; guide wire is inserted centrally.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Local anesthesia can be applied to an area wherein the port <b>100</b> is to be inserted or the port pocket. For example, the area can be generally in the upper chest. The port pocket can be disposed at the skin entry site for tunneling by, for example, a variant longitudinal incision. Then, a hollow tunneler is advanced through the tissue in the area wherein the port <b>100</b> is to be inserted. Afterwards, the 0.035&#x2033;-0.038&#x2033; guide wire is directed toward the hollow tunneler. Once the guide wire reaches the hollow tunneler, the second guide wire is inserted through the hollow tunneler and directed toward the area of the port pocket.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The port <b>100</b> is placed in the port pocket with the stem <b>102</b> in the first position. That is, the stem <b>102</b> is not coupled to the body <b>104</b> of the port <b>100</b>. A catheter is then placed over the guide wire. Once the catheter reaches the appropriate position, the guide wire can be removed. The catheter can then be cut to an appropriate length. Next, the catheter is coupled to the stem <b>102</b>, and the stem <b>102</b> is pivoted and coupled to the body <b>104</b> of the port <b>100</b>. Then, the port <b>100</b> may be flushed and the site of the incision for the port pocket can be closed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although one method of using the port <b>100</b> is described, the port <b>100</b> can be used with a variety of other methods and not limited to the method described. For example, the described method does not require a peel-apart vascular sheath, but such a sheath may be used with the port <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>, the present invention provides a second embodiment of an implantable port <b>200</b> that includes a pivotably coupled stem <b>202</b>. The stem <b>102</b> is pivotably coupled at one end to a body <b>204</b> of the port <b>200</b>, and at the opposite end, the stem <b>202</b> is adapted to be mated to a catheter (not shown). In this particular embodiment, the implantable port <b>200</b> is of a heart shape, and comprises two reservoirs. Each of the two reservoirs <b>206</b>A <b>206</b>B are within the body <b>204</b> of the implantable port <b>200</b>. Each of the reservoir <b>206</b>A <b>206</b>B is capped with a needle penetrable septum <b>208</b>A <b>208</b>B respectively. The septa <b>208</b>A <b>208</b>B are secured by a cap <b>230</b> that attaches to the body <b>204</b> of the implantable port <b>200</b>. Each of the reservoir <b>206</b>A <b>206</b>B comprises a tunnel <b>210</b>A <b>210</b>B allowing fluid communication with the reservoirs <b>206</b>A <b>206</b>B. The distal end of the stem <b>202</b> comprises two prongs <b>252</b>A <b>252</b>B. In this embodiment, the two prongs are of a generally &#x201c;D&#x201d; shaped cross section. A dual lumen catheter (not shown) may be secured to the prongs <b>252</b>A <b>252</b>B using a coupling or locking device (not shown) well known to one skilled in the art. The stem <b>202</b> of embodiment shown also has two proximal tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B. The tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B corresponds to the tunnels <b>210</b>A <b>210</b>B of the body of the implantable port <b>200</b>. The stem <b>202</b> can be selectively placed in a closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), wherein the stem <b>202</b> is coupled to the body <b>204</b> of the port <b>200</b>, an extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) wherein the stem <b>202</b> slides distally away from the body <b>204</b>, or an open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), wherein the stem <b>202</b> pivots away from the body <b>204</b> of the port <b>200</b> allowing access to the proximal tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B. In the open position, a guide wire can be inserted into the each tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B of the stem <b>202</b> to unkink a catheter mated to the stem <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The stem <b>202</b> mates with the catheter and is pivotably coupled to the body <b>204</b> such that the stem <b>102</b> selectively provides a pathway for fluid or some other matter between the catheter and the body <b>204</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>, the first reservoir <b>206</b>A is in fluid communication with tunnel <b>210</b>A, tubular member <b>212</b>A and the first distal prong <b>252</b>A. The second reservoir <b>206</b>B is in fluid communication with tunnel <b>210</b>B, tubular member <b>212</b>B and the second distal prong <b>252</b>B. The tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B may each have a tapered end <b>214</b>A and <b>214</b>B at an end that engages the tunnels <b>210</b>A <b>210</b>B, respectively. It is contemplated in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>, the tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B extend into the tunnels <b>210</b>A <b>210</b>B when the implantable port <b>200</b> transitions from the extended position to the closed position. The stem <b>202</b> slides toward the body <b>204</b> of the implantable port. A fluid seal is achieved by using an O-ring affixed at the distal end of the tunnels <b>210</b>A <b>210</b>B. The O-ring typically has an inner diameter that is slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B. When sliding toward the body <b>204</b> of the implantable port <b>200</b>, the tapered ends <b>214</b>A <b>214</b>B facilitates the tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B to slide into the O-ring achieving a fluid seal. Alternatively, the O-ring may be of a size comparable to the diameter of the tapered ends <b>214</b>A <b>214</b>B, and the tapered ends <b>214</b>A <b>214</b>B may be pressed against the O-ring to achieve a fluid seal. Other technique for achieving a fluid seal between the tunnels <b>210</b>A <b>210</b>B and the tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B may be employed without departing from the teaching of the present invention. A tongue and grove, a detent, or any other mechanical engagement mechanism may be used to retain the stem <b>202</b> in the closed position in relation to the body <b>204</b> of the implantable port.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The stem <b>202</b> is pivotably coupled to the body <b>204</b> by a pivoting coupling. The pivoting coupling allows the stem <b>202</b> to pivot relative to the body <b>204</b>. The pivoting coupling can be, but not limited to, a ball and socket joint, a condyloid joint, a saddle joint, a hinge joint, a pivot joint, and the like. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>, the body <b>204</b> includes at least two arms <b>220</b> that extend from an outer surface of the body <b>204</b>. In the particular embodiment, the arms <b>220</b> are joined at the bottom forming a U-shaped support. Each arm <b>220</b> has a protrusion <b>226</b> close to the distal end of the arm <b>220</b>. The stem <b>202</b> comprising a grove <b>224</b> in a portion of the surface opposing the protrusions <b>226</b> of the arms <b>220</b> along the length of the stem <b>202</b>, but does not extend all the way to the distal end. When assembled, the protrusions <b>226</b> fit in the groves <b>224</b> of the arms <b>220</b> allowing the stem <b>202</b> to slide along the arm <b>220</b>, and pivot when the proximal end of the stem <b>202</b> clears the body <b>204</b> of the implantable port <b>200</b>. To close the implantable port <b>200</b>, the stem <b>202</b> is aligned with the arms <b>220</b>, and slid toward the body <b>204</b> until the securely engages the body. To open the implantable port <b>200</b>, the stem <b>202</b> is pulled away from the body <b>204</b>, and then pivots to allow access to the distal tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The body <b>204</b> and the stem <b>202</b> can be made from plastic such as biocompatible medical grade polymers such as polysulfone, metal such as titanium, alloys such as stainless steel, rubber, synthetic rubber, glass, ceramic, combinations of the aforementioned, or some other suitable material. The body <b>204</b> and the stem <b>202</b> can be made from a single material, a single material with one or more coatings of another material, or a single material with at least one plating of another material. The body <b>204</b> can be substantially rigid such that the reservoirs <b>206</b>A <b>206</b>B generally retains its shape and can resist penetration by a needle, such as the type generally used to access an implantable port (e.g., Huber needle). The septa <b>208</b>A <b>208</b>B is made from a self-sealing material, such as silicone rubber, that can be punctured many times before weakening significantly. The tubular members <b>212</b>A <b>212</b>B and the distal prongs <b>252</b>A <b>252</b>B may be made of similar biocompatible materials as the body <b>204</b>, particularly may be made of metal such as titanium and alloys such as stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>, the present invention provides a third embodiment of an implantable port <b>300</b> that includes two identical individual pivotable stems <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B. The stems <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B are pivotably coupled at one end to a body <b>304</b> of the port <b>300</b>, and at the opposite end, each of the stem <b>302</b> is adapted to be mated to an individual catheter (not shown).

Each of the reservoir <b>306</b>A <b>306</b>B is capped with a needle penetrable septum <b>308</b>A <b>308</b>B, respectively. The septa <b>308</b>A <b>308</b>B are secured by a cap <b>330</b> that attaches to the body <b>304</b> of the implantable port <b>300</b>. Each of the reservoir <b>306</b>A <b>306</b>B comprises a tunnel <b>310</b>A <b>310</b>B allowing fluid communication with the reservoirs <b>306</b>A <b>306</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>, stem <b>302</b>A is shown in an exploded view. Each stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B comprises a hood <b>328</b>, a sleeve <b>350</b>, and a tubular member <b>360</b>. The tubular member <b>360</b> further comprises a proximal tapered end <b>362</b>, a collar <b>364</b>, a ridge <b>366</b>, and a distal tapered end <b>368</b>. The catheter is secured between the tubular member <b>360</b> and the sleeve <b>350</b>. The collar <b>364</b> of the tubular member and the corresponding internal profile of the sleeve, e.g., narrowing in the inner diameter of the sleeve, compress against the catheter, ensuring a secure and fluid tight connection. The catheter, tubular member <b>360</b>, and sleeve <b>350</b> assembly is placed in the hood <b>328</b>. The catheter, tubular member <b>360</b>, and sleeve <b>350</b> assembly may slide within the hood. When the catheter, tubular member <b>360</b>, and sleeve <b>350</b> assembly slide toward and couple to the body <b>304</b>, a fluid tight connection is formed from the reservoirs <b>306</b>A <b>306</b>B to the catheters. When the catheter, tubular member <b>360</b>, and sleeve <b>350</b> assembly slide away from the body, the entire stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B can then pivot in relation to the body <b>304</b> of the implantable port <b>300</b>. Typically, the tubular member <b>360</b> is partially inserted into the catheter up to the ridge <b>366</b>. The distal tapered end <b>368</b> can facilitate the insertion of the tubular member <b>360</b> into the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The stems <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B mate with the catheter and is pivotably coupled to the body <b>304</b> such that the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B selectively provides a pathway for fluid or some other matter between the catheter and the body <b>304</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>, the first reservoir <b>306</b>A is in fluid communication with tunnel <b>310</b>A, and tubular member <b>360</b>. The second reservoir <b>306</b>B is in fluid communication with tunnel <b>310</b>B, and tubular member <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Each of the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B can be selectively placed in a closed position, wherein the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B is coupled to the body <b>304</b> of the port <b>300</b>, an extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15-17</figref>, <b>302</b>B) wherein the catheter, tubular member <b>360</b>, and sleeve <b>350</b> assembly slides distally away from the body <b>304</b>, or an open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15-16</figref>, <b>302</b>A), wherein the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B pivots away from the body <b>304</b> of the port <b>300</b> allowing access to the proximal tubular members <b>382</b>. In the open position, a guide wire can be inserted into the each tubular members <b>360</b> of the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B to unkink a catheter mated to the stem <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The tubular members <b>360</b> may each have a tapered end <b>362</b> at an end that engages the tunnels <b>310</b>A <b>310</b>B, respectively. It is contemplated in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>, that the distal end of the tubular members <b>362</b> extend into the tunnels <b>310</b>A <b>310</b>B when the implantable port <b>300</b> transitions from the extended position to the closed position. A fluid seal is achieved by using an O-ring <b>374</b> affixed at the distal end of the tunnels <b>310</b>A <b>310</b>B. The O-ring typically has an inner diameter that is slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the tubular members <b>360</b>. The O-ring <b>374</b> is secured in place by a retainer ring <b>372</b>. When sliding toward the body <b>304</b> of the implantable port <b>300</b>, the tapered ends <b>362</b>A <b>362</b>B facilitates the tubular members <b>360</b> to slide into the O-ring achieving a fluid seal. Alternatively, the tapered ends <b>362</b> may be pressed against the O-ring to achieve a fluid seal. Other technique for achieving a fluid seal between the tunnels <b>310</b>A <b>310</b>B and the tubular members <b>360</b> may be employed without departing from the teaching of the present invention. A tongue and grove, a detent, or any other mechanical engagement mechanism may be used to retain the stem <b>302</b> in the closed position in relation to the body <b>204</b> of the implantable port.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Each of the stems <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B is pivotably coupled to the body <b>304</b> by a pivoting coupling <b>318</b>. The pivoting coupling <b>318</b> allows the stem <b>302</b> to pivot relative to the body <b>304</b>. The pivoting coupling <b>318</b> can be, but not limited to, a ball and socket joint, a condyloid joint, a saddle joint, a hinge joint, a pivot joint, and the like. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>, the body <b>304</b> includes at least two arms <b>320</b> that extend from an outer surface of the body <b>304</b> for each of the stems <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B. In the particular embodiment, the arms <b>320</b> for each of the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B are joined at the bottom, forming a U-shaped support. Each stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B has a pair of protrusions <b>326</b> close to the distal end of the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B. Each of the arm <b>320</b> comprising a depression <b>324</b> in the surface opposing the protrusions <b>326</b> of the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B. When assembled, the protrusions <b>326</b> of the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B fit in the depressions <b>324</b> of the arms <b>320</b> allowing the stems <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B to pivot when the proximal end of the tubular members <b>362</b> clear the body <b>304</b> of the implantable port <b>300</b>. To close the implantable port <b>300</b>, the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B is aligned with the arms <b>320</b>, and the catheter, tubular member <b>360</b>, and sleeve <b>350</b> assembly slid toward the body <b>304</b> until it securely engages the body. To open the implantable port <b>300</b>, the catheter, tubular member <b>360</b>, and sleeve <b>350</b> assembly is pulled away from the body <b>304</b>, and then the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B pivots to allow access to the distal tubular members <b>362</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The body <b>304</b> and the stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B can be made from plastic such as biocompatible, medical grade polymers such as polysulfone, metal such as titanium, alloys such as stainless steel, rubber, synthetic rubber, glass, ceramic, combinations of the aforementioned, or some other suitable material. The body <b>304</b> and the stem <b>302</b> can be made from a single material, a single material with one or more coatings of another material, or a single material with at least one plating of another material. The body <b>304</b> can be substantially rigid such that the reservoirs <b>306</b>A <b>30613</b> generally retains its shape and can resist penetration by a needle, such as the type generally used to access an implantable port (e.g., Huber needle). The septa <b>308</b>A <b>308</b>B is made from a self-sealing material, such as silicone rubber, that can be punctured many times before weakening significantly. The stem <b>302</b>A <b>302</b>B and its components, the tubular members <b>360</b>, the sleeves <b>350</b>, and the hood <b>328</b> may be made of similar biocompatible materials as the body <b>304</b>. Particularly, the tubular member <b>360</b> may be made of metal such as titanium and alloys such as stainless steel.</p>
