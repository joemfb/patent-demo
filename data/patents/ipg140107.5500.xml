<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the disclosure. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. Moreover, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed interposing the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. Various features may be arbitrarily drawn in different scales for the sake of simplicity and clarity. It is noted that the same or similar features may be similarly numbered herein for the sake of simplicity and clarity. In addition, some of the drawings may be simplified for clarity. Thus, the drawings may not depict all of the components of a given apparatus (e.g., device) or method.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Various aspects of the present disclosure will be described herein with reference to drawings that are schematic illustrations of idealized configurations of the present disclosure. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, the various aspects of the present disclosure presented throughout this disclosure should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of elements (e.g., regions, layers, sections, substrates, etc.) illustrated and described herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. By way of example, an element illustrated or described as a rectangle may have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient concentration at its edges rather than a discrete change from one element to another. Thus, the elements illustrated in the drawings are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of an element and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It will be understood that although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, &#x201c;third&#x201d;, and so on, may be used herein to describe various elements or devices, the elements or devices should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element or device from another element or device. Thus, a first element or device discussed below could be termed a second element or device without departing from the teachings of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is understood that several processing steps and/or features of a device may be only briefly described, such steps and/or features being well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Also, additional processing steps or features can be added, and certain of the following processing steps or features can be removed and/or changed while still implementing the claims. Thus, the following description should be understood to represent examples only, and are not intended to suggest that one or more steps or features is required.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Example methods and systems to generate, mange, and/or share an inventory are described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An inventory system is to generate and maintain an inventory of a consumer's belongings or desired items, including, for example, fungible products and collectibles, organized as item trading cards in one example. The inventory may include a list of items, a description of at least a portion of the respective items belonging to the consumer or desired by the consumer, a quantity of each item owned or desired by the consumer, and a market value of each item. The inventory, as used herein, is defined as a list of items and associated description of the items that a particular consumer or set of consumers possesses, desires to possess (e.g., as a potential purchase item or as a &#x201c;wish list&#x201d; or &#x201c;wish item&#x201d;), and/or desires to share with other consumers or users. The inventory may include at least a partial description of at least a portion of the items. The inventory may be augmented with market data for certain items. The consumers may include users of the inventory system, people identified by the user, or business entities, such as the nodes of a user's social network (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one example, the inventory system may generate, manage, and/or share items organized as item trading cards, with each item trading card associated with an item. Each item trading card may further include a item identifier associated the item, a trading card identifier associated with the trading card, item data about the item, and market data about the item.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The inventory system may establish an inventory account for the consumer. In some instances, the inventory account may be subdivided into multiple accounts or be associated with other accounts belonging to other consumers. Items and associated item trading cards may be added to the inventory account based on, for example, transactions associated with the consumer, input received from the consumer, or by other operations. For example, a consumer may send a barcode or a quick response (QR) code associated with an item to the inventory system for generating an item trading card. In another example, a consumer may send a unique barcode associated with a vehicle identification number for generating an item trading card associated with that vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Upon receiving at least a partial identification of an item, the inventory system may collect additional item data from a plurality of sources, including the consumer, and update an item description in the item trading card. In the case of the item being a fungible good, the item trading card in the inventory may be updated based on catalog data associated with the fungible good.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The inventory system may collect market data for the respective items in the inventory. The market data may include a current market value for an item in inventory based on recent transactions, availability notes, or information about events that may affect the value of the item. The market data, along with a description of the item, may be displayed on the item trading card to the consumer via a user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a network diagram depicting a client-server system <b>100</b>, within which one example embodiment may be deployed. A networked system <b>102</b>, in the example forms of a network-based marketplace or publication system, provides server-side functionality, via a network <b>104</b> (e.g., the Internet, a Wide Area Network (WAN), or a local area network (LAN)) to one or more clients. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates, for example, a web client <b>106</b> (e.g., a browser, such as the Internet Explorer browser developed by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The network <b>104</b>, in one embodiment, may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, the network <b>104</b> may include a wireless telecommunications network (e.g., cellular telephone network) adapted for communication with one or more other communication networks, such as the Internet. In other examples, the network <b>104</b> may include the Internet, one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and/or one or more other appropriate types of communication networks.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The client machines <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, in various embodiments, may each be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and/or software configured for wired and/or wireless communication over the network <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the client machines <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> may each be implemented as a mobile communication device (e.g., wireless cellular phone) adapted for communication with the network <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, the client machines <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> may each be implemented as a personal computer (PC), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a notebook computer, and/or various other generally known types of wired and/or wireless computing devices for communication with the network <b>104</b>. It should be appreciated that the client machines may be referred to as a client device or a customer device without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An Application Program Interface (API) server <b>114</b> and a web server <b>116</b> are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers <b>118</b>. The application servers <b>118</b> host one or more marketplace applications <b>120</b> and payment applications <b>122</b>. The application servers <b>118</b> are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more database servers <b>124</b> that facilitate access to one or more databases <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The marketplace applications <b>120</b> may provide a number of marketplace functions and services to users that access the networked system <b>102</b> and may include an inventory system <b>200</b>. The payment applications <b>122</b> may likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. The payment applications <b>122</b> may allow users to accumulate value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as &#x201c;points&#x201d;) in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products (e.g., goods or services) that are made available via the marketplace applications <b>120</b>. While the marketplace and payment applications <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to both form part of the networked system <b>102</b>, it will be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the payment applications <b>122</b> may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the networked system <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, while the system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> employs a client-server architecture, embodiments are not limited to such an architecture, and could equally well find application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, architecture system, for example. The various marketplace and payment applications <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> could also be implemented as standalone software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The web client <b>106</b> accesses the various marketplace and payment applications <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> via the web interface supported by the web server <b>116</b>. Similarly, the programmatic client <b>108</b> accesses the various services and functions provided by the marketplace and payment applications <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> via the programmatic interface provided by the API server <b>114</b>. The programmatic client <b>108</b> may, for example, be a seller application (e.g., the TurboLister application developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, Calif.) to enable sellers to author and manage listings on the networked system <b>102</b> in an off-line manner, and to perform batch-mode communications between the programmatic client <b>108</b> and the networked system <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates a third-party application <b>128</b>, executing on a third-party server machine <b>130</b>. In one example, third-party server machine <b>130</b> may have programmatic access to the networked system <b>102</b> via the programmatic interface provided by the API server <b>114</b>. For example, the third-party application <b>128</b> may, utilizing information retrieved from the networked system <b>102</b>, support one or more features or functions on a website hosted by the third party. The third-party website may, for example, provide one or more promotional, marketplace or payment functions that are supported by the relevant applications of the networked system <b>102</b>. In other examples, the third-party application <b>128</b> on third party server machine <b>130</b> may provide a social network (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) with contacts or nodes with whom item trading cards may be shared by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of an inventory system <b>200</b> according to at least one embodiment. The inventory system <b>200</b> may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. The inventory system <b>200</b> is configured to generate an inventory including at least one item trading card (typically a plurality of item trading cards) and maintain the inventory for at least one consumer (typically a plurality of consumers). For simplicity, the inventory system <b>200</b> is described as generating a single inventory for a single consumer. It is understood that the inventory system may generate and maintain multiple inventories for multiple consumers. The identification of a particular inventory is discussed in greater detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Upon receiving an identification of a particular inventory maintained by the inventory system <b>200</b>, an identification module <b>202</b> is configured to receive an indication that the consumer possesses, owns, plans to purchase, or desires a particular item. The indication may be a record that the consumer has purchased the item using the marketplace application <b>120</b>, a universal product code (UPC) or quick response (QR) input (or other bar code) from a camera or optical scanner, a selection of the item by the consumer via a user interface, a picture of the item received from the consumer, text received from the consumer, or by other data collected about or by the consumer. In some embodiments, the consumer may scan a bar code printed on a receipt that identifies multiple items purchased by the consumer at a point of sale (POS) system in a store. Other identifiers, such as vehicle identification numbers (VINs) or serial numbers, may be provided by the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some instances, search terms saved by the user or used repeatedly by the user may be identified and associated with a particular item owned or desired to be purchased by the consumer. For example, if the saved searches include various car parts for a 1987 Nissan truck, the identification module <b>202</b> may determine that the consumer owns or desires to purchase a 1987 Nissan truck. In these instances, the identification module <b>202</b> may send a confirmation message to the consumer to confirm that the consumer does, in fact, own or desires to purchase the 1987 Nissan truck.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The indication received by the identification module <b>202</b> may or may not include a complete description of the item. Upon receiving the indication, the identification module <b>202</b> stores the indication and as complete a description as known in an inventory <b>204</b>. The inventory <b>204</b> stores and makes available the indications of the items of the consumer. In one example, the description of the item may be stored as an initial item trading card in the inventory <b>204</b> and used as a basis for additional item data (e.g., vehicle performance and mechanical specifications) and/or item market data (e.g., vehicle sale prices, lowest prices, etc.) to generate a subsequent item trading card. In other examples, item data may be stored in inventory <b>204</b> and used for an item trading card subsequently assembled and displayed via interface module <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some instances, the identification module <b>202</b> is further configured to manage a wish list associated with the consumer. The wish list includes at least a portion of a description of one or more items that the consumer desires or plans to purchase (or have purchased for the consumer) at some point in the future. The identification module <b>202</b> may access the inventory <b>204</b> to complete a description of an item on the wish list. For example, if the inventory <b>204</b> includes a description of a 1987 Nissan truck and the consumer has added &#x201c;windshield wipers&#x201d; to his wish list, the identification module <b>202</b> (or the collection module <b>204</b>, discussed below), may include the windshield wipers on the wish list as being &#x201c;windshield wipers for a 1987 Nissan truck.&#x201d; In some instances, a product code or part number for appropriate windshield wipers may be determined and added to the wish list. In one example, one or more items of a wish list may be described, displayed, or linked on an existing item trading card with an associated item (e.g., on an existing item trading card for the 1987 Nissan truck) or on a newly created item trading card which is or is not associated with another existing item trading card.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The collection module <b>206</b> is configured to collect additional details about an item (also referred to as additional &#x201c;item data&#x201d;) or related items and/or to confirm an identity of an item. The additional details about an item may be collected from multiple sources such as manufacturers, retailers, distributors, media sources, consumers, and experts. The item may be a fungible good identifiable by a UPC scanned by the consumer or may be a rare collectible identifiable by experts. To populate descriptions of particular items, particularly a fungible good, the collection module <b>206</b> may access a catalog <b>208</b>. The catalog <b>208</b> may include at least one table that includes descriptions or specifications known about the fungible good. A fungible good in a particular inventory <b>204</b> may include a pointer to the catalog <b>208</b>. For rare items or items that are not included in the catalog <b>208</b>, the collection module <b>206</b> may store the additional details in the inventory <b>204</b>. In instances where the consumer purchased the item using a marketplace application <b>120</b>, the item description published by a seller during the sale of the item may be used to populate the description of the purchased item. In one example, the additional item data which is collected by collection module <b>206</b> may be described, displayed, or linked on an existing item trading card with an associated item (e.g., vehicle performance and mechanical specifications for an existing vehicle trading card).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A tracking module <b>210</b> is configured to collect market data about the items in the inventory <b>204</b>. The market data may be collected from one or more resources including transaction data in an online marketplace and/or third party websites (e.g., from a third party server machine <b>130</b>). Other sources of data include published pricelists, market data for substantially the same or similar items, and various other market data sources. The similar items may be complementary (e.g., accessories for a device) or competitive (e.g., replacements for an item). In one example, the item market data which is collected by tracking module <b>210</b> may be described, displayed, or linked on an existing item trading card with an associated item (e.g., vehicle sale prices, lowest prices, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An interface module <b>212</b> is to generate a user interface to display the inventory to the consumer. The user interface may include a description of an item or a plurality of items accessed from the inventory and/or the catalog <b>208</b> and market data pertaining to the item or items. As noted above, in one example, the user interface may display an item from the inventory in the form of an item trading card as further described below. The interface module <b>212</b> may assemble an interface for a set of inventories or an item trading card(s) accessible to the consumer. According to one aspect, item data (e.g., additional item data and/or item market data) may be stored in inventory <b>204</b> and used for an item trading card subsequently assembled and displayed via interface module <b>212</b>. According to another aspect, a basis item trading card may be stored in inventory <b>204</b> which may subsequently be updated with additional item data and/or item market data and displayed via interface module <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, the interface module <b>212</b> may communicate with the marketplace applications <b>120</b> and the payment applications <b>122</b> to provide an option to list a particular item in the inventory (e.g., to list a particular item trading card) for sale in an online marketplace.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the inventory <b>204</b> maintained by the inventory system <b>200</b> may be used to provide search results. For example, a search module (not shown) among the marketplace applications <b>120</b> may access the inventory <b>204</b> (or data about the consumer derived from the inventory <b>204</b>) to refine search results provided to the consumer in response to a query. For example, if the inventory <b>204</b> associated with the consumer includes the 1987 Nissan truck and the consumer enters a query for &#x201c;windshield wipers,&#x201d; the search module may provide search results directed to windshield wipers for a 1987 Nissan truck. In some embodiments, search results related to a 1987 Nissan truck may be prioritized or featured within the search results provided to the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In further instances, the inventory <b>204</b> may be used to establish social groups of consumers who own similar items. For example, if a number of consumers each own a 1987 Nissan truck, a social group for 1987 Nissan truck owners may be created within a social network. Each consumer who owns a 1987 Nissan truck may be invited to join the social group. The social network may provide a number of features to the members of the social group. These features may include a wall, a forum having a number of chat rooms, profile pages for each member where the member may post images of his 1987 Nissan truck, a buy/sell feature where the member may list 1987 Nissan trucks and related items (e.g., spare parts) for sale or purchase. In one embodiment, inventory system <b>200</b> may communicate via interface module <b>212</b> with a third party social network to share or transmit or communicate one or more item trading cards to a consumer's contacts or nodes in the consumer's social network. According to one aspect, unique item identifiers and/or unique item trading card identifiers may be shared or transmitted or communicated.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart of a process <b>300</b> for generating and managing a particular inventory in the inventory <b>204</b> according to at least one embodiment. The process <b>300</b> may at least partially be performed by the inventory system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an operation <b>302</b>, the particular inventory within the inventory <b>204</b> is identified. The particular inventory may be accessible by one or more consumers. The particular inventory may comprise a set of two or more inventories or be linked to other inventories. For example, the particular inventory may be a family inventory having items divided by family members, for example, a father, a mother, and a child. In other instances, the family inventory may be constructed as a set of linked inventories having permissions. For example, a mother may be able to access a father's inventory and a child's inventory but the child may not have access to his parent's inventories. The permissions may define the ability of a consumer within the family to perform certain tasks such as adding items to an inventory and listing items for sale. For example, a father may be able to list items in the child's inventory for sale but not the mother's items even though the mother's items are visible to the father.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an operation <b>304</b>, at least one item is added to an inventory. The addition of the item may be performed as described above in connection with the identification module <b>202</b>, collection module <b>206</b>, and/or tracking module <b>210</b>. The item may have a full or partial description at the time it is added.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an operation <b>306</b>, data about the added item may be collected from one or more sources. In an operation <b>308</b>, the collected data is added to the item description by storing the information in the inventory <b>204</b> or the catalog <b>208</b>. Operations <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> may be repeated as additional information is collected.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an operation <b>310</b>, market data is collected for the item, and in an operation <b>312</b>, an interface is provided to communicate the market data to the consumer. The operation <b>310</b> may be performed upon receiving a request for the interface of operation <b>312</b> or may be performed at other times. For fungible goods that may be included in more than one inventory, the market data may be collected continuously or periodically.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a high-level entity-relationship diagram, illustrating various tables <b>400</b> that may be maintained within the inventory <b>204</b> and the catalog <b>208</b>, and that are utilized by and support the inventory system <b>200</b>. A user table <b>402</b> contains a record for each registered consumer of the networked system <b>102</b>, and may include identifier, address and financial instrument information pertaining to each such registered consumer. A consumer may operate as a seller, a buyer, or both, within the networked system <b>102</b>. In one example embodiment, a buyer may be a consumer that has accumulated value (e.g., commercial or proprietary currency), and is accordingly able to exchange the accumulated value for items that are offered for sale by the networked system <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The tables <b>400</b> also include an items table <b>404</b> in which are maintained item records for items in an inventory associated with a consumer. Each record within the items table <b>404</b> may furthermore be linked to one or more consumer records within the user table <b>402</b>, so as to associate a consumer with each item record. In one example, the item records which are maintained in items table <b>404</b> may be in the form of partial or complete item trading cards. The item trading cards may be associated with one or more consumers and may be associated with any number of other item trading cards.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A history table <b>406</b> maintains a history of transactions to which a consumer has been a party and may be used to identify items possessed or desired to be purchased by the consumer to be included in the inventory. Catalog table <b>408</b> records information pertaining to the respective fungible goods for which records exist within the items table <b>404</b> (e.g., additional item data). Considering only a single example of information that may be stored in the catalog table <b>408</b> for a particular item, a UPC attribute may record the UPC associated with the item. A market table <b>410</b> may record market information relating to an item in the items table <b>404</b> (e.g., item market data).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a portion of an example user interface <b>500</b> generated by the inventory system <b>200</b>.

The inventory may include longer item descriptions, images, or may link to more detailed information.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For the respective items listed in the inventory, the interface <b>500</b> includes market data including an expected resale value. The expected resale value may be based on recent sales and may be calculated as, for example, an average, median, or mode of recent sale prices. A price trend may be indicated to the user graphically, for example by arrows pointing up, down, and sideways. Other graphics may include graphs, charts, or the like. Notations explaining reasons for price trends may be included in the interface <b>500</b>. The interface <b>500</b> may include an option to sell <b>508</b> the item in the inventory. Upon selecting the option to sell <b>508</b>, the item may be listed for sale by the marketplace applications <b>120</b>.</p>
