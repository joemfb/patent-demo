<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. JP 2007-136686, filed in the Japanese Patent Office on May 23, 2007, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a transmission system, a recording apparatus, a transmission method, a recording method and a program, and particularly relates to a transmission system, a recording apparatus, a transmission method, a recording method and a program capable of efficiently recording contents transmitted from another apparatus with information used for trick play thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recording apparatuses such as a DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) recorder and a Blu-ray (Registered Trademark) recorder are becoming popular. A user can record a content broadcasted by digital broadcasting and the like in an internal hard disc, and can view the content later.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the user views the content recorded in the hard disc, the user can also perform it by trick play. The trick play includes various playback methods other than normal speed playback in forward direction such as fast-forwarding, rewinding, and head searching of a content during playback.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to realize various kinds of playback methods, trick play information which is information used for the trick play of the content is recorded with the content when recording the content in the recording apparatus. When the recording system is a MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) system, the trick play information includes PTS (Presentation Time Stamp) indicating the time of each I-picture on the content.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The trick play information will be explained here.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The recording of contents in the MPEG system is performed in the unit of GOP (Group Of Picture), in which one GOP includes the prescribed number of pictures of three types of pictures which are I-picture, P-picture and B-picture.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">I-picture is a picture which is intra-coded not referring to other pictures. P-picture is a picture which is prediction-coded by referring I-picture or P-picture previously displayed in a temporal scale and by using a prediction picture generated from the picture to be referred. B-picture is a picture which is prediction-coded by referring I-picture or P-picture previously displayed in a temporal scale and one or both of I-picture and P-picture later displayed in a temporal scale and by using a prediction picture generated from the picture to be referred.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The decoding (playback) processing is also performed in this order, and the picture later displayed in a temporal scale is referred, if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When respective pictures forming the GOP are shown by combinations of alphabets (I, P, B) indicating picture types and numbers indicating the order of display, in the case that 1 GOP is formed by pictures of 15 frames and I-picture or P-picture are arranged in the unit of three pictures, 1 GOP is shown as &#x201c;B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, I<b>3</b>, B<b>4</b>, B<b>5</b>, P<b>6</b>, B<b>7</b>, B<b>8</b>, P<b>9</b>, B<b>10</b>, B<b>11</b>, P<b>12</b>, B<b>13</b>, B<b>14</b>, and P<b>15</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, since there is a case in which B-picture is encoded not only by referring the picture previously displayed in a temporal scale but also by referring the picture later displayed in a temporal scale, it is difficult to play back the B-picture when the picture later displayed is not played back.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, when playing back contents recorded in the MPEG system, the picture referred to for the playback of the B picture is played back before the B-picture. Accordingly, playback of the GOP formed by &#x201c;B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, <b>13</b>, B<b>4</b>, B<b>5</b>, P<b>6</b>, B<b>7</b>, B<b>8</b>, P<b>9</b>, B<b>10</b>, B<b>11</b>, P<b>12</b>, B<b>13</b>, B<b>14</b>, and P<b>15</b>&#x201d; and displayed in that order as described above will be played back in the order of &#x201c;I<b>3</b>, B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, P<b>6</b>, B<b>4</b>, B<b>5</b>, P<b>9</b>, B<b>7</b>, B<b>8</b>, P<b>12</b>, B<b>10</b>, B<b>11</b>, P<b>15</b>, B<b>13</b>, and B<b>14</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">That is, pictures B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b> in the certain GOP are played back by referring to a picture P<b>15</b> which is picture previous for one picture and a picture I<b>3</b> in the same GOP which is displayed later, and the picture I<b>3</b> is played back without referring to other pictures.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Pictures B<b>4</b>, B<b>5</b> are played back by referring to the picture I<b>3</b> in the same GOP which is previously displayed and a picture P<b>6</b> in the same GOP which is displayed later, and the picture P<b>6</b> is played back by referring to the picture I<b>3</b> in the same GOP which is previously displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Pictures B<b>7</b>, B<b>8</b> are played back by referring to the picture P<b>6</b> in the same GOP which is previously displayed and a picture P<b>9</b> in the same GOP which is displayed later, and the picture P<b>9</b> is played back by referring to the picture P<b>6</b> in the same GOP which is previously displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Pictures B<b>10</b>, B<b>11</b> are played back by referring to the picture P<b>9</b> in the same GOP which is previously displayed and a picture P<b>12</b> in the same GOP which is displayed later, and the picture P<b>12</b> is played back by referring to the P<b>9</b> in same GOP which is previously displayed.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In recent years, it is not unusual that one user uses plural recording apparatuses, and in such environment, contents are dealt with in such a matter that a content recorded in one recording apparatus is transmitted to another recording apparatus to be recorded in another recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, the user can transmit the contents, for example, recorded in a STB (Set Top Box) including a hard disc to a DVD recorder or a Blu-Ray recorder including a hard disc to be played back in the recorder of a transmission destination, thereby viewing the content.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">However, in the transmission of information between plural apparatuses, various arrangement have been made with respect to the transmission of contents, however, no arrangement has been made with respect to the transmission of trick play information. Therefore, if the recording apparatus of a transmission source creates trick play information and manages it, it is necessary that the recording apparatus of a transmission destination analyzes the transmitted content and creates trick play information by itself.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a view showing an example of a content transmission system of a related art.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The content transmission system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is configured by a PVR (Personal Video Recorder) <b>1</b> and a recorder <b>2</b> being connected through a network <b>3</b> which is compliant with DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) or IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The PVR <b>1</b> is a STB including a hard disc, provided by a vendor providing contents by CS (Communication Satellite) broadcasting or cable television broadcasting. The recorder <b>2</b> is a recording apparatus such as a Blu-Ray recorder including a hard disc, which is purchased by the user at a sales outlet and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the PVR <b>1</b> includes a tuner <b>11</b>, a recording control unit <b>12</b>, a hard disc <b>13</b> and a transmission unit <b>14</b>. The recorder <b>2</b> includes a receiving unit <b>21</b>, a recording control unit <b>22</b> and a hard disc <b>23</b>. An optical disc <b>24</b> such as a Blu-Ray disc is mounted in the recorder <b>2</b>. In a format of the Blu-Ray disc, when a content is recorded, trick play information thereof is recorded with the content.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The tuner <b>11</b> of the PVR <b>1</b> receives and decodes a broadcast wave signal, acquiring a MPEG-TS (MPEG-Transport Stream). The tuner <b>11</b> acquires an AV stream of a content which is a subject to be recorded from the MPEG-TS, outputting the acquired AV stream to the recording control unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The recording control unit <b>12</b> records the AV stream supplied from the tuner <b>11</b> in the hard disc <b>13</b>. The recording control unit <b>12</b> includes a stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>12</b>A, analyzing the AV stream supplied from the tuner <b>11</b> to generate trick play information in the stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>12</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, the stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>12</b>A analyzes picture types of respective pictures forming the AV stream to acquire PTSs of I-pictures. The stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>12</b>A generates trick play information by associating the acquired PTS with information indicating a recording position of the I-picture the time of which is shown by the PTS on the hard disc <b>13</b>, and records the generated trick play information in the hard disc <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The hard disc <b>13</b> includes an AV stream area in which the AV stream is recorded and a trick play information area in which the trick play information is recorded. The AV stream in information supplied from the recording control unit <b>12</b> is recorded in the AV stream area and the trick play information is recorded in the trick play information area.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the user instructs the transmission of a certain content to the recorder <b>2</b>, the transmission unit <b>14</b> reads only the AV stream of the content to be transmitted, not reading trick play information of the content to be transmitted, and stores the read AV stream in plural TS packets to transmit it to the recorder <b>2</b> through the network <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The receiving unit <b>21</b> of the recorder <b>2</b> receives TS packets transmitted from the PVR <b>1</b>, outputting the AV stream stored in the TS packets to the recording control unit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The recording control unit <b>22</b> records the AV stream supplied from the receiving unit <b>21</b> in a recording medium designated as a recording destination, which is either the hard disc <b>23</b> or the optical disc <b>24</b>. The recording control unit <b>22</b> includes a stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>22</b>A, analyzing the AV stream supplied from the receiving unit <b>21</b> to generate trick play information in the stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>22</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>22</b>A analyzes picture types of respective pictures forming the AV stream to acquire the PTS of the I-picture. The stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>22</b>A generates trick play information by associating the acquired PTS with information indicating a recording position of the I-picture the time of which is shown by the PTS on the recording medium, recording the generated trick play information in the hard disc <b>23</b> or the optical disc <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The hard disc <b>23</b> includes an AV stream area in which the AV stream is recorded and a trick play information area in which the trick play information is recorded. The AV stream in information supplied from the recording control unit <b>22</b> is recorded in the AV stream area and the trick play information is recorded in the trick play information area.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The optical disc <b>24</b> also records the AV stream supplied from the recording control unit <b>22</b> in the AV stream area and records the trick play information in the trick play information area.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Accordingly, when the content is transmitted from one apparatus to another apparatus, the AV stream is analyzed and trick play information is generated at both apparatuses of the transmission source and the transmission destination.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Therefore, it is ineffective because it is necessary to prepare a large-scaled hardware also at the apparatus of the transmission destination for generating trick play information or processing load in the apparatus of the transmission destination is heavy.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is desirable to efficiently record contents transmitted from another apparatus with information used for trick play thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a transmission system according to an embodiment of the invention in which a first and second recording apparatus are connected through a network, the first recording apparatus (for example, a PVR <b>31</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) includes a recording means (for example, a hard disc <b>43</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for recording an AV stream, a generating means (for example, a recording control unit <b>42</b>) for analyzing picture types of respective pictures included in the AV stream and generating trick play information including time information indicating the time of I-pictures on the AV stream which are necessary to be played back before playing back a picture designated as a playback start position by trick play, and a transmission means (for example, a mixing processing unit <b>44</b>) for transmitting the AV stream recorded in the recording means to the second recording apparatus with the time information included in the trick play information generated by the generating means, and the second recording apparatus (for example, a recorder <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) includes a receiving means (for example, a receiving unit <b>51</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for receiving the AV stream and the time information transmitted from the first recording apparatus and a recording control means (for example, a recording control unit <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for recording the AV stream received by the receiving means on the predetermined recording medium as well as recording trick play information including recording positions of I-pictures included in the AV stream on the predetermined recording medium and time information indicating the time of respective I-pictures on the AV stream, which is generated based on the time information received by the receiving means.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention will be explained with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view showing a content transmission system according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The content transmission system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is configured by a PVR <b>31</b> and a recorder <b>32</b> being connected through a network <b>33</b> which is compliant with a standard such as DLNA or IEEE1394.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The PVR <b>31</b> is a STB including a hard disc, provided by a vendor providing contents by CS broadcasting or cable television broadcasting. A recorder <b>32</b> is a recording apparatus such as a Blu-Ray recorder including a hard disc, which is purchased by a user at a sales outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the PVR <b>31</b> includes a tuner <b>41</b>, a recording control unit <b>42</b>, a hard disc <b>43</b>, a mixing processing unit <b>44</b> and a transmission unit <b>45</b>. The recorder <b>32</b> includes a receiving unit <b>51</b>, a recording control unit <b>52</b> and a hard disc <b>53</b>. An optical disc <b>54</b> such as a Blu-Ray disc is mounted in the recorder <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The tuner <b>41</b> of the PVR <b>31</b> receives and decodes a broadcast wave signal, acquiring a MPEG-TS. The tuner <b>41</b> acquires an AV stream of a content to be recorded from the MPEG-TS, outputting the acquired AV stream to the recording control unit <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The recording control unit <b>42</b> records the AV stream supplied from the tuner <b>41</b> in the hard disc <b>43</b>. The recording control unit <b>42</b> includes a stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>42</b>A, analyzing the AV stream supplied from the tuner <b>41</b> to generate trick play information in the stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>42</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, the stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>42</b>A analyzes picture types of respective pictures forming the AV stream to acquire PTSs of I-pictures. The stream analysis/trick play information generating unit <b>42</b>A generates trick play information by associating the acquired PTS with information indicating a recording position of the I-picture the time of which is shown by the PTS on the hard disc <b>43</b>, and records the generated trick play information in the hard disc <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The hard disc <b>43</b> includes an AV stream area in which the AV stream is recorded and a trick play area in which trick play information is recorded. The AV stream in the AV stream area in information supplied from the recording control unit <b>42</b> is recorded in the AV stream area and the trick play information is recorded in the trick play information area.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a chart showing an example of trick play information.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, PTS <b>1</b> indicating the time of a first I-picture, taking the prescribed time on the AV stream as a standard is associated with the I-picture recording position <b>1</b> which is a recording position of the I-picture on the hard disc <b>43</b>, the time of which is shown by the PTS <b>1</b>. Also concerning other I-pictures, the PTS indicating the time of the I-picture is associated with the recording position of the I-picture the time of which is shown by the PTS.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">For example, when the playback by the trick play is instructed by the user, time and the recording position of an I-picture which is necessary to be played back before playing back a picture according to the position (time) of the picture of the playback start position is certificated based on the trick play information shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Returning to explanation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a certain content is instructed to be transmitted by the user, a mixing processing unit <b>44</b> reads the AV stream of the content to be transmitted from the hard disc <b>43</b> as well as reads PTSs included in the trick play information of the content to be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The mixing processing unit <b>44</b> stores the AV stream read from the hard disc <b>43</b> in plural TS packets and aligns them in the order of transmission as well as inserts the TS packet storing the PTS of the I-picture at the head of a string of TS packets storing data of the I-picture.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The mixing processing unit <b>44</b> adds a PID allocated to video data to a packet header of the TS packet storing video data such as the I-picture as well as adds a PID allocated to audio data to the packet header of the TS packet storing audio data.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The mixing processing unit <b>44</b> adds a PID which is, for example, allocated to section data including table information to the TS packet storing the PTS of the I-picture, which is different from the PID to be added to the packet header of packets storing the AV stream (video data, audio data). Which kind of data is stored according to each PID is managed also in the recorder <b>32</b> which is the apparatus of the transmission destination of the content.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The mixing processing unit <b>44</b> outputs a string of TS packets generated as described above to the transmission unit <b>45</b>. As described later, in the recorder <b>32</b> which has received the TS packets transmitted from the PVR <b>31</b>, when the PTS stored in the TS packet identified by the prescribed PID is acquired, the acquired PTS is recognized as the one showing the PTS of the I-picture transmitted by following the TS packet storing the PTS, and trick play information is generated by using the PTS.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The PTS stored in the TS packet and transmitted from the PVR <b>31</b> is used for generating trick play information in the recorder <b>32</b>, therefore, it is information for generating trick play information (trick-play information generating information). The trick-play information generating information may include information such as the number of the I-picture in addition to the PTS, which is included in the trick play information generated in the PVR <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The transmission unit <b>45</b> adds a time stamp prescribed by the standard of DLNA to respective TS packets supplied from the mixing processing unit <b>44</b> when the network <b>3</b> is a network, for example, which is compliant with the standard of DLNA, transmitting them in the order arranged by the mixing processing unit <b>44</b> to the recorder <b>32</b> through the network <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a view showing an example of information transmitted from the PVR <b>31</b>.</p>
