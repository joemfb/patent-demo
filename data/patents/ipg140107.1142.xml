<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Application is continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/150,660, filed Apr. 29, 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,789,329.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to filtering apparatus (and method) for inlet fluid into the pressure chamber of a sprayer, and particularly from fluid filling a tank in which the pressure chamber is disposed. The invention is especially suitable for use in a backpack or knapsack sprayer wherein the tank and pressure chamber are parts thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The backpack sprayers in which the filtering apparatus provided by the invention may be deployed and may suitably be of a design described in Luchsinger, U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,419, issued Oct. 27, 1987. Such sprayers have a tank which is filled with liquid to be sprayed through a filling opening at the top thereof. A pressure chamber is disposed extending upwardly from the bottom of the tank toward the filling opening and a pump which is reciprocally actuated by a crank mechanism connected to structure depending from the bottom of the tank. The tank, pressure chamber, and pumping mechanism of such backpack sprayers are also shown in Wirz, U.S. Pat. No. 5,335,853, issued Aug. 9, 1994, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,412,707, issued Jul. 2, 2002. Liquid is drawn into the pressure chamber, via an inlet port, and pressurized fluid is withdrawn for spraying from an outlet port from the pressure chamber. These ports may be cyclically opened and closed on the suction and pressure cycle of the pump by check valves of the pump mechanism as shown and described in the above referenced patents. Particles, such as in sediment collected in the tank, can flow with the sprayer liquid into the pressure chamber and clog the pump mechanism, especially the check valves thereof. Preventing the infusion of unwanted particles, sediment and the like is a problem adversely effecting the operation of sprayers wherein a pressure chamber is inside the tank. The need to reduce the infusion of such particles, and especially sediment, in the tank into the pressure chamber and the pump mechanism has been heretofore recognized, and schemes for agitating the fluid at the bottom of the tank has, for example, utilizing a special agitation chamber associated with the pump mechanism, have been proposed; for example, in Luchsinger, U.S. Pat. No. 4,768,714, issued Sep. 6, 1988, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,798,333, issued Jan. 17, 1989.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Heretofore, removal of particles and other undesirably material clogging the pumping mechanism has required disassembly of the entire sprayer, flushing out the collected material and then reassembling the sprayer. It is desirable to avoid the use of agitation mechanisms as well as the total disassembly and assembly of the entire sprayer. It would be desirable to filter inlet fluid into the pressure chamber inlet port so that it does not reach the pumping mechanism or the pressure chamber. Filters have been proposed for use in sprayer especially of the type having a discharge tube, which extends to the bottom of the sprayer and is in communication with the spraying hose and nozzle. See, for example, Spriegel, U.S. Pat. No. 6,440,303, issued Aug. 27, 2002. The problem of accommodating filtering apparatus in a backpack sprayer is exacerbated by the confined space between the walls of the tank and the pressure chamber inside the tank of the sprayer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A filter apparatus which may be removed for cleaning and replaced manually by the operator is provided in a sprayer having a tank with a pressure chamber therein, all in accordance with the invention, thereby avoiding the need for hydraulic agitation or complete disassembly of the sprayer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is the principal object of the present invention to improve sprayers in which a pressure chamber is disposed inside a tank, which is filled with the spraying liquid, by providing filter apparatus accommodated inside the tank and which may be readily removable and replaceable manually, thereby avoiding the need to disassemble the entire sprayer for cleaning out of particles entering the pressure chamber and mechanism for pumping and pressurizing spraying liquid from the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the invention is to improve backpack sprayers by incorporating therein filtering apparatus for preventing the flow of particles and similar contaminants with liquid entering the pressure chamber of the sprayer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is a further object of the invention to provide a filter for inlet fluid to the pressure chamber inside a tank of the sprayer, which is manually accessible through the filling opening of the tank to enable installation and removal of the filter, as for cleaning of material which may be trapped in the filter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a still further object of the invention to provide removable and replaceable filtering apparatus which is manually accessible through the filing opening of a tank of a sprayer and reduces contamination due to particles and other solid contaminants at low cost without the need for disassembly and reassembly of the sprayer or the need to use special apparatus for agitating the liquid at the bottom of the sprayer tank.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Briefly described, a sprayer having a tank with a filling opening and having a pressure chamber inside the tank and an inlet port for the flow of liquid from the tank into the pressure chamber for pressurization is improved by filtering apparatus. The filtering apparatus removably locates a filter in the flow of the liquid into an inlet port from the tank into the pressure chamber. The filter is at the end of a handle, which is manually accessible via the filling opening of the tank for moving the filter into and out of filtering relationship with the inlet port and into and out of the tank, when it is desired to clean the filter of contaminating particles which may be trapped therein and to replace the cleaned filter back in the flow of liquid into the inlet port.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention also provides a method for filtering liquid to be sprayed in a sprayer having the steps of: placing a filtering element, such as a screen, near a liquid inlet port to the pressure chamber in the tank; providing a member external of the pressure chamber which extends from the filtering element to an end graspable by an operator; removing the filtering element from the tank by an operator via an opening of the tank with the aid of the member using the graspable end; cleaning material from the filtering element; and placing the cleaned filtering element via the opening of the tank back near the inlet port to the pressure chamber.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a backpack sprayer of the type shown in the above referenced patents issued to Luchsinger and Wirz. The backpack sprayer includes a tank <b>10</b> having a filling opening <b>12</b> which is open for filling with liquid to be sprayed (i.e., poured into the tank) and then closed with a cap <b>14</b>. A pressure chamber <b>16</b> is sealingly connected to the tank <b>10</b> in a flanged bottom opening <b>18</b> of the tank by a hose type clamp <b>20</b>. Lips are provided in the bottom flange <b>18</b> of the tank <b>10</b> and on the bottom of the pressure chamber <b>16</b> which are engagable with the clamp <b>20</b> so as to position the pressure chamber in alignment inside the tank <b>10</b>. As shown, the pressure chamber <b>16</b> may be a generally cylindrical vessel having its lower end. Depending from and preferably screwed into the pressure chamber is a pumping mechanism <b>22</b> which is reciprocated by a crank connected to a shaft <b>24</b>. The support structure at the bottom of the tank and around the pump <b>22</b> is not shown to simplify the illustration, but may be similar to the support mechanisms shown in the above cited Luchsinger and Wirz patents.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The pressure chamber <b>16</b> may be provided with a relief valve <b>26</b>, which is rotatable to relieve the pressure therein. Relief valve <b>26</b> may be of conventional design such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,416, issued Oct. 27, 1987 to Pagliai and Luchsinger. The filter apparatus provided by the invention and the operation thereof is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Filtering apparatus <b>30</b> provided by this invention has a filter in the form of a screen <b>32</b> in proximity to, and preferably against an inlet port <b>34</b> provided by dual openings in a rectangular neck <b>36</b>, projecting radially outward from the pressure chamber (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Also projecting outwardly from the pressure chamber <b>16</b> are flanged stubs <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> which provide a fixture <b>42</b> for capturing the removable filtering apparatus or filter <b>30</b>. This filtering apparatus <b>30</b> also has a frame <b>44</b> in which the filter screen <b>32</b> is disposed and a handle <b>46</b> with a stem connected to the frame <b>44</b> and strengthened by gussets <b>48</b> (see especially <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The upper end <b>50</b> of the stem of the handle <b>46</b> is enlarged to facilitate manual grasping of the handle, and may be provided with a finger access hole <b>52</b>. Although a finger access hole <b>52</b> is preferred, other feature(s) facilitating operator grasping of upper end <b>50</b> of the filtering apparatus <b>30</b> may be used. Fixture <b>42</b> is sized to capture the frame <b>44</b> of filtering apparatus <b>30</b> and to enable removal there from when needed. The entire filter <b>30</b> may be a molded plastic part; the frame <b>44</b> and handle <b>46</b> all being molded together, as by injection molding. The screen <b>32</b> may be either a plastic or wire mesh with the wires sufficiently close to block contaminating particles in the flow into the inlet port <b>34</b> without interfering with the flow of the spray liquid. The frame <b>44</b> and handle <b>46</b> extending therefrom thus represents a member extending from one end with screen <b>32</b> to another end <b>50</b> graspable by an operator. The location of the filtering end of apparatus <b>30</b> provided by screen <b>32</b> is proximate to the bottom of the tank <b>10</b> facilitating filtering of material that may have settled at the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to access the filter <b>30</b>, the hand <b>60</b> of the operator is inserted through the filling opening <b>12</b> of tank <b>10</b> so as to grasp the enlarged end <b>50</b> with the fingers <b>62</b> of the hand <b>60</b>. One of the fingers <b>62</b> may be inserted into hole <b>52</b>. The handle <b>46</b> extends sufficiently upwardly along the outside of the pressure chamber <b>16</b> to enable the hand <b>60</b> to access the filter <b>30</b> by reaching the handle <b>46</b>. The frame <b>44</b> of the filter <b>30</b> may be removed from the notch in the fixture <b>42</b> and removed from the tank <b>10</b> so that the screen may be cleaned if necessary. The filter <b>30</b> is then reinstalled into the fixture <b>42</b> by the operator via opening <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">During manipulation of the filter <b>30</b>, the tank <b>10</b> remains assembled and sealed via the O-ring <b>21</b> which bears against the tank. Pressurized liquid in the pressure chamber <b>16</b> is accessed via an outlet port <b>64</b> connected to a sprayer hose <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The hose <b>66</b> is connected to a nozzle (not shown) with a valve which enables the pressurized fluid to enter the nozzle and, be sprayed wherever the nozzle is pointed by the operator. Such nozzle may be typical of those used in backpack sprayers, as shown for example, in above referenced patents issued to Wirz.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">From the foregoing description, it will be apparent that there has been provided a sprayer which is improved by a manually accessible filter in the tank which is removably disposed adjacent an inlet port to a pressure chamber for liquid from a tank in which the pressure chamber is disposed. Variations and modifications and other applications of the invention will undoubtedly become apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the foregoing description should be taken as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.</p>
