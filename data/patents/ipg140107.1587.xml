<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Electronic modules, such as electronic or optoelectronic transceiver or transponder modules, are increasingly used in electronic and optoelectronic communication. Electronic modules typically communicate with a printed circuit board of a host device by transmitting electrical signals to the printed circuit board and receiving electrical signals from the printed circuit board. These electrical signals can then be transmitted by the electronic module outside the host device as optical and/or electrical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One common difficulty associated with the operation of electronic modules is the emission of electromagnetic radiation (&#x201c;EMR&#x201d;). The generation of EMR by an electronic module or a host device is a matter of significant concern because emitted EMR can cause electromagnetic interference (&#x201c;EMI&#x201d;) in other systems and devices in the vicinity, which can seriously impair, if not prevent, the proper operation of those other systems and devices. Thus, the control of EMR emissions is an important consideration in the design and use of electronic modules.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, example embodiments relate to an electromagnetic radiation shield for an electronic module. The example electromagnetic radiation (&#x201c;EMR&#x201d;) shields disclosed herein can be employed in connection with an electronic module positioned in a host device. When so employed, the example EMR shields can help maintain EMR emitted outside the host device at acceptably low levels to avoid electromagnetic interference (&#x201c;EMI&#x201d;) in surrounding devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one example embodiment, an EMR shield for an electronic transceiver module includes a conductive carrier sized and configured to surround a shell of an electronic transceiver module. The conductive carrier defines a plurality of extended elements located on at least one edge of the conductive carrier and an orientation element. Each extended element is configured to bias against the shell in order to create a physical and electrical contact between the conductive carrier and the shell. The orientation element is configured to engage a corresponding structure in the shell in order to correctly orient the conductive carrier with respect to the shell.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another example embodiment, an electronic transceiver module includes a shell, a printed circuit board (PCB) at least partially positioned within the shell, a transmitter electrically connected to the PCB, a receiver electrically connected to the PCB, and an EMR shield. The EMR shield includes a conductive carrier and a conductive foam. The conductive carrier surrounds the shell and defines a plurality of extended elements located on at least one edge of the conductive carrier. Each extended element is biased against the shell in order to create a physical and electrical contact between the conductive carrier and the shell. The conductive foam surrounds the shell and is supported by and in electrical contact with the conductive carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet another example embodiment, an active cable includes a fiber-optic communications cable and first and second optoelectronic transceiver modules. The fiber-optic communications cable includes one or more optical data transmission lines and has first and second ends. The first and second optoelectronic transceiver modules are attached to the first and second ends of the fiber-optic communications cable. Each optoelectronic transceiver module includes a shell, a PCB at least partially positioned within the shell, one or more optical transmitters electrically connected to the PCB, one or more optical receivers electrically connected to the PCB, and an EMR shield. The EMR shield includes a conductive carrier surrounding the shell and a conductive foam surrounding the shell and attached to the conductive carrier. The conductive carrier defines a plurality of extended elements located on at least one edge of the conductive carrier. Each extended element is biased against the shell in order to create a physical and electrical contact between the conductive carrier and the shell. The conductive foam is configured to physically and electrically engage a cage of a host device when the electronic transceiver module is inserted into the cage.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Example embodiments of the invention relate to an electromagnetic radiation shield for an electronic module. The example electromagnetic radiation (&#x201c;EMR&#x201d;) shield disclosed herein can be employed in connection with an electronic module positioned in a host device. When so employed, the example EMR shield can help maintain EMR emitted outside the host device at acceptably low levels to avoid electromagnetic interference (&#x201c;EMI&#x201d;) in surrounding devices.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference will now be made to the drawings to describe various aspects of example embodiments of the invention. It is to be understood that the drawings are diagrammatic and schematic representations of such example embodiments, and are not limiting of the present invention, nor are they necessarily drawn to scale.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">1. Example Active Cable</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference is first made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which discloses an example active cable <b>100</b>. The example active cable <b>100</b> is configured to physically connect two host devices together for optical and electrical data communication. The example active cable <b>100</b> includes a communications cable <b>102</b> and two identical optoelectronic transceiver modules <b>200</b> attached to the first and second ends of the communications cable <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The communications cable <b>102</b> is multichannel fiber-optic ribbon communications cable having twenty four (24) fibers, with twelve (12) of the fibers being employed to transfer data signals in one direction, and the other twelve (12) fibers being employed to transfer data signals in the opposite direction. It is understood, however, that the communications cable <b>102</b> could instead have a fewer or greater number of fibers, including a single fiber, or alternatively be an electrical communications cables including one or more electrical data transmission lines such as a Category 5 (CAT-5) cable.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the communications cable <b>102</b> is permanently attached to each of the transceiver modules <b>200</b>. However, it is understood that the communications cable <b>102</b> can alternatively be pluggably attached to one or both of the transceiver modules <b>200</b>. For example, where the communications cable <b>102</b> is a fiber-optic communications cable, the communications cable <b>102</b> can be terminated on one or both ends with a multi-fiber push on (MPO) male connector and one or both of the transceiver modules <b>200</b> can include a corresponding MPO female connector configured to pluggably receive the MPO male connector. Alternatively, where the communications cable <b>102</b> is an electrical communications cable, the communications cable <b>102</b> can be terminated on one or both ends with a registered jack 45 (RJ-45) male connector and one or both of the transceiver modules <b>200</b> can include a corresponding RJ-45 female connector configured to pluggably receive the RJ-45 male connector. Thus, although the example EMR shields disclosed herein can be employed in connection with the transceiver modules <b>200</b> as part of the example active cable <b>100</b>, it is understood that the EMR shields disclosed herein can alternatively be employed in connection with standalone electronic modules that are not permanently attached to a communications cable.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, each transceiver module <b>200</b> includes a shell <b>202</b> attached to a latching handle <b>204</b>. The latching handle <b>204</b> can be employed to insert the transceiver module <b>200</b> into a cage <b>300</b> of a host device (not shown). Once inserted into the cage <b>300</b> of the host device, the latching handle <b>204</b> engages the cage <b>300</b> to securely maintain the transceiver module <b>200</b> in the cage <b>300</b>. The latching handle <b>204</b> functions such that when the latching handle <b>204</b> is pulled, the latching handle <b>204</b> disengages from the cage <b>300</b> of the host device, thus allowing the transceiver module <b>200</b> to be extracted from the cage <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each transceiver module <b>200</b> further includes a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>206</b> at least partially positioned within the shell <b>202</b>, optical transmitters <b>208</b> electrically connected to the PCB <b>206</b>, and optical receivers <b>210</b> electrically connected to the PCB <b>206</b>. The optical transmitters <b>208</b> of the transceiver module are configured to convert electrical signals received through the PCB <b>206</b> from the host device (not shown) of the cage <b>300</b> into corresponding optical signals. Similarly, the optical receivers <b>210</b> of the transceiver module <b>200</b> are configured to convert optical signals received from the fiber-optic ribbon communications cable <b>102</b> into corresponding electrical signals for transmission to the host device (not shown) of the cage <b>300</b> through the PCB <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each transceiver module <b>200</b> can be configured for optical signal transmission and reception at a variety of data rates including, but not limited to, 150 Gb/s or higher. Further, each transceiver module <b>200</b> can be configured to support various transmission standards including, but not limited to, InfiniBand, Fibre Channel, 100 G Ethernet, SAS/SATA, and PCIe. In addition, although each transceiver module <b>200</b> is configured to have a form factor that is substantially compliant with the CXP MSA, each transceiver module <b>200</b> can alternatively be configured to have one of a variety of different form factors that are substantially compliant with other MSAs including, but not limited to, the SFP+MSA, the XFP MSA, the QSFP MSA, the X2 MSA, the XENPAK MSA, and the XPAK MSA.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, each of the transceiver modules <b>200</b> also includes an example EMR shield <b>400</b>. The EMR shields <b>400</b> can be employed to help maintain EMR emitted outside the host devices (not shown) through the module openings <b>304</b> in the cages <b>300</b> at acceptably low levels to avoid electromagnetic interference (&#x201c;EMI&#x201d;) in surrounding devices. Addition detail regarding the EMR shields <b>400</b> will be disclosed below in connections with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">2. Example EMR Shields</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, additional aspects of the example EMR shield <b>400</b> will be disclosed. As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, each EMR shield <b>400</b> includes a conductive carrier <b>402</b> and may include a conductive foam <b>404</b>. The conductive carrier <b>402</b> is sized and configured to surround the shell <b>202</b> of the transceiver module <b>200</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The conductive carrier can be formed from a relatively sturdy conductive material such <b>301</b> stainless steel sheet metal that is &#xbe; spring hard and about 0.08 mm thick, for example. The conductive carrier <b>402</b> defines a plurality of extended elements <b>406</b> located on at least one edge of the conductive carrier <b>402</b>, an orientation element <b>408</b>, two locking elements <b>410</b>, and a cavity <b>412</b>. As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the locking elements <b>410</b> are oriented about perpendicular to the orientation element <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the example EMR shield <b>400</b> is disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> as including the conductive foam <b>404</b>, it is understood that the conductive carrier <b>402</b> may also be effective at shielding EMR without the conductive foam <b>404</b>. Thus, the conductive carrier <b>202</b> may or may not be employed in connection with the conductive foam <b>404</b>, as disclosed in the alternative embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, an alternative EMR shield <b>400</b>&#x2032; is disclosed which includes the conductive carrier <b>402</b> and not the conductive foam <b>404</b>. As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, each extended element <b>406</b> of the conductive carrier <b>402</b> is configured to bias against the shell <b>202</b> in order to create a physical and electrical contact between the conductive carrier <b>402</b> and the shell <b>202</b>. As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the orientation element <b>408</b> is configured to engage a corresponding structure <b>212</b> in the shell <b>202</b> in order to correctly orient the conductive carrier <b>402</b> with respect to the shell <b>202</b>. As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, each locking element <b>410</b> is configured to engage two corresponding locking structures <b>214</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) defined in the shell <b>202</b> in order to properly position the conductive carrier <b>402</b> around the shell <b>202</b>. As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the cavity <b>412</b> is sized and configured to receive the conductive foam <b>404</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>) and have the conductive foam <b>404</b> at least partially positioned therein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the conductive <b>404</b> foam can be attached to the conductive carrier <b>402</b> within the cavity <b>412</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>) using a conductive adhesive, such as the electrically conductive adhesive <b>3</b>M <b>9712</b> for example. Thus, the relatively sturdy conductive carrier <b>402</b> can help to support, position, and reduce damage to the relatively flexible conductive foam <b>404</b>, both during assembly of the transceiver module <b>200</b> and during insertion and extraction of the transceiver module <b>200</b> from the cage <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the conductive foam <b>404</b> is also sized and configured to surround the shell <b>202</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The conductive foam may also define an orientation structure <b>414</b> corresponding to the orientation element <b>408</b> of the conductive carrier <b>402</b>. The conductive foam <b>404</b> is formed from a conductive material that is generally effective and shielding EMR. For example, the conductive foam <b>404</b> may be formed from silicone and filled with nickel and graphite. In one example embodiment, the conductive foam <b>404</b> may be formed from TennVac S-3311.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">2. Example EMR Shield Function</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 6A</figref>, before the transceiver module <b>200</b> is inserted into the cage <b>300</b> of the host device (not shown), the conductive carrier <b>402</b> is in physical and electrical contact with the shell <b>202</b> of the transceiver module and the conductive foam <b>404</b> is attached to, supported by, and in electrical contact with the conductive carrier <b>402</b>. Then, as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 6B</figref>, once the transceiver module <b>200</b> is inserted into the cage <b>300</b> of the host device (not shown), the conductive carrier <b>402</b> remains in physical and electrical contact with the shell <b>202</b> of the transceiver module and the conductive foam <b>404</b> remains attached to, supported by, and in electrical contact with the conductive carrier <b>402</b>, but the conductive foam <b>404</b> also comes into physical and electrical contact with an edge <b>302</b> of the opening <b>304</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in the cage <b>300</b>, thus creating a seal that reduces or prevents EMR from emitting out of the opening <b>304</b>, thus reducing or preventing EMI in surrounding devices</p>
