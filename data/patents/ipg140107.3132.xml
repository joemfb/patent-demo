<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD AND BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention concerns a system for controlling photomultiplier gain drift and a method for controlling photomultiplier gain drift.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention applies to the stabilisation of the gain of a photomultiplier used for spectrometry measurements or photon counting measurements in the fields of nuclear measurement and medical measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention also applies to the stabilisation of the neutron measurement systems using photomultipliers and also to the stabilisation of the gain of photomultipliers used in optical spectroscopy applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A photomultiplier is a device allowing photons to be detected. It takes the form of an electronic tube. Under the action of light electrons are torn away from a bi-alkali-metal by a photoelectric effect from a photocathode, and the weak electrical current generated in this manner is amplified by a series of dynodes using the phenomenon of secondary transmission to obtain a substantial gain. Such a detector enables the photons to be counted individually.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows a traditional photomultiplier. It consists of a glass vacuum tube <b>100</b> containing a photocathode <b>110</b>, a focusing electrode <b>115</b>, and &#x201c;electron multiplier&#x201d; consisting of a set of electrodes <b>120</b>, called dynodes, and an anode <b>130</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, moving from left to right of the figure, each dynode is maintained at a potential value higher than the previous one. A photocathode is a material capable of converting electron radiation by secondary emission. The photomultiplier is coupled to a scintillator <b>140</b>. A scintillator is a material which emits light photons after absorbing radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The photomultiplier operates as will be described below. The scintillator <b>140</b> is illuminated, i.e. subject to radiation. Under the effect of this radiation the atoms of the material constituting the scintillator are &#x201c;excited&#x201d;, i.e. the electrons move to a higher energy level. Incident photons <b>150</b> strike the material constituting the photocathode, the latter forms a fine layer deposited on the input window of the device. Electrons <b>117</b> are then produced by photoelectric effect. The electrons <b>117</b> are directed to the electron multiplier by the focusing electrode <b>115</b>. The electrons <b>117</b> leave the photocathode with an energy equal to that of the incident photon, minus the operating energy of the photocathode <b>110</b>. The electrons <b>117</b> are accelerated by the electric field and arrive at the first dynode with much higher energy, for example a few hundreds of electronvolts. When the electrons touch the dynode they cause a mechanism called secondary emission. An electron which arrives in this manner with an energy level of several hundred electronvolts generates several tens of electrons of a much lower energy level which, due to the difference of potential which exists between the first dynode and the second dynode, accelerate towards the second dynode, causing once again the same mechanism. By repeating this mechanism along the different stages of the dynode it is then possible to obtain, from the first 4 or 5 electrons emitted by the photocathode, several million electrons or more.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The structure of the sequence of dynodes is such that the number of electrons emitted constantly increases at each stage of the cascade. Finally, anode <b>130</b> is reached and the variation of charges generated in this manner over time creates a current pulse which marks the arrival of a photon at the cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>represents a histogram illustrating the relationship between the useful signal and the noise in a photomultiplier. Axis x is the axis of the amplitudes of the pulses delivered by the photomultiplier and axis y is the axis of the quantity of pulses which are associated with the amplitudes of the pulses. Graph C<b>1</b> represents the noise of the photomultiplier, and graph C<b>2</b> represents the signal consisting of the useful signal and the noise signal. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, it can be seen that there is a pertinent difference between the derivative of the graph comprising only the noise and the graph comprising the noise and the useful signal. This difference indicates the drift of the photomultiplier.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Photomultipliers are found very widely in measuring devices in the nuclear field and the medical field. The general characteristics of a photomultiplier make it a very efficient tool in terms of light/electrons conversion efficiency. However, intrinsically, photomultipliers have drifts relating to their intrinsic operation (temperature and ageing problems). These drifts are generally reflected by a change in the photomultiplier's general gain. Gain is the fundamental parameter describing the overall efficiency of the photomultiplier.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There are several known methods to stabilise the gain of a photomultiplier</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Glenn F Knoll describes, in &#x201c;Radiation Detection and Measurement&#x201d; (ISBN 0-47-07338-5; John Willey &#x26; Sons, Inc) a system which uses an alpha emitting source installed within the scintillating material itself. The advantage of this method lies in the fact that the stabilisation is accomplished in relation to a radioactive-type measurement which, normally, is representative of that which is measured by the photomultiplier during its operation. A first disadvantage of such a system lies in the fact that the scintillating material ages significantly due to its being permanently exposed to the radiation and, as a consequence, the conversion efficiency between the energy deposited by the radiation and the quantity of light emitted by the scintillating material varies as the unit ages. Consequently, the peak monitoring generally made no longer enables the photomultiplier's gain to be corrected nominally. A second disadvantage is that, during low-level measurement, the fact of having a source present in the scintillator adds a background noise contribution which impairs the overall quality of the measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Document U.S. Pat. No. 5,548,111 &#x201c;Photomultiplier Having Gain Stabilisation Means&#x201d; by Nurmi et al. describes a system which uses an LED electroluminescent diode in direct or pulsed mode to stabilise the photomultiplier's gain, in which the signal is detected at the cathode and at the anode. The gain is stabilised taking the quotient of the two signals at a constant value. The advantage of such a system is that, in this case, a non-radioactive system is used. A first disadvantage lies in the fact that the wavelength emitted by the LED is limited to a certain wavelength, and does not therefore enable the entire wavelength range to be covered. In addition, the temporal distribution corresponding to the emission of the scintillator is very different from that of the LED. A second disadvantage is that the coupling between the LED and the photomultiplier and the scintillator may pose problems of usage since this makes the construction more complex by adding elements. A third disadvantage lies in the fact that the quantity of photons emitted by the LED is not equal to that which is emitted by a scintillator. As an active system the LED is therefore itself subject to drifts which must be corrected. There is therefore a gain drift correction system which must itself be corrected and stabilised in terms of temperature, which undermines simplicity of use, and increases the sources of errors.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The system for controlling photomultiplier gain drift of the invention does not have the disadvantages mentioned above.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">CERTAIN INVENTIVE ASPECTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Indeed, one aspect of the invention concerns a system for controlling photomultiplier gain drift, where the system includes:

    </ul>

<p id="p-0017" num="0020">Another aspect relates to a method that stabilizes the gain of a photomultiplier by using properties intrinsic to the photomultiplier. The method of stabilisation according to the invention is advantageously based on the correlation existing between the noise internal to the photomultiplier and the gain of the photomultiplier.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0034">A scintillator <b>1</b> has an output connected to the input of a photomultiplier <b>2</b> the output of which is connected, firstly, to a first integrator <b>35</b> including an amplifier <b>5</b> connected in parallel to a condenser <b>25</b> and to a first switch <b>27</b> and, secondly, to a discriminator <b>6</b>. In a particular embodiment (a case in which the photomultiplier does not output a signal of sufficiently high level) a preamplifier <b>4</b> is installed at the output of the photomultiplier such that it is then the output of the preamplifier <b>4</b> which is connected to the first integrator <b>35</b> and to the discriminator <b>6</b>. The discriminator <b>6</b> drives the first switch <b>27</b> and a second switch <b>7</b>, the input of which is connected to the output of the first integrator <b>35</b>, and the output of which is connected to the input of a filter <b>8</b>. The output of the filter <b>8</b> is connected to a first input of a second integrator <b>9</b>. An example of an integrator which can be used in this embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and will be described in due course. A reference voltage <b>10</b> is connected to a second input of the second integrator <b>9</b>. The second integrator <b>9</b> has its output connected to the input of an adjustable high-voltage device <b>3</b> which is known in the art and the output of which is connected to a voltage control input of the photomultiplier <b>2</b>. The function of device <b>3</b> is to provide the photomultiplier <b>2</b> with a high voltage in accordance with the signal emitted at the output of the second integrator <b>9</b> and, as a consequence, to adjust the total gain of the photomultiplier by altering the high voltage and the various dynodes of the tube in accordance with the result of the signal analysis by the previously described system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>represents various signals <b>1</b><i>s</i>-<b>7</b><i>s </i>which are processed in a device in accordance with the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">In operation, when the photomultiplier is activated, a first signal <b>1</b><i>s</i>, comprising the useful signal Su emitted from the scintillator <b>1</b> and the noise signal Sb originating from the photomultiplier, is transmitted simultaneously at the input of the first integrator <b>35</b> and at the input of the discriminator <b>6</b>. The discriminator <b>6</b> measures, in a manner known per se, the amplitude and duration of the pulses output from the photomultiplier. The discriminator <b>6</b> can be activated either by means of a clock signal predefined by the user (not represented in the figure), or by means of the photomultiplier output signal. The discriminator <b>6</b> simultaneously sends a logic signal <b>3</b><i>s </i>to the first switch <b>27</b> belonging to the integrator <b>35</b>, and a logic signal <b>4</b><i>s </i>to the second switch <b>7</b>. The function of the logic signal <b>3</b><i>s </i>is to close the first switch <b>27</b> (activation of the first integrator <b>35</b>), and the function of the logic signal <b>4</b><i>s </i>is to close the second electronic switch <b>7</b>. The first integrator <b>35</b> integrates the noise pulses in order to obtain the area of each pulse, i.e. in order to obtain the energy of each noise signal. According to the integration operation, the first switch <b>35</b> sends an integrated output signal <b>2</b><i>s </i>to the second electronic switch <b>7</b>. The amplitude of the signal <b>2</b><i>s </i>is then proportional to the energy of the noise signals. When the second electronic switch <b>7</b> is in the on-state, a fifth analog signal <b>5</b><i>s </i>originating from the first integrator is sent to the filter <b>8</b>. The filter <b>8</b> determines the amplitudes of the signal <b>5</b><i>s </i>originating from the first integrator <b>5</b> and sends a sixth filtered signal <b>6</b><i>s </i>to the second integrator <b>9</b>. The sixth signal <b>6</b><i>s </i>is dependent on the amplitude. The sixth signal <b>6</b><i>s </i>can be analog or digital. The second integrator <b>9</b> integrates the difference between the signal <b>6</b><i>s </i>and the reference voltage <b>10</b>, where the sixth signal <b>6</b><i>s </i>depends on the photomultiplier's intrinsic noise. Integrator <b>9</b> compares the amplitude of the sixth signal <b>6</b><i>s </i>with the reference voltage <b>10</b>. Depending on the result of this comparison, the integrator <b>9</b> integrates the difference between its two inputs and generates a seventh signal <b>7</b><i>s </i>of constant value. The seventh signal <b>7</b><i>s </i>is provided at the input of device <b>3</b> and its function is to indicate to device <b>3</b> the voltage to be applied to the control of photomultiplier <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">The drift of the photomultiplier is stabilised by controlling the intrinsic noise Sb of the photomultiplier <b>2</b>. In a first step, the noise Sb is separated from the useful signal Su. In a second step the intrinsic noise of the photomultiplier is measured. After this, in a third step, this noise is stabilised at a constant value.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a variant of the first embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">This variant differs from the embodiment of the invention represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>by the presence of an optical pulse stretcher <b>11</b> located between the scintillator <b>1</b> and the photomultiplier <b>2</b>. The output of the scintillator <b>1</b> is connected to the input of the optical stretcher <b>11</b>, the output of which is connected to the input of the photomultiplier <b>2</b>. The optical stretcher <b>11</b> includes a material suitable for temporally stretching the light pulses emitted by the scintillator. The presence of an optical stretcher is necessary in the case of very fast scintillating material, the temporal performance of which leads to useful signal shapes comparable to the noise signals. The optical stretcher then causes a modification of the temporal distribution of the photons which facilitates the separation of the useful light pulse and of the noise signals.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represents a system for controlling photomultiplier gain drift according to a second embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">The output of the scintillator <b>1</b> is connected to the input of the photomultiplier <b>2</b> the output of which is connected to the input of an amplitude spectrometer <b>31</b>, which is also connected to a first input of an integrator <b>9</b>, a second input of which is connected to a reference voltage <b>10</b>. As above, in a particular embodiment in which the photomultiplier does not emit a signal of a sufficiently high level, a preamplifier <b>4</b> is placed between the output of the photomultiplier and the input of the spectrometer <b>31</b>. The integrator <b>9</b> has its output connected to the input of an adjustable high-voltage device <b>3</b> the output of which is connected to a voltage control input of the photomultiplier <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">In operation, when the photomultiplier is activated, a first signal is sent from the photomultiplier <b>2</b> to the amplitude spectrometer <b>31</b>. The analysis of the spectrum by the amplitude spectrometer <b>31</b> in the region of the low amplitudes (region of the noise pulses, cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>), consists, through a calculation of decrease of the observed spectrum, in splitting the distribution of the amplitudes. Given that the amplitude decrease of the spectrum in this region depends on the distribution of the amplitudes of the noise signals generated by the photomultiplier, and that the distribution of the noise signals' amplitudes also depends on the gain of the photomultiplier <b>2</b>, stabilising the decrease in this region enables the photomultiplier's gain to be stabilised. After analysis of the spectrum in the low-amplitude region, the spectrometer <b>31</b> sends a sixth signal <b>6</b><i>s</i>, either digital or analog, having a voltage proportional to the decrease in the noise region, to the integrator <b>9</b>. The remainder of the circuit operates as described above, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> represents a system for controlling photomultiplier gain drift according to a third embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">The output of the scintillator <b>1</b> is connected to an input of an optical switch of the Kerr effect cell type <b>12</b>, one output of which is connected to the input of the photomultiplier <b>2</b>. The output of the photomultiplier <b>2</b> is connected to an input of a switch <b>14</b>. As mentioned above, if the signal emitted by the photomultiplier is insufficient, a preamplifier <b>4</b> is placed in series between the output of the photomultiplier and the input of the switch. Switch <b>14</b> has two outputs, of which a first output is connected to an input of a measurement chain <b>13</b>, and a second output of which is connected to an input of a filter <b>8</b>. An output of a clock <b>15</b> is connected, firstly, to a high-voltage adjustment unit <b>16</b> of the Kerr cell and, secondly, to the control input of the switch <b>14</b>. The purpose of the clock signal transmitted from the clock <b>15</b> to the switch <b>14</b> is to control the frequency of the link between, firstly, the photomultiplier and the measuring chain <b>13</b> and, secondly, the photomultiplier and the filter <b>8</b>. The output of the unit <b>16</b> is connected to a control input of the Kerr effect cell <b>12</b>.

When a pulse arrives at switch <b>14</b>, a signal <b>10</b><i>s </i>consisting solely of the noise pulses Sb which are emitted by the photomultiplier <b>2</b> is sent to the filter <b>8</b>.
