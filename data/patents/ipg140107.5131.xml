<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and an apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention includes a controller to process a criterion for selecting a point-of-interest (POI). The criterion can be based on historical trip data. Data related to a POI, including a community-of-interest rating, for example, can be accessed through a satellite and terrestrial mobile communication network. Multiple POIs can be graphically represented for user selection based on the criterion and/or other data. Once a POI is selected, data related to the selected POI, including navigation data, can be displayed. In another embodiment, the controller can access navigation data to a specified destination. The navigation data can be based on historical trip data such as route segments and destination areas. The navigation data can be accessed from an in-vehicle system or from a navigation service provider and can be displayed to assist a user in reaching the specified destination.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/042,204 entitled &#x201c;Method and System for Integrated Satellite Assistance Services&#x201d;, filed concurrently herewith. The above-identified U.S. patent application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to navigation and more particularly to devices providing interactive navigation services based on historical driving information and methods for using such devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A hybrid satellite and terrestrial communication system, such as a Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) system with an Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC), for example, can provide a more efficient spectrum utilization and a more effective coverage in rural and urban areas than can be provided by stand-alone mobile satellite systems. For that reason, existing MSS/ATC systems have been typically used to provide voice communication services that cover a wide geographic coverage. Using existing MSS/ATC systems to make available other types of services, however, poses many implementation challenges. For instance, to support mobile interactive services, an MSS/ATC system design may need to effectively handle multicast transmissions across both satellite networks and ancillary terrestrial networks along with interactive communications with individual users. A properly designed MSS/ATC system can support one or more mobile interactive services, including mobile or in-vehicle navigation services, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a typical in-vehicle system that supports navigation services, travel directions to a destination point or location can be obtained by a search process that uses information stored in the vehicle and/or information received from a navigation service provider through a cellular network, for example. In some instances, a user can specify travel or routing preferences in the navigation service search criteria. A user can specify, for example, a preference for the fastest travel time, for the shortest travel distance, and/or for routes that include highways over routes that include country or rural roads. The navigation service search criteria, however, can be limited by the navigation system and/or by the network that supports the system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Improvements in mobile or in-vehicle navigation services are desirable to a broad range of users. Thus, a need exists for interactive services and/or devices that use satellite and terrestrial communication systems to offer users wide geographic coverage and a more flexible, effective, and/or feature-rich navigation and guidance experience.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A apparatus includes a controller to process one or more criterion for selecting a point-of-interest (POI). The criterion can be based on historical trip data. Data related to a POI, including a community-of-interest (COI) rating, for example, can be accessed through a satellite and terrestrial mobile communication network. Multiple POIs can be graphically represented for user selection based on the criterion and/or on other data. Once a POI is selected, data related to the selected POI, including navigation data, can be displayed. In another embodiment, the controller can access navigation data to a specified destination. The navigation data can be based on historical trip data such as route segments and destination areas. The navigation data can be accessed from a mobile or in-vehicle system or through the satellite and terrestrial mobile communication network from a navigation service provider and can be displayed to assist a user in reaching the specified destination.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The devices and methods described herein are generally related to mobile or in-vehicle interactive navigation services. For example, the devices and methods are suitable for use in a hybrid satellite and terrestrial (satellite/terrestrial) communication system, such as a Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) system with an Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC). An example of such a hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication system is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/797,048 to Zufall et, al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. An MSS MSS/ATC system can use one or more satellites to support a wide geographic coverage of mobile satellite interactive services. For example, a portion of the 2 GHz spectrum allocated for MSS satellite communications can be used to provide effective service coverage to rural and remote areas. Along with the MSS network, the land-based ATC network can facilitate service penetration in urban and suburban areas through effective satellite and terrestrial frequency reuse.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The mobile interactive satellite services described herein can be used to provide navigation, guidance, and/or additional information such that a user can travel from a current location to a specified or preferred destination. The destination can be a specified address, the name of a place or location, and/or a destination category, for example. In some instances, the destination can be a point-of-interest (POI), such as a restaurant, store, or entertainment venue, for example, which can be selected from multiple POIs within a specified destination category. The selection of a POI can be based, at least partially, on historical information collected during previously conducted trips, on other navigation information related to the POIs, and/or on a community-of-interest (COI) rating for the POIs, for example. Information related to the multiple POIs can be graphically or visually represented to facilitate the destination selection process. Moreover, navigation, guidance, and/or other information related to a specified or selected destination can be displayed to assist the user in reaching the destination.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is noted that, as used in this written description and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, the term &#x201c;a route segment&#x201d; is intended to mean a single segment or a combination of segments. Similarly, the term &#x201c;a destination area&#x201d; is intended to mean, for example, a single destination area or more than one destination areas.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a schematic representation of a satellite and terrestrial mobile communication network, according to an embodiment of the invention. A hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> can be configured to provide mobile interactive satellite services, such as interactive navigation services, for example. The hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> can include a first satellite <b>110</b>, terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and/or <b>154</b>, a first ground station <b>120</b>, and a network <b>130</b>. In some instances, the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> can have a second satellite <b>111</b> and/or a second ground station <b>121</b> to support other mobile interactive satellite services, such as mobile video services that provide satellite television multicasting, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first satellite <b>110</b> can be configured to communicate with the first ground station <b>120</b> through one or more signals in a connection or communication path <b>170</b> that includes, for example, uplink signals and downlink signals. The uplink signals can be used to communicate information or data from the first ground station <b>120</b> to the first satellite <b>110</b>. The uplink-communicated information can include a multicast portion or component (e.g., video, music, traffic reports, radio) and/or an interactive component (e.g., navigation data, travel assistance data). The downlink signals can be used to communicate data, such as interactive data (e.g., requests for navigation services, requests for travel assistance services), from the first satellite <b>110</b> to the first ground station <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first ground station <b>120</b> can be configured to process at least a portion of the data or information related to an interactive service that can be supported by the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b>. In this regard, the first ground station <b>120</b> can be configured to process multicast, interactive, and/or control data for communication with the first satellite <b>110</b>. In one example, the first ground station <b>120</b> can generate ground-based beam-forming (GBBF) information that is communicated to the first satellite <b>110</b> via the communication path <b>170</b>. The GBBF information can be used to configure a transmission antenna, such as an antenna array, for example, which can be used by the first satellite <b>110</b> to generate an appropriate number of beam spots and beam spot locations, and/or appropriate beam spot shapes to effectively communicate with a mobile interactive services system, such as one that can be used in the vehicle <b>140</b>, and/or with terrestrial antennas <b>150</b> and <b>152</b>. The GBBF information can be dynamically modified to adjust communication operations, including spectrum bandwidth and/or geographic coverage, for example, between the first satellite <b>110</b> and users of mobile interactive satellite services. In emergency situations, such as during a natural disaster, for example, GBBF information can be processed in a manner such that priority in spectrum bandwidth and/or geographic coverage can be given to affected areas.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first satellite <b>110</b> can be configured to communicate with a mobile interactive services system through one or more signals in a connection or communication path <b>172</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first satellite <b>110</b> can communicate with a mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b>. The communication path <b>172</b> can include a downlink signals through which the first satellite <b>110</b> can wirelessly transmit multicast and/or interactive data to the mobile interactive services system and an uplink signals to wirelessly transmit interactive data from the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> to the first satellite <b>110</b>. In this regard, a user can request data, such as travel assistance data, data related to a specific destination, and/or data related to a destination or assistance category of interest, for example, through one or more mobile interactive satellite services supported though the uplink signals in the communication path <b>172</b>. Moreover, a mobile interactive services system can communicate with a service provider (e.g., navigation service provider, travel assistance service provider, a travel assistance service center) through the downlink and uplink signals in the communication path <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the first satellite <b>110</b> can be configured to communicate with terrestrial antennas <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> using one or more signals through communication paths <b>174</b> and <b>176</b>, respectively. For instance, communication paths <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> can each include a downlink path from the first satellite <b>110</b> to the terrestrial antennas <b>150</b> and <b>152</b>, respectively. Each of the downlink paths can support multicast and/or interactive data communication to the terrestrial antenna. In one example, the terrestrial antenna <b>150</b> can be configured to further communicate multicast and/or interactive data received from the first satellite <b>110</b> to a mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> through a downlink path in a communication path <b>178</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, however, terrestrial antenna <b>150</b> may not be configured to receive interactive data from the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> (e.g., communication path <b>178</b> may not support uplink signals to terrestrial antenna <b>150</b>). In another example, terrestrial antenna <b>152</b> can be configured to further communicate multicast and/or interactive data received from the first satellite <b>110</b> to a mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> through a downlink path in a communication path <b>182</b>. Along with the downlink path, communication path <b>182</b> can have an uplink path that can support transmission of signals that include interactive data from the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> to the terrestrial antenna <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The ground station <b>120</b> can be configured to communicate with terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>154</b> through a network <b>130</b>. In this regard, land-based communication of multicast and/or interactive data can occur through terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>154</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>154</b> can be configured to communicate multicast and/or interactive data via at least one of communication paths <b>178</b>, <b>182</b>, and <b>180</b>, respectively, with a mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b>. Terrestrial antennas <b>152</b> and <b>154</b>, for example, can be configured for bi-directional communication and can receive interactive data from the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> through uplink paths in communication paths <b>182</b> and <b>180</b>, respectively. Terrestrial antennas <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> can be configured to communicate interactive data received from the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> to the ground station <b>120</b> through the network <b>130</b> for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The network <b>130</b> can include at least a portion of, for example, a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a packet-switched network, a satellite network, and/or a wireless network. The packet-switched network can be a multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) network that can carry different kinds of traffic such as Internet protocol (IP) packets, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) frames, synchronous optical network (SONET) frames, and/or Ethernet frames, for example. The ground station <b>120</b> can be configured to communicate with the network <b>130</b> through a network connection or communication path <b>162</b>. Terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>154</b> can communicate with the network <b>130</b> through a network connection or communication path <b>160</b>. Communication paths <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> can include, in some instances, a broadband and/or long-haul optical fiber connection.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Other embodiments of the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> can include a number of ground stations, terrestrial antennas, and/or satellites that can be different from those of the different embodiments described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Moreover, other embodiments of the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> can support multiple devices that, like the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b>, can be configured to communicate with the first satellite <b>110</b> and with the terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and/or <b>154</b>. For example, handheld devices, laptops, and/or in-vehicle systems can be configured to receive and/or transmit data related to mobile interactive satellite services through an embodiment of the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> are block diagrams of a mobile interactive services system for satellite and terrestrial communication, according to embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a schematic representation of an mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> that can be configured to provide mobile interactive satellite services. In some instances, the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> can be an in-vehicle system (i.e., can operate within and/or coupled to the vehicle, for example). The mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> can include a controller module <b>210</b>, a modem module <b>220</b>, and/or a media server module <b>230</b>. In some instances, the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> can include one or more passenger device modules <b>240</b><sub>0</sub>, . . . , <b>240</b><sub>N</sub>. The controller module <b>210</b>, the modem module <b>220</b>, the media server module <b>230</b>, and the passenger device modules <b>240</b><sub>0</sub>, . . . , <b>240</b><sub>N </sub>can be software-based (e.g., set of instructions executable at a processor, software code) and/or hardware-based (e.g., circuit system, processor, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), field programmable gate array (FPGA)). In some embodiments, the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> can be configured to communicate with a vehicle communication network, such as, for example, a controller area network (CAN), an on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II), a media-oriented system transport (MOST), or other like vehicle communication networks.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The controller module <b>210</b> can be configured to process and/or display data such as data received from other modules or components of the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b>, data that is provided as input from a user, and/or data received from a vehicle communication network or bus. For instance, the controller module <b>210</b> can receive, process, and/or display multicast and/or interactive data that is received via the modem module <b>220</b>. In some instances, the controller module <b>210</b> can receive, process, and/or display data (e.g., video, audio, navigation, and/or travel assistance data) stored in the media server module <b>230</b>. The data processing provided by the controller module <b>210</b> can include processing that supports mobile interactive satellite services such as mobile interactive navigation services, for example. The controller module <b>210</b> can be configured to store data before, during, and/or after processing.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the controller module <b>210</b> can be configured to collect and/or process historical trip data from one or more previous trips. In other embodiments, the controller module <b>210</b> can process historical trip data for transmission to a service provider or service center that may further process the historical trip data to generate, for example, navigation and/or travel assistance data. The navigation data generated from the processed historical trip data can be subsequently received by the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b>. Historical trip data can include, for example, departure time and/or location, arrival time and/or location, road or route segments traveled, travel time, travel distance, time of departure, and/or date (day, week, month, and/or year) of travel. In some embodiments, historical trip data can include navigation data or guidance data that may have been received from a navigation service provider for consideration by a user during a previously occurring trip.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An example of historical trip data processing can include determining which trips are routine or regularly occurring trips. In one embodiment, routinely occurring trips can be determined by generating statistical information which may be compared to specified thresholds to determine when a certain trip (e.g., weekday morning commute to work) occurs routinely. A road or route segment traveled during a routine trip can be referred to as a routine route segment and a destination location or destination area arrived to during a routine trip can be referred to as a routine destination location or a routine destination area, respectively, for example. In other embodiments, a user of the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> may indicate to the system that a trip is a routine trip.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The controller module <b>210</b> can be configured to communicate data to other components of the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b>. For example, the controller module <b>210</b> can communicate user input data, such as interactive data, to the modem module <b>220</b>. Moreover, the controller module <b>210</b> can be configured to control at least a portion of the operation of other components of the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b>. The controller module <b>210</b> can control, for example, the providing of video, audio, and/or other data to the passenger device modules <b>240</b><sub>0</sub>, . . . , <b>240</b><sub>N</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The modem module <b>220</b> can be configured to communicate with a network such as the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this regard, the modem module <b>220</b> can support multiple wireless and/or satellite communication or networking protocols, including multiple cellular communication protocols, for example. For mobile video services, for example, the modem module <b>220</b> can support one or more satellite communication protocols, such as digital video broadcasting satellite services to handhelds (DVB-SH) or DVB second generation (DVB-S2). The modem module <b>220</b> can communicate with cellular networks such as global system for mobile communications (GSM) or code-division multiple access (CDMA) networks, for example. Moreover, the modem module <b>220</b> can be configured to support wireless side-loading operations, such as content loading from a local area network (LAN), through multiple wireless interfaces, including WiMax IEEE 802.16 interface and/or WiFi IEEE 802.11 interface, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The media server module <b>230</b> can be configured to store multimedia data (e.g., video, audio, navigation, and/or travel assistance data). The multimedia data can be stored in, for example, integrated circuit (IC) memory, compact discs (CDs), digital video discs (DVDs), and other like machine-readable storage medium. In some instances, the media server module <b>230</b> can receive multimedia data for storage from the modem module <b>220</b>. In this regard, the media server module <b>230</b> can operate as a digital video recorder (DVR), for example. In a DVR, multimedia data (e.g., current satellite video channel programming) can be received and stored while stored multimedia data (e.g., previously stored satellite video channel programming) can be accessed for further processing. The media server module <b>230</b> can communicate stored multimedia data to the controller module <b>210</b>, which may process and/or display the multimedia data. For instance, the controller module <b>210</b> can display video data, audio data, instructional information, travel assistance information, navigation maps, guidance information, travel directions, information related to specified destinations and/or destinations within destination categories, personal and/or community ratings of places, and/or other information that may be stored in the media server module <b>230</b>. Moreover, the controller module <b>210</b> may communicate at least a portion of the multimedia data received from the media server module <b>230</b> to one or more of the passenger device modules <b>240</b><sub>0</sub>, . . . , <b>240</b><sub>N </sub>for display.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The passenger device modules <b>240</b><sub>0</sub>, . . . , <b>240</b><sub>N </sub>can be configured to process and/or display data received from the controller module <b>210</b>. For example the passenger device modules <b>240</b><sub>0</sub>, . . . , <b>240</b><sub>N </sub>can be configured to play movies, music, radio programming, video games, and/or other applications.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The modules or components of the mobile interactive services system <b>300</b> can be software-based (e.g., set of instructions executable at a processor, software code) and/or hardware-based (e.g., circuit system, processor, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), field programmable gate array (FPGA)). The RF front-end modules <b>302</b><sub>0</sub>, . . . , <b>302</b><sub>M</sub>, for example, can be configured to process RF signals. In this regard, an RF front-end module can operate as a transmitter (i.e., processes signals for wireless transmission) and/or as a receiver (i.e., processes wirelessly-received signals). An RF front-end module can be configured to perform multiple signal processing operations, including, but not limited to, amplification, filtering, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), de-modulation, modulation, digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), and/or mixing, for example. Thus, an RF front-end module can convert received RF signals to an appropriate baseband frequency for further processing and/or convert baseband frequency signals to appropriate RF signals for wireless transmission. An RF front-end module can process signals according to one or more terrestrial (e.g., land-based) and/or satellite RF communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The baseband processing modules <b>304</b><sub>0</sub>, . . . , <b>304</b><sub>M </sub>can be configured to perform digital signal processing operations on data received from an RF front-end module, from the processing module <b>312</b>, and/or from the memory module <b>306</b>, for example. A baseband processing module can communicate processed data to an RF front-end module for wireless transmission or to another module of the mobile interactive services system <b>300</b> for further processing. In one example, video content from a video interactive service can be received and processed by a baseband processing module and can be communicated to the multimedia processing module <b>308</b> for further processing. In another example, navigation or navigation-related data can be received and processed by a baseband processing module and can be communicated to the processing module <b>312</b> for further processing and/or to the memory module <b>306</b> for storage. A baseband processing module can process data according to one or more terrestrial and/or satellite RF communication protocols.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The multimedia processing module <b>308</b> can be configured to digitally process multimedia data (e.g., video, audio, and/or content data). For example, video data can be decoded and/or encoded at the multimedia processing module <b>308</b> according to the appropriate video coding standard. In this regard, the multimedia processing module <b>308</b> can be configured to support more than one video, audio, and/or content data coding standard, such as the H.264 standard and the MPEG-4 standard for video coding, for example. In some instances, the processing module <b>312</b> can provide at least a portion of the multimedia data processing operations supported by the mobile interactive services system <b>300</b>. For example, the multimedia processing module <b>308</b> can be optimized for video data processing operations and the processing module <b>312</b> can be used to provide audio and/or content data processing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The processing module <b>312</b> can be configured to provide operations for mobile interactive satellite services, including mobile interactive navigation services and/or mobile interactive travel assistance services.

In this regard, the interface module <b>314</b> can use different bus protocols to communicate, for example, audio, video, content, and/or graphical data between the processing module <b>312</b> and one or more modules. For example, in mobile interactive navigation services, a controller module, such as the controller <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, can include the display module <b>318</b>, the audio module <b>320</b>, and/or the I/O module <b>322</b> for providing a user interface (UI) to receive and/or provide navigation data.

In some embodiments, the display screen <b>404</b> can be a touch-screen display, for example, which can be used to enter data, such as alphanumeric data and/or selection data. The data entered through a touch-screen display can be subsequently processed by a mobile interactive services system to provide appropriate operations for mobile interactive satellite services. In some instances, certain operations and/or selections can be activated by touching an icon or other graphical or visual representation displayed on the screen. In other instances, certain operations and/or selections can be activated by gesturing and/or writing on the touch-screen display.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> depicts a front view of a module <b>402</b> that can include the display screen <b>404</b>. Along with the display screen <b>404</b>, the module <b>402</b> can include one or more controls <b>406</b> (e.g., buttons) that can be used to enter data, such as alphanumeric data and/or selection data. For example, one or more of the controls <b>406</b> can be used as soft buttons that provide a different set of selection options. In another example, one or more of the controls <b>406</b> can be used as hard buttons that provide a fixed set of selection options, such as setting the module to an ON or OFF state. The controllers or passenger devices described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> can detect selections made by a user through the user interface provided by the display screen <b>404</b> and/or the controls <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The modules <b>400</b> and <b>402</b> can include audio and/or visual components (not shown) that can be used to input and/or output data.

In yet another example, a camera (not shown) can be included to detect user motions, gestures, and/or signals that can correspond to a data entry operation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, controllers in a mobile interactive services system can be used to provide a user interface for mobile interactive satellite services that can be supported through a network such as the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b>. Navigation services, for example, can use the interactive aspect of the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> to offer users a wide geographic coverage and a more flexible, effective, and/or feature-rich navigation and guidance experience.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic representation of a navigation map, including routine trip data, according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a navigation map <b>500</b> can be a graphical representation of a geographic area or region that includes information regarding multiple locations (e.g., towns, cities, places, landmarks, addresses) and/or road information (e.g., road identification, road lanes, exit identification, road intersections and junctions, speed limits). The geographic region in the navigation map <b>500</b> can correspond to a region for which mobile interactive satellite services can be provided. In this regard, the navigation map <b>500</b> can include information that can be used by a mobile interactive navigation service to determine and/or provide navigation instructions and/or other navigation-related data.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the navigation map <b>500</b> can include multiple locations S, A, B, C, D, E, and F, multiple road or route segments, and/or multiple road or route nodes. A route segment can refer to a road or to a portion of a road between two route nodes, for example. As shown, a solid-line route segment can be associated with a large road, such as a highway, for example, and a dotted-line route segment can be associated with a local road, such as a back road or a rural road, for example. In this regard, a solid-line route segment can generally correspond to a route segment in which a driver can travel at a faster speed than when traveling through a dotted-line route segment. For example, local roads tend to have fewer lanes of traffic and have more traffic lights, both of which may tend to reduce the average travel speed. A route node can refer to an intersection or junction between two or more route segments, for example. In some instances (not shown), a route node can also refer to a location or landmark in a route segment that need not be associated with a road intersection or junction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Within the geographic area described by the navigation map <b>500</b>, multiple different trips can occur. For example, for a trip between location S and location A, route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and S<b>4</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b>, and N<b>3</b> maybe traversed. In another example, for a trip between location S and location B, route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>8</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, and N<b>2</b> may be traversed. Traveling between location S and location C, for example, may involve traversing route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>13</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b>, and N<b>7</b>. In yet another example, traveling between location A and location F may involve traversing route segments S<b>4</b>, S<b>5</b>, S<b>6</b>, S<b>13</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>16</b> and nodes N<b>3</b>, N<b>4</b>, location C, N<b>7</b>, and N<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some instances, there may be more than one possible route for a trip that involves going from a first location to a second location. For example, a first route for a trip starting at location S and having as destination location B can include traversing route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>8</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, and N<b>2</b>. A second route for a trip starting at location S and having as destination location B can include traversing route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>9</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b>, and N<b>7</b>, for example. The first and second routes can differ in multiple aspects, including total travel distance, travel time, average travel speed, route segments and/or nodes traversed, travel areas or neighborhoods, ease or comfort in traveling (e.g., highway traffic or local road traffic), and/or costs (e.g., tolls), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Differences in routes for a particular trip can result in a user of a mobile interactive services system (e.g., a driver or vehicle passenger) having a preference for one route over another route. In this regard, the user may routinely or regularly prefer to travel using a particular route for trips between specified locations. An example of a regularly occurring trip can be going from the user's home to their place of work at the beginning of a work day. Another example of a regularly occurring trip can be the return trip home at the end of the work day. In this regard, the user or driver can have a preference for one of multiple possible routes that may be available when traveling to and from work, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A regularly occurring trip can be referred to as a routine trip and the route segments traversed during the routine trip can be referred to as routine route segments, for example. As described above, a mobile interactive navigation system can be used to collect historical trip data which can be processed to determine whether a trip occurs with a sufficient degree of regularity to be a routine trip. Historical trip information that can be processed to determine whether a trip is a routine trip can include, but need not be limited to, starting and destination locations, departure time, arrival time, and/or day of travel (e.g., Monday, weekday, weekend). In some instances, the mobile interactive navigation system can process the historical trip data while in other instances the historical trip data can be communicated to a provider of navigation and/or travel assistance services for processing. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a routine trip <b>502</b> can include traveling from a location S to a destination at location C. The routine trip <b>502</b> can include a route that traverses route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>12</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b>, and N<b>7</b>. In this example, an &#x201c;R&#x201d; can be used to label routine route segments associated with the routine trip <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some instances, a user may prefer to use routine route segments when making a trip that is different from the routine trip <b>502</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to travel from location S to a destination at location B, a user can select between, for example, a first route that includes traversing route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>8</b> and route nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, and N<b>2</b>, and a second route that includes traversing route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>9</b> and route nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b>, and N<b>7</b>. In this instance, the user or driver may prefer the second route over the first route because it includes routine route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, and S<b>12</b> with which the user may be more comfortable and/or familiar, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Routine route segments can be temporally defined, that is, can be associated with a specific time of day and with specific days. In some instances, a route segment can be a routine route segment for a first trip but may not be a routine route segment for a second trip because of the time and/or day in which the second trip is occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a schematic representation of a navigation map including defined areas, according to an embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> depicts a navigation map <b>600</b> that includes the location information and road information described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Also shown are multiple areas A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, and A<b>4</b>. The areas A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, and A<b>4</b> can each have a specified or defined geographic area, however, they need not have similar areas, shapes, contours, and/or outlines. In other embodiments, the areas can have different areas, shapes, contours, and/or outlines from those described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Moreover, other embodiments can include a different number of areas than the number used in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Each of the locations S, A, B, C, D, E, and F can be located within one of the areas A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, and A<b>4</b>, for example. For example, locations S, D, and E can be located within area A<b>1</b>. In another example, locations C and F can be located within area A<b>3</b>. In some instances, such as when a location is at a boundary or interface between areas, the location may be included within more than one of the areas A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, and A<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A starting area can refer to an area or region in which the starting point of a trip is located, for example. Similarly, a destination area can refer to an area or region in which the destination of a trip is located, for example. For instance, when traveling from location S to location A, a user of a mobile interactive services system can start at location A in area A<b>1</b> and can arrive at location S in area A<b>2</b>. In this example, area A<b>1</b> is the starting area and area A<b>2</b> is the destination area. When traveling between any two locations in the navigation map <b>600</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a user or driver may travel from one area to another area or may travel within one of the areas (i.e., the starting and destination areas can be the same).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A user of a mobile interactive services system may routinely or regularly prefer to travel to a specific destination area. For example, the user's place of work, preferred supermarket, and preferred shopping mall may all be located in area A<b>3</b>. A regularly occurring destination area can be referred to as a routine destination area, for example. As described above, a mobile interactive navigation system can be used to collect historical trip data which can be processed to determine whether a particular destination area occurs with a sufficient degree of regularity to be a routine destination area.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Destination areas can be temporally defined, that is, can be associated with a specific time of day and with specific days. In some instances, a destination area can be a routine destination area for a first trip but may not be a routine destination area for a second trip because of the time and/or day in which the second trip is occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a schematic representation of a navigation map including dynamic destination areas, according to an embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> depicts a navigation map <b>650</b> that includes the location information and road information described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6A</figref>. Also shown are multiple areas B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b>, which can each be dynamically specified or defined based on, for example, historical trip data. For instance, the area, contour, shape, and/or size of each of the areas B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b> can be adjusted or modified based on statistical information that can result from the processing of historical trip data. Areas B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b> can, in some instances, overlap such that a location in the navigation map <b>650</b> can be included in more than one of areas B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b>. Moreover, as areas B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b> can dynamically change, whether a location is included within a specified area can vary over time.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, the home of a user of a mobile interactive services system can be in location S and the user may take short trips, such as for local grocery shopping, for example, to locations D and E. Thus, the geographic scope of area B<b>1</b> may be at least partially determined from historical trip data collected from trips between the user's home and local shopping in locations D and E. Changes in the user's local shopping habits can result in changes to area B<b>1</b>. In another example, the user's place of work can be in location C. The user may generally stop at locations B and F (e.g., gas station, coffee shop) when traveling to and/or from work. Thus, the geographic scope of area B<b>3</b> may be determined at least partially from historical trip data collected from trips to and/or from work. Changes in the user's travel habits to work (e.g., dropping off and/or picking up a child at daycare near location A) can result in changes to area B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, a user of a mobile interactive services system may routinely or regularly prefer to travel to a specific destination area. For example, area B<b>3</b> can be a routine destination area when the user travels to area B<b>3</b> as a destination area with a sufficient degree of regularity. In this regard, the user can have a preference for route segments located within a routine destination area when making a trip. For example, when traveling from location S in area B<b>1</b> to location B in areas B<b>2</b> and B<b>3</b>, the user can select between, for example, a first route that includes route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>8</b> and route nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, and N<b>2</b>, and a second route that includes route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>9</b> and route nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b>, and N<b>7</b>. In this instance, the user can have a preference for the second route because it includes more route segments (e.g., S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>9</b>) associated with routine destination area B<b>3</b> than the first route (e.g., S<b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic representation illustrating the selection of navigation data based on historical trip data, according to an embodiment of the invention.

In some embodiments, a mobile interactive services system, such as the mobile interactive services systems <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, respectively, can be used to collect, process, operate, display, and/or select data such as the navigation data illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The travel diagram <b>700</b> can have data that is based on collected and/or processed historical trip data, including route segment information (e.g. routine route segments) and/or travel area information (e.g., routine destination area). In some embodiments, at least a portion the navigation data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be received from a service provider (e.g., a navigation service provider) through a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The example illustrated by the travel diagram <b>700</b> includes a first route <b>702</b>, a second route <b>704</b>, and a third route <b>706</b>. Other examples can illustrate travel routes for a trip between locations S and B that are different from those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The first route <b>702</b> can correspond to, for example, a route resulting in the least amount of travel time. Because most of the route segments in the first route <b>702</b> are larger roads (solid lines), travel time for the first route <b>702</b> may be the fastest. The first route <b>702</b> can include route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, S<b>5</b>, and S<b>7</b>, of which only route segment S<b>0</b> is a routine route segment (R). The destination, location B, can be associated with areas B<b>2</b> and B<b>3</b> because it is located in an overlap region between areas B<b>2</b> and B<b>3</b>. For the first route <b>702</b>, location B is approached using route segment S<b>7</b> in area B<b>2</b>, thus location B is associated with area B<b>2</b> and not with area B<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The second route <b>704</b> can correspond to, for example, a travel route resulting in the shortest travel distance. The second route <b>704</b> can include route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>8</b>, of which only route segment S<b>0</b> is a routine route segment (R). For the second route <b>704</b>, location B is approached using route segment S<b>8</b> in area B<b>2</b>, thus location B is associated with area B<b>2</b> and not with area B<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The third route <b>706</b> can correspond to, for example, a travel route that can include multiple routine route segments (R). The third route <b>706</b> can include route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>9</b>, of which only route segment S<b>9</b> is not a routine route segment (R). For the third route <b>706</b>, location B is approached using route segment S<b>9</b> in area B<b>3</b>, thus location B is associated with area B<b>3</b>, which is a routine destination area, and not with area B<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the example illustrated by the travel diagram <b>700</b>, a user of a mobile interactive services system can have a preference for, for example, the fastest travel route, the shortest travel route distance, the travel route with the most routine route segments, the travel route to a routine destination area, and/or a combination of the above. Based on these preferences, the user may select the navigation data of one of the travel routes in the travel diagram <b>700</b>. For example, the user can prefer the third route <b>706</b> because it includes a large number of routine route segments and because location B is associated with a routine destination area. Routine route segments and routine destination areas may give the user a level of comfort, ease, and/or familiarity from previous experiences (e.g., previous trips) that can overcome, in some instances, the benefits of faster travel time and shorter travel distance provided by the first route <b>702</b> and the second route <b>704</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A user's preferences can be included in the navigation data that is provided by a navigation service through a mobile interactive services system. In some embodiments, the mobile interactive services system can process the user's preferences to generate at least a portion of the navigation data illustrated by the travel diagram <b>700</b>. In other embodiments, a navigation service provider can process the user's preferences and communicate navigation data that is based on these preferences to the mobile interactive services system through a hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The processing of a user's preferences can include providing a weight, ranking, and/or priority to multiple aspects of a trip such as, but need not limited to, travel time, travel distance, starting and/or destination location, destination area information, route segment information, traffic conditions, time of day, and/or day of travel. The weighted aspects of the trip can be combined to determine at least one criterion that can be used to select one of the multiple travel routes that are possible for a particular trip. In one example, the combination can be a linear combination while in another example the combination can be non-linear. In one embodiment, the criterion or criteria can be used to graphically represent a relative preference between multiple travel routes such that the user can select one of the travel routes. In another embodiment, the criterion or criteria can be used by a navigation service operated through a mobile interactive services system to determine a preferred travel route. The navigation data of the preferred travel route can be made available (e.g., graphically represented or displayed on a display screen) to the user through a mobile interactive services system. In some embodiments, routine route segments and/or routine destination areas may be given significant weight when determining the criterion or criteria from which to select a travel route.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some instances, the user's travel preferences, including routine route segments and/or routine destination areas, for example, can be used to adjust or modify navigation instructions or data provided by a navigation service provider. For example, the mobile interactive services system can replace a portion of a travel route provided by a navigation service provider with one or more routine route segments.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic representation of a navigation map including points-of-interest, according to an embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts a navigation map <b>800</b> that includes the location information, road information, and area information described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Also shown are multiple points-of-interest (POI), including POI <b>0</b>, POI <b>1</b>, POI <b>2</b>, POI <b>3</b>, POI <b>4</b>, and POI <b>5</b>. For instance, POI <b>0</b> is located in area B<b>1</b> near location D, POI <b>1</b> is located in area B<b>1</b> near location E, POI <b>2</b> is located in area B<b>3</b> near location F, POI <b>3</b> is located in area B<b>3</b> near location C, POI <b>4</b> is located in areas B<b>2</b> and B<b>3</b> near location B, and POI <b>5</b> is located in area B<b>2</b> near location A.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Each POI may correspond to, for example, a destination location from one or more destination categories selected by a user through a mobile interactive services system. For example, a driver can search for navigation or guidance data to a destination category such as entertainment places (e.g., restaurants, cinemas, theaters). The driver can be provided by a navigation service and through the mobile interactive services system with one or more POIs that may meet the search criteria. The navigation or travel route preferences of the user mobile interactive services system can be used to determine at least one criterion for traveling to each POI that provides a relative preference between multiple POIs. For example, the user may prefer traveling to a POI that is near a location which may result in the shortest travel time from a current location, traveling to a POI near a location which may result in using multiple routine route segments (R), traveling to a POI near a location in a routine destination area, and/or a combination of the above.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some instances, the POI data can include ratings, reviews, and/or rankings that can be provided by a community with similar inters tests to those of the user (e.g., a community-of-interest (COI)). The travel criterion or criteria can, in these instances, include information related to the COI rating. For example, when two or more POIs meet relatively similar travel preferences, the POI with the highest rating by a COI can be preferred over the others.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one embodiment, at least a portion of the data related to the POIs (e.g., travel route preferences, navigation data, name of place, location) can be graphically represented in the mobile interactive services system to assist the user in the selection process. In this regard, data related to the POIs can be graphically represented to indicate a relative preference between multiple POIs based on, for example, one or more travel criterion. In another embodiment, the travel criterion or criteria results can be used by a navigation service operated through a mobile interactive services system to determine a preferred POIs for the destination category. The navigation data of the preferred POI can be made available (e.g., graphically represented or displayed on a display screen) to the user through a mobile interactive services system. The mobile interactive services system can also make available data related to the remaining POIs upon user request. When a POI is selected or accepted by the user, the mobile interactive services system can provide data related to the POI, including navigation data.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a front view of a controller that can graphically display data related to one or more points-of-interest, according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a mobile interactive services system can include a controller <b>900</b> having a display screen <b>910</b>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The first portion <b>930</b> of the display screen <b>910</b> can be used to visually or graphically represent information related to, for example, a navigation map <b>920</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the navigation map <b>920</b> can include location information (e.g., towns, cities, addresses, names of places, landmarks) and road information as described in the examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, and <b>8</b>. The navigation map <b>920</b> can include data related to the POIs as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The second portion <b>940</b> of the display screen <b>910</b> can be used to graphically or visually represent, for example, the relative organization of the POIs that results from considering the user's travel route preferences from a starting location S. In this example, the POIs can be listed from top to bottom in order of preference. In other embodiments, different graphical representations of POI preferences can be used that may be different from those described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. A user can select any one POI and need not select the POI with the highest relative preference. In one embodiment, the display screen <b>910</b> can be a touch screen, for example, such that a user can select one of the POIs through the display screen <b>910</b>. In another embodiment, the controller <b>900</b> can include buttons that can be used to select a POI from those graphically represented on the display screen <b>910</b>.</p>

For instance, the user can belong to one or more communities that share common interests (e.g., parents with young children groups, retired people groups, traveling bands groups). These communities can share with its members the ratings and/or reviews of particular POIs. In this regard, the second portion <b>990</b> can be used to select a community-of-interest (COI) and to provide the selected COI with a personal rating and/or review of services and/or facilities associated with POI <b>2</b> (e.g., quality of service, promptness, cost, cleanliness).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for selecting a POI based on historical trip data, according to an embodiment of the invention. At <b>1002</b>, after start <b>1000</b>, a mobile interactive services system that supports navigation services can access historical trip data, such as trip data related to departure time, arrival time, time and/or date of travel, travel distances, starting and/or destination locations, route segments, destination areas, and/or navigation or guidance data provided for previously occurring trips, for example. The historical trip data can be accessed from memory in the mobile interactive services system and/or through a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network, for example. In some instances, the historical trip data can include processed historical trip data such as routine route segment data and/or routine destination area data.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">At <b>1004</b>, data related to one or more POIs can be accessed by the mobile interactive services system. The POI data can result from a search of a selected destination category through a navigation service. The POI data can include information related to multiple POIs such as location of a POI, name, contact information (e.g., telephone number, fax number, email, text messaging, hyperlinks), and/or ratings or reviews provided by one or more communities or groups (e.g., COI ratings). The POI data can be accessed from memory in the mobile interactive services system and/or through a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network, for example. In this regard, the POI data can be received from a navigation service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At <b>1006</b>, at least one criterion can be used for selecting a POI. The criterion or criteria can be based on historical trip data, user preferences, and/or other data related to the POIs, such as ratings or reviews, for example. In this regard, at least one criterion can be determined by providing a weight or weighting factor to one or more aspects of the historical trip data, the user preferences, and/or other data related to the POIs. In some embodiments, routine route segments, routine destination areas, and/or ratings or reviews can be weighted more heavily to reflect the user's travel preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">At <b>1008</b>, the mobile interactive services system can graphically represent data related to the POIs based on, at least partially, at least one criterion determined for POI selection. For example, a display screen can be used to graphically represent the location of the POIs. The display screen can also be used to graphically represent POI information, such as name, for example, in a manner that illustrate relative POI preferences based on the criterion or criteria. At <b>1010</b>, a user can select or accept a POI based on the criterion and/or other POI data. In one embodiment, a user can activate a portion of the mobile interactive services system, such as a touch-screen or a button, to indicate which of the POIs is being selected. In another embodiment, the mobile interactive services system can determine a preferred POI based on the criterion or criteria and can provide the user with the option of accepting the preferred POI. The user need not accept the preferred POI and the mobile interactive services system can present subsequent options of POIs (e.g., according to relative criterion preference) until the user accepts one. At <b>1012</b> and <b>1014</b>, the mobile interactive services system can graphically represent data related to the selected or accepted POI. For example, the mobile interactive services system can provide the user with navigation or guidance information, data related to the selected POI (e.g., address and contact information, hyperlinks, websites, and/or multimedia content). After <b>1014</b>, the method can proceed to end <b>1016</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for obtaining navigation data to a destination point based on historical trip data, according to an embodiment of the invention.

In some instances, the historical trip data can include processed historical trip data such as routine route segment data and/or routine destination area data.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">At <b>1104</b>, the historical trip data can be communicated to a navigation service provider through a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network, for example. The navigation service provider can process the historical trip data, including determining statistical information to identify routine or regularly occurring trips, for example. At <b>1106</b>, a user can request navigation data for a specified location or destination from the navigation service provider via the hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network. At <b>1108</b>, the navigation service provider can generate navigation data for the user-specified location based, at least partially, on the historical trip data received. The mobile interactive services system can receive the navigation data generated by the navigation service provider through the hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network. At <b>1110</b>, the mobile interactive services system can graphically represent the navigation data, including travel directions or guidance and/or additional data related to the specified destination. In this regard, the navigation service provider can update the navigation data to, for example, reflect changes in the user's location and/or to indicate changes in remaining travel time and/or distance to travel to arrive at the destination location. After <b>1112</b>, the method can proceed to end <b>1114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one embodiment, a processor in a mobile interactive navigation service can be operated to process at least one criterion for multiple of POIs based on historical trip data. The historical trip data can include route segment data and destination area data. An input device can also be coupled to the processor and can be operated to detect a selection of one of the graphically represented POIs. A modem can be coupled to the processor and can be operated to receive data related to the POIs from a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network. In some instances, the criterion or criteria can be based on a portion of the route segment data related to travel to the one of the POIs from a current location, the portion of the destination area data related to a location of the POIs, and/or a rating provided by a COI. The processor can be operated to process a preferred POI based on the at least one criterion. A display can be coupled to the processor that can be configured to graphically represent the multiple POIs based on the criterion or criteria. The graphically represented data can include, for example, data related to a preferred POI, data related to the POIs in an order that is based on the criterion, and data related to the selected POI.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In another embodiment, a processor in a mobile interactive navigation service can be operated process navigation data to a destination for graphical representation in a display. The navigation data can be based on historical trip data and the historical trip data can include route segment data and destination area data. The processor can access the navigation data from memory and/or through a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network. In this regard, the memory can be operated to store navigation data, historical trip data, and/or data related to a previously conducted trip. The processor can process data related to a previously conducted trip to generate historical trip data. In some instances, the processor can process the historical trip data for communication to a navigation service provider through the hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network and via a modem coupled to the processor. The modem can also receive navigation data from the service provider through the hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network. The navigation data received from the service provider can be based on a portion of the route segment data related to travel to the destination from a current location and/or a portion of the destination area data related to a location of the destination.
