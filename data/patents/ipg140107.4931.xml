<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an image heating apparatus employed by an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine, a printer, a facsimile machine, and the like. As examples of an image heating apparatus, an apparatus for fixing an unfixed image formed on a recording medium, an apparatus for heating a fixed image on a recording medium to increase the glossiness of an image, and the like can be listed.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally speaking, an image forming apparatus which uses powdery toner forms an unfixed toner image on a recording medium. Thus, it has to fix the unfixed toner image. Therefore, in the field of an image forming apparatus which uses powdery toner, it is common practice to employ an image heating apparatus as a fixing device to fix an unfixed toner image to a recording medium. As for the process through which an unfixed toner image is fixed by an image heating device (fixing device), it is as follows: After the formation of an unfixed toner image by an image forming apparatus, the unfixed toner image is electrostatically transferred onto the surface of a sheet of a recording medium. Then, the sheet of the recording medium, on which the transferred unfixed toner image is present, is conveyed through the fixing device of the image forming apparatus so that it remains pinched between the heating member and the pressure applying member of the fixing device. As the sheet is conveyed through the fixing device, the unfixed toner image is thermally fixed to the sheet by the heat and pressure applied by the heating member and the pressure applying member of the fixing device. As the means for thermally fixing an unfixed toner image, a rotational member such as a roller, an endless belt, and the like are employed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As an example of a fixing device which employs a rotational member, such as the one described above, as a heating means, there is the fixing device disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application 2000-187406. In the case of this fixing device, its rotational heating member is provided with an electrically conductive surface layer, in which heat can be generated by electromagnetic induction. More specifically, in the case of a fixing device such as the abovementioned one, an alternating magnetic field is generated by causing high frequency current to flow through an excitation coil. As an alternating magnetic field is generated, the magnetic flux is guided by a magnetic flux passage formed of a magnetic substance so that it penetrates the electrically conductive layer of the rotational member. As the magnetic flux penetrates the electrically conductive layer, it generates eddy currents in the electrically conductive layer. Consequently, heat is generated in the electrically conductive layer by the eddy current (Joule Effect), and the rotational member is heated by thus heat.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, the portions of the rotational member, through which a greater amount of the magnetic flux penetrates, generate more heat than the portions of the rotational member through which a lesser amount of the magnetic flux penetrates. Thus, the rotational member can be made uniform in heat generation in terms of the direction parallel to its rotational axis (lengthwise direction), by placing the magnetic substance across the entire range of the rotational member in terms of the lengthwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Laid-open Patent Application 2006-078933 discloses another example of the above-described type. In the case of this fixing device, a magnetic substance is within the hollow of the rotational member (member to be heated) to control the rotational member in temperature. In a fixing device such as the one in this patent application, the magnetic substance is solidly held by a supporting member so that a preset distance is maintained between the magnetic substance and the rotational member (member to be heated).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At this time, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, the prior art regarding the positioning of the various components of a fixing device in terms of the direction perpendicular to the recording-medium-conveyance direction is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> are vertical sectional views of the fixing device <b>5</b> in accordance with the present invention, at a plane parallel to the lengthwise direction of the device <b>5</b>. The fixing device <b>5</b> is provided with a pressure roller <b>105</b>, a fixation belt unit <b>110</b>, and a pair of side plates <b>55</b>. The fixation belt unit <b>110</b> is supported by the pair of side plates <b>55</b>, which are at the lengthwise ends of the device <b>5</b>, one for one. More concretely, the supporting portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>of each of the two flanges <b>103</b> of the fixation belt unit <b>110</b> is in engagement with the corresponding side plate <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The fixation belt unit <b>110</b> is made up of a stay <b>104</b>, a magnetic core <b>106</b>, and a supporting member <b>107</b>. The stay <b>104</b> and the magnetic core <b>106</b> extend from one lengthwise ends of the fixation belt unit <b>110</b> to the other, and are supported by the core supporting member <b>107</b>. The position of the flange <b>103</b> is under the control of the core supporting member positioning portion <b>103</b><i>c </i>of the flange <b>103</b>. Thus, the positional referential point for the stay <b>104</b> and the core supporting member <b>107</b> in terms of the lengthwise direction is the lengthwise end A (left end in drawings).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, a fixing apparatus which employs an inductive heating method such as the one described above suffers from the following problems. That is, in order for a fixing device to meet the low-energy-consumption requirement, its fixing member has to be very small in thermal capacity. Thus, as a fixing device that satisfies the low-energy-consumption requirement is started, its fixing member virtually instantly increases in surface temperature, becoming ready for fixation. In comparison, its magnetic core supporting member, which is formed of resinous substance, remains relative low in temperature when the fixing device is started for a job. However, if the job started happens to be a long continuous job, the core supporting member gradually increases in temperature with the continuation of the job. Further, the core supporting member is on the inward side of the loop which the fixation belt forms, and is in the adjacencies of the inward surface of the fixation belt. Therefore, its temperature increase is substantially greater than the temperature increase of the ambience of the outward side of the fixing member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, as the core supporting member <b>107</b> increases in temperature, it expands in the direction (lengthwise direction) perpendicular to the recording-medium-conveyance direction (by &#x394;L). As for the magnetic core <b>106</b>, it is positioned so that its left and right portions are symmetrical with reference to the center line of the recording-medium conveyance passage before the fixation belt is heated. However, as a job continues, in particular, if the job happens to be a long one, the left and right portions of the magnetic core <b>106</b> become different in dimension (length), because of the thermal expansion of the core supporting member <b>107</b> (QR and QL, PR and PL).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a result, one side of the fixing member, relative to the center line of the recording-medium conveyance passage, becomes different from the other side, in terms of the gap between the magnetic core <b>106</b> and the coil, and therefore, one side of the fixing member becomes different in temperature distribution from the other side, which is problematic.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, the primary object of the present invention is to provide an image heating apparatus that has a significantly smaller temperature difference between one side of its fixing member and the other side with reference to the center line of its recording-medium conveyance passage, than any image heating apparatus in accordance with the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image heating apparatus comprising an excitation coil; an image heating member for generating heat using a magnetic flux from the excitation coil to heat an image on a recording material; a magnetic core provided inside the image heating member for guiding the magnetic flux to the image heating member; a core supporting member of resin material contacting the magnetic core to support the magnetic core; a back-up member contacting an inner surface of the image heating member; a pressing member forming a nip between the back-up member and itself with the image heating member therebetween; a stay member of metal, provided inside the image heating member, for pressing the back-up member to form a nip; an apparatus side plate provided at each of opposite ends with respect to a rotational axis direction of the image heating member; a first positioning portion for determining a position of the stay member relative to one of the apparatus side plates; and a second positioning portion, provided at a central portion of the stay member, for determining a position of the core supporting member relative to the stay member.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the appended drawings, in which a component, its portions, etc., in the second to fourth embodiments are the same in structure as the counterparts in the first embodiment, they are given the same referential codes as those given to the counterparts.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Image Forming Apparatus)</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the image forming apparatus, the fixing device of which is in accordance with the present invention is described about its overall structure. The image forming apparatus has four photosensitive drums a, b, c, and d, as image formation media, which are for forming yellow, magenta, cyan, and black monochromatic toner images, respectively. The four photosensitive drums a, b, c, and d are in the so-called tandem alignment, and are parallel to each other. The image forming apparatus has also an intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b>, which is an intermediary means for transferring a monochromatic toner image from the photosensitive drums onto a recording medium. The intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b> is positioned so that it remains in contact with each of the four photosensitive drums a, b, c, and d.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The drums a, b, c, and d are driven by an unshown motor. More concretely, the drums a, b, c, and d are parts of process cartridges <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>c</i>, and <b>1</b><i>d</i>, one for one. Each process cartridge is provided with a primary charging device, a developing device, and a transfer charging device, which are unshown and are in the adjacencies of the peripheral surface of the corresponding drum. The image forming apparatus has also an exposing device <b>6</b>, which is made up of a polygon mirror, etc., and is under the area in which the four drums are present.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">After the peripheral surface of the drum <u style="single">a</u> is uniformly charged, it is scanned by a beam of laser light projected by the exposing device <b>6</b>, by way of the polygon mirror, while being modulated with electrical signals for forming a monochromatic yellow image, that is, one of the primary monochromatic images into which the image to be formed was separated. As a result, an electrostatic latent image is effected on the peripheral surface of the drum <u style="single">a</u>. Then, the electrostatic latent image is developed into a visible image, that is, an image formed of yellow toner, with which the peripheral surface of the drum <u style="single">a</u> is supplied by the developing device. Then, the yellow toner image is conveyed to the primary transfer station, which is the area of contact between the drum <u style="single">a</u> and intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b>, by the further rotation of the drum <u style="single">a</u>. As the yellow toner image arrives at the primary transfer station, it is transferred (primary transfer) onto the intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b> by the primary transfer bias applied to the transfer charging member <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Meanwhile a magenta toner image is formed on the drum b with the use of the same method as the method for forming the yellow toner image, with such a timing that the portion of the intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b>, on which the yellow toner image is present, arrives at the image forming station for the formation of the magenta toner image, at the same time as the magenta toner image is transferred (primary transfer) onto the intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b>. Thus, as the magenta toner image is transferred onto the intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b>, it is layered onto the yellow toner image on the intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b>. Then, as the intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b> is circularly moved further, a cyan toner image and a black toner image are layered on the combination of the yellow and magenta toner images on the intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b> in the primary transfer station of the corresponding image forming station.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Meanwhile, one of the sheets P of the recording medium in a cassette <b>4</b> is moved out of the cassette <b>4</b> by a pickup roller <b>8</b> while being separated from the rest, and is conveyed to a pair of registration roller <b>9</b> through a recording medium passage <b>25</b>. Then, the sheet P is released by the registration rollers <b>9</b> with such a timing that it arrives at the second transfer station at the same time as the layered four monochromatic toner images, different in color, arrive at the second transfer station. Then, as the sheet P and the layered four monochromatic toner images, different in color, on the intermediary transfer belt <b>2</b> are conveyed together through the secondary transfer station, the four monochromatic toner images are transferred together (secondary transfer) onto the sheet P by the second transfer bias applied between a pair of secondary transfer rollers <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">After the transfer of the four monochromatic toner images, different in color, onto the sheet P of recording medium, the sheet P is conveyed to the fixing device <b>5</b>, being guided by a recording medium conveyance guide <b>20</b>. In the fixing device <b>5</b>, the four monochromatic toner images are fixed to the sheet P by the heat and pressure applied by the fixing device <b>5</b>. That is, as the four monochromatic toner images, different in color, are subjected to the heat and pressure applied by the fixing device <b>5</b>, they melt and mix, effecting thereby a full-color image, and become fixed to the sheet P as they cool down. Then, the combination of the sheet P and the fixed full-color image is discharged as a color print into a delivery tray <b>7</b> though a recording medium conveyance passage <b>21</b> by a pair of rollers <b>10</b> and a pair of rollers <b>11</b>, which are on the downstream side of the fixing device <b>5</b> in terms of the recording-medium-conveyance direction.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Incidentally, the above-described image forming operation is started after the information such as recording-medium size, image-formation data, and the number of prints, which are set by a user, is transferred to the CPU <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the image forming apparatus. The abovementioned information is set by a user with the use of the control panel of the image forming apparatus, and/or a computer which is in connection to the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Fixing Device)</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, the fixing device <b>5</b> as an image heating device in this embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are a schematic sectional view of the fixing device <b>5</b> in this embodiment at a plane perpendicular to the recording-medium-conveyance direction, and a plane parallel to the recording-medium-conveyance direction, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of a combination of the belt unit and pressure roller in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">1) Internal Structure of Fixation Belt Unit <b>110</b>, and Pressure Application to Fixation Belt <b>101</b></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a component designated by reference numeral <b>101</b> is a fixation belt, in which heat can be generated by the magnetic flux from an excitation coil <b>91</b> (electromagnetic induction heat generation). The fixation belt <b>101</b> is an endless belt. It is circularly movable. Designated by reference numeral <b>105</b> is a pressure roller as a pressure applying member, which is in contact with the outward surface of the fixation belt <b>101</b>. Incidentally, instead of the pressure roller <b>105</b> which is rotated in contact with the fixation belt <b>101</b>, another endless belt which is suspended by multiple rollers and is circularly moved, or a stationary pad, may be employed as the pressure applying member.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A component designated by reference numeral <b>102</b> is a fixation belt backing member (which hereafter will be referred to simply as backup member) formed of heat resistant resin. The backup member <b>102</b> is kept pressed against the pressure roller <b>105</b> with the presence of the fixation belt <b>101</b> between itself and the pressure roller <b>105</b>, being in contact with the inward surface of the fixation belt <b>101</b> and forming thereby a fixation nip N between the fixation belt <b>101</b> and pressure roller <b>105</b>. Thus, the backup member <b>102</b> controls the pressure distribution in the fixation nip N.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Designated by a reference numeral <b>104</b> is a stay formed of a metallic substance (which in this embodiment is stainless steel). The stay <b>104</b> supports the backup member <b>102</b>, and applies pressure upon the backup member <b>102</b>. It is strong enough to withstand the reactive force from the pressure roller <b>105</b>. Designated by reference numeral <b>106</b> is an inside magnetic core, which is on the inward side of the loop which the fixation belt <b>101</b> forms. The inside magnetic core <b>106</b> is for increasing in efficiency the magnetic circuit for induction heating, and also, functions as a magnetism shield. That is, not only does it increase the efficiency with which heat is generated in the fixation belt <b>101</b>, but also, it covers the outward surface of the stay <b>104</b> (formed of metallic substance) to prevent the magnetic flux from reaching the stay <b>104</b>, in order to prevent the stay <b>104</b> from being warmed (heated) by induction. In this embodiment, the stay <b>104</b> is not in contact with the inside core <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Designated by reference numeral <b>107</b> is a core supporting member formed of heat resistant resin. The core supporting member <b>107</b> supports the inside core <b>106</b>. Designated by reference numeral <b>103</b> is a flange formed of heat resistant resin. The fixing device <b>5</b> has two flanges <b>103</b>, which are at the lengthwise ends of the fixing device <b>5</b>, one for one. Not only do the flanges <b>103</b> support the stay <b>104</b>, but also, regulate the fixation belt <b>101</b> in shape, and also, in the position in terms of the direction perpendicular to the moving direction of the fixation belt <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fixation belt unit <b>110</b> comprises the backup member <b>102</b>, flanges <b>103</b>, fixation belt <b>101</b>, and stay <b>104</b>. It is above the fixation roller <b>105</b>, and opposes the pressure roller <b>105</b>. It is under the pressure applied to the flanges <b>103</b> (which are at the lengthwise ends of unit <b>110</b>) from unshown compression springs. Thus, the stay <b>104</b> (which extends in lengthwise direction) is kept pressed toward the pressure roller <b>105</b>, with the presence of the fixation pad <b>102</b> and fixation belt <b>101</b> between itself and the pressure roller <b>105</b>, forming thereby the fixation nip N having a preset width.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, designated by reference numeral <b>93</b> is a magnetic flux generating means, which comprises: an excitation coil <b>91</b>; an outside magnetic core <b>92</b>; and a holder <b>93</b> which holds the coil <b>91</b> and outside magnetic core <b>92</b>. The magnetic flux generating means <b>93</b> is in the adjacencies of the surface layer of fixation belt <b>101</b>. The outside core <b>92</b> is on the opposite side of the excitation coil <b>91</b> from the inside core <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">2) Heating of Fixation Belt <b>101</b> by Electromagnetic Induction</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">2-a) Fixation Belt <b>101</b></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The fixation belt <b>101</b>, which is the member in which heat is generated by electromagnetic induction, is provide with an electrically conductive surface layer made of a highly magnetic metal (high in permeability) such as iron, so that the magnetic flux generated by the magnetic flux generating means can be confined in the metallic portion of the fixation belt <b>101</b> as much as possible. That is, the fixation belt <b>101</b> is made as high as possible in magnetic flux density. With the surface layer of the fixation belt <b>101</b> being higher in magnetic flux density, heat can be efficiently generated in the fixation belt <b>101</b> by the eddy current generated in its metallic surface layer.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">2-b) Coil <b>91</b> and Outside Magnetic Core <b>92</b></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the excitation coil <b>91</b> and outside magnetic core <b>92</b> are on the outward side of the fixation belt loop. Incidentally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> does not show the inside magnetic core <b>106</b>, that is, the magnetic core which is on the inward side of the fixation belt loop. As AC current is supplied to the coil <b>91</b>, the excitation circuit <b>300</b> generates alternating magnetic flux, which is guided by the cores <b>92</b> and core <b>106</b> to generate eddy current in the fixation belt <b>101</b>, that is, a belt which can be heated by electromagnetic induction. The eddy current generates heat (Joule Effect) because of the electrical resistance (specific to fixation belt material) of fixation belt <b>101</b>. That is, as the coil <b>91</b> is supplied with AC current, the fixation belt <b>101</b> is heated by electromagnetic induction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The coil <b>91</b> is in the form of a long and narrow ellipse (like long and narrow boat), the lengthwise direction of which is parallel to the rotational axis of the fixation belt <b>101</b>. It is wound in such a manner that its lengthwise end portions coincide in position with the edges of the fixation belt <b>101</b>, one for one. It heats the fixation belt <b>101</b> by electromagnetic induction. More concretely, as seen from the top side of the fixing device <b>5</b>, the coil <b>91</b> is roughly elliptic (like long and narrow boat), with its lengthwise direction being parallel to the lengthwise direction of the fixation roller <b>105</b> (perpendicular to widthwise direction of fixation belt <b>101</b>). It is positioned so that its contour, in terms of cross section, matches the contour of the fixation belt <b>101</b>. The wire, of which coil <b>91</b> is made, is litz wire composed of roughly 80-160 fine insulated strands which are 0.1-0.3 mm in diameter and woven together.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The coil <b>91</b> is wound 8-12 times in a manner to follow the contour of the inward surface of the outside magnetic core <b>92</b>. It is in connection to the excitation circuit <b>300</b> so that it can be supplied with AC current.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The fixation belt unit <b>110</b> is structured so that the outside magnetic core <b>92</b> surrounds the peripheral portions of the coil <b>91</b> as well as the center portion of the coil <b>91</b>. Thus, the outside magnetic core <b>92</b> plays the role of efficiently guiding the alternating magnetic flux generated by the coil <b>91</b>, to the fixation belt <b>101</b> (member in which heat can be generated by electromagnetic induction). That is, it is used to contain the magnetic flux to increase the magnetic circuit in efficiency. As the material for the outside magnetic core <b>92</b>, a substance such as ferrite, which is high in permeability and low in residual magnetic flux density, is used.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the outside magnetic core <b>92</b> has multiple sections which make up a center group and a pair of end groups. The center group corresponds in position to the elliptical space which is at the center of the coil <b>91</b>, whereas the end groups correspond in position to the lengthwise end portions of the coil <b>91</b>. The sections in the end groups which correspond in position to the areas E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are allowed to individually move in the direction to change their distance from the coil <b>91</b>, whereas the sections in the center group which corresponds in position to the area D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) are solidly attached to the holder (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The center portion of the outside magnetic core <b>92</b> may be left in a single piece. The dimension of the area D in terms of the lengthwise direction of the fixing device is equal to the width of the narrowest sheet of recording medium usable with the fixing device.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">2-c) Inside Magnetic Core <b>106</b></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as AC current is supplied to the coil <b>91</b> from the excitation circuit, the coil <b>91</b> generates alternating magnetic flux, which is guided by the outside magnetic core <b>92</b> and inside magnetic core <b>106</b> to the fixation belt <b>101</b> (in which heat can be generated by magnetic induction) to induce eddy current in the fixation belt <b>101</b>. Although the inside core <b>106</b> is a single-piece core, it may be made up of multiple sections, which correspond in number and position to the multiple section of the center group of the outside magnetic core <b>92</b>, one for one.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(Control of Image Fixing Operation)</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as the CPU <b>100</b> receives an image formation start signal from an external host apparatus <b>200</b>, it warms up the fixing device <b>5</b> with a preset timing; it raises the temperature of the fixation belt <b>101</b> to a temperature level which is suitable for thermally melting a toner image. A soon as the surface temperature of the fixation belt <b>101</b> reaches a preset level, for example, 180&#xb0; C., the image forming apparatus <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is ready for image formation. The sequence for warming up the fixing device <b>5</b> is as follows: First, the CPU begins to drive the pressure roller <b>105</b> to cause the fixation belt <b>101</b> to be circularly moved by the rotation of the pressure roller <b>105</b>. At virtually the same time as the fixation belt <b>101</b> begins to circularly move, or as soon as the fixation belt <b>101</b> begins to circularly move, the CPU begins to supply the coil <b>91</b> of the magnetic flux generating means <b>93</b> with AC current from the excitation circuit <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The CPU turns on the fixation motor M (means for rotating pressure roller <b>105</b>) to drive the pressure roller <b>105</b>. The driving force from the fixation motor M is transmitted to the pressure roller <b>105</b> through the mechanical power transmitting means (unshown), whereby the pressure roller <b>105</b> is rotated in the counterclockwise direction, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, at a preset speed. Thus, the rotation force from the pressure roller <b>105</b> is transmitted to the fixation belt <b>101</b> by the friction between the peripheral surface of the pressure roller <b>105</b> and the outward surface of the fixation belt <b>101</b>, in the fixation nip N. Thus, fixation belt <b>101</b> is rotated by the rotational force from the pressure roller <b>105</b> in the clockwise direction, indicated by an arrow mark, at roughly the same speed as the peripheral velocity of the pressure roller <b>105</b>, with its inward surface sliding on the bottom surface of the fixation pad <b>102</b>, in the fixation nip N.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the CPU <b>100</b> turns on the high frequency converter of the excitation circuit <b>300</b> (circuit for electromagnetically inducing eddy current to generate heat in fixation belt <b>101</b>). Thus, the coil <b>91</b> of the magnetic field generating means <b>93</b> is supplied with the AC current (high frequency current) from an AC power source <b>400</b>. Therefore, the magnetic flux, designated by reference letter H, is repeatedly generated and collapsed in the adjacencies of the coil <b>91</b>. The magnetic flux H is guided by the outside magnetic core <b>92</b> to the fixation belt <b>101</b>, and crosses the electrically conductive layer of the fixation belt <b>101</b>. As the magnetic flux H crosses the electrically conductive layer of the fixation belt <b>101</b>, eddy current is induced in the direction to generate such a magnetic field that counters the change in the magnetic field generated in the adjacencies of the coil <b>91</b>. This eddy current generates heat in the electrically conductive layer of the fixation belt <b>101</b>, by the amount which is proportional to the surface resistance of the electrically conductive layer, and also, the amount of the square of the eddy current. (Joule Effect). It is by this heat generation in the electrically conductive layer of the fixation belt <b>101</b> that the fixation belt <b>101</b> is increased in temperature while being circularly moved.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">On the other hand, the thickness of the electrically conductive layer of the fixation belt <b>101</b> is less than the depth of penetration of the magnetic flux. Thus, the magnetic flux penetrates through the electrically conductive layer, and reaches the inside magnetic core <b>106</b>, which is on the inward side of the fixation belt loop, forming thereby a closed magnetic flux circuit. Since the inside magnetic core <b>106</b> is positioned as close as possible while ensuring that a preset amount of distance is maintained between itself and fixation belt <b>101</b>, the closed magnetic circuit is as tight as possible, increasing thereby the fixing belt <b>101</b> in the internal magnetic flux density. Therefore, the fixation belt <b>101</b> is uniformly increased in temperature in terms of its widthwise direction by the heat generated by the magnetic induction.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The temperature of the fixation belt <b>101</b> is detected by a thermistor TH, and the electrical information about the detected temperature of the fixation belt <b>101</b> is inputted into the CPU <b>100</b> through an A/D converter <b>500</b>. The CPU <b>100</b> controls the excitation circuit <b>300</b>, based on the information, that is, the detected temperature of the fixation belt <b>101</b>, inputted from the thermistor TH, so that the temperature of the fixation belt <b>101</b> increases to a preset level (fixation temperature), and remains at the preset level.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described above, the pressure roller <b>105</b> is driven, and the temperature of the fixation belt <b>101</b> is increased to the preset level and is kept at the preset level. While the pressure roller <b>105</b> is driven and the temperature of the fixation belt <b>101</b> is kept at the preset level, a sheet P of recording medium, on which an unfixed toner image t is present, is introduced into the fixation nip N, and then, is conveyed through the nip N, in such an attitude that the surface of the sheet P, on which the unfixed toner image t is present, faces the fixation belt <b>101</b> and is kept in contact with the outward surface of the fixation belt <b>101</b>. While the sheet P is conveyed through the fixation nip N, the sheet P remains between the fixation belt <b>101</b> and pressure roller <b>105</b>. Thus, the sheet P and the unfixed toner image thereon are given heat by the fixation belt <b>101</b>, and also, are subjected to the pressure by the nip N. As a result, the unfixed toner image t on the sheet P is fixed to the surface of the sheet P, becoming thereby a permanent toner image.

<p id="p-0069" num="0073">The stay <b>104</b> is formed of stainless steel. Thus, &#x3b1;=1.6&#xd7;20&#x2212;5(/K).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0074">Thus, if L (length of portion of stay <b>104</b> between side plates <b>55</b>)=400 mm; T=200&#xb0; C.; and T<b>0</b>=20&#xb0; C., and also, the position of the stay <b>104</b> and the position of the core supporting member <b>107</b>, in terms of the lengthwise direction of the fixing device, is under the control of the side plate <b>55</b> (<b>55</b>A) in the area A (stay <b>4</b> and core supporting member <b>107</b> are directly or indirectly attached to side plate <b>55</b>A so that they are not movable relative to side plate <b>55</b>A in terms of lengthwise direction), the amount of the lengthwise (linear) thermal expansion of the stay <b>104</b> is 1.15 mm. Thus, in this embodiment, the distance by which the stay <b>104</b> is allowed to move relative to the core supporting member <b>107</b> is set to 1.5 mm.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">6) Effect of Thermal Expansion (Upon Stay <b>104</b> and Core Supporting Member <b>107</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0075">Next, the thermal expansion of the stay <b>104</b> and core supporting member <b>107</b> in terms of the lengthwise direction of the fixation belt unit <b>110</b> is described. The stay <b>104</b> is formed of stainless steel, and therefore, &#x3b1;=1.6&#xd7;10&#x2212;5(/K), whereas the core supporting member <b>107</b> is formed of heat resistant resin (PPS), and therefore, &#x3b1;=6.0&#xd7;10&#x2212;5(/K). Thus, if L (length of portion of stay <b>104</b> between side plates <b>55</b>)=400 mm; T=200&#xb0; C.; and T<b>0</b>=20&#xb0; C., and also both the stay <b>104</b> and core supporting member <b>107</b> are attached to one of the side plates <b>55</b> (<b>55</b>A in this embodiment). Then, the amount of the lengthwise (linear) thermal expansion of the stay <b>104</b> and the amount of the lengthwise (linear) thermal expansion of the core supporting member <b>107</b>, which are obtainable with the use of Equation (1) are 1.15 mm and 4.32 mm, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0076">In this embodiment, the stay <b>104</b> is made of a metallic substance, and is attached to one (<b>55</b>A) of the side plates <b>55</b>, being thereby positioned by the side plate <b>55</b>A. Thus, the amount by which the core supporting member <b>107</b> in this embodiment, which is formed of heat resistant resin, thermally expands in the lengthwise direction of the fixation belt unit <b>110</b> is far smaller than a core supporting member (<b>107</b>) of any fixation belt unit (<b>110</b>) in accordance with the prior art, which is directly attached to one of the side plates (<b>55</b>). Further, the core supporting member <b>107</b>, which is greater in the amount of the lengthwise thermal expansion than the stay <b>104</b>, is attached to the stay <b>104</b> by fitting its projection (<b>107</b>O), which is at the lengthwise center of the core supporting member <b>107</b>, in the center hole <b>104</b>M of the stay <b>104</b>, as described above, being thereby aligned with the center line O of the recording-medium conveyance passage. Thus, the thermal expansion of the core supporting member <b>107</b> in its lengthwise direction is symmetrical relative to the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0077">Therefore, even after the conveyance of a substantial number of sheets of the recording medium through the fixing device, the core supporting member <b>107</b> is far less asymmetrical with reference to the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, than the core supporting member (<b>107</b>) of any fixing device in accordance with the prior art, which is directly attached to one of the side plates of the fixing device. Therefore, the inside core <b>106</b>, which has significant effects upon the temperature distribution of the fixation belt <b>101</b>, and is supported by the core supporting member <b>107</b>, remains far less asymmetrical than the core (<b>106</b>) of any fixation belt unit <b>110</b> in accordance with the prior art. In other words, the present invention can make it possible to significantly reduce the gap between the inside core <b>106</b> and coil <b>91</b> at both ends of the fixation belt unit <b>110</b> in terms of the direction perpendicular to the recording-medium-conveyance direction. Therefore, the present invention can provide a fixing device which does not suffer from the problem that even when a sheet of a recording medium, which is narrower than the widest sheet of recording medium usable with an image forming apparatus (fixing device) is used as the recording medium, the portion of the fixing member, which corresponds in position to one of the areas of the recording-medium conveyance passage, which is outside the path of the narrow sheet of recording medium, is thermally damaged by its excessive temperature increase, or the problem that &#x201c;cold offset&#x201d; occurs because of the excessive temperature drop which occurs to the portion of the fixing member, which corresponds in position to one of the areas of the recording-medium conveyance passage, which is inside the path of the narrow sheet of recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0078">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the core supporting member <b>107</b> is in the adjacencies of the fixation belt <b>101</b> (in which heat can be generated by electromagnetic induction), and also, is in contact with the inside core <b>106</b> which is virtually in contact with the fixation belt. On the other hand, there are the inside core <b>106</b> and core supporting member <b>107</b> between the stay <b>104</b> and fixation belt <b>101</b>. In other words, its distance from the fixation belt <b>101</b> is relatively long. Therefore, the heat from the fixation belt <b>101</b> is more likely to transfer to the core supporting member <b>107</b>, being therefore more likely to be increased in temperature by the heat from the fixation belt <b>101</b> than the stay <b>104</b>. Thus, the stay <b>104</b> remains lower in temperature T than the core supporting member <b>107</b>, being therefore smaller in the extent to which it is affected by its thermal expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0079">Next, the effect of the thermal expansion of the left end portion <b>103</b>A of the flange <b>103</b> upon the asymmetry of the fixation belt unit <b>110</b>, with reference to the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage, is described. Assuming that the distance L<b>3</b> between the side plate engaging portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the left end portion <b>103</b>A of the flange <b>103</b> and the flange positioning portion <b>103</b><i>c </i>is 3 mm; the temperature of the portion <b>103</b>A after the conveyance of a substantial number of sheets of recording medium through the fixing device is 80&#xb0; C., the amount &#x394;S of the thermal expansion of the portion of the flange <b>103</b>, which is between the positioning portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the flange <b>103</b>A and the side plate <b>55</b>A, is 0.01 mm (&#x394;S=0.01 mm). On the other hand, the amount &#x394;S of the thermal expansion of the stay <b>104</b>, between the flange positioning portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the flange <b>103</b> and the center O of the recording-medium conveyance passage is 0.5 mm (&#x394;S=0.5 mm) because L<b>0</b>=200 mm and T=180&#xb0; C. In other words, it is roughly 2% of the overall asymmetry. Therefore, the effect of the lengthwise thermal expansion of the left end portion <b>103</b>A of the flange <b>103</b> is ignorable.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0082">Further, in consideration of the thermal expansion of the stay <b>104</b>, the core supporting member <b>107</b>, etc., in the lengthwise direction of the fixation belt unit <b>110</b>, the grooves <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b</i>, and <b>104</b><i>c </i>are provided with margins X and Y. The margin X is provided in consideration of the thermal expansion of the core supporting member <b>107</b> in the direction A, to prevent the problem that as the fixation belt <b>101</b> is heated, the anchor portions of the core supporting member <b>107</b> are made to expand in the direction A by the heat from the fixation belt <b>101</b> and causes its anchor portions to interfere with the stay <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0083">As for the margin Y, it is provided in consideration of the thermal expansion of the core supporting member <b>107</b> in the opposite direction from the direction A, to prevent the problem that as the fixation belt <b>101</b> is heated, the core supporting member <b>107</b> is made to expand in the opposite direction from the direction A by the heat from the fixation belt <b>101</b> and causes its anchor portions to interfere with the stay <b>104</b>, and also, in consideration of the thermal expansion of the core supporting member <b>107</b> in the direction A, and the amount by which the stay <b>104</b> and core supporting member <b>107</b> are made to slide relative to each other, by their thermal expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0084">In this embodiment, the stay <b>104</b> is made of stainless steel. Therefore, &#x3b1;=1.6&#xd7;10&#x2212;5(/K).

<p id="p-0083" num="0087">In order to prevent the problem that as the fixation belt <b>101</b> is heated, the anchor projection <b>107</b><i>a </i>and <b>107</b><i>c </i>of the core supporting member <b>107</b> is made to interfere with the stay <b>104</b> by the thermal expansion of the core supporting member <b>107</b> in the direction A, the space (margin) between the opposite end of the projection <b>107</b><i>a </i>from the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage and the corresponding groove of the stay <b>104</b>, and the space between the opposite end of the portion <b>107</b><i>c </i>from the centerline of the recording-medium conveyance passage and the corresponding groove of the stay <b>104</b>, have to be no less than 1.36 mm (=1.67 mm-0.307 mm) in terms of the lengthwise direction of the fixation belt unit <b>110</b>. In this embodiment, therefore, the margin X for the prevention of the interference between the stay <b>104</b> and core supporting member <b>107</b> was set to 2 mm, whereas the margin Y was set to 8 mm in consideration of a distance of 6 mm by which the stay <b>104</b> and core supporting member <b>107</b> have to be allowed to move (slid) relative to each other in order for the core supporting member <b>107</b> to be anchored to the stay <b>104</b>, and also, in consideration of the difference between the amount (6 mm) by which the core supporting member <b>107</b> has to be moved relative to the stay <b>104</b> in order for the core supporting member <b>107</b> to be anchored to the stay <b>104</b>, and the margin X.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0088">With the employment of the above described structural arrangement, the core supporting member <b>107</b>, which is larger in the amount of thermal expansion in the lengthwise direction than the stay <b>104</b>, is anchored to the stay <b>104</b> so that its center portion <b>107</b>O, that is, its positioning portion, aligns with the positioning portion <b>104</b>O of the stay <b>104</b> and the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage. Therefore, the thermal expansion of the core supporting member <b>107</b> in its lengthwise direction is symmetrical with reference to the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage. In other words, the inside magnetic core <b>106</b>, which is supported by the core supporting member <b>107</b> and is responsible for the temperature distribution of the fixation belt <b>101</b>, becomes far less asymmetrical relative to the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage than the inward core (<b>106</b>) of any fixation belt unit (<b>110</b>) in accordance with the prior art. In other words, the present invention can provide a fixing device which does not suffer from the problem that when a sheet of the recording medium, which is narrower than the recording-medium passage, is used as the recording medium for a given image forming operation, the portion of the fixing member, which corresponds in position to one of the areas of the recording-medium conveyance passage that are outside the path of the narrower sheet of the recording medium, becomes thermally damaged because of the excessive temperature increase, or the problem that the portion of the fixing member, which corresponds in position to one of the areas of the recording-medium conveyance passage that are within the path of the narrower sheet of recording medium excessively reduces in temperature, causing thereby the &#x201c;cold offset&#x201d;.</p>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading>
<p id="p-0085" num="0089">The image forming apparatus in this embodiment, and its fixing device, are the same in structure in terms of the lengthwise direction of the fixing device, and also, in fixing operation, as the counterpart in the first embodiment. Therefore, they are not going to be described here. This embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that the backup member <b>102</b> is attached to the stay <b>104</b> so that the lengthwise center of the backup member <b>102</b> is aligned with the lengthwise center of the stay <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic sectional view of the fixing device in this embodiment, at a vertical plane which is parallel to the lengthwise direction of the fixing device. In this embodiment, the stay <b>104</b> is solidly attached to the one of the side plates <b>55</b> (right plate <b>55</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) with the presence of the flange <b>103</b> between itself and the side plate <b>55</b>A, and the core supporting member <b>107</b> is attached to the stay <b>104</b> so that its lengthwise center and the lengthwise center of the stay <b>104</b> are in the proximity of the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage. Therefore, the fixing device in this embodiment is far less asymmetrical in temperature distribution, with reference to the center line O of the recording-medium conveyance passage, in terms of its lengthwise direction than any fixing device in accordance with the prior art, even after a substantial number of sheets of recording medium are continuously conveyed through the fixing device.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0090">Further, in this embodiment, the backup member <b>102</b>, which is in the form of a fixation pad formed of heat resistant resin, is attached to the stay <b>104</b> so that the lengthwise center (<b>102</b>D) of the backup member <b>102</b> aligns with the lengthwise center (<b>104</b>D) of the stay <b>104</b>, and also, with the centerline O of the recording-medium passage. The backup member <b>102</b> is responsible for the pressure distribution of the fixation nip N in terms of the lengthwise direction of the fixing device <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0091">As a substantial number of sheets of a recording medium are continuously conveyed through the fixing device, the backup member <b>102</b> is made to expand by the heat from the fixation belt <b>101</b> in the lengthwise direction of the fixing device <b>5</b>. Therefore, if the backup member <b>102</b> is solidly attached to the side plate <b>55</b>A, the pressure distribution of the fixation nip N becomes asymmetrical with reference to the centerline O of the recording-medium passage, as a large number of sheets of recording medium are continuously conveyed through the fixing device <b>5</b>. Further, the relationship between the temperature distribution and pressure distribution of the fixation nip N also becomes asymmetrical with reference to the centerline O of the recording-sheet conveyance passage. Consequently, the sheet P of recording medium becomes askew while it is conveyed through the fixation nip N. If the sheet P becomes askew in the fixation nip N, it sometimes occurs that the sheet P becomes misaligned with a toner image as the toner image is transferred (secondary transfer) onto the sheet P in the secondary transfer station between the pair of transfer rollers <b>3</b>, and/or the sheet P wrinkles in the fixation nip N.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0092">In this embodiment, however, the backup member <b>102</b> is attached to the stay <b>104</b> so that the lengthwise center of the backup member <b>102</b> aligns with the lengthwise center of the stay <b>104</b>, and also, it roughly aligns with the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage, before the fixation belt <b>101</b> is heated. Therefore, the fixing device in this embodiment is far less asymmetrical with reference to the recording medium passage centerline O in terms of the relationship between the temperature distribution and pressure distribution of the fixation nip N than a fixing device in accordance with the prior art. Therefore, the fixing device in this embodiment does not cause the misalignment between a sheet P of recording medium and a toner image, in the second transfer station, and the wrinkling of the sheet P in the fixation nip N.</p>
<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading>
<p id="p-0089" num="0093">The image forming apparatus in this embodiment, and its fixing device, are the same in structural arrangement in terms of the lengthwise direction of the fixing device, and also, the fixing operation in this embodiment is the same as the one in the first embodiment. Therefore, they are not going to be described here. This embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that the excitation coil <b>91</b> and outside magnetic core <b>92</b> are attached to the stay <b>104</b> in such a manner that in terms of the lengthwise direction of the fixing device <b>5</b>, the center of the excitation coil <b>91</b> and the center of the outside magnetic core <b>92</b> align with the center of the stay <b>104</b>. The pressure roller <b>105</b> and fixation belt unit <b>110</b> in this embodiment also are supported by the side plates <b>55</b> which are at the lengthwise ends of the fixing device, one for one, like the counterparts in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0094">More concretely, the side plate engaging portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the flange <b>103</b> of the fixation belt unit <b>110</b> is in engagement with of the side plate <b>55</b> (<b>55</b>A). The stay <b>104</b> is positioned (attached to) by the side plate <b>55</b>A, with the presence of the portion <b>103</b><i>c </i>of the flange <b>103</b> between the stay <b>104</b> and the side plate <b>55</b>A, whereas the core supporting member <b>107</b> is positioned (attached to) the stay <b>104</b> so that its center remains aligned with the lengthwise center of the stay <b>104</b>, and remains in the adjacencies of the sheet passage centerline O (<b>107</b>O). Therefore, the temperature distribution in the fixation nip N of the fixing device in this embodiment is significantly less asymmetrical in terms of the lengthwise direction of the fixing device, with reference to the sheet passage center O, even after a substantial number of sheets P of the recording medium are conveyed through the fixation nip N, than that of any fixing device in accordance with the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a perspective view of the fixing device (minus fixation belt <b>101</b>) in this embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a combination of a schematic exploded sectional view of the fixing device in this embodiment (minus fixation belt <b>101</b>) at a vertical plane perpendicular to the recording-medium-conveyance direction, prior to the heating of the fixation belt <b>101</b>, and a schematic exploded sectional view of the fixing device in this embodiment (minus fixation belt <b>101</b>) at a vertical plane perpendicular to the recording-medium-conveyance direction, after the conveyance of a substantial number of sheets of recording medium through the fixing device. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the excitation coil <b>91</b> which is a magnetic field generating means is held within the holder <b>93</b>, which is formed of heat resistant resin. The outside magnetic core <b>92</b> also is held within the holder <b>93</b>, and is on the outward side of the excitation coil <b>91</b>. The heat resistant resin as the material for the holder <b>93</b> in this embodiment is the same as the heat resistant resin as the material for the core supporting member <b>107</b>. The holder <b>93</b> is attached to the top plate <b>94</b>, which is made of a metallic substance. The top plate <b>94</b> is supported by the fixation belt unit <b>110</b> by its lengthwise ends. The portion <b>103</b><i>b </i>of the flange <b>103</b> of the fixation belt unit <b>110</b> is fitted in the groove <b>94</b><i>a </i>of the left side plate <b>94</b>A of the top plate <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0096">The holder <b>93</b> is provided with a positioning portion <b>93</b><i>a</i>, which corresponds in position to the centerline O of the recording-medium passage. The positioning portion <b>93</b><i>a </i>is fitted in the positioning hole <b>94</b><i>c </i>with which the top plate <b>94</b> is provided. Thus, the holder <b>93</b> is positioned so that its lengthwise center remains aligned with the lengthwise center of the fixing device.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0097">On the other hand, the top plate <b>96</b> is attached to the positioning portion <b>103</b><i>b </i>of the portion <b>103</b>A of the flange <b>103</b>. Therefore, the position of the top plate <b>94</b> is controlled by its side wall <b>94</b>A. In this embodiment, the position of the top plate <b>94</b> is controlled by the stay <b>104</b> through the portion <b>103</b>A of the flange <b>103</b>. However, the fixing device may be structured so that the position of the top plate <b>94</b> is directly controlled by the stay <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0098">Next, the thermal expansion of the top plate <b>94</b> and holder <b>93</b> in the lengthwise direction of the fixing device in this embodiment, which is similar to the thermal expansion of the counterparts in the first embodiment is described as in the first embodiment, is described.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0099">The materials of the top plate <b>94</b> and holder <b>93</b>, their coefficient of thermal expansion, and the amount of thermal expansion calculated with the use of Equation (1), are summarized in Table 2. It is assumed here that their positions are controlled with reference to one of the lengthwise ends of the fixing device, and L=400 mm; T=200&#xb0; C.; and T<b>0</b>=20&#xb0; C.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0101">As is evident from Table 2, the holder <b>93</b> is five times larger in the amount of thermal expansion than the top plate <b>94</b>. Thus, if the fixing device is structured so that the position of the holder <b>92</b> relative to the top plate <b>94</b> is controlled with reference to only one of the lengthwise ends of the fixing device (one of side walls of top plate <b>94</b>), the thermal expansion of the holder <b>93</b> makes the holder <b>93</b> asymmetrical with reference to the recording medium conveyance passage centerline O.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0102">In this embodiment, therefore, in order to solve the above described problem of the asymmetrical thermal expansion of the holder <b>93</b>, the holder <b>93</b>, which is significant in the amount of thermal expansion in the lengthwise direction of the fixing device, is attached to the center (<b>94</b><i>c</i>) of the top plate <b>94</b>, which corresponds in position to the centerline of the recording-medium conveyance passage. With the employment of this structural arrangement, the holder <b>93</b> symmetrically expands with reference to the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage, in terms of the lengthwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, therefore, even after the conveyance of a substantial number of sheets of recording medium through the fixing device, the holder <b>93</b> remains far less asymmetrical with reference to the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage than the holder (<b>93</b>) of any fixing device in accordance with the prior art. Therefore, the outside magnetic core <b>92</b> which is supported by the holder <b>93</b> and is responsible for the temperature distribution of in the fixation nip N remains far less asymmetrical with reference to the centerline O of the recording-medium conveyance passage than the counterpart of any fixing device in accordance with the prior art. Therefore, the fixing device in this embodiment is unlikely to suffer from the problem that the portion of its fixing member, which corresponds in position to one of the two areas of the recording-medium conveyance passage which are outside the recording medium path when a sheet of recording medium which is narrower than the widest sheet of recording medium usable with the fixing device is used as the recording medium, excessively increases in temperature, and therefore, suffers from thermal damage, or the problem that the portion of its fixing member, which corresponds in position to one side of the recording-medium passage with reference to the centerline O of the passage, excessively decreases in temperature, and causes thereby the &#x201c;cold offset&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">(Modification of Preceding Preferred Embodiments)</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0104">The various arts in the preceding preferred embodiments of the present invention described above may be employed in combination to realize an image heating device in accordance with the present invention. For example, the backup member <b>102</b> in the third embodiment may be attached to the stay <b>104</b> so that its center coincides with the center of the stay <b>104</b> in terms of the lengthwise direction, and the excitation coil <b>91</b> in the fourth embodiment may be attached to the stay <b>104</b> so that its center coincides with the center of the stay <b>104</b> in terms of the lengthwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0105">As described above, according to the present invention, it is possible to provide an image heating device which is significantly smaller in the temperature difference created between one side of its fixing member and the other, in terms of the lengthwise direction of the image heating device, by the thermal expansion of the resin of which the member for supporting magnetic cores is formed, than any fixing device in accordance with the prior art.</p>
