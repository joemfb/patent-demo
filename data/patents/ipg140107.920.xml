<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The production of liquefied gas offshore by production and liquefaction of natural gas requires the transfer of the liquefied gas between floating units or seabed based offshore units, between one seabed based offshore unit and one floating unit. Concepts for offshore transfer system between two units usually involve the use of heavy lifting cranes, and complex systems including hydraulics, position control, ship movement compensation, and a large number of parts. It is also important to avoid clashes between the different conduits spaced closely together. This is especially the case for current ship to ship transfer systems suitable for LNG, which must be maintained at a temperature of &#x2212;163&#xb0; C. Therefore, current concepts are very heavy and expensive, operator unfriendly, difficult to maintain, and prone to failure. All existing transfer concepts are not ideal to be used in harsh environment and harsh sea state.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this patent application, a preferred offshore transfer system configuration would be a tandem offloading configuration between two vessels. In a tandem offloading configuration the carrier will position itself in line behind the process vessel or FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading unit). The position will be in-line with the current since the FPSO will weathervane. In between the FPSO and carrier, a hawser line will be holding the carrier at a certain distance from the FPSO. To insure that the carrier will not clash with the FPSO, back trust should be provided by the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a tandem offloading configuration, it is also required to have means that will allow one or more offloading hoses to be lowered into the sea and will provide buoyancy at the end fitting locations, but also means to transport offloading hose(s) in the vicinity of the carrier. Further, one or more hoses (floating or submerged) needs to be lifted up from water level to a certain height, for example the vessels deck, which could be 10-30 m above water level, to be connected to a fluid piping manifold. The use of local cranes and/or winches is not always possible as the overall weight of the hose(s) to be lifted up is too large, because the lifting capacity is limited, or they are not located at the required/needed place on the deck. Moreover, installing additional lifting equipment or modifications on existing lifting systems onboard carriers is not a preferred solution, as it needs to be done on each carrier that must be connected to the hoses.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A solution that avoids any additional modifications to be made on board the carriers is advantageous as it can be used for any standard carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The proposed system, manufactured under the trademark CryoRide&#x2122; by the applicant, is a key system to enable an easiest, fastest and cheapest offloading connection between two offshore units.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this patent application the term &#x201c;transfer hose&#x201d; is used to designate all types of transfer hoses which are suitable for the transfer of hydrocarbons, in particular cryogenic fluids (at &#x2212;163&#xb0; C.) but also for the transfer of liquefied gas such as LPG and liquefied CO2.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0024" num="0026">In the embodiments chosen, there is a LNG-FPSO in tandem configuration with a LNG carrier. The transfer hoses are cryogenic transfer hose suitable for the transfer of LNG. However, it must be noted that the invention is applicable to any type of offshore transfer system between any types of offshore units.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>show different possible configurations of the hoses between the two vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0028">It is preferred in a LNG loading or offloading situation where the LNG FPSO or FSRU (Floating Storage and Regas Unit) or offshore unit <b>1</b> is spread or weathervaning moored, that the LNG carrier <b>2</b> is placed at a certain, safe distance during the transfer of LNG. In configurations where the offshore unit <b>1</b> is seabed based the LNG carrier <b>2</b> can be nearer to the unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0029">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>show an overall offshore midship, tandem configuration, a cryogenic fluid transfer arrangement between a LNG process vessel <b>1</b> and a LNG carrier <b>2</b>, with at least one cryogenic transfer hose <b>3</b> and one gas return line <b>4</b> which includes a traditional tandem offloading between a spread or turret moored vessel and a hydrocarbon transfer carrier, but which is optimized for an offshore LNG transfer situation. This offshore offloading configuration includes a spread or turret moored gas liquefaction barge or a spread or turret moored LNG FPSO <b>1</b> to which a standard LNG carrier <b>2</b> is connected via at least one special, extra long hawser(s) <b>5</b> and LNG is transferred between the two vessels via a relatively long floating, aerial or submerged cryogenic transfer system which could include one or more cryogenic hoses <b>3</b> or cryogenic hard pipes. For redundancy or stability reasons it could be necessary to have more than one of those special hawsers <b>5</b> between the two floating vessels <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>. The special hawser <b>5</b> according to the invention can be 50-300 m long and hence keeps the LNG carrier <b>2</b> at a safe distance of at least 90 m. At least one, more likely two or more tug boats will tow and keep the carrier <b>2</b> away from the spread moored LNG FPSO/FSRU <b>1</b> and ensure the correct heading during loading or unloading the LNG. In this way it is possible to load or offload LNG for situations where the carrier <b>2</b> can stay within the 90 degrees zone of the LNG FPSO or FSRU <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, it is clearly shown that three hoses <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are going onto the same side of the LNG-Carrier <b>2</b> midship manifold. Two cryogenic transfer hoses <b>3</b> and one gas return line <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, it is also clearly shown that two cryogenic transfer hoses <b>3</b> are going into the portside midship manifold of the carrier <b>2</b> and on starboard midship manifold one gas return line <b>4</b> is going back to the LNG-FPSO <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, the configuration is similar to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, except that it is between a LNGC <b>2</b> and an offshore unit <b>1</b> which is non weathervaning.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0033">The possible configurations according to the present invention should not be limited to those shown, and could include all types of possible configurations such as a configuration where:

<p id="p-0032" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>to <b>2</b><i>d </i>show the multi-function unit <b>6</b> or CryoRide&#x2122; according to the present invention. The CryoRide&#x2122; design uses a modular and easy adaptable concept. Based on the needs of operators, location and projects, different line configurations can be chosen. The main functions of the CryoRide&#x2122; is to function as a fixation point holding the end fittings <b>7</b> of the cryogenic hoses <b>3</b> and required cryogenic component needed for this offloading procedure. It also needs to function as a floating structure when the end fittings <b>7</b> and the components are merged in water. Third main function of the CryoRide&#x2122; is to lift the end fittings <b>7</b> and cryogenic components to the level of the midship manifold <b>8</b> of the LNG-Carrier <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039">An other main function is that the system should be able to shut down and disconnect in case of any emergency and a last main function is that the system allows itself to purge the remaining LNG in the transfer hoses <b>3</b> into the storage tanks of the offshore unit <b>1</b> and LNG-Carrier <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0040">The preferred base structure of the CryoRide&#x2122; is a tubular structure <b>9</b> providing buoyancy and known assembly technologies for cryogenic service. Low pressurized wheels <b>10</b> are fitted to the CryoRide&#x2122; structure to provide additional buoyancy to the system. The wheels <b>10</b> also act as fenders in case of a collision with the LNG carrier hull or the offshore unit hull and they are used to reduce the friction coefficient during the lifting against the carrier's hull by means of rotation provided by a composite bearing arrangement in the axis of the wheels <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c </i>it is clearly shown that three rigid spool pieces <b>11</b> are fixed to the structure of the CryoRide&#x2122;. In this embodiment 3 rigid spool pieces are shown and at least 2 spool pieces are needed to create a loop between two transfer lines or hoses. The main function of the spool pieces is to transfer the dynamic loads onto the pipe structure induced by the offloading hoses. The spool pieces <b>11</b> also function as an interface for the aerial jumper hoses <b>12</b>. The spool pieces <b>11</b> are structurally inter-connected but only the two cryogenic transfer hoses or export lines <b>3</b> are cross-flow connected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It should also be mentioned that in some cases, when the gas return line has an equivalent design as the cryogenic transfer hoses and hence is able to withstand cryogenic fluids, it can be in fluid connection with one cryogenic transfer hose for the precooling of the hoses <b>3</b>, before starting the offloading.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0042">An insulation layer prevents thermal conduction from the spool pieces <b>11</b> to the rest of the CryoRide&#x2122; structure. One end of the spool pieces <b>11</b> is connected to an Emergency Response System (ERS) <b>13</b> and to the cryogenic offloading hose <b>3</b> while the other end is connected to a jumper hose <b>12</b>. The jumper hose is a light, flexible, non insulated cryogenic hose with basic outer protection. A lifting frame <b>14</b> is connecting the three jumper hoses <b>12</b> together for handling procedures and also to lock the hoses during storage. The length and flexibility of the jumper hoses <b>12</b> is determined to provide the CryoRide&#x2122; with the widest operating envelope possible to connect the cryogenic transfer hoses <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> on different non-dedicated LNG carriers' manifold arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0043">The ERS <b>13</b> will be hydraulically actuated by hydraulic accumulators located onboard the structure which accumulators will be reloaded between each offloading at the offshore unit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d </i>shows another embodiment, where the CryoRide&#x2122; is provided with three cryogenic spool pieces <b>11</b> are mounted on the tubular structure <b>9</b> to fixate three transfer hoses <b>3</b>,<b>4</b>. In between the hoses and the spool pieces an Emergency Release System (ERS) <b>13</b> provides the required decoupling of the hoses during an emergency disconnection.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0045">Between the ERS and the transfer hose flanges/end fittings, three more spool pieces interlink the transfer export lines. This will enable to purge the transfer hoses after disconnection with the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0046">Three aerial jumper hoses <b>12</b> are mounted on the other side of the cryogenic spool pieces. They are supported by a hydraulic system HS guiding the aerial jumper hoses towards the carrier's manifold flanges, it is then possible to accommodate the manifold envelope height with respect to the type of carrier and/or manifold. This system is designed to make the final connection without obstructing any equipment or structures on the carrier's deck. The support system of the aerial jumper hoses <b>12</b> is driven by two hydraulic cylinders <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047">The aerial jumper hoses <b>12</b> are equipped with bend restrictors in order not to exceed the minimum bending radius. On the end fittings of the aerial jumper hoses <b>12</b>, three manual QC/DCs are fitted to make the final connection with the carrier. The QC/DCs are blind flanged during transportation to avoid sea water and moisture ingress.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>j </i>show the sequential steps of pull-out, transport, lift and connect of multiple floating hoses between a LNG process vessel and an LNGC. The CryoRide&#x2122; will be transported to the FPSO on a supply vessel or installation vessel. The floating hoses stored on the hose reels at the stern of the FPSO will be lowered to sea level and lifted on the lay down area of the installation/supply vessel. The hoses and the CryoRide&#x2122; will be connected together on the vessel and then dropped back in the water. The CryoRide&#x2122; can then be towed back to its storage position on the FPSO.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0049">The CryoRide&#x2122; is stored on the deck attached to a hydraulic A-frame system <b>14</b>. This has the advantage to provide a good access to the CryoRide&#x2122; for maintenance and re-pressurizing of the hydraulic accumulators. The A-frame <b>14</b> will be located behind the three hose reels <b>15</b> at the stern of the LNG-FPSO <b>1</b> where the cryogenic hoses <b>3</b> are stored. The hose end fittings <b>7</b> will be permanently bolted to the CryoRide&#x2122; hose interface. The two hose reels on the outside will be angled to accommodate the spacing constraint on the CryoRide&#x2122;. The spacing constraint is according to international standards (SIGTTO/OCIMF recommendations for manifolds for refrigerated liquefied natural gas carriers).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>shows the lowering or launching the CryoRide&#x2122;. The CryoRide&#x2122; will be flipped overboard by means of the A-frame <b>14</b>. After the CryoRide&#x2122; is decoupled from the A-frame <b>14</b>, winches <b>16</b> are attached to it, lowering the CryoRide&#x2122; into the sea, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>c</i>. Parallel to this operation the hose reels <b>15</b> will be unwind by electromotor and pinions driving a turntable attached to the reels.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0051">In another embodiment (not shown), there would be ramps integrated in the hull of the FPSO that will function as launching platform. The hose reels are located above the launch platform and the hoses are pre-connected with the CryoRide&#x2122;. On the motor of the hose reels the CryoRide&#x2122; will be launched into the water or reeled back in onto the launching platform. It is also a location for the re-pressurizing of the accumulators and for maintenance of the system. In this embodiment, the hose reels will operate the launching and pulling in of the CryoRide&#x2122;.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>d </i>and <b>3</b><i>e</i>, it is clearly shown that a support vessel <b>18</b> will connect a pulling rope <b>17</b> with a hook onto the pulling bar or lugs of the CryoRide&#x2122; and tow it along with the cryogenic floating hoses <b>3</b> to the LNGC <b>2</b>. The hose reels <b>15</b> will need to release the hoses <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> at different velocities (faster for the foremost hose in the tandem configuration).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0053">The next step is the lifting preparation of the CryoRide&#x2122;. The CryoRide&#x2122; unit has a central sheave block stored with a length of 85 m synthetic or steel wire rope wired through a pivoting sheave constructed on the CryoRide&#x2122; frame. On the sheave block a shackle will make the connection with the strong point on the vessel located also central regarding the midship manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>f </i>shows clearly the shackle on the sheave side being picked up with the manifold crane <b>19</b> and connected to a strong point on the LNG carrier's deck central regarding the manifold deck. Then the sheave block is lifted to deck level with the manifold crane <b>19</b> and connected to the lug. The pulling load line of the sheave block rigging will be routed towards the most convenient mooring winch <b>20</b> located at stern or bow. The wire rope should be routed where there are the fewer obstacles on the deck.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0055">The lifting is then possible, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>g</i>, the mooring winch <b>20</b> which is placed near the bow or the stern area of the LNG carrier, can be connected to the CryoRide&#x2122; and lift it up the hull up to about <b>1</b>m below deck level. During this lifting process, the manifold crane can be used to guide and/or displace the multi function unit in a horizontal direction along the length of the vessel so that in the end the multi function unit is placed within the connection envelop near the manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0056">Another lifting embodiment is to use the two mooring winches on the stern and bow of the LNG-Carrier <b>2</b>. This will be a &#x201c;two point lifting&#x201d; solution.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0057">Length of synthetic ropes and adequate lifting equipment with messenger lines are also fitted onboard the CryoRide&#x2122; making the lifting procedure easier.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0058">The snubbing chains will be connected to the available lugs on the deck of the LNG carrier in order to secure the CryoRide&#x2122;.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>h </i>and <b>3</b><i>i </i>show how the jumper hoses are flipped over during lifting and positioned at the manifold location. The manifold crane <b>19</b> will be connected to the flexible jumper hose <b>12</b> lifting frame on its rotating lifting point. The blind flanges can be removed and a manual or hydraulic QCDC (already connected to the jumper hoses <b>12</b>) will be connected to the manifold flange.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0060">Another embodiment is to have cables placed within the jumper hoses <b>12</b> to control the bending of the jumper hose <b>12</b>. This way the bending in one plane is allowed and limited thanks to stoppers, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>j</i>. A small winch installed on the CryoRide&#x2122; could make the jumper hoses <b>12</b> bend in the desired direction at the desired moment without requiring the use of the manifold crane <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>k</i>, the cryogenic transfer hose is now connected and secured, conventional export of LNG can start with cool down as discussed and shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0062">When the offloading is over, the disconnection of jumper hoses is held as follow: after cool down, jumper hoses <b>12</b> are disconnected and stored back on the CryoRide&#x2122; using the manifold area crane <b>19</b> on the LNG carrier <b>2</b>. The CryoRide&#x2122; will be lowered back into the sea and the support vessel <b>18</b> will store the rigging equipment back onto the CryoRide&#x2122;. Then the support vessel <b>18</b> will tow the CryoRide&#x2122; back and disconnect the towing cable<b>17</b>. The hose reel <b>15</b> will then reel the CryoRide&#x2122; back into the LNG-FPSO <b>1</b> or will be lifted up back onto the A-Frame support structure<b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0063">As mentioned above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows how the hoses are interconnected in order to form a closed loop according to the present invention. It is clearly shown that the cryogenic hoses <b>3</b> are flow connected, hence forming a closed loop. This is enabling the cryogenic transfer hoses to be cooled down before the transfer starts. In fact, a cold fluid within the interconnected hoses is pumped in order to precool the hoses before offloading.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0064">Another key point of having such a closed loop is that in case of an emergency, the lower and upper parts of the ERS <b>13</b> are decoupled by the mean of a PERC.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0065">The two cryogenic transfer hoses <b>3</b> with trapped LNG are inter-connected by the spool piece <b>11</b> and can be purged using nitrogen form the LNGC. A similar spool piece <b>11</b> inter-connects the cryogenic transfer hoses <b>3</b> ends and creates a loop in order to purge out the remaining LNG to the FPSO storage tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows how the flexible jumper hose with interconnected pivoting bend restrictor elements can be brought towards the manifold with cables that are guided within the bend restrictor elements and which are connected to one or more small auxiliary winches on the multi function unit. If one cable is drawn-in and the other is paid-out the jumper hose end flips over and is moved towards the manifold end (over bending is restricted). In a reverse action the jumper hose is forced again in a storage position on the multi function unit.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>d </i>show the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d </i>in a sequence when the CryoRide&#x2122; is disconnected from the manifold of the carrier <b>2</b>. In these figures it clearly appears that the hydraulic system is used to bend the aerial jumper hoses <b>12</b>. In this embodiment it is also important to note that the CryoRide&#x2122; is provided with lifting equipment that enables it to lift itself autonomously out of the water against the hull of the carrier. Hence, as shown in the particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>d </i>and <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>d</i>, two hydraulic winches are mounted on the CryoRide&#x2122;, the winch cables <b>28</b> are connected to two strong points at the carrier deck level at midship manifold location. This connection will be achieved via messenger lines pick up from a supporting tug boat.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0068">Hydraulic power will be supplied also from the support tug boat.

<p id="p-0064" num="0075">Further, guiding means are provided for the lifting of the multi function unit.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0076">It should also be noted that the transfer hose as well as the CryoRide&#x2122; can be stored on the FPSO.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0077">Further it appears clearly that a third wheel is provided in this embodiment. This third wheel has two main functions: it enables to protect the equipment located on top of the CryoRide&#x2122; (such as the hydraulic system and the jumper aerial hoses <b>12</b>) when it approaches the hull of the carrier. Further, it enables a smoother transition from the horizontal position to the vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0078">Another alternative design according to the present invention is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>. First to get a much more compact design, especially a much more flat design of the multi-function unit, the jumper hose <b>12</b> is shorted and the flip-over movement is not required anymore. An arrangement comprising several swivels <b>25</b> (such as motorized swivels) enables the connection of the jumper hose end and the manifold <b>8</b> of the carrier. The jumper hose <b>12</b> can be already installed on the multi-function unit <b>6</b> or can be connected to the unit <b>6</b> just before connection with the manifold <b>8</b>, when the multi-function unit <b>6</b> is at the right height and the access to it is easier.</p>

The support vessel will deliver the lifting means <b>21</b> to the LNG-carrier <b>2</b> where it will be lifted onto the deck of the carrier with the manifold crane (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0080">This mobile lifting means <b>21</b> allows lifting the CryoRide&#x2122; <b>6</b> out of the sea onto the hull and lifts the CryoRide&#x2122; <b>6</b> to the required height in order to connect the flexible jumper hoses <b>12</b> to the manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0081">The lifting mean is bolted to the deck using the dedicated sea fastening means in order to make the connection with the mobile lifting means.</p>
