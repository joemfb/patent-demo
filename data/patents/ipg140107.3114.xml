<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Conventional projectiles, such as bombs or missiles, have movable fins which help to steer the projectiles toward a particular target. In certain situations, such as prior to launch or during transportation, a locking mechanism holds the fins in a zero angle of attack position relative to the projectile's centerline. Such locking minimizes wear, overstressing, and the possibility of damage to the fins and associated steering systems. Additionally, the locking mechanism allows for release of the fins at the time of use so that the fins can be driven to computer controlled positions.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional locking mechanisms can be transitioned from a locked state to an unlocked state in a variety of ways. For example, the locking mechanism can be configured as an explosive release mechanism having an explosive squib. The explosive squib can include a small tube that contains an explosive substance and a detonator disposed along a length of the tube. Initially, the explosive squib holds a release mechanism against the fins of the guided munitions to maintain the fins in an aligned or non-deployed position. When the detonator receives an electric discharge signal, the detonator detonates the explosive squib to release the lock mechanism. With such a release, the lock mechanism allows the fins to move from the non-deployed or locked position to a deployed position. Other conventional locking mechanisms include brakes, solenoids, and fin lock release motors configured to hold the fins in a retracted or stationary state and release the fins to allow the fins to move to a deployed position.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition to the locking mechanism, conventional projectiles can also include a driving mechanism to adjust the position of the fins during operation. For example, certain projectiles include a Control Actuation System (CAS) having an actuator, such as a motor, and an electronic controller, such as a flight computer. In use, the actuator is configured to adjust the position of the fins in response to steering commands received from the controller to steer the projectile along a flight path toward a target.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As indicated above, certain conventional projectiles include both a locking mechanism and a driving mechanism to control operation of the projectile fins. With such a configuration, the use of conventional locking mechanisms can affect the overall cost, weight, and reliability associated with the projectiles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, the locking mechanism can be configured as an explosive release mechanism. While conventional explosive release mechanisms have a minimal effect on the overall weight of a projectile, the explosive release mechanisms are one-time use devices that do not allow for resettability without incurring a relatively high replacement cost. Also, explosive devices have a reliability rating, thereby impacting the overall reliability of the projectile.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While other conventional locking mechanisms such as brakes, solenoids, and fin lock release motors are resettable, these locking mechanisms add to the cost and weight a projectile when taken in conjunction with the projectile's driving mechanism. Furthermore, one of these locking mechanisms can be added to a projectile as a distinct mechanical component, separate from the driving mechanism. The addition of a separate mechanical assembly can reduce the overall reliability and increase weight, power draw, and cost of the projectile with respect to the projectile's operation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">By contrast to conventional locking mechanisms, embodiments of the present invention relate to a shift lock assembly for each of projectile's fins. In one arrangement, a drive motor is configured to operate the shift lock assembly to unlock drive shaft that secures a set of projectile fins.

The use of the shift lock assembly reduces the costs experienced with conventional locking mechanisms.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a shift lock assembly for each projectile fin. In one arrangement, a single drive motor is configured to operate the shift lock assembly to unlock a drive shaft that secures each projectile fin. Once disposed in an unlocked position, the drive motor is further configured to operate the shift lock assembly to cause and the drive shaft to drive the projectile's fin to a commanded position. The use of the shift lock assembly reduces the costs experienced with conventional locking mechanisms. For example, motors, electromechanically brakes, solenoids, and explosive devices found in conventional locking mechanisms are typically more expensive to procure and install compared to the shift lock assembly. Additionally, shift lock assembly weighs less than the motors and brakes found in conventional locking mechanisms. Accordingly use of the shift lock assembly can reduce the overall weight of the projectile, compared to conventional locking mechanisms. Furthermore, because the shift lock assembly adds relatively few mechanical components to the projectile, the reliability of the shift lock assembly is relatively higher than conventional locking mechanisms such as motors, solenoids, and explosive devices and their related drive electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a shift lock system <b>10</b>, according to one embodiment. The shift lock system <b>10</b> includes a drive motor <b>12</b>, a drive shaft <b>14</b>, and a shift lock assembly <b>16</b>. As shown, the drive shaft <b>14</b> caries the shift lock assembly <b>16</b> at a first end <b>18</b> and has an opposing second end <b>20</b> rotatably carried by a base member <b>22</b>. The drive shaft <b>14</b> also drives a ball nut <b>24</b> disposed between the first and second ends <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. The ball nut <b>24</b> operatively couples the drive shaft <b>14</b> to an output shaft <b>26</b>, such as a fin interface of one or more projectile fins. For example, as illustrated, the drive shaft <b>14</b> defines a set of threads <b>28</b> that extend along a longitudinal axis <b>30</b> of the drive shaft <b>14</b> and that mate with a corresponding set of threads disposed within the ball nut <b>24</b>. As the drive shaft <b>14</b> rotates about a clockwise or counterclockwise direction relative to the base <b>22</b>, intersection of the ball screw threads <b>28</b> and the crank arm housing threads (not shown) causes the ball nut <b>24</b> to translate along axis <b>30</b> to rotate the output shaft <b>26</b> in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction about a longitudinal axis <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The motor <b>12</b> is configured to mechanically couple to the shift lock assembly <b>16</b> to both unlock the drive shaft <b>14</b> from a locked position and to drive the drive shaft <b>14</b> to position the output shaft <b>26</b>. For example, the motor <b>12</b> is disposed in electrical communication with a controller <b>36</b>, such as a processor and memory, which receives load positioning signals <b>37</b> from a flight control center <b>38</b>. While the flight control center <b>38</b> can provide the signals <b>37</b> in a variety of ways, in one arrangement, the flight control center <b>38</b> provides the signals <b>37</b> from a remote location. Based upon the signals <b>37</b> received by the controller <b>36</b>, the controller <b>36</b> commands the motor <b>12</b> to adjust the position of the drive shaft <b>14</b>, via the shift lock assembly <b>16</b>, to move the load <b>26</b> to a desired position. For example, when used as part of a projectile, such as a missile, the controller <b>36</b> commands the motor <b>12</b> to adjust the position of the fins through the output shaft <b>26</b> to steer the projectile towards a target.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, an arrangement of the shift lock assembly <b>16</b> includes a drive member <b>40</b>, a shift mechanism <b>42</b> disposed between the drive member <b>40</b> and a ground plate <b>44</b>, and an drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> coupled to the drive shaft <b>14</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the ground plate <b>44</b> is configured to be secured to an object, such as a projectile housing, to minimize movement of the ground plate <b>44</b> relative to the shift lock assembly <b>16</b> during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one arrangement, the drive member <b>40</b> is configured to rotatably couple to the drive motor <b>12</b>. For example, the drive mechanism <b>40</b> is configured as a gear having teeth that mesh with the corresponding teeth of a gear <b>50</b> carried by the motor <b>12</b>. As the gear <b>50</b> of the motor <b>12</b> rotates in a counterclockwise direction, the drive member <b>40</b>, in response, rotates in a clockwise direction. The drive member <b>40</b> is configured to operate in conjunction with the shift mechanism <b>42</b>, as will be described below, to unlock the drive shaft <b>14</b> from a locked state and to drive the drive shaft <b>14</b> and corresponding output shaft <b>26</b> to a commanded position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The shift mechanism <b>42</b> configured to move between a first position and a second position relative to the drive member <b>40</b> and the ground plate <b>44</b> to selectively couple the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> to one of the ground plate <b>44</b> and the drive member <b>40</b>. For example, the shift mechanism <b>42</b> includes a spring <b>48</b> disposed between the shift mechanism <b>42</b> and a portion of the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> as well as the ground plate <b>44</b>. As will be described above, expansion of the spring <b>48</b> from a compressed state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, to an expanded state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, translates the shift mechanism <b>42</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>30</b> of the drive shaft <b>14</b> from the first position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>) to the second position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). While the spring <b>48</b> can be configured in a variety of ways, in one arrangement, the spring <b>48</b> has a biased-open configuration and is configured to generate a force of about five pounds when compressed between the shift mechanism <b>42</b> and the ground plate <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As indicated above, the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> is coupled to the drive shaft <b>14</b> at the first end <b>18</b>. While the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> can be coupled to the drive shaft <b>14</b> in a variety of ways, in one arrangement, the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> is splined and fastened, such as via a bolt, to the drive shaft <b>14</b>. Furthermore, the shift mechanism <b>42</b> is moveably coupled to the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> defines an opening or slot <b>52</b> configured to contain at least part of a mating support <b>54</b> extending from the shift mechanism <b>42</b> along an axis <b>56</b> that is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>30</b> of the drive shaft <b>14</b>. Interaction between the slot <b>52</b> and the mating support <b>54</b> secures the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> to the shift mechanism <b>42</b> when the shift mechanism <b>42</b> couples the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> to either the ground plate <b>44</b> or the drive member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> illustrate operation of the shift lock assembly <b>16</b>, according to one embodiment. In an initial state, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the shift mechanism <b>42</b> is disposed in a first position to secure or lock the position of the drive shaft <b>14</b> thereby minimizing rotation of the drive shaft <b>14</b> and corresponding movement of the attached output shaft <b>26</b>. For example, the shift mechanism <b>42</b> includes a ground plate mating portion <b>58</b> disposed at an end of the mating support <b>54</b> and a drive member mating portion <b>60</b> disposed at an opposing end of the mating support <b>54</b>. In the first position, as shown, the ground plate mating portion <b>58</b> is disposed within a mating opening <b>61</b> defined by the ground plate <b>44</b> with the mating support <b>54</b> aligned with the slot <b>52</b> of the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b>. Also in the first position, the drive member mating portion <b>60</b> abuts an opposing face <b>62</b> of the drive member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With such positioning, the face <b>62</b> of the drive member <b>40</b> pushes against the drive member mating portion <b>60</b>, thereby causing a ring <b>64</b> of the shift mechanism <b>42</b> to compress the spring <b>48</b> against the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b>. Furthermore, with the ground plate mating portion <b>58</b> disposed within the ground plate mating portion <b>58</b> and the mating support <b>54</b> disposed within the slot <b>52</b> of the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b>, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the shift mechanism <b>42</b> couples the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> to the ground plate <b>44</b>, as indicated by arrows <b>65</b>. Accordingly, during an initial phase of operation, as the motor <b>12</b> rotates gear <b>50</b>, because the shift mechanism <b>42</b> is decoupled from the drive member <b>40</b>, the drive member <b>40</b> can rotate relative to the drive shaft <b>14</b> and the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> without causing either the drive shaft <b>14</b> or the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a subsequent state, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, the shift mechanism <b>42</b> is disposed in a second position to couple the drive shaft <b>14</b> to the drive member <b>40</b> and decouple the drive shaft <b>14</b> from the ground plate <b>44</b> to allow rotation of the drive shaft <b>14</b> in response to rotation of the drive member <b>40</b>. For example, the drive member <b>40</b> defines a mating opening <b>68</b>, such as extending from the face <b>62</b> of the drive member <b>40</b>. When the mating opening <b>68</b> aligns with the drive member mating portion <b>60</b> of the shift mechanism <b>42</b>, such alignment allows the shift mechanism <b>42</b> to translate from the first position to the second position, as will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, in the case where an operator wants to unlock the drive shaft <b>14</b>, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the operator transmits a control signal <b>37</b> to the controller <b>36</b> to cause the motor <b>12</b> to rotate the drive member <b>40</b> along a clockwise direction. In response, the drive member <b>40</b> rotates to a first rotational position when a stop portion <b>72</b> extending from the face <b>62</b> of the drive member <b>40</b> abuts the drive member mating portion <b>60</b>. At this point, the operator provides a control signal <b>37</b> to the controller <b>36</b> to cause the motor <b>12</b> to rotate the drive member <b>40</b> along a clockwise direction <b>74</b> for a particular number of Hall counts to a second rotational position. At the second rotational position, the mating opening <b>68</b> of the drive member <b>40</b> aligns with the drive member mating portion <b>60</b> of the shift mechanism <b>42</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With the mating opening <b>68</b> aligned with the drive member mating portion <b>60</b>, the spring <b>48</b> expands along the longitudinal axis <b>30</b> of the drive shaft <b>14</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, to push the ring <b>64</b> toward the face <b>62</b> of the drive member <b>40</b>, insert the drive member mating portion <b>60</b> of the shift mechanism <b>42</b> into the mating opening <b>68</b> of the drive member <b>40</b>, and disengage the mating support <b>54</b> from the ground plate mating portion <b>58</b>. With such positioning, the shift mechanism <b>42</b> couples the drive shaft <b>14</b> to the drive member <b>40</b> and decouples the drive shaft <b>14</b> from the ground plate <b>44</b> to unlock the drive shaft <b>14</b>. With the drive shaft <b>14</b> coupled to both the drive member <b>40</b> and the drive shaft drive mechanism <b>46</b> via the shift mechanism <b>42</b>, continued rotation of the drive member <b>40</b> by the motor <b>12</b>, indicated as arrows <b>80</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> drives the drive shaft <b>14</b>, as indicated by arrows <b>82</b>, and positions an associated output shaft <b>26</b> at a particular commanded position.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As indicate above, the use of the shift ring assembly <b>16</b> allows a single motor <b>12</b> to drive both an drive shaft locking mechanism and an output shaft positioning mechanism. Accordingly, use of the shift lock assembly reduces the costs experienced with conventional locking mechanisms and reduces the overall weight of the projectile, compared to conventional locking mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While various embodiments of the invention have been particularly shown and described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, as indicated above, the shift ring assembly <b>16</b> is disposed at a first end <b>18</b> of the drive shaft <b>14</b>. Such indication is by way of example only. In one arrangement, the shift lock assembly <b>16</b> can be placed at any location relative to the drive motor <b>12</b> to properly balance inertia, backlash, and loads.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As indicated above, the shift ring assembly <b>16</b> is utilized to both lock and allow positioning of projectile fins in a projectile. Such indication is by way of example only. The shift lock assembly <b>16</b> can be applied to any mechanical system that requires a load to be locked into a position, such as for transportation and storage, and then shifted into an operational state where a motor can drive it to a commanded position using only the motor power that drives the load.</p>
