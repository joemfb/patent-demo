<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a National Stage application of PCT/AU2009/000336 entitled &#x201c;Electronic Component Configuration&#x201d;, filed on Mar. 25, 2009, which claims priority from Australian Provisional Patent Application No. 2008901434, filed on Mar. 25, 2008, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to complex electronic devices, for example medical prosthesis systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Complex electronic devices can incorporate many integrated circuits (ICs) which each provide different functionalities which cooperate to provide a working system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Particular examples of complex electronic devices are complex medical devices, for example implantable hearing systems. An implantable hearing system typically consists of an external part and an internal part (i.e. the so-called implant). External and internal parts communicate with each other using a wireless link through the skin. Both internal and external parts can consist of one or multiple components, for example:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">An external sound processor, capturing the microphone signal and conditioning the signal before sending it to the implant, is a typical component of the external part. Other external components could be a remote control, a programming interface, a diagnostics device, etc.;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">The internal part typically has a stimulator component that is responsible for stimulating the auditory nerve. Internal components also can include an implantable battery, implantable microphone, a receiver for a wireless link, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">Each of these components operates according to its own functional requirements. The cooperation of these individual functionalities provides a complex system which together provides the normal working operation of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">Continued developments in hearing devices are driven by market demands. Some demands relate to better signal processing to offer more hearing performance. Other demands include additional functionality to make the device more user friendly, for example an enhanced user interface, and connectivity to a PC or to wireless equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">When facing developments related to enhanced signal processing and functionality two challenging problems need to be resolved:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0012">Miniaturization so that everything fits in as small a volume as possible, and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0013">Low power consumption to achieve an acceptable battery life.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">It is proposed that both challenges can be met by including integrated circuits (ICs) in the system. Hence there is an expected future trend towards the incorporation of more ICs within the same system. Multiple ICs like microcontrollers or Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) (but also other ICs like wireless transceivers) are expected to be used more widely within the one implantable hearing system.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">However, there are a number of disadvantages when using ICs for implantable hearing devices because they require a collective number of very specific functionalities that are not found in other devices on the market.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">The specific functionalities for implantable hearing devices often require that custom-made ICs are used (i.e. application specific ICs or ASICs) and installed in the device during manufacture. Design, verification and qualification of such custom-made ICs for medical implantable devices is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, to follow the trend of installing an increased number of custom-made ICs into a hearing device system results in a marked increase in the cost of manufacture.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">In a broad form, embodiments of the present invention provide a construction in which a common IC can be used for a variety of functions, with the IC itself determining which function and hence which parts of firmware or software to enable or load based on the position of the IC in the configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">As will be discussed further below, in an embodiment, upon system initialization, the generic integrated circuit (also referred to herein as a common IC) executes an initialization program that allows the generic integrated circuit to detect where in a system the generic integrated circuit has been installed. The generic integrated circuit determines where in the system it has been installed by determining which of its connecting pins have been electrically connected during installation. Upon determining where in the system it has been installed, the generic integrated circuit downloads a required operating program from an external source, the required operating program, upon execution by the generic integrated circuit, providing the required individual operating functionality for the integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">Embodiments of the present invention may advantageously employ the use of one or more generic integrated circuits capable of providing any one of a number of required functionalities installed during manufacture the system. Upon system initialization, each generic integrated circuit configures itself to its actual required functionality on the basis of where it has been installed within the system. Hence, specific IC customization in advance is not a prerequisite of manufacture, and hence costs can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">Embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to particular illustrative examples. However, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention are applicable to any electronic system which uses multiple ICs. While the following description pertains to an implantable hearing prosthesis system, the present invention may be applied with any suitable hearing prosthesis system, for example a hybrid electrical/acoustic system, a cochlear implant system, an implantable hearing aid system, a middle ear stimulator or any other suitable hearing prosthesis. It may be applied to a system with totally implanted components, or to a system which additionally includes one or more external components. It will be appreciated that the present implementation is described for illustrative purposes, and its features are not intended to be limitative of the scope of the present invention. Many variations and additions are possible within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an implantable hearing prosthesis system <b>10</b>. The system <b>10</b> illustrated includes three components: a remote control <b>12</b>, a sound processor <b>14</b> and an implant <b>16</b>. It will be appreciated that the illustrated system <b>10</b> is but one example and that the invention can be applied to a wide variety of system configurations with different numbers and types of components. As shown, each component includes a number of ICs which each provide different operating functionalities for the respective component in which the IC is installed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">The remote control <b>12</b> is illustrated as having a microcontroller IC <b>18</b> and a wireless transceiver IC <b>20</b>. The same wireless transceiver IC <b>20</b> is also installed in the sound processor <b>14</b> and the implant <b>16</b>. The sound processor <b>14</b> additionally includes a DSP IC <b>26</b>. The same DSP IC <b>26</b> is also found in the implant <b>16</b>. The implant additionally includes a stimulator IC <b>22</b> and an implantable battery <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">Given that the same DSP IC <b>26</b> can be used in the sound processor <b>14</b> and the implant <b>16</b>, these may be considered to be generic DSP ICs in respect of their architecture and functional capabilities. However, in the present embodiment, the required functionality of the sound processor <b>14</b> DSP IC <b>26</b> will be different from the required functionality of the implant <b>16</b> DSP IC <b>26</b>. In this regard, each DSP IC <b>26</b> will utilize different operating setting and parameters to function appropriately in its respective component.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a typical processor-type IC <b>200</b>, e.g. a DSP or microcontroller.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the processor-type IC <b>200</b> is installed in both an external <b>210</b> and an internal <b>212</b> part of a prosthesis system <b>204</b>. The processor IC <b>200</b> needs to change its behavior or functionality depending upon which component it is installed in. As a basic example, the processor IC <b>200</b> needs to functionally communicate over a UART interface <b>206</b> with a programming system <b>208</b> when it is used in the external part <b>210</b>, but it needs to functionally communicate over a wireless RF interface <b>214</b> when it is used in the internal part <b>212</b>. Hence, while the processor ICs <b>200</b> are architecturally the same, in normal operation they are required to provide different functionalities based on the respective components in which each is installed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">The generic processor ICs <b>200</b> can be configured to provide their individually required functionality during initialization of the system <b>204</b>. At startup the processor <b>200</b> loads a boot loader (or initialization) program and starts executing the boot loader program. The boot loader program causes a processor program to be downloaded from non-volatile memory (e.g. ROM) into the processor memory <b>220</b> (RAM). The functionality of the boot loader program (and also of the IC <b>200</b>) needs to be different depending upon in which component the IC <b>200</b> is installed. Therefore, the IC <b>200</b> needs to determine where it has been installed. The boot loader program can do this by checking at start-up time how one or more of the ICs connecting pins have been electrically connected during installation, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The manner in which ICs are electrically connected via their pins during installation is different depending upon in which component the IC <b>200</b> is installed and/or the intended functionality of the installed IC <b>200</b>. Hence, by determining the actual pin connection, the required functionality of the IC <b>200</b> during normal operation of the system can be readily determined by the boot loader. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, pin<b>1</b> <b>401</b> is connected to supply rail (Vdd) <b>410</b> while pin<b>2</b> <b>402</b> and pin<b>4</b> <b>404</b> are connected to ground rail (Vss) <b>420</b>. An example flow chart of the boot loader operation is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. At <b>510</b>, it is determined whether pint <b>401</b> of the IC <b>200</b> is connected to: supply rail (Vdd) <b>410</b>. If yes, then at <b>520</b> it is realized that the IC <b>200</b> is being used in an internal component which requires functionality that can be provided by executing code routine A (at <b>530</b>). If it is determined that pin<b>1</b> <b>401</b> of the IC <b>200</b> is not connected to supply rail (Vdd) <b>410</b>, then at <b>540</b> it is realized that the IC <b>200</b> is being used in an external component. In the example shown, further pin connections are required to be determined before the required functionality can be realized. Hence, at <b>550</b>, it is determined whether pin<b>2</b> <b>402</b> is connected to supply rail (Vdd) <b>410</b>. If yes, then the required functionality is determined to be provided by executing code routine B (at <b>560</b>). If the determination is negative, then the required functionality is determined to be provided by executing code routine C (at <b>570</b>). Following this example boot loader operation, the IC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, would be determined to be installed in an internal component requiring code routine A.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">The ICs ROM could be installed with all of the potential functionality programs in place, whereby the initialization process causes a selection of the required program for future normal operations. Conceivably, however, the required functionality program could be downloaded from an external source during the initialization process thereby obviating the need for the IC ROM to have all potential programs.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">While the present invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that various modifications and changes could be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, during start up, the IC could communicate with an external source (e.g. a memory, another IC, or PC system) and the external source determines the required functionality of the IC. As a further example, while the foregoing contemplated a software solution it is envisaged that a hardware solution could be employed. In such a hardware example, the ICs functionality would not be programmable but fixed in hardware (hard-wired). In which case, the required functionality is not determined by a boot loader or a downloaded processor program that is executed from memory, but by a pre-programmed state machine in hardware.</p>
