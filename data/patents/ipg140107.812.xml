<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to tools for internal combustion engines and in particular to a pistol grip spring compressor system and methods for maintaining compression on a valve spring while a valve spring unit is separated from an automotive internal combustion engine block.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Piston driven internal combustion engines are undisputedly the primary means for transportation today. Often, each internal combustion engine has more than one piston assembly whereby each piston assembly features a valve spring unit. For dampening forces exerted by a corresponding valve stem within a piston cylinder, each valve spring unit includes a valve spring having a plurality of coils. The valve spring includes a base coil at one end. The valve spring unit further includes a valve spring retainer positioned at one end of the valve spring and keepers positioned within the valve spring and adjacent to the valve spring retainer. Moreover, a valve stem aperture, concentrically defined by the retainer, is provided, with respect to the centerline of the valve spring, to accommodate the keepers as well as the movement of the valve stem along the valve spring centerline as held by the keepers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Overtime, during the life of an internal combustion engine, constant factors such as extreme heat and pressure as well as continuous movement at high speeds detrimentally affect a cylinder head, and in particular a valve spring unit. As a result, various problems may arise such as burnt valves, valve stems seals leaking, broken valve springs or cracked cylinder heads, that require the removal of a valve spring unit for the replacement of at least one component part.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Inasmuch, it is desirable to maintain spring compression while quickly and effortlessly repairing or replacing damaged component parts from the valve spring unit. Unfortunately, however, it is believed that no known tool exists for the removal of a valve spring unit while maintaining the requisite spring compression for operating the cylinder head during internal combustion. Nevertheless, there is a significant, continuing demand for a pistol grip spring compressor system and method for maintaining compression on the valve spring while the valve spring unit is separated from the internal engine combustion block.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Skilled artisans appreciate that elements in the Figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the Figures may be exaggerated relative to the other elements to help improve understanding of the embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Generally speaking, pursuant to the various embodiments, the present disclosure provides a pistol grip spring compressor system and a method of maintaining compression on a valve spring of a valve spring unit. The pistol grip spring compressor system generally includes a spring lock unit, an actuator assembly, and an anvil module such that the spring lock unit secures a valve spring coil in a fixed position relative to a frame element to permit an anvil, provided by the anvil module and positioned against a valve spring retainer of the valve spring unit, to maintain compression on the valve spring while the valve spring unit is separated from an automobile internal engine combustion block. The spring lock unit includes a plurality of &#x201c;J&#x201d; hooks where each &#x201c;J&#x201d; hook has a flanged portion. In operation, the flanged portion is configured to secure the pistol grip spring compressor system to a coil of a valve spring provided by a valve spring unit from an internal combustion engine block. The actuator assembly includes a frame element, an actuator rod positioned through the frame element, a grip handle assembly to drive the actuator rod along the frame element, and a bias locking bar to lock the actuator rod in place. The grip handle assembly is coupled to and extends outwardly from the frame element and includes a fixed handle and a pivot handle pivotally coupled to the fixed handle. In operation, the pivot handle and pivot handle cooperate to drive the actuator rod along the frame element. The bias locking bar is rendered to lock the actuator rod in an advance position or rendered to reverse-release the actuator rod in an opposing direction. The anvil module is coupled to a driver end of the actuator rod and, in particular, an anvil provided by the anvil module is coupled to a driver end of the actuator rod.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, the system implements the methods as follows. A pistol grip spring compressor is secured to a coil of a valve spring provided by a valve spring unit. An anvil, at the end of an actuator rod, moves toward the coil of a valve spring that is fixed relative to a plurality of &#x201c;J&#x201d; hooks provided by the pistol grip spring compressor. A plurality of projection elements, provided by the anvil, are compressed to annularly contact against the valve spring retainer, about the valve stem aperture that is concentrically defined by the retainer. A bias locking bar secures the actuator rod in a fixed position relative to the frame element. Accordingly, the valve spring unit from the internal combustion engine block is separated via the pistol grip spring compressor with the actuator rod in a fixed position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to the Figures, and particularly <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the device of the present disclosure includes a pistol grip spring compressor system <b>1</b> includes a frame member <b>10</b>. The frame member <b>10</b> includes a depending fixed handle <b>12</b> with an upper frame element <b>14</b> including a forward frame section <b>16</b> and a second or rear frame section <b>20</b>. The frame sections <b>16</b> and <b>20</b> are generally parallel to one another and spaced to define a window <b>22</b>. A reinforcing rib <b>24</b> with a mounting projection <b>26</b> is provided on the top of the frame element <b>14</b>. The rear frame section <b>20</b> includes a through bore <b>28</b> into which a cylindrical hollow fitting <b>30</b> with throughbore <b>31</b> is inserted. The forward frame section <b>16</b> also includes a throughbore <b>32</b> into which a flanged nut <b>34</b> having an internal throughbore <b>36</b> with counter bore <b>38</b> on the inside end and counter bore <b>40</b> on the outside end being provided.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A flanged nut <b>34</b> is threaded into the front frame section <b>16</b> and holds a backing plate <b>100</b> with slots onto the front frame section <b>16</b>. In one example, the backing plate is a planar plate having a general H shape in plain view as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. J hooks <b>102</b> A and <b>102</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) have stabilizing guides <b>101</b>A and <b>101</b>B respectively attached when wedged into coil spring (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). J hooks <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B slide onto the slots <b>116</b>A and <b>116</b>B of backing plate <b>100</b> and grab the base bottom of coil spring (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The flanged nut <b>34</b> and, more particularly the through bore <b>36</b> as well as the through bore <b>31</b> of the hollow fitting <b>30</b>, receive an actuator rod <b>50</b> having the end <b>110</b> threaded to receive a handle <b>111</b>, a washer <b>112</b>, a lock washer <b>113</b>, a locking nut <b>114</b>, and a straight section projecting through the bores <b>31</b>, <b>36</b> of the fitting <b>30</b> and nut <b>34</b>. An anvil <b>107</b> is attached to the outer end <b>56</b> of rod <b>50</b> with the following nut <b>103</b>, bearing washer <b>104</b>, bearing <b>105</b>, bearing washer <b>106</b>, anvil <b>107</b>, washer <b>108</b>, and locking nut <b>109</b>, (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) in respective order. The following bearing <b>104</b>, bearing <b>105</b> and bearing washer <b>106</b> make up the thrust bearing which allows the anvil <b>107</b> to swivel prior to actuation and to stay in position when the actuator rod <b>50</b> is turned while under compression.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The actuator rod <b>50</b> is slideable through the frame element <b>14</b> with the sliding movement control by a means of a bias feed dog <b>60</b> and a bias locking bar <b>62</b> in combination with a pivotal handle <b>64</b> mounted on the frame member <b>10</b> by means of a pivot pin <b>66</b>. The pivotal handle <b>64</b> includes a lever arm extension <b>67</b> which, when pivoted on pin <b>66</b>, engages with a lower side of the dog <b>60</b> and advances the dog <b>60</b> as well as the rod <b>50</b> against the biasing force of a coil spring <b>68</b> mounted on the rod <b>50</b> intermediate the dog <b>60</b> and a land <b>70</b> in the counter bore <b>38</b>. Counter bore <b>38</b> functions to maintain the spring <b>68</b> appropriately guided in alignment for biasing of the dog <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The pistol grip spring compressor system <b>1</b> further includes the bias locking bar <b>62</b> biased by a spring member <b>80</b> about a pivot axis <b>82</b> on the reinforcing rib <b>24</b>. The bias locking bar <b>62</b> includes a throughpassage into which the rod <b>50</b> fits and when the biasing spring <b>80</b> biases the bias locking bar <b>62</b>, in a manor depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where the edges of the throughpassage engage the actuator rod <b>50</b> precluding the actuator rod <b>50</b> from moving in the direction of the arrow or to the right as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The actuator rod <b>50</b> may, however, be manually moved in the opposite direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The dog lever extension arm <b>67</b> of handle <b>64</b> provides a mechanical advantage when advancing the actuator rod <b>50</b> forward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as position &#x201c;A&#x201d;. In other words, the dog <b>60</b> includes a throughpassage which is oversized relative to the outer diameter of the actuator rod <b>50</b>. Driving the dog <b>60</b> forward by means of actuation of the pivotal handle <b>64</b> causes the dog <b>60</b> to become canted slightly. Thus, the dog <b>60</b> will engage the rod <b>50</b> and drive the rod <b>50</b> in the forward direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The dog <b>60</b> will return to its un-canted, initial position upon release of the handle <b>64</b> thereby enabling the spring <b>68</b> to transport dog <b>60</b> in the opposite direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as position &#x201c;B&#x201d;, to position the dog <b>60</b> for an additional incremental movement of the rod <b>50</b>. In this manner, the anvil <b>107</b> on the end of actuator rod <b>50</b> can be driven so as to be further spaced from the backing plate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The described construction provides a mechanical advantage in that the pivot handle <b>64</b> and fixed handle <b>12</b>, when used in combination with the other elements of the apparatus, enable the operator to provide a significant mechanical advantage due to the long extension that is characteristic of the pivot handle <b>64</b> relative to the extension lever arm <b>67</b>. The use of a locking dog <b>60</b> in combination with the bias locking bar <b>62</b> and associated biasing springs arranged in the manor depicted enables movement of the actuator rod <b>50</b> to compress the spring or springs and maintain its compression. Release of the element from a compressed position is affected by pressing on the break lever or locking plate <b>62</b> and moving at clockwise in a direction shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> against the force of the biasing spring <b>80</b>. As such, the actuator rod <b>50</b> is the free to move.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Importantly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the flanged nut <b>34</b> includes counterbores <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> at the opposite ends thereof. The counterbores are greater in diametrical dimensions than the bore <b>36</b> for the actuator rod <b>50</b>. Accordingly, this enables the inside bore <b>38</b> to act as a guide for a dog biasing spring <b>68</b>. The outside counter bore <b>40</b> enables the anvil to be positioned more closely to the backing plate <b>100</b> in as much as a mounting nut for the anvil <b>107</b> may fit within the recess define by the counter bore <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Variations of the constructions may be adopted. For example, the particular arrangement of the handle may be reversed with the fixed handle <b>12</b>, which is a fixed handle, being made the pivoting element and the pivot handle <b>64</b> being made to be a fixed element relative to the pivoting element. The particular arrangement of the bias locking bar <b>62</b> may also be altered. Thus, while there has been set forth a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is to be understood that the invention is limited only by the following claims and equivalence thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Controlled Release of Valve Spring</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the actuator rod <b>50</b>, from the threaded end <b>110</b> to at least the center length of the actuator rod, is threaded <b>50</b> such that the locking pawl <b>62</b> is configured to receive a threaded hinged spring loaded lock <b>162</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that will hold the threaded actuator rod <b>50</b> in one direction and will allow for smooth release when turning actuator rod <b>50</b> along the threaded portion in an opposite direction such that the anvil module <b>230</b> moves toward the actuator assembly <b>220</b>. This will allow for quick compression of a valve spring <b>305</b> and the smooth release of the valve spring <b>305</b>. When compressing a valve spring <b>305</b>, the threaded hinge lock <b>162</b> attached to the bias locking bar <b>62</b> will allow the threaded rod <b>50</b> to slide in one direction due to pivot of hinge lock <b>162</b> and hold caused by spring tension that is place on the actuator rod <b>50</b>. The hinge lock <b>162</b> has a spring <b>164</b> that will keep threads engaged and can be disengage by pressing unthreaded side of the hinge lock <b>162</b> against the threaded actuator rod <b>50</b>.</p>
