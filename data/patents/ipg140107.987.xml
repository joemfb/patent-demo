<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a motorcycle exhaust system structure in which a resonator is provided to an exhaust pipe.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some motorcycles include a resonator provided to an exhaust pipe. See, for example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2009-287548 (hereinafter JP 2009-287548) which discloses such a motorcycle including a resonator of a double pipe structure provided to an exhaust pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As shown in JP 2009-287548, when a resonator is provided as a double pipe structure, the shaping of the resonator is complicated because its layout needs to match the shapes of the exhaust pipe and the internal combustion engine. Accordingly, the exterior of the resonator is complicated as well in this known motorcycle. Moreover, the attachment structure of an exhaust protector is also subject to the constraints of the shape of the resonator and is thus complicated in shape and larger in size.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention has been made in consideration of the aforementioned circumstances and aims to provide a motorcycle exhaust system structure capable of improving the exterior arrangement of a vehicle by compactly arranging a resonator in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the purpose of solving the above-mentioned problems, according to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a motorcycle exhaust system structure in a motorcycle in which an internal combustion engine including a crankcase, a cylinder, and a cylinder head is attached to a vehicle body frame, the motorcycle exhaust system structure comprising: an exhaust pipe connected to the cylinder head; and a resonator having a communication hole in communication with an inside of the exhaust pipe; wherein the exhaust pipe is curved after being extended forward from the cylinder head and is then extended rearward in such a manner as to pass by a lateral side of the cylinder above the crankcase; and wherein the resonator is arranged in a space between the exhaust pipe and the cylinder, and is joined to a side surface of the exhaust pipe facing inwardly of the motorcycle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the motorcycle exhaust system structure according to a second aspect of the invention, in addition to the first aspect, the resonator has a flat box shape being long in a vehicle front-rear direction and a vehicle up-down direction and having a small lateral width in a vehicle width direction, and a lateral wall of the resonator directly joined to the exhaust pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the motorcycle exhaust system structure according to a third aspect of the invention, in addition to either of the first and second aspects, the resonator is formed of two components divided along a substantially vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the motorcycle exhaust system structure according to a fourth aspect of the invention, in addition to any of the first-third aspects, the structure further comprises an exhaust protector provided to the exhaust pipe; a lateral wall of the resonator facing the exhaust pipe is directly joined to the exhaust pipe; a supporting recessed portion which forms a space between the resonator lateral wall and an outer surface of the exhaust pipe is formed in the resonator lateral wall; the exhaust protector is placed on a side of the exhaust pipe opposite to the resonator with the exhaust pipe interposed therebetween; and the exhaust protector is supported by a band member inserted through the supporting recessed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the motorcycle exhaust system structure according to a fifth aspect of the invention, in addition to any of the first-fourth aspects, the exhaust pipe is formed by joining together a curved pipe part extending forward from the cylinder head and then curving and a rear pipe part extending rearward from the curved pipe part; a releasing recessed portion forming a space between the resonator lateral wall and an outer surface of the exhaust pipe is formed on the lateral wall of the resonator facing the exhaust pipe; and the resonator is attached to the exhaust pipe in such a manner as to straddle a joint portion of the exhaust pipe between the curved pipe part and the rear pipe part while causing the releasing recessed portion to face the joint portion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the motorcycle exhaust system structure according to a sixth aspect of the invention, in addition to the fourth aspect, a recessed portion is formed in a lateral wall of the resonator facing the cylinder, the recessed portion having a bottom portion facing, inside the resonator, a bottom portion of the supporting recessed portion formed on the lateral wall of the resonator facing the exhaust pipe; and a swell chamber is formed in the resonator by the recessed portion facing the cylinder and the supporting recessed portion facing the exhaust pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the motorcycle exhaust system structure according to a seventh aspect of the invention, in addition to the fifth aspect, an outer recessed portion is formed in a lateral wall of the resonator facing the cylinder, the recessed portion having a bottom portion facing a bottom portion of the releasing recessed portion formed on the lateral wall of the resonator facing the exhaust pipe on an inner side of the resonator is formed on a lateral wall of the resonator facing the cylinder; and a swell chamber is formed in the resonator by the recessed portion facing the cylinder and the releasing recessed portion facing the exhaust pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the motorcycle exhaust system structure according to an eighth aspect of the invention, in addition to any of the first-seventh aspects, the exhaust pipe linearly extends rearward after curving; and the communication hole is in communication with a portion of the exhaust pipe where the exhaust pipe becomes a linear shape after curving and which is positioned on an extension line of a curved portion of the exhaust pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the motorcycle exhaust system structure according to a ninth aspect of the invention, in addition to the first aspect, the exhaust pipe passes by the lateral side of the cylinder above the crankcase in such a manner as to come closer to the cylinder as extending rearward; in a top view, the resonator includes a front inclination portion at a front-side corner portion thereof positioned facing the cylinder, and a rear inclination portion at a rear-side corner portion thereof positioned facing the cylinder, the front inclination portion coming closer to the cylinder as extending rearward, the rear inclination portion positioned more distant from the cylinder as extending rearward; and the rear inclination portion inclines more gently than the front inclination portion and is formed longer in the rearward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the first aspect of the invention, it is possible to improve the exterior arrangement of a vehicle by compactly arranging the resonator while effectively using the space.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the second aspect of the invention, it is possible to reduce the size of the exhaust system structure in the vehicle width direction by effectively using the space between the exhaust pipe and the cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the third aspect of the invention, it is possible to form the resonator separately between the exhaust pipe side and the internal combustion engine side while matching the portions of the resonator with the shapes of the components on the respective sides, thereby, improving the degree of freedom in design.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the fourth aspect of the invention, it is possible to simply install an exhaust protector without being affected by the resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the fifth aspect of the invention, it is possible to easily attach the resonator to the exhaust pipe even in a shape where the exhaust pipe is formed of separate components.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to either of the sixth and seventh aspects of the invention, it is possible to easily form a swell chamber in the resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the eighth aspect of the invention, the communication hole of the resonator is in communication with the portion of the exhaust pipe which is located at a position after the exhaust pipe curves and where the exhaust flow rate is slow, so that influence on the exhaust flow due to the resonator is suppressed and thereby a desired output of the internal combustion engine can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the ninth aspect of the invention, the exhaust pipe curves after extending forward, and then passes by a lateral side of the cylinder in such a manner as to come closer to the cylinder as the exhaust pipe extends rearward, and is thus positioned on an inner side of the vehicle body in a top view. Thus, although the distance between the exhaust pipe and the cylinder is reduced as the exhaust pipe extends rearward, the resonator can be compactly arranged in the vehicle by forming the resonator into a shape corresponding to the shape and arrangement of the exhaust pipe.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION INCLUDING BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, a description will be given of an embodiment of the present invention on the basis of the drawings. Note that, in the drawings used in the following description, an arrow FR indicates a forward direction of a vehicle, an arrow UP indicates an upward direction of the vehicle, and an arrow RH indicates a rightward direction of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an off-road motorcycle <b>1</b>, and a vehicle body frame <b>2</b> of the motorcycle <b>1</b> includes a head pipe <b>3</b>, a main frame <b>4</b>, paired left and right center frames <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>, a down frame <b>6</b>, and paired left and right lower frames <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>. The head pipe and frames are connected to one another in a loop shape and support an internal combustion engine <b>8</b>, which is attached to the inner side of the loop. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the internal combustion engine <b>8</b> includes a crankcase <b>9</b>, a cylinder <b>10</b>, a cylinder head <b>11</b> and a head cover <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The main frame <b>4</b> extends above the internal combustion engine <b>8</b> linearly at a center position of the vehicle body in an obliquely downward direction to the rear. The center frames <b>5</b>, <b>5</b> are connected to the main frame <b>4</b> above the crankcase <b>9</b> and then are curved downward in such a manner as to extend around the rear of the crankcase <b>9</b>. The down frame <b>6</b> extends below in front of the internal combustion engine <b>8</b> linearly at a center position of the vehicle body in an obliquely downward direction and then connected to front end portions of the paired left and right lower frames <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> at a lower end portion of the down frame <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The lower frames <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> extends downward substantially linearly while curving below the internal combustion engine <b>8</b> from a front side lower portion of the internal combustion engine <b>8</b> and then are connected to lower end portions of the center frames <b>5</b>, <b>5</b> at rear end portions of the lower frames <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The internal combustion engine <b>8</b> is a water-cooled, four-cycle engine, and the cylinder <b>10</b> is provided to a front portion of the crankcase <b>9</b> in a state of standing in an upright position where its cylinder axis line is substantially vertical. The cylinder head <b>11</b> is provided on a top portion of the cylinder <b>10</b>, and the head cover <b>12</b> covers a top portion of the cylinder head <b>11</b>. The internal combustion engine <b>8</b> is reduced in size in a front-rear direction by causing the cylinder <b>10</b> to stand in the upright position. Thus, the internal combustion engine <b>8</b> is formed appropriately for an off-road vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A fuel tank <b>13</b> is supported by the main frame <b>4</b> above the internal combustion engine <b>8</b>, and a seat <b>14</b> is placed right behind the fuel tank <b>13</b>. An air cleaner whose illustration is omitted is provided on an inner side of a side cover <b>15</b>, which is placed under the seat <b>14</b>. Thus, air is taken from the air cleaner to the cylinder head <b>11</b> in a direction from the rear of the vehicle body. An exhaust pipe <b>16</b> is connected to the front of the cylinder head <b>11</b>. The exhaust pipe <b>16</b> extends forward from the cylinder head and then turns rearward and extends rightward around the cylinder <b>10</b>. A muffler <b>17</b> is connected to a rear end of the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The head pipe <b>3</b> supports paired left and right front forks <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>, and lower end portions of the front forks <b>18</b>, <b>18</b> rotatably support a front wheel <b>19</b>. A top bridge <b>20</b> is installed between upper portions of the front forks <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>, and a steering handlebar <b>21</b> is fixed to the top bridge <b>20</b>. A pivot shaft <b>22</b> is supported by lower end portions of the center frames <b>5</b>, <b>5</b> in a state of extending in a vehicle width direction and thereby swingably supports a rear swing arm <b>23</b>. Rear end portions of the swing arm <b>23</b> support a rear wheel <b>24</b>. A rear cushion unit <b>28</b> is installed between the swing arm <b>23</b> and the center frames <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a radiator <b>25</b> is supported by the down frame <b>6</b>. Both lateral sides of the radiator <b>25</b> are covered by a front cover <b>26</b>, which is positioned in front of the side cover <b>15</b>. A water hose <b>27</b> is connected to a right side lower portion of the radiator <b>25</b> and extends downward, and its lower end is connected to a right side lateral portion of the crankcase <b>9</b>. The exhaust pipe <b>16</b> extends forward from the cylinder head <b>11</b> and curves while passing by in front of the water hose <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> is formed by joining (welding) together a curved pipe part <b>30</b>, a rear pipe part <b>31</b> and a rear extension pipe part <b>32</b>. The curved pipe part <b>30</b> extends forward from the cylinder head <b>11</b> and then curves. The rear pipe part <b>31</b> extends rearward from the curved pipe part <b>30</b>. The rear extension pipe part <b>32</b> extends rearward from the rear pipe part <b>31</b>. The curved pipe part <b>30</b> and the rear pipe part <b>31</b> are joined together on a right side of the cylinder <b>10</b> as denoted by reference numeral L<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The rear pipe part <b>31</b> extends rearward above the crankcase <b>9</b> in such a manner as to pass by a lateral side of the cylinder <b>10</b> and then is joined to the rear extension pipe part <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To put it specifically, the curved pipe part <b>30</b> curves through substantially 180 degrees after extending forward and then downward in a right oblique direction and opens its rear end rearward in such a manner as to direct its rear end to the center in the vehicle width direction from an outer side in the vehicle width direction at a position on the right side of the cylinder <b>10</b>. The rear pipe part <b>31</b> extends upward in a rear oblique direction from the rear end of the curved pipe part <b>30</b> at a gentle angle in a side view. In addition, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rear pipe part <b>31</b> extends rearward in a direction to the center in the vehicle width direction from the front in a top view. To put it differently, the rear pipe part <b>31</b> passes by a lateral side of the cylinder <b>10</b> above the crankcase <b>9</b> in such a manner as to come closer to the cylinder <b>10</b> as the rear pipe part <b>31</b> extends rearward in a top view. Moreover, the rear pipe part <b>31</b> curves above a rear portion of the crankcase <b>9</b>, then extends rearward on an inner side of the right side center frame <b>5</b> in the vehicle width direction and then opens its rear end in a straight rearward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The rear extension pipe part <b>32</b> extends from the rear end of the rear pipe part <b>31</b> in a straight rearward direction, and the aforementioned muffler <b>17</b> is connected to a rear end of the rear extension pipe part <b>32</b>. Note that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a relatively wide space Si is formed above the crankcase <b>9</b> by connecting the rear pipe part <b>31</b> to the rear end of the curved pipe part <b>30</b> to extend rearward toward the center in the vehicle width direction from the front and then to pass by the inner side on the right side center frame <b>5</b> in the vehicle width direction. A kick pedal <b>33</b>, which extends upward from a rear end portion of the crankcase <b>9</b>, is arranged in this space S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a space S<b>2</b> is formed between the rear pipe part <b>31</b> and the cylinder <b>10</b>, and a resonator <b>35</b>, which is in communication with the rear pipe part <b>31</b> and is joined (welded) to the rear pipe part <b>31</b>, is arranged in this space S<b>2</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the resonator <b>35</b> is formed in a flat box shape that is long in a vehicle front-rear direction and also in a vehicle up-down direction and has a small lateral width in the vehicle width direction. The resonator <b>35</b> is formed by joining (welding) together an outer half body <b>36</b>, which is positioned facing the rear pipe part <b>31</b>, and an inner half body <b>37</b>, which is positioned facing the cylinder <b>10</b>. Thus, resonator <b>35</b> forms an enclosed space.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> and the resonator <b>35</b> in a state where the outer half body <b>36</b> is removed. The outer half body <b>36</b> is formed in an elongated shape extending along the longitudinal direction of the rear pipe part <b>31</b> and exhibits a substantially octagonal shape in which its front portion and rear portion taper off along the extension direction of the rear pipe part <b>31</b>. Meanwhile, the inner half body <b>37</b> exhibits a substantially octagonal shape in an elongated shape extending along the longitudinal direction of the rear pipe part <b>31</b> as in the case of the outer half body <b>36</b>. The resonator <b>35</b> formed by joining together the inner half body <b>37</b> and the outer half body <b>36</b> is thus formed in a polyhedral shape. Division surfaces of the inner half body <b>37</b> and the outer half body <b>36</b> are set in a vertical direction and are joined (welded) together. To put it specifically, the resonator <b>35</b> is formed of two vertically divided components or two components divided along a substantially vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a cross section of the resonator <b>35</b>, taken along the line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a contact surface <b>39</b> having a cross-sectionally arc shape to be brought into contact along a curved surface of the rear pipe part <b>31</b> is formed on an outer lateral wall <b>38</b>, which is located on the outer half body <b>36</b> facing the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>. The outer half body <b>36</b> is joined (welded) in a state where the contact surface <b>39</b> is brought into contact with the rear pipe part <b>31</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, multiple (five in this example) welding holes <b>39</b>A . . . are provided in a substantially center region of the outer lateral wall <b>38</b> of the outer half body <b>36</b> while penetrating through the outer lateral wall <b>38</b>. The outer half body <b>36</b> is directly joined to the rear pipe part <b>31</b> while being welded thereto by causing molten metal to flow through the welding holes <b>39</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the outer half body <b>36</b> is joined to the rear pipe part <b>31</b> in such a manner as to straddle a joint portion <b>40</b> between the curved pipe part <b>30</b> and the rear pipe part <b>31</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a first recessed portion <b>41</b>, which forms a space S<b>3</b> between the outer lateral wall <b>38</b> and an outer surface of the rear pipe part <b>31</b>, is formed on the outer lateral wall <b>38</b> of the outer half body <b>36</b>. The first recessed portion <b>41</b> is positioned in such a manner as to face the joint portion <b>40</b>, thereby, avoiding interference between the joint portion <b>40</b> and the outer lateral wall <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, a second recessed portion <b>42</b>, which forms a space S<b>4</b> between the outer lateral wall <b>38</b> and the outer surface of the outer half body <b>36</b>, is formed on the outer lateral wall <b>38</b> facing the rear pipe part <b>31</b> at a position rearwardly of the first recessed portion <b>41</b>. Here, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, band members <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> are inserted through the first recessed portion <b>41</b> and the second recessed portion <b>42</b> (the spaces S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b>), respectively. In the present embodiment, the band members <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> support an exhaust protector <b>45</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the like and is placed on an outer side in the vehicle width direction. The outer side is a side opposite to the resonator <b>35</b> on the rear pipe part <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a communication hole <b>47</b> is formed in the outer lateral wall <b>38</b> of the outer half body <b>36</b>, and the resonator <b>35</b> is in communication with the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> through the communication hole <b>47</b>. The communication hole <b>47</b> is formed near the rear of the second recessed portion <b>42</b>, and a through hole <b>49</b> corresponding to the communication hole <b>47</b> is formed in the rear pipe part <b>31</b>. Thus, exhaust is introduced into the resonator <b>35</b> through the communication hole <b>47</b> and is returned to the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> from the resonator <b>35</b> after passing through the communication hole <b>47</b> and then is discharged in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The communication hole <b>47</b> is provided in the resonator <b>35</b> in such a manner as to be in communication with a portion (rear pipe part <b>31</b>) of the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> where the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> becomes a linear shape after curving and which is positioned on a virtual extension line V<b>1</b> of the curved portion (curved pipe part <b>30</b>) of the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. To put it another way, the communication hole <b>47</b> is provided on an inner side path of the curved line of the curved pipe part <b>30</b> in the rear pipe part <b>31</b>. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram schematically showing a result of analysis of an exhaust flow rate in the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> of a case where the resonator <b>35</b> is not provided. Meanwhile, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a diagram schematically showing an exhaust flow rate in a case where the resonator <b>35</b> is provided to the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>. In the drawings, a longer arrow shows a portion where the exhaust flow rate is faster. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> show the exhaust flow rate distributions in the respective exhaust pipes <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the exhaust flow rate is slow in a region corresponding to an inner circumference of the curve in the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> after the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> curves (right behind the curved pipe part <b>30</b>) (region f<b>1</b>). When the communication hole <b>47</b> is set in communication with such a portion where the exhaust flow rate is slow, the influence on the exhaust flow due to the resonator <b>35</b> can be suppressed. Accordingly, in the present embodiment, the communication hole <b>47</b> is set in communication with the portion of the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> where the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> becomes a linear shape after curving and which is positioned on an extension side of the virtual extension line V<b>1</b> of the curved portion of the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>. As is apparent in comparison between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it can be seen that the influence on the exhaust flow due to provision of the resonator <b>35</b> is small (refer to a region f<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Note that, although only the single communication hole <b>47</b> is provided on the rear side in this embodiment, the influence on the exhaust flow can be suppressed in this configuration because the communication hole <b>47</b> is provided at the position distant from the curved pipe part <b>30</b> where the flow of the exhaust gas is likely to be disproportionate.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> together, the resonator <b>35</b> in a top view has a front inclination portion <b>37</b>F, which is closer to the cylinder <b>10</b> as the portion extends rearward, at a front-side corner portion thereof positioned on the cylinder <b>10</b> side. The resonator <b>35</b> in a top view also has a rear inclination portion <b>37</b>R, which is positioned more distant from the cylinder <b>10</b> as the portion extends rearward, at a rear-side corner portion thereof positioned on the cylinder <b>10</b> side. The rear inclination portion <b>37</b>R inclines more gently than the front inclination portion <b>37</b>F and extends longer in the rearward direction (in the vehicle front-rear direction). In a case where this configuration is employed, the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> curves after extending forward, and then passes by a lateral side of the cylinder <b>10</b> in such a manner as to come closer to the cylinder <b>10</b> as the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> extends rearward in this embodiment. Thus, although the distance between the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> and the cylinder <b>10</b> is reduced as the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> extends rearward, the resonator <b>35</b> can be compactly arranged in the space S<b>2</b> formed between the rear pipe part <b>31</b> and the cylinder <b>10</b> of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, the resonator <b>35</b>, which includes the communication hole <b>47</b> in communication with the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>, is arranged in the space S<b>2</b> between the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> and the cylinder <b>10</b> and is joined to the inwardly facing side surface of the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> in the motorcycle <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment. The motorcycle <b>1</b> includes the internal combustion engine <b>8</b>, which includes the crankcase <b>9</b>, the cylinder <b>10</b>, and the cylinder head <b>11</b>, is attached to the vehicle body frame <b>2</b>, and the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> is connected to the cylinder head <b>11</b> and is curved after being extended forward and then is extended rearward in such a manner as to pass by the lateral side of the cylinder <b>10</b> above the crankcase <b>9</b>. According to this configuration, it is possible to compactly arrange the resonator <b>35</b> while effectively using the space, thus improving the exterior arrangement of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, in the present embodiment, the resonator <b>35</b> is formed in a flat box shape that is long in the vehicle front-rear direction and also in the vehicle up-down direction and has a small lateral width in the vehicle width direction. Moreover, the outer lateral wall <b>38</b> of the resonator <b>35</b> is directly joined to the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>. According to this configuration, it is possible to reduce the vehicle width by effectively using the space S<b>2</b> between the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> and the cylinder <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, the resonator <b>35</b> is formed of the vertically divided two components in the present embodiment. According to this configuration, it is possible to form the resonator <b>35</b> separately between the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> side and the internal combustion engine <b>8</b> (cylinder <b>10</b>) side and thus to match the portions of the resonator <b>35</b> with the shapes of the components on the respective sides, thereby, improving the degree of freedom in design.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, in the present embodiment, the exhaust protector <b>45</b> is provided to the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>, and the first and second recessed portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, which respectively form the spaces S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b> between the outer lateral wall <b>38</b> and the outer surface of the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>, are formed on the outer lateral wall <b>38</b> of the resonator <b>35</b> facing the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>. The exhaust protector <b>45</b> is placed opposite to the resonator <b>35</b> with the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> interposed therebetween and is supported by the band members <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>, which are inserted through the first and second recessed portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, respectively. According to this configuration, the exhaust protector <b>45</b> can be simply installed without being affected by the resonator <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Moreover, in the present embodiment, the resonator <b>35</b> is attached to the rear pipe part <b>31</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> in such a manner as to straddle the joint portion <b>40</b> between the curved pipe part <b>30</b> and the rear pipe part <b>31</b> while causing the first recessed portion <b>41</b> to face the joint portion <b>40</b>. According to this configuration, even if the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> is formed of divided components, the resonator <b>35</b> can be easily attached to the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, in the present embodiment, the communication hole <b>47</b> of the resonator <b>35</b> is formed in such a manner as to be in communication with the portion of the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> where the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> becomes a linear shape after curving and which is positioned on an extension line of the curved portion of the exhaust pipe <b>16</b>. According to this configuration, the communication hole <b>47</b> is formed at the portion of the exhaust pipe which is located at a position after the exhaust pipe curves and where the exhaust flow rate is slow. Thus, the influence on the exhaust flow due to the resonator <b>35</b> is suppressed, and a desired output of the internal combustion engine can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, a description will be given of a modification of the aforementioned embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In this modification, a front recessed portion <b>52</b> and a rear recessed portion <b>54</b> are formed on an inner lateral wall <b>50</b> of the inner half body <b>37</b> of the resonator <b>35</b> facing the cylinder <b>10</b>. The front recessed portion <b>52</b> includes a bottom portion <b>51</b>, which faces a bottom portion <b>41</b>A of the first recessed portion <b>41</b>. The first recessed portion <b>41</b> is formed on the outer lateral wall <b>38</b> on the inner portion of the resonator <b>35</b>. The rear recessed portion <b>54</b> includes a bottom portion <b>53</b>, which faces a bottom portion <b>42</b>A of the second recessed portion <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Here, the bottom portion <b>41</b>A of the first recessed portion <b>41</b> and the bottom portion <b>51</b> of the front recessed portion <b>52</b> face each other, and the bottom portion <b>42</b>A of the second recessed portion <b>42</b> and the bottom portion <b>53</b> of the rear recessed portion <b>54</b> face each other in the resonator <b>35</b>. Accordingly, three swell chambers <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>57</b> in the order from the front are formed in the resonator <b>35</b>. In a case where the configuration according to this modification is employed, it is possible to easily form the swell chambers in the resonator <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The embodiment of the present invention has been described above, but the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above. For example, although the resonator <b>35</b> is formed as a half divided structure formed of the two components in the embodiment described above, the resonator <b>35</b> may be formed of a single box member.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As another example, although the resonator <b>35</b> is set to be in communication with the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> through the single communication hole <b>47</b> in the embodiment described above, but multiple communication holes may be provided and may be formed at a position different from the position in the embodiment described above. As a specific example, a configuration in which a second communication hole <b>46</b> is added to the resonator <b>35</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In this example, the second communication hole <b>46</b> is formed separately from the communication hole <b>47</b> and is formed at a position near the rear of the first recessed portion <b>41</b>. Then, a second through hole <b>48</b> corresponding to the second communication hole <b>46</b> is formed in the rear pipe part <b>31</b>. In this configuration, the exhaust introduced into the resonator <b>35</b> through the communication hole <b>46</b> is returned to the exhaust pipe <b>16</b> after passing through the communication hole <b>47</b> and then is discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Moreover, the following configuration is described in the embodiment described above. The exhaust protector <b>45</b> is supported by inserting the band members <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> respectively through the first and second recessed portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, which are formed on the outer half body <b>36</b> of the resonator <b>35</b>. However, the exhaust protector <b>45</b> may be supported by inserting the band member <b>43</b> or <b>44</b> through any one of the first and second recessed portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
