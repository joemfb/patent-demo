<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a processed object processing apparatus that processes objects to be processed, a processed object processing method, a pressure control method, a processed object transfer method, and a transfer apparatus, and in particular relates to a processed object processing apparatus that carries out CVD (chemical vapor deposition) or COR (chemical oxide removal) as an alternative to dry etching or wet etching, and more particularly, relates to a processed object processing apparatus comprising a plurality of treatment systems, a processed object transfer method for transferring the processed object therethrough, and a pressure control method for controlling a pressure therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">From hitherto, etching has been carried out to shape thin films using a chemical reaction. In general, the etching process forms a set with a lithography process; in the lithography process, a resist pattern is formed, and then in the etching process the thin film is shaped in accordance with the resist pattern that has been formed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are two types of etching, dry etching and wet etching. The most common type of dry etching is parallel plate reactive ion etching. With parallel plate reactive ion etching, a vacuum treatment chamber of a vacuum treatment apparatus (processed object processing apparatus) is put into a vacuum state, a wafer, which is an object to be processed, is put into the vacuum treatment chamber, and then an etching gas is introduced into the vacuum treatment chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Inside the vacuum treatment chamber are provided a stage on which the wafer is placed, and an upper electrode which is parallel to and faces a wafer-placing surface of the stage. A high-frequency voltage is applied to the stage, whereupon the etching gas is made into a plasma. Charged particles such as positive and negative ions and electrons, neutral active species that act as etching species, and so on exist scattered around in the plasma. When an etching species is adsorbed onto a thin film on the wafer surface, a chemical reaction occurs at the wafer surface, and then products thus produced separate away from the wafer surface and are exhausted outside the vacuum treatment chamber, whereby etching proceeds. Moreover, depending on the conditions, the etching species may be sputtered onto the wafer surface, whereby etching proceeds through a physical reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Here, the high-frequency electric field is applied to the wafer surface perpendicularly thereto, and hence the etching species (radicals) also move in a direction perpendicular to the wafer surface. The etching thus proceeds in the direction perpendicular to the wafer surface, rather than proceeding isotropically over the wafer surface. That is, the etching does not spread sideways across the wafer surface. Dry etching is thus suitable for microprocessing.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, with dry etching, to carry out high-precision microprocessing conforming to a resist pattern, it is necessary to make the ratio between the etching rate for the material to be etched and the etching rate for the resist material high, and take care over etching damage caused by contamination with impurities, the occurrence of crystal defects and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With wet etching, on the other hand, there is a dipping method in which the wafer is immersed in an etching bath containing a liquid chemical, and a spinning method in which a liquid chemical is sprayed onto the wafer while rotating the wafer. In either case, the etching proceeds isotropically, and hence sideways etching occurs. Consequently, wet etching cannot be used in microprocessing. Note, however, that wet etching is used even nowadays for processes such as completely removing a thin film.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, an example of a method of forming a thin film using a chemical reaction is CVD (chemical vapor deposition). With CVD, two or more reactant gases are reacted in the vapor phase or in the vicinity of the surface of a wafer or the like, and a product produced through the reaction is formed on the wafer surface as a thin film. At this time, the wafer is heated, and hence activation energy is supplied to the reactant gases by thermal radiation from the heated wafer, whereby the reaction of the reactant gases is excited.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Conventionally, in the manufacture of integrated circuits and other electronic devices for flat panel displays and so on, vacuum treatment apparatuses have been used to carry out various types of treatment such as film formation including CVD as described above, oxidation, diffusion, etching for shaping as described above, and annealing. Such a vacuum treatment apparatus is generally comprised of at least one load lock chamber, at least one transfer chamber, and at least one treatment chamber. At least two types of such vacuum treatment apparatus are known.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One type is a multi-chamber type vacuum treatment apparatus. Such a vacuum treatment apparatus is comprised of three to six process chambers as vacuum treatment chambers, a vacuum preparation chamber (load lock chamber) having a transfer mechanism for transferring semiconductor wafers, i.e. objects to be processed, into and out of each of the process chambers, a polygonal transfer chamber around which are disposed the process chambers and the load lock chamber and which has in peripheral walls thereof a plurality of connecting ports for communicating in gas-tight fashion with the process chambers and the load lock chamber via gate valves, and a transfer arm that is provided inside the transfer chamber and is able to turn, elongate and contract (see, for example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. H08-46013).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, the other type is a vacuum treatment apparatus having chambers in a straight line. Such a vacuum treatment apparatus has a vacuum treatment chamber in which etching is carried out on semiconductor wafers, and a load lock chamber having built therein a scalar type single pick type or scalar type twin pick type transfer arm as transfer means for carrying out handover of the wafers between the load lock chamber and the vacuum treatment chamber. That is, a vacuum treatment chamber and a load lock chamber having a transfer arm built therein are taken as one module (see, for example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2001-53131 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2000-150618).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In either of the types of vacuum treatment apparatus described above, switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state is carried out in the load lock chamber, and smooth wafer transfer is realized between a loader that transfers the wafer set in a wafer carrier and a vacuum treatment chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the case of etching treatment, with either of the types of vacuum treatment apparatus, it has been that a high-frequency voltage is applied to an etching gas (reactive treatment gas) that has been introduced into a vacuum treatment chamber, thus making the reactive treatment gas into a plasma, whereby etching is carried out. With this dry etching, the etching treatment is carried out with excellent perpendicular anisotropy due to the etching species being controlled according to the applied voltage, and hence etching can be carried out in conformance with the required line width for lithography.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, there have been advances in the development of microprocessing technology with regard to a photolithography process of burning circuit patterns onto wafer surfaces, and amid this a process in which exposure is carried out with ultraviolet radiation from a KrF excimer laser (wavelength 248 nm) as a photolithography light source has been put into practice, and moreover a process in which an ArF excimer laser having a yet shorter wavelength (193 nm) is used is in the process of being put into practice. Furthermore, photolithography using an F<sub>2 </sub>laser (wavelength 157 nm), which enables formation of a fine pattern of line width 70 nm or less, has become the top contender for the next-generation process of 2005. However, a resist material that enables 1:1 line-and-space fine patterning with a line width of 65 nm or less at a film thickness of 150 to 200 nm without loss of dry etching resistance has not yet been developed, and with conventional resist materials a practical problem of particle contamination due to outgassing arises, and hence fine patterning by anisotropic dry etching is approaching its limit.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">There are thus hopes on COR (chemical oxide removal) as a fine etching treatment method as an alternative to dry etching or wet etching. With COR, gas molecules are subjected to chemical reaction and products produced are attached to an oxide film on an object to be processed (wafer), and then the wafer is heated to remove the product, whereby a line width finer than that of a lithography pattern can be obtained. Moreover, COR involves mild isotropic etching; the etching rate is controlled through parameters such as the pressure, the gas concentrations, the gas concentration ratio, the treatment temperature, the gas flow rates, and the gas flow rate ratio, and the etching stops through the treatment amount saturating beyond a certain treatment time period. The desired etching rate can thus be obtained by controlling the saturation point.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Such COR is suitable for the manufacture of a sub-0.1 &#x3bc;m metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor device comprised of a minimum-thickness poly-depletion layer, source/drain junctions having a metal silicide layer formed thereon, and very low sheet resistance poly-gates, the manufacture using a damascene-gate process comprised of source/drain diffusion activation annealing, and metal silicidation which occurs immediately before a dummy gate region that is subsequently removed and replaced with a polysilicon gate region (see, for example, the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 6,440,808).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With vacuum treatment apparatuses that carry out conventional etching treatment, there are demands for it to be possible to carry out a plurality of processes more efficiently. Moreover, for vacuum treatment apparatuses that carry out COR treatment or CVD treatment, treatment to cool wafers that have been heated through the COR treatment or CVD treatment is required, and hence there are again demands for it to be possible to carry out a plurality of processes more efficiently. However, with conventional vacuum treatment apparatuses, as described above, switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state is carried out in a load lock chamber, and yet the load lock chamber contains both a transfer arm and a cooling mechanism for cooling wafers, and hence the volume of the load lock chamber inevitably becomes large, and thus the switching between the vacuum state and the atmospheric pressure state requires much time. Moreover, a wafer that has been transferred into the load lock chamber is exposed to air convection due to the switching between the vacuum state and the atmospheric pressure state for a long time, and hence there is a risk of attachment of particles caused to fly up by the convection.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the second aspect, the COR treatment system and the heat treatment system are preferably always in a vacuum state. As a result, the respective treatments in the COR treatment system and the heat treatment system can be carried out one after the other without the vacuum being released, and hence there will be no adsorption of moisture onto the surface of an object to be processed after the COR treatment, and thus an oxide film on the object to be processed can be prevented from undergoing a chemical reaction after the COR treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the second aspect, the load lock system is preferably disposed in a position such as to form a line with the COR treatment system and the heat treatment system.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the third aspect of the present invention, at the same time as carrying out COR treatment in the COR treatment system on an object to be processed, heat treatment can be carried out in the heat treatment system on an object to be processed that has already been subjected to the COR treatment, and moreover an object to be processed that has not been subjected to the COR treatment can be prepared while awaiting completion of the COR treatment. As a result, the COR treatment and the heat treatment can be carried out efficiently, with no wastage of time during the sequence of processes.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, before communicating the load lock system and the heat treatment system together, the heat treatment system is exhausted such as to satisfy the condition that the pressure inside the heat treatment system is less than the pressure inside the load lock system, and then the heat treatment system continues to be exhausted thereafter. As a result, the atmosphere in the heat treatment system can be prevented from getting into the load lock system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the fourth aspect, preferably, after communicating the load lock system and the heat treatment system together, the heat treatment system is exhausted such as to satisfy the condition that that the pressure inside the heat treatment system is less than the pressure inside the COR treatment system, and then the heat treatment system and the COR treatment system are communicated together while continuing to exhaust the heat treatment system. As a result, not only can the atmosphere in the heat treatment system be prevented from getting into the load lock system, but moreover the atmosphere in the heat treatment system can be prevented from getting into the COR treatment system.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to the fourth aspect, a fluid is preferably introduced into the load lock system and the COR treatment system. As a result, convection and so on can be prevented from occurring when evacuating from the heat treatment system.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the fourth aspect, the flow rate of the fluid from the load lock system into the heat treatment system and the flow rate of the fluid from the COR treatment system into the heat treatment system are preferably equal to one another. As a result, pressure equilibrium can be maintained in the heat treatment system, and moreover the exhaust flow direction can be fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the fourth aspect, after an object to be processed that has been subjected to the COR treatment has been transferred out from the COR treatment system, the heat treatment system and the COR treatment are preferably exhausted, thus setting the pressure inside the COR treatment system to a static elimination pressure for eliminating residual ESC charge. As a result, ESC static elimination can be carried out without the atmosphere inside the heat treatment system getting into the COR treatment system.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to the fifth aspect of the present invention, before communicating the heat treatment system and the COR treatment system together, the heat treatment system is exhausted such as to satisfy the condition that the pressure inside the heat treatment system is less than the pressure inside the COR treatment system.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the sixth aspect of the present invention, a first treatment system in which objects to be processed are subjected to first treatment and a second treatment system in which the objects to be processed are subjected to second treatment are communicably connected together, and moreover a load lock system is interposed between the first treatment system and the second treatment system and is communicably connected to each of the first treatment system and the second treatment system. As a result, the operation of transferring the objects to be processed between the first treatment system and the second treatment system can be simplified, and hence a plurality of processes can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to the sixth aspect, a cooling treatment system for carrying out cooling treatment is preferably connected to the first treatment system via the load lock system. As a result, cooling treatment can be carried out efficiently after the first treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to the sixth aspect, the cooling treatment is preferably carried out in the second treatment system always in an atmospheric pressure state. As a result, there is no need to carry out switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state in the second treatment system, and thus the cooling treatment can be carried out in a short time period; moreover, the load lock system in which switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state is carried out need not have a cooling mechanism, and hence the volume of the load lock system can be reduced, and thus the switching between the vacuum state and the atmospheric pressure state can be carried out in a short time period. As a result, the plurality of processes can be carried out more efficiently. Moreover, after having been transferred into the load lock system, an object to be processed (wafer) will not be exposed to air convection due to the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state for a long time period, and hence the risk of attachment of particles caused to fly up by such convection can also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to the sixth aspect, the load lock system is preferably disposed in a position such as to form a line with the first treatment system and the second treatment system. As a result, the operation of transferring the objects to be processed in and out can be further simplified, and hence a plurality of processes including the first treatment and the second treatment can be carried out yet more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to the seventh aspect of the present invention, the second vacuum/atmospheric pressure switching step and the atmospheric treatment step carried out after the object to be processed (wafer) has been subjected to the vacuum treatment are separated. As a result, the total time required for these steps can be reduced, and hence the plurality of processes can be carried out efficiently. Moreover, after the object to be processed (wafer) has been subjected to the vacuum treatment, the atmospheric treatment step is reached only after the load lock system transfer-out step, the second vacuum/atmospheric pressure switching step and the atmospheric treatment system transfer-out step, and hence the cooling of the object to be processed (wafer) proceeds even before the atmospheric treatment step, and thus the cooling treatment in the atmospheric treatment step can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to the eighth aspect of the present invention, the transfer means transfers an object to be processed into the load lock system, and then, after evacuation of the load lock system has been completed, transfers the object to be processed into the vacuum treatment system, and then, after the vacuum treatment has been completed, transfers the object to be processed from the vacuum treatment system into the heat treatment system, and then, after the heat treatment has been completed, transfers the object to be processed into the load lock system, and then transfers the object to be processed out into the loader module. As a result, the operation of transferring the object to be processed between the treatment systems can be simplified, and hence a plurality of processes including at least one vacuum treatment can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to the ninth aspect of the present invention, for each stage, a first relative positional relationship between the center of the object to be processed in an initial position and the center of the stage is detected, a transfer route for the object to be processed is determined based on the detected first relative positional relationship, and the object to be processed is transferred along the determined transfer route. As a result, the transfer route to the stage can be set to be short. Moreover, a second relative positional relationship between the center of the object to be processed after having been transferred to the stage and the center of the object to be processed in the initial position is detected, and the position of the object to be processed is corrected based on a difference between the first relative positional relationship and the second relative positional relationship. As a result, the object to be processed can be placed in an accurate position on the stage, and hence the efficiency of the transfer operation can be improved, and thus a plurality of processes can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the ninth aspect, the processed object holding part is preferably rotated while the processed object holding part is still holding the object to be processed. As a result, the position of a reference plane of the object to be processed relative to the stage can easily be aligned with a predetermined position, and hence the efficiency of the transfer operation can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the ninth aspect, the center of the object to be processed in the initial position is preferably the center of the object to be processed in the load lock system before transfer. As a result, the transfer route to each stage can be set to be yet shorter.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to the tenth aspect of the present invention, the transfer means possessed by the load lock system, which is communicably connected to a heat treatment system and a vacuum treatment system, comprises a transfer arm that comprises at least two arm-shaped members that are rotatably connected together at one end of each thereof, and a processed object holding part that is connected to the other end of one of the arm-shaped members and holds an object to be processed; the processed object holding part is rotated in a plane parallel to a surface of the object to be processed about the other end of the one of the arm-shaped members, and the one of the arm-shaped members is rotated in a plane parallel to the surface of the object to be processed about the one end of the one of the arm-shaped members, and the other one of the arm-shaped members is rotated in a plane parallel to the surface of the object to be processed about the other end of the other one of the arm-shaped members. As a result, the object to be processed can be transferred along a freely chosen transfer route to a freely chosen position in the heat treatment system or the vacuum treatment system, and hence the efficiency of the transfer operation can be improved, and thus a plurality of processes can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the tenth aspect, the arm-shaped members and the processed object holding part are preferably rotated in cooperation with one another so as to move the object to be processed along a direction of disposition of the first stage and the second stage. As a result, the processed article transfer route can be made shorter, and hence the efficiency of the transfer operation can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to the eleventh aspect of the present invention, the transfer means, which is provided in a load lock system that is communicably connected to a heat treatment system and a vacuum treatment system, comprises a transfer arm that comprises at least two arm-shaped members that are rotatably connected together at one end of each thereof, and a processed object holding part that is connected to the other end of one of the arm-shaped members and holds an object to be processed; the processed object holding part is rotated in a plane parallel to a surface of the object to be processed about the other end of the one of the arm-shaped members, and the one of the arm-shaped members is rotated in a plane parallel to the surface of the object to be processed about the one end of the one of the arm-shaped members, and the other one of the arm-shaped members is rotated in a plane parallel to the surface of the object to be processed about the other end of the other one of the arm-shaped members.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the construction of the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b> described above, there are two vacuum treatment chambers, i.e. a first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b> and a second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b>, connected together in a line. However, the number of vacuum treatment chambers is not limited to two, but rather three or more vacuum treatment chambers may be connected together in a line.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">With the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b> described above, a processed object transfer sequence is carried out as will be described later; however, in the case that a processed object is not transferred properly, the processed object transfer sequence must be suspended immediately to prevent the processed object from being subjected to improper treatment. The vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b> must thus have the ability to accurately grasp the positions of the processed objects being transferred. The vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b> thus has a plurality of position sensors as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">First, component parts with which each processed object comes into direct contact, specifically the stage <b>31</b> (or the processed object holder <b>32</b>), the transfer mechanism <b>52</b> (or the processed object holding part <b>51</b>), and a stage (not shown) provided inside the load lock chamber <b>50</b> for temporarily holding the processed objects, each have a position sensor, and using these position sensors it is detected whether or not a processed object is present. Moreover, whether or not a processed object is present is detected according to the status of an ESC chuck provided in the stage <b>11</b> inside the first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b> or using a position sensor. Creating software for detecting the positions of processed objects based on information obtained through the detection would be easy for a person skilled in the art in the field of vacuum treatment apparatuses; through such software, for example, a controller (not shown) that controls the operation of the transfer mechanism <b>52</b> and so on can detect the positions of processed objects being transferred through the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Furthermore, in the first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b>, the second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b> and the load lock chamber <b>50</b>, position sensor units <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> are provided along the processed object transfer route in positions on either side of each of the gate valves <b>21</b> and <b>41</b> and the door valve <b>61</b>. Each of the position sensor units is comprised of three position sensors, for example laser sensors, that point to an outer periphery of the processed object; the laser sensors are radially disposed facing the outer periphery of the processed object, or are disposed in positions corresponding to the outer periphery of the processed object, and not only detect the position of the processed object, but also detect the center position of the processed object.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The controller detects a first relative positional relationship between the center position of a processed object in the load lock chamber <b>50</b> before transfer (hereinafter referred to as the &#x201c;initial position&#x201d;) and the center position of the stage <b>11</b> or <b>31</b>, determines a transfer route for the processed object based on the detected first relative positional relationship, transfers the processed object along the determined transfer route, and then detects a second relative positional relationship between the center position of the processed object that has been transferred to the stage <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> and the initial position, and corrects the position of the processed object on the stage <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> based on the difference between the first and second relative positional relationships. As a result, the transfer route to each stage can be set to be short, and moreover each processed object can be placed in an accurate position on each of the stages <b>11</b> and <b>31</b>, and hence the efficiency of the transfer operation can be improved, and thus the plurality of processes can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The transfer mechanism <b>52</b> is a transfer arm comprised of an articulated arm of a scalar type single pick type, a scalar type twin pick type or the like. A connecting pulley is disposed at a base portion of the transfer arm, and this connecting pulley is connected to a support pulley disposed at a joint of the arm via a timing belt, whereby a rotational driving force is transmitted to the support pulley. Moreover, the connecting pulley is also connected via another timing belt to a rotational angle pulley possessed by an encoder that detects the rotational angle of the arm.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The encoder electrically stores the rotation starting position of the rotational angle pulley, i.e. the starting position for movement of the transfer arm, as an origin, and moreover detects the moved distance of the transfer arm by detecting the rotational angle of the rotational angle pulley rotatably driven by the other timing belt in the form of a digital signal using a rotational angle sensor, and outputs the detected moved distance as teaching data used in the transfer of a processed object, for example in judging whether or not positioning of the processed object has been carried out accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b> judges whether or not positioning of a processed object, in particular, positioning of a processed object on the stage <b>11</b> or <b>13</b>, has been carried out accurately, by comparing the position of the processed object detected by the position sensors with the teaching data outputted by the encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Moreover, the transfer arm that serves as the transfer mechanism <b>52</b> is comprised of at least two arm-shaped members. The two arm-shaped members are rotatably connected together at one end of each thereof, and the processed object holding part <b>51</b> is connected to the other end of one of the two arm-shaped members. Moreover, the processed object holding part <b>51</b> rotates in a plane parallel to the surface of the processed object about the other end of the one of the arm-shaped members, and moreover the one of the arm-shaped members rotates in a plane parallel to the surface of the processed object about the one end of the one of the arm-shaped members, and the other arm-shaped member rotates in a plane parallel to the surface of the processed object about the other end of the other arm-shaped member. As a result, each processed object can be transferred along a freely chosen transfer route to a freely chosen position in the second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b> or the first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b>, and hence the efficiency of the transfer operation can be improved, and thus the plurality of processes can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The two arm-shaped members and the processed object holding part <b>51</b> rotate in cooperation with one another so as to move each processed object along a freely chosen transfer route, for example along the direction of disposition of the stages <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>. As a result, the processed object transfer route can be made yet shorter, and hence the operational efficiency can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Moreover, over the stage <b>11</b> or <b>31</b>, the processed object holding part <b>51</b> rotates while still holding the processed object so as to align the position of an orientation flat (reference plane) of the processed object (wafer) with a predetermined position. As a result, the position of the orientation flat of the wafer relative to the stage <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> can easily be aligned with the predetermined position, and hence the operational efficiency can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Next, a description will be given of a processed object processing method carried out by the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b>, and a processed object transfer sequence used in this method.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are diagram showing the first half of the processed object transfer sequence for the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are diagram showing the latter half of the transfer sequence, the first half of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the following description, an example is given in which the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b> carries out COR (chemical oxide removal) and PHT (post heat treatment) on processed objects as an alternative to conventional etching treatment (dry etching or wet etching). COR is treatment in which gas molecules are subjected to chemical reaction and the products produced are attached to an oxide film on a processed object, and PHT is treatment in which the processed object that has been subjected to the COR is heated, thus subjecting the products produced on the processed object through the chemical reaction in the COR to vaporization and thermal oxidation, and hence driving these products off from the processed object.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Here, in the COR carried out on the processed object, which is comprised of a substrate forming a foundation and a predetermined layer formed on the substrate, an oxide layer (oxide film) or polysilicon exposed after removing a polysilicon layer in gate regions of the predetermined layer is selectively etched; with this COR, the etching rate is controlled such that the progress of the etching stops at the surface of the substrate. Moreover, this COR includes a vapor phase chemical oxide removal process for forming gate openings that can be realized at low pressure by using a vapor of HF and NH<sub>3 </sub>as an etchant gas.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the following, the first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b> is made to be a COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> in which the COR is carried out on the processed objects, and the second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b> is made to be a PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b> in which the PHT is carried out on the processed objects. Here, the gas supply system <b>13</b> of the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> is preferably a shower head, in which case the introduced gas can be supplied uniformly through the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The volume of the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> is approximately 30 liters, the pressure inside the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> is in a range of 0.5 to 30 mTorr, the temperature inside the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> is in a range of 15 to 50&#xb0; C., and the introduced gas is a fluorine-containing reactive gas, a reducing gas, an inert gas or the like. Inert gases include Ar, He, Ne, Kr and Xe gases, but Ar gas is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Moreover, the volume of the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b> is approximately 50 liters, and the pressure inside the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b> is reduced in two stages, with the pressure during the processing being different to the pressure during the transfer. Moreover, there is no limitation to reducing the pressure in two stages, but rather multi-stage pressure reduction in which the pressure is reduced in more than two stages may be carried out in accordance with the process conditions. Moreover, the temperature inside the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b> is in a range of 80 to 200&#xb0; C., and the vacuum pump exhausting rate is in a range of 1600 to 1800 L/min (when at 200 mTorr), and in a range of 0 to 100 L/min when the processing is completed (when at 0.5 mTorr), although once the desired degree of vacuum in the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b> has been attained, the pump is not operated. The gas introduced into the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b> is for preventing scattering of particles and for cooling, and is a downflow gas (N<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in (1) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, first, a processed object W<b>1</b> is in the loader module <b>70</b>, and the connecting units <b>20</b> and <b>40</b> are in a closed state, and hence the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> and the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b> are isolated from one another. The connecting unit <b>60</b>, on the other hand, is in an open state. The processed object W<b>1</b> has already had a predetermined pattern formed on a surface thereof using conventional treatment. As shown in (2), the first processed object W<b>1</b> is transferred from the loader module <b>70</b> into the load lock chamber <b>50</b>, and then the door valve <b>61</b> of the connecting unit <b>60</b> is closed. Next, the exhaust system pressure control valve <b>34</b> is closed, and the load lock chamber <b>50</b> is evacuated. After the evacuation of the load lock chamber <b>50</b> has been completed, as shown in (3), the exhaust system pressure control valve <b>34</b> is opened, and the gate valve <b>41</b> of the connecting unit <b>40</b> is opened. After that, the gate valve <b>21</b> of the connecting unit <b>20</b> is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Next, as shown in (4), the processed object W<b>1</b> held by the processed object holding part <b>51</b> is transferred into the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> by the transfer mechanism <b>52</b>, and then as shown in (5), after the processed object holding part <b>51</b> and the transfer mechanism <b>52</b> have returned into the load lock chamber <b>50</b>, the gate valves <b>21</b> and <b>41</b> are closed, and the COR is started. During this treatment, the interior of the load lock chamber <b>50</b> is opened to the atmospheric air.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Next, as shown in (6) and (7), a second processed object W<b>2</b> is transferred from the loader module <b>70</b> into the load lock chamber <b>50</b>, and then the door valve <b>61</b> is closed, and moreover the exhaust system pressure control valve <b>34</b> is closed, and evacuation of the load lock chamber <b>50</b> is started. After the evacuation of the load lock chamber <b>50</b> has been completed, the exhaust system pressure control valve <b>34</b> and the gate valve <b>41</b> are opened, and completion of the COR is awaited.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As shown in (8) and (9), after the COR has been completed, the gate valve <b>21</b> is opened, and the processed object W<b>1</b> is moved from the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> into the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Next, as shown in (10) and (11), the processed object W<b>2</b> is moved from the load lock chamber <b>50</b> into the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b>, and then as shown in (12), after the processed object holding part <b>51</b> and the transfer mechanism <b>52</b> have returned into the load lock chamber <b>50</b>, the gate valves <b>21</b> and <b>41</b> are closed, and the COR is started in the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> while the PHT is started in the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">After the PHT has been completed, as shown in (13), the gate valve <b>41</b> is opened, and the processed object W<b>1</b> in the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b> is moved into the load lock chamber <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Next, as shown in (14) to (16), the gate valve <b>41</b> is closed and the interior of the load lock chamber <b>50</b> is opened to the atmospheric air, and then the processed object W<b>1</b> in the load lock chamber <b>50</b> and a third processed object W<b>3</b> waiting in the loader module <b>70</b> are replaced with one another. After that, as shown in (17), the load lock chamber <b>50</b> is evacuated. The gate valve <b>41</b> is then opened, and completion of the COR on the processed object W<b>2</b> is awaited. The transfer sequence described above is accompanied by pressure control. The transfer sequence described above is repeated until processing of the whole lot of processed objects is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In each of the steps (1) to (16) in the transfer sequence described above, judgement of the positioning of each processed object based on comparison between the position of the processed object detected by the position sensors described earlier and the teaching data may be carried out, and in the case that positioning of a processed object has not been carried out accurately in a particular step, the transfer of the processed object may be suspended, and the step and the position of the processed object in that step may be stored, whereby the stored data can be utilized as basic data for a re-treatment recipe.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The above is merely an example of the transfer method, but other transfer patterns are also possible, for example, load lock chamber <b>50</b>&#x2192;first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b>&#x2192;load lock chamber <b>50</b>, load lock chamber <b>50</b>&#x2192;second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b>&#x2192;load lock chamber <b>50</b>, and load lock chamber <b>50</b>&#x2192;second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b>&#x2192;first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b>&#x2192;load lock chamber <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Furthermore, if necessary back-and-forth movement between the first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b> and the second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b> is also possible. By moving a processed object back-and-forth between the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> (first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b>) and the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b> (second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b>), and thus carrying out the COR and the PHT repeatedly, the line width of the pattern formed on the processed object can theoretically be made finer. Pattern miniaturization can thus be coped with.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to the vacuum treatment apparatus of the first embodiment of the present invention described above, the transfer mechanism <b>52</b> transfers the processed object W<b>1</b> into the load lock chamber <b>50</b>, and after evacuation of the load lock chamber <b>50</b> has been completed, transfers the processed object W<b>1</b> into the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b>, and after the COR has been completed, moves the processed object W<b>1</b> from the COR treatment chamber <b>10</b> into the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b>, and after the PHT has been completed, moves the processed object W<b>1</b> in the PHT treatment chamber <b>30</b> into the load lock chamber <b>50</b>, and then further transfers the processed object W<b>1</b> out into the loader module <b>70</b>. As a result, the operation of transferring the processed object W<b>1</b> between the plurality of treatment chambers can be simplified, and hence the plurality of processes including at least one COR treatment can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Moreover, according to the vacuum treatment apparatus of the first embodiment, in the case that the following process condition is satisfied, a sequence of two treatments can be carried out efficiently, without making the first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b> wait.</p>

<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Moreover, in the case that the first vacuum treatment chamber <b>10</b> and the second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b> are always in a vacuum state, there will be no instances in which the second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b> and the load lock chamber <b>50</b> are evacuated simultaneously, and hence in this case the second vacuum treatment chamber <b>30</b> and the load lock chamber <b>50</b> may share the same exhaust system <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Next, a description will be given of the pressure control during the operation of the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>

The interior of the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> is always in a vacuum state, and here is in a state such that vacuum treatment can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">A transfer port (not shown) for transferring processed objects into and out of the first vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> is provided in a side wall of the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b>. A transfer port (not shown) is similarly provided in a side wall of the load lock chamber <b>603</b> disposed adjacent to the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b>. The portions of the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> and the load lock chamber <b>603</b> in which the transfer ports are provided are connected together by a connecting unit <b>611</b>. The connecting unit <b>611</b> is comprised of a gate valve <b>612</b> and a thermal insulation unit <b>613</b> for isolating the interiors of the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> and the environment in the load lock chamber <b>603</b> from the ambient atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> has provided therein a stage <b>609</b> on which a processed object is placed, and a holder <b>610</b> that holds the processed object placed on the stage <b>609</b>. The stage <b>609</b> has built therein a cooling circuit (not shown) as a cooling mechanism through which a coolant can circulate, whereby the processed object placed on the stage <b>609</b> is cooled. Moreover, the interior of the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> is always opened to the atmospheric air. Therefore, cooling treatment in which a processed object that has been heated during CVD or the like is cooled can thus be carried out at atmospheric pressure in the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Moreover, as a cooling mechanism, in addition to the cooling circuit described above, the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> may have an inlet port through which a downflow gas for cooling, for example an inert gas such as N<sub>2</sub>, Ar or He gas, is introduced into the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">A transfer port (not shown) for transferring processed objects into and out of the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> is provided in a side wall of the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>. In addition to the transfer port described earlier, another transfer port (not shown) is similarly provided in a side wall of the load lock chamber <b>603</b> disposed adjacent to the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>. The portions of the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> and the load lock chamber <b>603</b> in which the transfer ports are provided are connected together by a connecting unit <b>614</b>. As a result, the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b>, the load lock chamber <b>603</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> are disposed so as to form a line in this order. The connecting unit <b>614</b> is comprised of a gate valve <b>615</b> and a thermal insulation unit <b>616</b> for isolating the interiors of the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> and the environment in the load lock chamber <b>603</b> from the ambient atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The load lock chamber <b>603</b> has provided therein a processed object holding part <b>617</b> that holds a processed object during transfer so that handover of the processed object can be carried out, and a transfer mechanism <b>618</b> for transferring the processed object holding part <b>617</b> into the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>. Through the transfer mechanism <b>618</b> transferring the processed object holding part <b>617</b> holding a processed object, the processed object can be transferred between the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>, and handover of the processed object can be carried out. Moreover, the volume inside the load lock chamber <b>603</b> is set such as to secure the minimum space required such that the operation of the transfer mechanism <b>618</b> will not be hampered.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a pipe <b>619</b> that communicates the interior of the load lock chamber <b>603</b> to the outside is provided in the load lock chamber <b>603</b> at a lower portion thereof. An evacuating pump <b>623</b> such as a turbo-molecular pump, and a valve <b>624</b> that enables the interior of the load lock chamber <b>603</b> and the evacuating pump <b>623</b> to be communicated with one another or shut off from one another are disposed in the pipe <b>619</b>. Moreover, a pressure measuring instrument (not shown) for measuring the pressure inside the load lock chamber <b>603</b> is installed in the load lock chamber <b>603</b>. Furthermore, a gas supply system <b>620</b> for supplying N<sub>2 </sub>gas or the like is connected to the load lock chamber <b>603</b> at a lower portion thereof. The load lock chamber <b>603</b> thus has a construction according to which the interior thereof can be switched between a vacuum state and atmospheric pressure using the pipe <b>619</b> and the gas supply system <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The loader module <b>604</b> has provided therein a processed object holding part <b>625</b> and a transfer mechanism <b>626</b> similar to the processed object holding part <b>617</b> and the transfer mechanism <b>618</b> described above. Using the processed object holding part <b>625</b> and the transfer mechanism <b>626</b>, a processed object can be transferred between a processed object carrier (not shown) installed in the loader module <b>604</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>, and handover of the processed object can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">A transfer port (not shown) is provided in a side wall of the loader module <b>604</b>. Moreover, in addition to the transfer port described earlier, another transfer port (not shown) is similarly provided in a side wall of the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> disposed adjacent to the loader module <b>604</b>. The portions of the loader module <b>604</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> in which the transfer ports are provided are connected together by a connecting unit <b>627</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In the construction of the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>600</b> described above, there are two treatment chambers, i.e. a vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> and an atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>, connected together in a line. However, as with the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the number of treatment chambers is not limited to two, but rather three or more treatment chambers may be connected together in a line.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Next, a description will be given of a processed object processing method carried out by the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>600</b>, and a processed object transfer sequence used in this method.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> are diagram showing the processed object transfer sequence for the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>600</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In the following description, an example is given in which the vacuum treatment apparatus <b>600</b> carries out CVD and cooling on processed objects.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In the following, the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> is made to be a CVD treatment chamber <b>601</b> in which CVD is carried out on the processed objects, and in the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>, cooling is carried out on the processed objects as atmospheric treatment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 4B</figref>, a connecting unit being white indicates that the gate valve is in an open state, and a connecting unit being black indicates that the gate valve is in a closed state.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">First, as shown in (1) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, a processed object W<b>1</b> in the loader module <b>604</b> is transferred into the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>. At this time, the gate valve <b>612</b> is in a closed state, and hence the load lock chamber <b>603</b> and the CVD treatment chamber <b>601</b> are isolated from one another. The gate valve <b>615</b>, on the other hand, is in an open state, and hence the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> and the load lock chamber <b>603</b> are communicated with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Next, as shown in (2), the processed object W<b>1</b> is transferred from the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> into the load lock chamber <b>603</b>, and then as shown in (3), the gate valve <b>615</b> is closed, and moreover the valve <b>624</b> in the pipe <b>619</b> is opened, and then the evacuating pump <b>623</b> is operated, thus evacuating the load lock chamber <b>603</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Next, as shown in (4), the gate valve <b>612</b> is opened, and then the processed object W<b>1</b> held by the processed object holding part <b>617</b> is transferred into the CVD treatment chamber <b>601</b> by the transfer mechanism <b>618</b>. Then, as shown in (5), after the processed object holding part <b>617</b> and the transfer mechanism <b>618</b> have returned into the load lock chamber <b>603</b>, the gate valve <b>612</b> is closed, and the processed object W<b>1</b> is subjected to CVD in the CVD treatment chamber <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Next, as shown in (6), after the CVD has been completed, the gate valve <b>612</b> is opened, and the processed object W<b>1</b> that has been subjected to the CVD is transferred out from the CVD treatment chamber <b>601</b> into the load lock chamber <b>603</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Next, as shown in (7), after the processed object W<b>1</b> has been transferred out into the load lock chamber <b>603</b>, the gate valve <b>612</b> is closed, and moreover the valve <b>624</b> in the pipe <b>619</b> is closed, and supply of N<sub>2 </sub>gas or the like from the gas supply system <b>620</b> is commenced, thus releasing the interior of the load lock chamber <b>603</b> to the atmospheric air. Once the pressure inside the load lock chamber <b>603</b> has reached atmospheric pressure, as shown in (8), the gate valve <b>615</b> is opened, and then the processed object W<b>1</b> is transferred by the transfer mechanism <b>618</b> into the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>, placed on the stage <b>609</b>, and held by the holder <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Next, as shown in (9), the stage <b>609</b> cools the processed object W<b>1</b>, and once the processed object W<b>1</b> has been cooled to a predetermined temperature (approximately 70&#xb0; C.), as shown in (10), the processed object W<b>1</b> is transferred out into the loader module <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The vacuum treatment apparatus <b>600</b> then repeats the transfer sequence described above until processing of the whole lot of processed objects is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In each of the steps (1) to (10) in the transfer sequence described above, as described for the first embodiment of the present invention, judgement of the positioning of each processed object based on comparison between the position of the processed object detected by the position sensors and the teaching data may be carried out, and in the case that positioning of a processed object has not been carried out accurately in a particular step, the transfer of the processed object may be suspended, and the step and the position of the processed object in that step may be stored, and the stored data may be utilized, whereby the stored data can be utilized as basic data for a re-treatment recipe.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Moreover, with the vacuum treatment apparatus according to the second embodiment, as described for the first embodiment of the present invention, again it is possible to detect a first relative positional relationship between the center position of the stage <b>605</b> or <b>609</b> and the initial position based on the information obtained by the position sensors, determine a transfer route for the processed object based on the detected first relative positional relationship, transfer the processed object along the determined transfer route, and then detect a second relative positional relationship between the center position of the processed object that has been transferred to the stage <b>605</b> or <b>609</b> and the initial position, and correct the position of the processed object on the stage <b>605</b> or <b>609</b> based on the difference between the first and second relative positional relationships. As a result, effects as described earlier can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Moreover, the transfer mechanism <b>618</b> and the processed object holding part <b>617</b> may have the same structure as that of the transfer mechanism <b>52</b> and the processed object holding part <b>51</b> in the first embodiment, whereby effects as described earlier can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The above is merely an example of the transfer sequence, and with other transfer sequences back-and-forth movement between the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> may be carried out if required. By moving the processed object W<b>1</b> back-and-forth between the CVD treatment chamber <b>601</b> (vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b>) and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>, and thus carrying out the CVD and the cooling repeatedly, variation in the thickness of the thin film formed on the surface of the processed object W<b>1</b> can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Moreover, the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> can be comprised of a suitable combination of required modules selected from etching systems, film formation systems, coating/developing systems, measurement systems, heat treatment systems and so on, with there being no limitation to the example described above.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">According to the vacuum treatment apparatus of the second embodiment of the present invention described above, the CVD treatment chamber <b>601</b> in which the processed object W<b>1</b> is subjected to CVD and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> in which the processed object W<b>1</b> is subjected to cooling are communicably connected together, and the load lock chamber <b>603</b> is disposed between the CVD treatment chamber <b>601</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> in a position such as to form a line with the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> and is communicably connected to the vacuum treatment chamber <b>601</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>. As a result, the operation of transferring the processed object W<b>1</b> between the CVD treatment chamber <b>601</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> can be simplified, and hence the plurality of processes including CVD treatment and cooling treatment can be carried out efficiently, and in particular the cooling treatment can be carried out efficiently after the CVD treatment on the processed object W<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Moreover, the cooling treatment in the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> is always carried out in an atmospheric pressure state, and hence there is no need to carry out switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state in the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>, and thus the cooling treatment can be carried out in a short time period; moreover, the load lock chamber <b>603</b> in which switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state is carried out need not have a cooling mechanism, and hence the volume of the load lock chamber <b>603</b> can be reduced, and thus the switching between the vacuum state and the atmospheric pressure state can be carried out in a short time period. As a result, the plurality of processes including the cooling treatment carried out on the processed object W<b>1</b> and the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state can be carried out more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">If, for example, the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state and the cooling treatment are carried out simultaneously as with the conventional vacuum treatment apparatus, then the load lock chamber must contain not only a transfer mechanism but also a cooling mechanism, and hence the volume of the load lock chamber is increased, and hence it has been found that approximately 126 seconds is required for the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state and the cooling treatment; however, in the case that the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state and the cooling treatment are carried out in separate treatment chambers as with the vacuum treatment apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention described above, only the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state needs to be carried out in the load lock chamber, and only the cooling treatment needs to be carried out in the atmospheric treatment chamber, and hence the volume of the load lock chamber is reduced, and thus only approximately 20 seconds is required for the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state, and only approximately 15 seconds is required for the cooling treatment, i.e. only a total of approximately 35 seconds is required for the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state and the cooling treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Furthermore, after having been transferred into the load lock chamber <b>603</b>, the processed object W<b>1</b> is not exposed to air convection due to the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state for a long time period, and hence the risk of attachment of particles caused to fly up by such convection can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Moreover, according to the processed object processing method of the second embodiment the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state and the cooling treatment after the processed object W<b>1</b> has been subjected to the CVD treatment are divided between the load lock chamber <b>603</b> and the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>, and hence the time period taken for each of these processes can be shortened, and thus the plurality of processes including the switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state and the cooling treatment can be carried out efficiently. Moreover, after the processed object W<b>1</b> has been subjected to the CVD treatment, the cooling treatment in the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> is carried out after a process of transferring the processed object W<b>1</b> out into the load lock chamber <b>603</b>, a process of switching between a vacuum state and an atmospheric pressure state in the load lock chamber <b>603</b>, and a process of transferring the processed object W<b>1</b> out into the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b>; cooling of the processed object W<b>1</b> thus proceeds even before the cooling treatment is carried out, for example in the case that the temperature of the processed object W<b>1</b> immediately after the CVD is approximately 650&#xb0; C., it has been found that the temperature of the processed object W<b>1</b> after the process of transferring the processed object W<b>1</b> out into the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> is approximately 400&#xb0; C. As a result, the cooling treatment carried out on the processed object W<b>1</b> in the atmospheric treatment chamber <b>602</b> can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">With the vacuum treatment apparatus according to the second embodiment described above, CVD was carried out on the processed object; however, it goes without saying that the vacuum treatment carried out on the processed object by the vacuum treatment apparatus is not limited to CVD, but rather any vacuum treatment that is accompanied by heat treatment may be carried out, and effects as described above can be achieved in this case as well.</p>
