<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a color electrophotographic image forming apparatus adopting a rotary developing process.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Full-color image forming apparatuses each including a single image bearing member and a rotatable support integrally supporting multiple developing units are heretofore known. The full-color image forming apparatuses adopt a developing process in which the developing units are sequentially switched at certain timing to develop an electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the image bearing member.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such an image forming apparatus that uses a rotatable developing unit support (rotary) integrally supporting multiple developing units and that sequentially switches the developing units to develop an electrostatic latent image on the surface of a single image bearing member is referred to as a rotary image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-148319 discloses the structure of a rotary image forming apparatus in related art. In general, in a developing process using a rotary (hereinafter referred to as a rotary developing process), it is necessary to perform an operation in which developer bearing members in the developer units corresponding to developer of the respective colors are sequentially in contact with and isolated from the surface of the image bearing member at a developing position. The switching of the developing units is performed by the developing unit support that rotates while the developing units are isolated from the surface of the image bearing member.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The image forming apparatus in the related art adopts a structure in which the developing unit support is moved in the radial direction (the direction of the center of the rotation) of the image bearing member by using, for example, a cam having a driving force to bring each developer bearing member in contact with the surface of the image bearing member or isolate each developer bearing member from the surface of the image bearing member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the rotary image forming apparatus in the related art has the following problem.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since the image forming apparatus in the related art adopts the structure in which the developing unit support is moved in the radial direction of the image bearing member to bring each developer bearing member in contact with the surface of the image bearing member or isolate each developer bearing member from the surface of the image bearing member, it is necessary to prepare a space in which the developing unit support is moved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, it is necessary to provide, for example, a cam serving as a driving unit that moves the developing unit support to the radial direction of the image bearing member in conjunction with the contact and isolation operation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other words, it is necessary to provide the space and the driving unit for moving the entire developing unit support to the radial direction of the image bearing member to bring each developer bearing member in contact with or isolate each developer bearing member from the surface of the image bearing member in the rotary image forming apparatus in the related art. Accordingly, it is difficult to achieve a reduction in size and cost of the main body of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to resolve the above problem, the rotation of the developing unit support may be directly used to, for example, cause each developer bearing member to be in contact with the surface of the image bearing member or to be isolated from the surface of the image bearing member without using the driving unit, such as the cam.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, in the image forming apparatus having such a structure, the developer on the developer bearing member can be unnecessarily transferred to the image bearing member when each developer bearing member passes along the image bearing member due to the rotation of the developing unit support to cause an image defect, such as a streaked image or a spot on the rear face of a sheet of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to prevent such an image defect, it is necessary to produce an electric field for preventing the developer from being transferred to the image bearing member between the surface of the image bearing member and the surface of each developer bearing member when the developer bearing member passes along the image bearing member.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the general rotary image forming apparatus, the contact between an electrical contact of the main body of the image forming apparatus and an electrical contact of each developing unit, at which a developing bias is applied, and the isolation of the main body of the image forming apparatus from the electric contact are repeated in conjunction with the rotation of the developing unit support.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention provides an image forming apparatus, such as a rotary image forming apparatus, capable of generating an excellent image without causing the malfunction of the image forming apparatus and the damage of the electrical contacts.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an aspect of the present invention, an image forming apparatus includes a rotatable image bearing member configured to bear an electrostatic latent image; a charge unit configured to charge the image bearing member; a plurality of developing units each including a developer bearing member that bears developer used for developing the electrostatic latent image; a rotatable developing unit support configured to support the plurality of developing units, the developing unit support being rotated to move each of the developing units to a developing position where the developing unit opposes the image bearing member for developing, the developing unit support including support side electrical contacts at which a bias is applied to the developer bearing members provided in the corresponding developing units; a stop position detecting unit configured to detect a stop position of the developing unit support; a main-body side electrical contact configured to apply a bias to each of the support side electrical contacts in a state in which the main-body side electrical contact is in contact with the support side electrical contact, the main-body side electrical contact being provided in the main body of the image forming apparatus; and a control unit configured to control a bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact and a bias to be applied to the charge unit. The voltage of the main-body side electrical contact when each developing unit performs the image formation at the developing position is referred to as a first developing voltage, the voltage of a non-image portion of the image bearing member when the developing unit performs the image formation at the developing position is referred to as a first image bearing member voltage, and the image forming apparatus is capable of performing a position detection sequence in which the developing unit support is rotated to move the developing unit support to a normal stop position by the stop position detecting unit. The voltage of the main-body side electrical contact when each developing unit passes along the developing position in the position detection sequence is referred to as a second developing voltage, the voltage of the image bearing member when the developing unit passes along the developing position in the position detection sequence is referred to as a second image bearing member voltage, and the control unit controls the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact and the bias to be applied to the charge unit so that the second developing voltage has the same polarity as that of the first developing voltage and has an absolute value smaller than that of the first developing voltage, the second image bearing member voltage has the same polarity as that of the first image bearing member voltage and has an absolute value smaller than that of the first image bearing member voltage, and the difference between the second developing voltage and the second image bearing member voltage is larger than that between the first developing voltage and the first image bearing member voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another aspect of the present invention, an image forming apparatus includes a rotatable image bearing member configured to bear an electrostatic latent image; a charge unit configured to charge the image bearing member; a plurality of developing units each including a developer bearing member that bears developer used for developing the electrostatic latent image; a rotatable developing unit support configured to support the plurality of developing units, the developing unit support being rotated to move each of the developing units to a developing position where the developing unit opposes the image bearing member for developing, the developing unit support including a plurality of support side electrical contacts at which a bias is applied to the developer bearing members provided in the corresponding developing units; a stop position detecting unit configured to detect a stop position of the developing unit support; a main-body side electrical contact configured to apply a bias to each of the support side electrical contacts in a state in which the main-body side electrical contact is in contact with the support side electrical contact, the main-body side electrical contact being provided in the main body of the image forming apparatus, the rotation of the developing unit support allowing the main-body side electrical contact to be in a contact state and in a non-contact state with each of the support side electrical contacts; and a control unit configured to control a bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact and a bias to be applied to the charge unit. The image forming apparatus is capable of performing a position detection sequence and an image formation sequence. In the position detection sequence, the developing unit support is rotated to move the developing unit support to a normal stop position by the stop position detecting unit. The plurality of developing units include a first developing unit and a second developing unit arranged downstream of the first developing unit with respect to the rotation direction of the developing unit support and, in the image formation sequence, the developing unit support is rotated in a state where the developing unit support stops at the normal stop position to cause the first developing unit to pass along without performing the image formation in the first developing unit and the image formation is performed in the second developing unit used as the developing position. In the image formation sequence, the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact when the first developing unit passes along the developing position has an absolute value that is larger than that of the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact before a first support side electrical contact at which power is supplied to the first developing unit becomes in the contact state with the main-body side electrical contact and that of the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact before the support side electrical contact becomes in the non-contact state with the main-body side electrical contact after the first developing unit passes along the developing position. The control unit controls the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact and the bias to be applied to the charge unit so that a first difference in voltage is larger than a second difference in voltage, where the first difference in voltage includes the difference between the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact when the first developing unit passes along the developing position and the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact before the first support side electrical contact at which power is supplied to the first developing unit becomes in the contact state with the main-body side electrical contact and the difference between the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact when the first developing unit passes along the developing position and the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact before the first support side electrical contact becomes in the non-contact state with the main-body side electrical contact after the first developing unit passes along the developing position in the image formation sequence, where the second difference in voltage includes the difference between the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact when the developing unit passes along the developing position and the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact before the support side electrical contact at which power is supplied to the developing unit becomes in the contact state with the main-body side electrical contact and the difference between the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact when the developing unit passes along the developing position and the voltage of the bias to be applied to the main-body side electrical contact before the support side electrical contact becomes in the non-contact state with the main-body side electrical contact after the developing unit passes along the developing position in the position detection sequence.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will herein be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. However, the size, material, and shape of each component described in the embodiments and the relative arrangement of the components are to be appropriately modified depending on the structure of an apparatus to which the present invention is applied and various conditions and it is to be understood that the scope of the present invention is not limited to these specific examples and embodiments.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">First Exemplary Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An image forming apparatus according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates an example of the structure of the image forming apparatus according to the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An electrophotographic color laser printer using a rotary is used as the image forming apparatus in the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The color laser printer includes a rotatable photosensitive drum <b>2</b> (image bearing member). The color laser printer also includes a charge roller <b>3</b>, an exposure unit <b>4</b>, and a cleaning unit <b>6</b> around the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>. The charge roller <b>3</b> uniformly charges the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>. The exposure unit <b>4</b> irradiates the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> with laser light to form an electrostatic latent image. The cleaning unit <b>6</b> cleans the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>are provided for the respective colors (yellow, magenta, cyan, and black) of developer as units for supplying the developer to the electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> to develop the electrostatic latent image.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>are integrally supported by a substantially circular rotary <b>102</b> (developing unit support) capable of rotating in the forward direction with respect to the rotation direction of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>. The rotary <b>102</b> is configured so as to be rotatable so that each of the developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>is positioned at a developing position opposing the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>. The rotation of the rotary <b>102</b> causes the multiple developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>to be sequentially moved to the developing position where developer images corresponding to the respective colors are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>may be removable from the rotary <b>102</b>. Such a structure allows supply of the developer and maintenance for every developing unit to improve the convenience of a user. In this case, a door allowing the developing unit <b>18</b> to be removable is provided in the main body of the image forming apparatus. The main body of the image forming apparatus also includes a door-close sensor capable of determining the open and close states of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The color laser printer further includes a control unit <b>10</b> serving as a controller. The control unit <b>10</b> controls a direct-current (DC) high-voltage power source <b>91</b> applying a voltage to the charge roller <b>3</b>, a DC high-voltage power source <b>92</b> applying a voltage to the developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d</i>, turning on and off of the DC high-voltage power sources <b>91</b> and <b>92</b>, and the magnitude and the variation with time of a bias voltage that is applied. The control unit <b>10</b> also controls the rotation operation of the rotary <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The color laser printer further includes a photo interpreter <b>300</b> that detects a normal stop position (home position) of the rotary <b>102</b>. A method of detecting the home position of the rotary <b>102</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the formation of an image on a sheet material S, first, the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is rotated in an arrow direction (counterclockwise) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in synchronization with the rotation of an intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is uniformly charged by the charge roller <b>3</b> and is irradiated with, for example, light for a yellow image (exposure) by the exposure unit <b>4</b> to form an electrostatic latent image corresponding to the yellow image on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Before the formation of the electrostatic latent image, the rotary <b>102</b> is driven by a drive transmission mechanism described below to rotate and move the yellow developing unit <b>18</b><i>a </i>to a position (developing position) opposing the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At the developing position, a voltage having the same polarity as the charge polarity of the developer is applied to a rotatable developing roller <b>182</b><i>a </i>(developer bearing member) of the developing unit <b>18</b><i>a </i>to adhere the yellow developer to the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> and the electrostatic latent image is developed as the developer image. The charge polarity of the developer is the charge polarity of the developer used in the developing of the electrostatic latent image, and the negatively charged developer is used in the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The color laser printer has a structure in which an electrical contact of the main body of the image forming apparatus at which the power is supplied to the developing unit <b>18</b> conducts to an electrical contact of the developing unit <b>18</b> during a period from before the developing unit <b>18</b> reaches the developing position to after the developing unit <b>18</b> passes along the developing position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. A developing bias is capable of being applied during a period before and after the developing position in the above structure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, reference numeral <b>400</b> denotes a main-body side electrical contact provided on the main body of the apparatus, at which the bias is supplied to the developing roller. The main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> is fixed at a position opposing the developing roller at the developing position. Reference numerals <b>185</b><i>a </i>to <b>185</b><i>d </i>denote rotary electrical contacts (support side electrical contacts) provided for the respective developing units in the rotary <b>102</b>. The rotary electrical contacts <b>185</b><i>a </i>to <b>185</b><i>d </i>are in contact with the core metal of the corresponding developing rollers upon mounting of the developing units and the relative positional relationship between the rotary electrical contacts and the core metal of the developing rollers is fixed. The core metal of the developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d </i>and the electrical contacts <b>185</b><i>a </i>to <b>185</b><i>d </i>provided in the rotary <b>102</b> are hereinafter collectively referred to as the contacts of the developing unit <b>18</b>. The main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> is provided so as to be capable of being in contact with the rotary electrical contacts <b>185</b><i>a </i>to <b>185</b><i>d</i>. The rotation of the rotary <b>102</b> allows the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> and the rotary electrical contacts <b>185</b><i>a </i>to <b>185</b><i>d </i>to be in a contact state or in a non-contact state.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Upon application of a voltage from a power source (not shown) in the image forming apparatus to the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b>, the voltage is supplied from the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> to the rotary electrical contacts <b>185</b><i>a </i>to <b>185</b><i>d</i>, which supply the voltage to the developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d</i>. Accordingly, the voltage of the bias applied to the developing rollers depends on the voltage of the bias applied to the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b>. The bias applied to the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> is hereinafter referred to as the developing bias. The voltage of the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> is called a developing voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">After the developing, the rotary <b>102</b> is driven to isolate the developing roller <b>182</b><i>a </i>from the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>. The developer image formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is primarily transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> in response to application of a voltage having a polarity opposite to that of the developer to a primary transfer roller <b>81</b> arranged inside the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Upon termination of the primary transfer of the yellow developer image in the above manner, the rotary <b>102</b> rotates again and the yellow developing unit is sequentially switched to the magenta, cyan, and black developing units (<b>18</b><i>b </i>to <b>18</b><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">After the developing unit <b>18</b> is positioned at the developing position opposing the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>, the developing and the primary transfer are sequentially performed for magenta, cyan, and black in the same manner as in yellow. As a result, the developer images of the four colors are superposed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> to be transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A secondary transfer roller <b>82</b> is in the non-contact with the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> during the primary transfer of the developer image of each color to the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b>. A cleaning unit <b>9</b> that cleans the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> is also in the non-contact with the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b>. The secondary transfer roller <b>82</b> and the cleaning unit <b>9</b> become in the contact state with the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> at the timing when the developer images of the four colors are superposed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> to enable secondary transfer on the sheet material S.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The sheet material S is loaded and housed in a feeding cassette <b>51</b> provided at a lower position of the main body of the apparatus. The sheet material S is fed from the feeding cassette <b>51</b> one by one by a feeding roller <b>52</b> and is fed to a registration roller pair <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The registration roller pair <b>53</b> supplies the sheet material S that is fed to a nip part composed of the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>82</b>. The secondary transfer roller <b>82</b> is pressed into contact with the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> in the nip part (the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the secondary transfer to transfer the developer images to the sheet material S, the sheet material S is conveyed to the nip part. Then, application of a voltage having a polarity opposite to the charge polarity of the developer to the secondary transfer roller <b>82</b> allows the developer images on the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> to be collectively secondarily transferred to the surface of the sheet material S.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The sheet material S on which the developer images are secondarily transferred is supplied to a fixing unit <b>54</b>. The sheet material S is heated and pressurized in the fixing unit <b>54</b> to fix the developer images on the sheet material S. Then, the sheet material S is supplied from the fixing unit <b>54</b> to an eject unit provided in an upper cover <b>55</b> outside the main body of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates an example of the structure of each of the developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>in the first exemplary embodiment. Since all the developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>in the first exemplary embodiment have the same structure, a description of each of the developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>is omitted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The developing unit <b>18</b> using a contact developing method is adopted in the first exemplary embodiment. The developing unit <b>18</b> adopting the contact developing method includes the developing roller <b>182</b> serving as the developer bearing member, a regulation blade <b>181</b>, a developer supply roller <b>183</b>, and a developer housing <b>184</b>. Developer T is housed in the developer housing <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The developing roller <b>182</b> is capable of rotation. The developing roller <b>182</b> is in contact with the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> while the developing roller <b>182</b> is rotating with the developer T borne on the surface thereof to supply the developer to an electrostatic latent image formed in advance on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is assumed in the first exemplary embodiment that the rotation direction of the developing roller <b>182</b> is the forward direction with respect to the rotation direction of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> and that the peripheral speed of the developing roller <b>182</b> is set to 160% of the peripheral speed of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The developing roller <b>182</b> is made of silicone rubber which serves as a basic layer, which is adhered to the outer area of the core metal of stainless used steel (SUS), and the surface layer of which is coated with urethane resin in the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The regulation blade <b>181</b> is formed of a thin plate (80 &#x3bc;m in thickness) made of an SUS material. The regulation blade <b>181</b> is arranged against the rotation direction of the regulation blade <b>181</b>. The provision of the regulation blade <b>181</b> in the above manner allows the coated amount of the developer on the developing roller <b>182</b> to be regulated in conjunction with the rotation of the developing roller <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The developer supply roller <b>183</b> is formed of an urethane sponge wound around the outer area of the core metal. The developer contained in the developer supply roller <b>183</b> is supplied to the surface of the developing roller <b>182</b> at a contact portion between the developer supply roller <b>183</b> and the developing roller <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The developing roller <b>182</b> and the developer supply roller <b>183</b> rotate in the same direction. In other words, the surfaces of the developing roller <b>182</b> and the developer supply roller <b>183</b> move in opposite directions at the contact portion between the developing roller <b>182</b> and the developer supply roller <b>183</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The developing unit <b>18</b> is structured so that a certain voltage is applied to each member in the developing unit <b>18</b> when the developing unit <b>18</b> is arranged at the developing position by an operation described below to form an image on the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the first exemplary embodiment, for example, the voltage of a non-exposure portion of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is set to &#x2212;500 V and the voltage of an exposure portion thereof is set to &#x2212;150 V in the developing. A voltage of about &#x2212;350 V is applied to the developing roller <b>182</b>, the regulation blade <b>181</b>, and the developer supply roller <b>183</b>. A reversal developing method in which the developer is adhered to the exposure portion to perform the image formation is adopted in the first exemplary embodiment. Accordingly, the voltage of the non-exposure portion of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is the voltage of a non-image portion. In a normal developing method, the voltage of the exposure portion of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is the voltage of the non-image portion.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Setting the voltages in the above manner causes the negative polarity developer not to be adhered to the non-exposure portion and to be adhered to the exposure portion due to an electrostatic force. Although the developing roller <b>182</b>, the developer supply roller <b>183</b>, and the regulation blade <b>181</b> have the same voltage in the first exemplary embodiment, the voltages that are set are not limited to the above ones and the voltages of the developing roller <b>182</b>, the developer supply roller <b>183</b>, and the regulation blade <b>181</b> may be differentiated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of the structure of the rotary <b>102</b> (the developing unit support) and peripheral members in the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A state (contact state) in which the developing roller <b>182</b><i>a </i>rotatably supported by the developing unit <b>18</b><i>a </i>is developing an electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Gear teeth are formed along the outer edge of the substantially circular rotary <b>102</b> capable of rotation and the gear teeth are mated with a drive gear <b>172</b>. Specifically, the driving force is transmitted from a drive source (not shown) to the drive gear <b>172</b> to rotate the rotary <b>102</b>. The rotary <b>102</b> rotates in a direction B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> when the drive gear <b>172</b> rotates in a direction A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the rotary <b>102</b> stops when the drive gear <b>172</b> stops.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The drive gear <b>172</b> is supported by the main body of the apparatus via a shaft <b>107</b>. The drive gear <b>172</b> stops when the drive source (not shown) stops and it is not possible for the drive gear <b>172</b> to drive the drive source.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The shaft <b>107</b> of the drive gear <b>172</b> is connected to the center of rotation of the rotary <b>102</b> via an arm <b>103</b>. The arm <b>103</b> is pivotably supported by the shaft <b>107</b>. The arm <b>103</b> is urged by an arm spring <b>104</b> one end of which is fixed to the main body of the apparatus to receive the pivot force of the center of the shaft <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The rotary <b>102</b> integrally supports the developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>so that the developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d </i>of the developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>are positioned on a substantial circumference (substantial outer edge) of the rotary <b>102</b> and the rotary <b>102</b> is rotatably supported by the arm <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A disk <b>101</b> capable of rotating concentrically with the rotary <b>102</b> is provided at the front side of the rotary <b>102</b> in the drawing. The disk <b>101</b> is engaged with the rotary <b>102</b> at the center of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Although the rotary <b>102</b> and the disk <b>101</b> are separately formed in the first exemplary embodiment, the rotary <b>102</b> and the disk <b>101</b> may be integrally formed. A protrusion <b>101</b><i>e </i>is provided on the outer wall of the disk <b>101</b> so as not to interfere with other members. The protrusion <b>101</b><i>e </i>serves as a rotary position detection flag for detecting the home position of the rotary.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A regulation roller <b>105</b> is provided near the disk <b>101</b> so as to be in contact with the outer edge of the disk <b>101</b>. The regulation roller <b>105</b> is rotatably supported by a roller holder <b>106</b> provided in the main body of the apparatus while being in contact with the outer edge of the disk <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Since the surface layer of the regulation roller <b>105</b> is made of elastic rubber, it is possible to reduce the noise occurring when the regulation roller <b>105</b> is in contact with the outer edge of the disk <b>101</b>. In addition, it is possible to reliably rotate the disk <b>101</b> because of a high friction coefficient of the rubber layer.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Although the regulation roller <b>105</b> is rotatably supported by the roller holder <b>106</b> in the first exemplary embodiment, it is not necessary for the regulation roller <b>105</b> to be rotatable and, further, to be a roller if the outer face of the regulation roller <b>105</b> has high sliding performance. In other words, the regulation roller <b>105</b> may be any member that reliably guides the rotation of the disk <b>101</b> while being in contact with the outer edge of the disk <b>101</b> and does not prevent the rotation of the disk <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The arm <b>103</b> urged by the arm spring <b>104</b> urges the rotary <b>102</b> to apply a contact pressure between the developing roller <b>182</b><i>a </i>and the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>. The disk <b>101</b> and the regulation roller <b>105</b> are formed so that a desirable contact pressure is applied between the developing roller <b>182</b><i>a </i>and the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As described above, the developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d </i>can be sequentially in contact with and isolated from the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> only by rotating the rotary <b>102</b> in the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In other words, the operation to make the developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d </i>contact with the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> and the operation to isolate the developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d </i>from the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> are performed from the tangential direction of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Accordingly, since, for example, the structure in which the entire rotary <b>102</b> is moved to the radial direction of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is not required, it is not necessary to prepare a space in which the developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d </i>are in contact with and isolated from the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>. As a result, the reduction in size of the main body of the apparatus can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition, since the contact and isolation operations of the developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d </i>can be performed by rotating the rotary <b>102</b> to switch the developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d</i>, it is not necessary to provide a special structure and a special drive source for the contact and isolation operations. Accordingly, the reduction in manufacturing cost can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Furthermore, since the contact and isolation operations can be performed simultaneously with the switching of the developing units <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d</i>, it is possible to sequentially make the developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d </i>contact with the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> and isolate the developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d </i>from the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> at a high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Furthermore, a pulse motor is used as the drive source (not shown) for the rotary <b>102</b> so as to freely control the rotation and drive of the rotary <b>102</b> in the first exemplary embodiment.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Since the control unit <b>10</b> cannot recognize the position of the rotary <b>102</b> in this state, it is not possible to correctly synchronize the rotation of the rotary <b>102</b> with other operations, such as the application of various biases and the drive of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Accordingly, it is necessary to return the rotary <b>102</b> to the home position if the rotary <b>102</b> possibly stops at a position other than the home position.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the first exemplary embodiment, a position detection sequence can be performed, in which the rotary <b>102</b> is rotated from a state in which the stop position of the rotary <b>102</b> is unknown and the rotary <b>102</b> is determined to be moved to the home position by the normal-stop-position detecting unit, such as the photo interpreter.

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The timing when the detection of the home position (the position detection sequence) is performed will now be described.</p>

The DC high-voltage power source <b>91</b>, the DC high-voltage power source <b>92</b>, and the pulse motor are controlled by the control unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Upon detection of a power-on signal or a door close signal for the main body of the apparatus, the control unit <b>10</b> performs the detection of the home position of the rotary.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">First, the detection of the home position after the apparatus is turned on will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The power supply to the main body of the apparatus is stopped, for example, when the user intentionally turns off the main body of the apparatus or pulls out the power cord while the main body of the apparatus stops. In such a case, the rotary <b>102</b> should basically be at the home position when the apparatus is turned on next time.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">However, if an irregular event occurs, for example, if the user erroneously rotates the rotary <b>102</b> while the apparatus is turned off, the control unit <b>10</b> cannot determine that the rotary <b>102</b> is not at the home position when the apparatus is turned on next time.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In addition, the power supply to the main body of the apparatus may be suddenly stopped when the power cable of the main body of the apparatus is pulled out or a power failure occurs during the image formation. Also in such a case, the control unit <b>10</b> cannot determine that, for example, the rotary <b>102</b> is not at the home position when the apparatus is turned on next time.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Since the rotary <b>102</b> is not necessarily be at the home position after the apparatus is turned on, as described above, the control unit <b>10</b> unfailingly performs the detection of the home position once.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Furthermore, when the developing units are removable from the main body of the image forming apparatus, the user may erroneously rotate the rotary <b>102</b> while the door of the main body of the apparatus is opened for the installation or removal of the developing units, as in the case in which the apparatus is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Accordingly, the control unit <b>10</b> performs the detection of the home position of the rotary <b>102</b> once also when the door is changed from the open state to the close state.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Next, the detection of the home position after the main body of the apparatus is subjected to emergency stop due to paper jam will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">If the time when the medium S stays in the apparatus, detected by a medium passing sensor (not shown) provided on the path of the medium S from the feeding cassette <b>51</b> to the fixing unit <b>54</b>, is longer than a predetermined value, the control unit <b>10</b> determines that the paper jam occurs and performs the emergency stop of the main body of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">At this time, the rotary <b>102</b> may stop at a position other than the home position.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Upon detection of turning on of the main body of the apparatus or closing of the door of the main body of the apparatus after the medium jammed in the apparatus is removed, the control unit <b>10</b> performs a resetting operation to remove the developer adhered to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> and/or the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> in order for the main body of the apparatus to prepare the next image formation. In this resetting operation, the control unit <b>10</b> also performs the detection of the home position of the rotary <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Various biases that are applied when the rotary <b>102</b> rotates and the developing roller <b>182</b> passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in the detection of the home position of the rotary <b>102</b> will now be described.</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates an exemplary state in which the rotary <b>102</b> stops at a position other than the home position. The rotary <b>102</b> stops at a position resulting from rotation of the rotary <b>102</b> from the home position in the direction B by about 60&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">After the main body of the apparatus is turned on, the control unit <b>10</b> starts the detection of the home position of the rotary <b>102</b>. The control unit <b>10</b> rotates the rotary <b>102</b> until the photo interpreter <b>300</b> detects the rotary position detection flag (the protrusion <b>101</b><i>e</i>) (s<b>1</b>) and, then, rotates the rotary <b>102</b> by (360-&#x3b8;)&#xb0; to return the rotary <b>102</b> to the home position.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The developing rollers <b>182</b><i>a </i>to <b>182</b><i>d </i>of the respective colors pass along the contact position with the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> a total of seven times since the rotary <b>102</b> has started the rotation (s<b>1</b>) during a period from the state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> to the termination of the detection of the home position.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Specifically, the yellow developing roller <b>182</b><i>a </i>passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in (s<b>2</b>) to (s<b>3</b>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>), the magenta developing roller <b>182</b><i>b </i>passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in (s<b>4</b>) to (s<b>5</b>), and the cyan developing roller <b>182</b><i>c </i>passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in (s<b>6</b>) to (s<b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the photo interpreter <b>300</b> detects the rotary position detection flag (the protrusion <b>101</b><i>e</i>) (s<b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Then, the rotary <b>102</b> further rotates by (360-&#x3b8;)&#xb0;. The black developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>passes along the contact position with the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in (s<b>9</b>) to (s<b>10</b>). The yellow developing roller <b>182</b><i>a </i>passes along the contact position with the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in (s<b>11</b>) to (s<b>12</b>). The magenta developing roller <b>182</b><i>b </i>passes along the contact position with the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in (s<b>13</b>) to (s<b>14</b>). The cyan developing roller <b>182</b><i>c </i>passes along the contact position with the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in (s<b>15</b>) to (s<b>16</b>). The rotary <b>102</b> stops at the home position (s<b>17</b>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Also during the detection of the home position, it is necessary to produce an electric field for preventing the developer on the developing roller <b>182</b> from being transferred to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> between the developing roller <b>182</b> and the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> when the developing roller <b>182</b> passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">However, since the control unit <b>10</b> cannot recognize the position of the rotary during the detection of the home position, it is not possible to apply the developing bias in synchronization with the timing when the developing roller <b>182</b> passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In addition, when the charge bias and the developing bias (a first developing voltage) similar to the ones during the image formation are continuously applied during the detection of the home position, the control unit <b>10</b> erroneously detected electrical noise occurring when the electrical contact of the main body of the apparatus is in contact with or is isolated from the electrical contact of the developing unit <b>18</b>. At this time, the voltage of the non-exposure portion on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is equal to the voltage during the image formation (a first image bearing member voltage).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The erroneous detection of the electrical noise by the control unit <b>10</b> may cause a problem, such as stop of the main body of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Even if the above problem does not occur, repeating the print operation may cause spark discharge caused by the contact and isolation of the electrical contacts in the energized state to be repeated to damage the electrical contact of the main body of the apparatus or the developing unit <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In order to resolve the above problems, the developing bias (a second developing voltage) is not applied to the developing roller <b>182</b> during the detection of the home position of the rotary and a charge bias of &#x2212;650 V causing the voltage of the non-exposure portion on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> to be &#x2212;150 V (a second image bearing member voltage) was applied to the charge roller <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">At this time, the difference between the voltage of the non-exposure portion on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> and the developing bias applied to the developing roller <b>182</b> is equal to &#x2212;150 V, as in the image formation.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Controlling the voltages in the above manner allows the electric field for preventing the developer on the developing roller <b>182</b> from being transferred to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> to be constantly produced between the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> and the developing roller <b>182</b> without applying the developing bias during the detection of the home position.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Since the developing bias is not applied, it is not necessary to consider the problems caused when the electrical contact of the main body of the apparatus is contact with or is isolated from the electrical contact of the developing unit in the energized state.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Although the image forming apparatus is structured so that the developing bias is not applied during the detection of the home position in the first exemplary embodiment, the electrical noise and the level of the spark discharge can be reduced by setting the developing bias to a value that has the same polarity as that in the image formation and that has an absolute value smaller than that in the image formation even if the developing bias is not set to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In other words, it is possible to reduce the incidence of the malfunction of the image forming apparatus due to the electrical noise and to suppress the damage of the electrical contacts due to the spark discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The difference between the surface potential of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> and the surface potential of the developing roller <b>182</b> when the developing roller <b>182</b> passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is set to &#x2212;150 V, as in the image formation, in the first exemplary embodiment. However, it is possible to more effectively prevent the developer on the developing roller <b>182</b> from being transferred to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> by controlling the charge bias and the developing bias so as to make the value of the above difference larger than that in the image formation. At the least, it is important that the difference between the surface potential of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> and the surface potential of the developing roller <b>182</b> when the developing roller <b>182</b> passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in the detection of the home position is made larger than the difference in potential in the image formation.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As described above, according to the first exemplary embodiment, it is possible to prevent the developer from being unnecessarily adhered to the image bearing member also during the detection of the home position of the rotary without considering the problems caused when the electrical contact of the main body of the apparatus is contact with or is isolated from the electrical contact of the developing unit in the energized state.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Second Exemplary Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The method of applying the developing bias to be applied to the developing roller and the charge bias when the developing unit passes along the developing position in the detection of the home position is described in the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In contrast, according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a case in which the rotary <b>102</b> is rotated in the state where the rotary <b>102</b> stops at the home position to cause a first developing unit to pass along the developing position without performing the image formation in the first developing unit and the image formation is performed in a second developing unit, which is used as the developing position, will be described. Such a sequence is called an image formation sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The second developing unit is arranged downstream of the first developing unit in the rotation direction of the rotary <b>102</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In terms of the home position of the rotary <b>102</b> in the image forming apparatus according to the second exemplary embodiment, the black developing unit <b>18</b><i>d </i>is arranged immediately before the developing position so that the image formation operation can be started as soon as a monochrome image formation signal is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The image formation is sequentially performed in the order of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black when a full-color image formation signal is transmitted in the image forming apparatus in the second exemplary embodiment.

<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Also in this case, as in the first exemplary embodiment, it is necessary to produce the electric field for preventing the transfer of the developer between the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>and the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in order to prevent the developer on the black developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>from being transferred to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> at the developing position.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">However, when the rotary <b>102</b> is at the home position, as in the second exemplary embodiment, the control unit <b>10</b> can apply the developing bias in synchronization with the timing when the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Specifically, the application of the developing bias is started before the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> since the electrical contact of the image forming apparatus has been in contact with the electrical contact of the developing unit <b>18</b><i>d</i>. The application of the developing bias is terminated before the electrical contact of the image forming apparatus is isolated from the electrical contact of the developing unit <b>18</b><i>d </i>since the developing roller <b>182</b> has passed along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As described above, when the rotary <b>102</b> stops at the home position, it is possible to prevent the developer on the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>from being transferred to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> while avoiding the contact and isolation of the electrical contacts in the energized state.</p>

<p id="p-0152" num="0151">After the electrical contact of the main body of the apparatus is in contact with the electrical contact of the black developing unit <b>18</b><i>d</i>, the control unit <b>10</b> applies a developing bias of &#x2212;250 V (a third developing voltage) (s<b>2</b>) in preparation for the black developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>that passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> (s<b>3</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0155" num="0154">At this time, the negative polarity developer on the developing unit <b>18</b><i>d </i>is prevented from being transferred to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> due to the electric field formed by the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> charged with &#x2212;500 V and the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>to which the developing bias of &#x2212;250 V is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">After the black developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>has passed along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> (s<b>4</b>), the control unit <b>10</b> turns off the developing bias (s<b>5</b>) before the electrical contact of the main body of the apparatus is isolated from the electrical contact of the black developing unit <b>18</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Before the yellow developing unit <b>18</b><i>a </i>is in contact with the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> (s<b>7</b>) since the electrical contact of the main body of the apparatus has been in contact with the electrical contact of the yellow developing unit <b>18</b><i>a</i>, the control unit <b>10</b> applies a developing bias of &#x2212;350V during the image formation (s<b>6</b>) to prepare the developing contact of the yellow developing roller <b>182</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In synchronization with the developing contact of the yellow developing roller <b>182</b><i>a</i>, the control unit <b>10</b> stops the drive of the rotary to start to form a yellow image (s<b>7</b>). The position of the rotary at this time is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As described above, when the rotary <b>102</b> stops at the home position, the control unit <b>10</b> controls the timing when the developing bias is applied in order to prevent the developer on the developing roller <b>182</b> to be unnecessarily transferred to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> when the developing roller <b>182</b> passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The second exemplary embodiment is characterized in that the developing bias voltage (the third developing voltage) when the developing roller <b>182</b> passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> from the state in which the developing roller <b>182</b> stops at the home position is different from the developing bias voltage (the second developing voltage) in the position detection sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In addition, the surface potential (the third image bearing member voltage) of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> when the developing roller <b>182</b> passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> from the state in which the developing roller <b>182</b> stops at the home position is different from the surface potential (the second image bearing member voltage) of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> in the position detection sequence in the second exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Specifically, the third developing voltage is set to a value that has the same polarity as that of the second developing voltage and that has an absolute value larger that of the second developing voltage. The third image bearing member voltage is set to a value that has the same polarity as that of the second image bearing member voltage and that has an absolute value larger than that of the second image bearing member voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The reason why the third developing voltage and the third image bearing member voltage are set to the above values will now be described with reference to a timing chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. A case in which control processing similar to the position detection sequence in the first exemplary embodiment is performed from the state where the rotary <b>102</b> stops at the home position is exemplified here. Steps (s<b>1</b>) to (s<b>7</b>) in the following description correspond to (s<b>1</b>) to (s<b>7</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In response to a printing instruction from the controller (not shown), the control unit <b>10</b> applies a charge bias of &#x2212;650 V that has the same polarity as in the image formation and that has an absolute value smaller than that in the image formation to the charge roller <b>3</b> to charge the surface potential of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> with a voltage of &#x2212;150 V (the second image bearing member voltage). The control unit <b>10</b> starts to rotate the rotary <b>102</b> in the direction B (s<b>1</b>) in order to move the developing roller <b>182</b><i>a </i>of yellow, which is the first color to be printed, to the developing position.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Then, the control unit <b>10</b> does not apply the developing bias (the second developing voltage) and the black developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>passes along the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> (s<b>2</b> to s<b>5</b>). The control unit <b>10</b> switches the charge bias to a charge bias of &#x2212;1,000 V for the image formation (s<b>5</b>) and charges the image bearing member with a voltage of &#x2212;500 V (the first image bearing member voltage). The control unit <b>10</b> applies the developing bias (the first developing voltage) for the image formation (s<b>6</b>) after the electrical contact of the main body of the apparatus is in contact with the electrical contact of the developing unit <b>18</b><i>a </i>before the yellow developing unit <b>18</b><i>a </i>moves to the developing position (s<b>7</b>). Then, the yellow developing unit <b>18</b><i>a </i>is in contact with the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> to start the image formation.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The surface potential of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> is changed stepwise from &#x2212;150 V to &#x2212;500 V in conjunction with the switching of the charge bias in (s<b>5</b>). This stepped charge variation does not completely disappear in the subsequent one charge and a stepped density variation may occur in the yellow image.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As described above, when the rotary <b>102</b> stops at the home position, setting the developing bias (the second developing voltage) and the second image bearing member voltage in the manner as in the position detection sequence causes an image defect, such as the density variation. This is because it is necessary to set the second developing voltage to a value that has a smaller absolute value in the position detection sequence in order to avoid the damage of the electrical contact of the developing unit <b>18</b>. In order to prevent fogging from the developing unit, it is not desirable that the difference between the voltage of the photosensitive drum (the second image bearing member voltage) and the developing bias voltage (the second developing voltage) be too large or too small. Accordingly, setting the second developing voltage to a smaller value causes the second image bearing member voltage to be a smaller value in accordance with the value of the second developing voltage. As described above, setting the second image bearing member voltage to a smaller value causes an image defect caused by the charge variation described above.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">When the rotary <b>102</b> stops at the home position, it is not necessary to set the developing bias voltage to an excessively small value, unlike the position detection sequence, because the developing bias can be appropriately turned on and off. Accordingly, when the rotary <b>102</b> stops at the home position, the developing bias voltage (the third developing voltage) is set to a value that has the same polarity as that of the second developing voltage and that has an absolute value larger than that of the second developing voltage in synchronization with the timing when the black developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>passes along the developing position. The voltage of the photosensitive drum (the third image bearing member voltage) is set to a value that has the same polarity as that of the second image bearing member voltage and that has an absolute value larger than that of the second image bearing member voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The electric field for preventing the transfer of the developer is provided between the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>and the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> to prevent the image defect caused by the voltage variation by setting the voltages in the above manner.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In addition, making the difference in voltage between the developing roller <b>182</b> and the non-exposure portion on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> larger than that in the image formation allows the transfer of the developer from the developing roller <b>182</b> to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> to be more effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The position detection sequence will now be compared with the image formation sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In the image formation sequence, the developing voltage is switched in synchronization with the timing when the black developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>passes along the developing position. The developing voltage when the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>passes along the developing position in the image formation sequence is referred to as the third developing voltage for description. The developing voltage before the rotary electrical contact <b>185</b> for supplying power to the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>is in the contact state with the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> is referred to as a fourth developing voltage. The third developing voltage differs from the fourth developing voltage (refer to s<b>2</b> and s<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The developing voltage before the rotary electrical contact <b>185</b><i>d </i>for supplying power to the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>is in the non-contact state with the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> after the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>passes along the developing position is referred to as a fifth developing voltage. The third developing voltage differs from the fifth developing voltage (refer to s<b>4</b> and s<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The third developing voltage is set to a value that has an absolute value larger than those of the fourth developing voltage and the fifth developing voltage. Setting the voltages in the above manner allows the electric field for preventing the transfer of the developer on the developing roller <b>182</b> to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b> to be formed when the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>passes along the developing position. Setting the developing voltage to a smaller value at the timing when the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> is in contact with (or is isolated from) the rotary electrical contact <b>185</b><i>d </i>can suppress the contact or isolation of the electrical contacts in the energized state. The difference between the third developing voltage and the fourth developing voltage and the difference between the third developing voltage and the fifth developing voltage are referred to as a first difference in voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In contrast, in the position detection sequence, the developing unit passes along the developing position in a state in which the position of the rotary <b>102</b> is unknown. Accordingly, the developing voltage is constantly set to zero in the position detection sequence both at the timing when the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> is in contact with the rotary electrical contact <b>185</b><i>c </i>and at the timing when the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> is isolated from the rotary electrical contact <b>185</b><i>c </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In other words, the developing voltage is not positively changed.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The developing voltage when the developing roller <b>182</b> passes along the developing position in the position detection sequence is referred to as the second developing voltage for description. The developing voltage before the rotary electrical contact <b>185</b><i>d </i>for supplying power to the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>is in the contact state with the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> is referred to as a sixth developing voltage. The developing voltage before the rotary electrical contact <b>185</b><i>d </i>for supplying power to the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>is in the non-contact state with the main-body side electrical contact <b>400</b> after the developing roller <b>182</b><i>d </i>passes along the developing position is referred to as a seventh developing voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The difference between the second developing voltage and the sixth developing voltage and the difference between the second developing voltage and the seventh developing voltage are referred to as a second difference in voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In this case, the first difference in voltage is caused to be larger than the second difference in voltage. The first difference in voltage can be made larger than the second difference in voltage because the position of the rotary <b>102</b> is known and the developing voltage can be positively changed.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">As described above, the developing voltage can be differently controlled in the case in which the position of the rotary <b>102</b> is known and in the case in which the position of the rotary <b>102</b> is unknown to prevent the contact between the electrical contacts in the energized state and to suppress the transfer of the developer to the photosensitive drum <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.</p>
