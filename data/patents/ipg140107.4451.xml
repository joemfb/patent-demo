<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">As wireless communications techniques develop and advance, so do the devices and applications which use them. One such example is the development of wireless internet access, or Wi-Fi, which allows a device to connect and use internet capabilities without traditional hardwire lines. By using a wireless connection, a user can move about with a device and maintain access to Internet services, provided that there is Wi-Fi coverage wherever the user moves to.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Traditionally, wireless coverage is provided by a base station, or access point, where the base station has a limited span of area which its signals can cover. In order to distance larger areas, multiple base stations are strategically placed in locations to more efficiently provide areas of viable signal coverage, while reducing overlap in coverage between the base stations. As a device moves out of one base station coverage area to another base station coverage area, the base station to which the device is connected may change.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To a user surfing the Internet on a connected device, the device switching from base station to base station has minor effects. However, when a user begins to use more sophisticated applications, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), the overhead of a device disconnecting from one base station and reconnecting to another can result in more significant issues. For example, in the case of VoIP, switching from base station to base station can result in a disjointed call connection. Thus, as wireless devices, and the applications they run, become more sophisticated, continuity of data transfer becomes an increasingly important element to a successful user experience.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various embodiments enable a device to maintain a plurality of connections to a plurality of wireless networks simultaneously, using one radio. The device can receive multiple copies of data from the plurality of connections, compare the copies of the data for a best representation, and select the best representation of the data for further usage. In at least some embodiments, a device can send data through a plurality of connected wireless networks by copying the data for each determined connection, and sending each copy through the respective connection.</p>

In addition, combiner module <b>106</b> can be configured to recognize multiple copies of data received by the device and select a best representation of the data to be consumed, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Environment <b>100</b> also includes a &#x201c;cloud&#x201d; <b>108</b>, which represents signals in one or more wireless networks between mobile computing device <b>102</b> and access points <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. For example, cloud <b>108</b> may represent wireless signals used as part of, a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based wireless network, a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) based wireless network, or any combination thereof, such as an IEEE 802.11 wireless network, via which a computing device can connect with the Internet.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Access points <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b> each represent a point of interconnection between a wireless network and a fixed wire network. Each access point can serve multiple users within a defined physical network area. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates three access points, it is to be appreciated that any suitable number of access points and/or base stations can be used without departing from the spirit of the claimed subject matter. The overall physical size of wireless network access is related proportionally to the number and location of access points and/or base stations in a region. An access point has the hardware, software, firmware, and any combination thereof, to transmit and receive wireless signals, as well as send and receive data over traditional fixed wires. An access point's connection into traditional fixed wires can be accomplished in any suitable way. Additionally, access points <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> can be associated with a same wireless network, associated with separate wireless networks, and/or associated with a same switch, such as a switch to bridge a connection to the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates access points <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b> connected to a switch <b>116</b> which links the access points to the Internet.

Having considered an example operating environment, consider now a discussion of an example operation in which a mobile computing device connects to multiple wireless networks simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a system <b>200</b> in which an example operation can take place in accordance with one or more embodiments. System <b>200</b> includes a mobile computing device <b>202</b>, as well as access points <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b>. Each access point provides wireless coverage for a corresponding region, represented by oval regions <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>214</b>, respectively. Additionally, each access point has a connection into switch <b>216</b> which, in turn, provides connectivity to systems outside a wireless network, such as the Internet. As illustrated, the access points can have overlapping coverage areas. For instance, sub-region <b>218</b> identifies coverage overlap between coverage regions <b>210</b> and <b>214</b>. Similarly, sub-region <b>220</b> identifies coverage overlap between coverage regions <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As mobile computing device <b>202</b> traverses through an area, it can wander into regions with single or multiple wireless network coverage, as illustrated by line <b>222</b>. Line <b>222</b> represents a path of the device relative to various coverage regions. When mobile computing device <b>202</b> moves into region <b>218</b>, the device can detect whether the wireless networks associated with access points <b>204</b> and <b>208</b> are associated with the same wireless network and/or switch. Upon this determination, the device can maintain simultaneous connections to both access points. Similarly, when the device moves into region <b>220</b>, it can maintain connections to access points <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>. As mobile computing device <b>202</b> moves in and out of regions with multiple wireless network coverage, it can use the simultaneous wireless network connections to maintain seamless data transfer, which is further described below. Furthermore, through the use of soft handoffs, a mobile computing device, as well as associated access points, can continue to use high modulation rates longer instead of reverting to lower modulation rates in an attempt to maintain a link as long as possible to a single connection. While the transmission range of a lower modulation rate is higher, it utilizes more time, which corresponds to more spectrum utilization, to convey the data. Thus, the ability to use a high modulation rate allows for more efficient data transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Having described an example environment and high level operation, consider now a discussion of how a mobile computing device can maintain simultaneous wireless connections using a single radio, in accordance with one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Maintaining Simultaneous Wireless Network Connections</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Various embodiments provide an ability for a mobile computing device to maintain two or more simultaneous wireless network connections without utilizing multiple radios. Communication with two or more wireless networks typically means that a device will disconnect from a first wireless network, then establish a new connection with a second wireless network in order to communicate with the second wireless network. In one or more embodiments, a mobile computing device can establish connections to two or more wireless networks simultaneously without having to disconnect from any of the networks. For example, a device can establish two or more wireless network connections and switch data transfer and receipt seamlessly between the networks when desired, such as, if a connection with one of the networks degrades.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, a mobile computing device may send and/or receive wireless signals on a first network, and then send and/or receive wireless signals on one or more additional networks without disconnecting from the first network. For example, after establishing two or more wireless network connections, a mobile computing device can communicate to a first wireless network that the mobile computing device is entering a power saving mode (or &#x201c;sleep period&#x201d;), thus discouraging communication with the mobile computing device. Connected networks that perceive the device to be in a power saving mode can then buffer data that would normally otherwise be sent to the device. Instead of actually going into a power saving mode as declared, the mobile computing device can switch to exchange data with another wireless network. When a wireless network perceives that the mobile computing device is no longer in power saving mode (e.g. by entering an &#x201c;awake&#x201d; mode), previously buffered data can then be sent to the device. In one or more embodiments, the buffered data can be discarded by an access point if the mobile computing device fails to reconnect or fails to obtain the packets in a timely fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As an example, consider <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which illustrates a relationship between data transmissions on multiple wireless networks connected to the same mobile computing device. Graphs <b>300</b> and <b>302</b> illustrate data transmissions from wireless networks associated with access points <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, respectively. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> only shows two access points connected to the same mobile computing device, it is to be appreciated and understood that any number of access points, as well as channels, can be used without departing from the spirit of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Horizontal axes of graphs <b>300</b> and <b>302</b> represent time while vertical axes represent signal amplitude. Over time, each access point can transmit various bursts of data, such as a beacon. As part of a standard Wi-Fi system, an access point transmits beacons on regular intervals. This is demonstrated for access point <b>1</b> with beacons <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>, and with beacons <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> for access point <b>2</b>. Beacons can be used by a mobile computing device to identify the presence of an access point, as well by an access point to convey relevant information, such as what data rates are supported by the access point, specific signaling methods that may be supported, capability information, and the like. Additionally, beacons can be used by an access point to indicate that there are buffered frames waiting to be transmitted to a particular device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As discussed above, graphs <b>300</b> and <b>302</b> represent a snapshot of data transmissions from two access points connected to the same mobile computing device. At the start of graphs <b>300</b> and <b>302</b>, access point <b>1</b> is engaged in an active connection with the device, while access point <b>2</b> perceives the device to be in power saving mode, and therefore maintains an inactive connection with the device. Since access point <b>1</b> is actively communicating with the mobile computing device, when data is to be sent, access point <b>1</b> transmits burst <b>314</b>, which contains data P<b>1</b><sub>1</sub>. At some point after receiving burst <b>314</b>, the mobile computing device indicates to access point <b>1</b> that it is going into power saving move, and switches its active connection to access point <b>2</b>. While not illustrated, this can entail some minimal communication between the device and one or more access points. Upon resuming active communication with the mobile computing device, access point <b>2</b> transmits data it may have been holding or buffering for the device. For instance, the device can request previous data by using a PS-POLL or UAPSD messages, or can simply send an indication to an access point that the device is no longer in power saving mode, or has &#x201c;woken up&#x201d;, and is ready to receive data. In this example, access point <b>2</b> transmits burst <b>316</b>, which contains data P<b>1</b><sub>2</sub>. Data P<b>1</b><sub>2 </sub>represents at least a partial replication of data P<b>1</b><sub>1</sub>-transmitted by access point <b>1</b>. This process of a mobile computing device switching access points and receiving buffered data from an access point can repeat itself numerous times across many different access points. Oval <b>318</b> represents the complete exchange of P<b>1</b> data to the device through the multiple wireless networks connected to the mobile computing device. Upon receipt of multiple copies of P<b>1</b> data, the mobile computing device compares the copies to determine a best representation of the data, as further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">After the transmission of burst <b>316</b>, access point <b>2</b> has additional data to send to the mobile computing device. Since access point <b>2</b> is currently maintaining an active connection with the device, this data is transmitted in burst <b>320</b>, which contains data P<b>2</b><sub>2</sub>. Mobile computing device may or may not receive burst <b>320</b>, but at some point after burst <b>320</b> is transmitted, the device indicates to access point <b>2</b> that it is going into power saving mode, and switches its active communication back to access point <b>1</b>. The determination to switch between wireless networks, and their associated access points, can be made in any suitable way, an example of which is further described below. Similar to access point <b>2</b>, when access point <b>1</b> resumes its active connection with the device, buffered data or new data is transmitted to the device. In this illustration, buffered data is transmitted, as represented by burst <b>322</b> containing data P<b>2</b><sub>1</sub>. Oval <b>324</b> represents a complete exchange of P<b>2</b> data to the mobile computing device through multiple wireless networks connected to the device. As time progresses, the mobile computing device continues to switch between access points <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. In response, the access points continue to transmit when an active connection is resumed. This is further illustrated with bursts <b>326</b> and <b>328</b>, containing additional data P<b>3</b><sub>x</sub>, in complete P<b>3</b> data exchange <b>330</b>. In one or more embodiments, as the mobile computing device transitions between wireless networks, it can receive multiple copies of the same data.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">By virtually alternating in and out of power saving mode with various wireless networks, a mobile computing device can quickly switch between the networks without disconnecting, thus allowing the device to save time and/or resources utilized to reestablish connections with the wireless networks. For example, some wireless networks utilize authentication protocols for network security purposes. Disconnecting from such networks typically means that a mobile computing device has to perform a re-authentication process before being able to again communicate with the network. By communicating a transition into and out of power saving mode to a network, a mobile computing device can remain connected to multiple networks without having to re-authenticate when alternating between the networks.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, a mobile computing device can alternate between two or more wireless networks without disconnecting from the wireless networks and without utilizing multiple radios. The decision of when to transition an active connection between two or more wireless networks can be determined in any suitable way. For instance, a mobile computing device can determine when to switch between networks and transmit a power saving mode indication to one or more networks based upon information contained in one or more beacons associated with the one or more wireless networks, signal strength and/or degradation, volume of data transfer, number of networks detected, and the like. Furthermore, the device can pause before jumping to a next channel to reduce power consumption, or scan access points for non-overlapping channels. As a device switches from network to network, the device can send and receive multiple copies of the same data, thus increasing the likelihood of real-time data continuity as the device moves from one region to the next. Having considered example implementations in operation, consider now a discussion of steps in a method that facilitates multiple simultaneous connections with wireless networks using a single radio</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of a method in accordance with one or more embodiments. The method can be implemented in connection with any suitable hardware, software, firmware or combination thereof. In at least some embodiments, aspects of the method can be implemented by a suitably configured device, such as mobile computing device <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Step <b>402</b> initiates transmission of a power saving mode indication to at least a first connected wireless network. For example, a mobile device that is connected to four wireless networks simultaneously may indicate to three of the wireless networks that it is going into power saving mode to maintain a passive or idle connection with the three networks, thus enabling an active connection with the fourth wireless network. As described above, a power saving mode indication can temporarily silence or buffer communication between a mobile computing device and an access point. It is to be appreciated and understood that any number of networks can be connected simultaneously without departing from the spirit of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Step <b>404</b> receives data, via a mobile computing device, through a second wireless network connected to the mobile computing device without disconnecting from at least another wireless network. The second connected wireless network is a network that does not perceive the mobile computing device to be in a power saving mode and is a wireless network actively communicating or exchanging data with the mobile computing device. This step can include creating a new active connection with the second wireless network or resuming an existing connection with the second wireless network. For example, a mobile computing device can indicate to the wireless network that it is coming out of power saving mode or actively fetch buffered data.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Step <b>406</b> initiates transmission, via the mobile computing device, of a power saving mode indication to the second connected wireless network. As described above, this message effectively switches an active connection with the mobile computing device to an idle or passive connection. The decision to transition from an active connection with the second connected wireless network to an idle or passive connection can be determined in any suitable way, examples of which are described above. Responsive to transmitting a power saving mode indication to the second connected wireless network, step <b>408</b> enables the mobile computing device to be available to receive data through another connected wireless network that is not the second connected wireless network. One way that this can be done is to transmit to the other connected wireless network an indication that the device is entering an awake mode. The received data can contain all, partial or no data duplication with the data received from the second connected wireless network. Similar to step <b>404</b>, receiving the data is achieved without disconnecting from the second connected wireless network, or other connected wireless networks, and can encompass establishing a new connection with another wireless network, or resuming an existing connection (as by transmitting an awake mode indication as noted above).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Having described how a mobile computing device can maintain multiple connections with wireless networks, consider now a discussion of how data can be managed through the multiple connections in accordance with one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Data Management</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Various embodiments provide an ability for data management associated with a mobile computing device that is simultaneously connected to multiple wireless networks using a single radio. Data management can include sending and receiving two or more transmissions of data over individual wireless networks, where the data transmissions can include at least some duplicate data. For example, a mobile computing device can recognize existing connections, whether active or inactive, and replicate outgoing data to each connection. Similarly, the mobile device can identify multiple copies of incoming data, select a best representation of the data, and sequence the data for consumption. In another embodiment, a switch that is wirelessly connected to a mobile computing device through multiple wireless networks can ensure that two or more networks connected to a same device have access to the same data destined for that device. Alternately or additionally, the switch can combine incoming data from the device connected to multiple networks so as to reduce or eliminate unnecessary redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Consider <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which illustrates a logical diagram of an example architecture in accordance with one or more embodiments. In this example, a system <b>500</b> includes multiple access points <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the system as including three access points, it is to be appreciated and understood that any number of access points can be included in the system without departing from the scope of the claimed subject matter. Wireless networks associated with these access points can connect to a mobile computing device through Virtual Wi-Fi Physical Network Interface Card (NIC) <b>508</b>, which represents hardware, software, firmware, and any combination thereof utilized to maintain multiple, simultaneous wireless network connections with the device using a single radio. In addition to supporting wireless connections to and from the mobile computing device with one or more access points, NIC <b>508</b> interfaces with logical adapters <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> and <b>514</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Logical adapters <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> each represent, to a mobile computing device, a logical connection with a wireless network. For example, logical adapter <b>510</b> represents a logical connection with a wireless network associated with access point <b>502</b>. Similarly, logical adapters <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> each represent a logical connection with wireless networks associated with access points <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>, respectively. A logical adapter sets up a logical connection with a corresponding access point, and sends and receives frame data with the access point through NIC <b>508</b>. While each logical adapter connects through the same physical adapter, the connection is virtualized through a driver and/or operating system. Multiple logical adapters represent multiple logical connections, regardless of whether the physical connection is through the same physical adapter, with the same access point, or with multiple access points.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition to communicating with access points through NIC <b>508</b>, logical adapters <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> communicate with combiner module <b>516</b> and splitter module <b>518</b>. As data is received from an access point, a logical adapter passes relevant data up to combiner module <b>516</b>. In various embodiments, the combiner module receives multiple copies of the same data from two or more logical adapters and determines a best representation of the data to pass up to networking layer <b>520</b> for further consumption. A best representation of data can be determined in any suitable way, such as, by way of example and not of limitation, considering bit error rate of each copy, access point signal strength, access point response time, and the like. Alternately or additionally, combiner module <b>516</b> may forward a packet without waiting for reception of all copies to select a best representation For example, if the combiner module determines a received copy is &#x201c;good enough&#x201d; or/and an expiry timeout is reached, the combiner module may forward the received copy with minimal or no comparisons to additional packets. In addition to determining a best representation of incoming data from one or more access points, combiner module <b>516</b> can further sequence the best representation of the incoming data with other best representations of previously received data as needed before passing to networking layer <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition to receiving data from one or more logical adapters, networking layer <b>520</b> can send outgoing data to splitter module <b>518</b>.

In one or more embodiments, outgoing data can be replicated for at least two or more wireless networks connected to a mobile computing device. Upon receiving outgoing data from networking layer <b>520</b>, splitter module <b>518</b> can determine wireless networks with connections to the mobile computing device, and send a copy of the data to each corresponding logical adapter. In some embodiments, one or more packets may be discarded prior to sending when it has been determined that transmission of a duplicate packet on another connection has succeeded or/and an expiry timeout for a packet was reached a successful transmission can be determined in many ways, such as through the receipt of a positive acknowledgement. Connections can be determined in any suitable way, such as by maintaining a list of logical adapters, querying for connections states, receiving notifications, and the like.</p>

In another embodiment, the two or more packets can be identical to one another.
