<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Computing and communication devices are capable of performing an increasing variety of functions and tasks that continue to improve the user's experience. Computing and communication devices can run a variety of applications, can connect to a variety of wired and wireless networks, can perform point of sale transactions to purchase goods and/or services, and/or can download content, which can be stored and/or displayed on the computing and communicating devices.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">However, many point of sale transactions occur when a customer is located at a merchant's facility (e.g., a store, a restaurant, etc.) and/or when the customer uses a conventional form of payment, such as cash, a credit card, and/or another form of payment (e.g., a debit card, a gift card, a check, etc.), to pay for goods and/or services. Unfortunately, when using the conventional form of payment, the customer risks losing the cash, the credit card, etc. Additionally, when a non-cash-based form of payment is used, to pay for the goods and/or services, the customer usually provides a check, credit card, and/or other form of payment to the merchant, which exposes the customer to a risk associated with an unauthorized use of the credit card, identity theft, and/or an unauthorized use of bank account information associated with the customer.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Systems and/or methods, described herein, may enable a user, of a user device, to pay for goods and/or services, received from a merchant while located at the merchant's premises (e.g., a restaurant, a store, etc.), using an automatic tab payment application (hereinafter referred to as an &#x201c;autotab application&#x201d;) hosted by a user device. The autotab application may enable the point of sale transaction to be automatically and/or electronically performed via the user device. Alternatively, or additionally, the autotab application may enable the point of sale transaction to be performed in a manner that permits the payment information to be provided, via the user device, in a secure manner (e.g., in a manner that does not permit the merchant to have access to the payment information).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As described herein, the autotab application may enable payment information (e.g., bank account information, credit card information, etc.) to be received from the user and/or a bank associated with the user and/or stored on the user device in a secure manner. As also described herein, the autotab application may enable a user to view products and/or services associated with the merchant (e.g., menu items, such as appetizers, entrees, deserts, prices for the menu items, etc.). The autotab application may cause the user device to communicate with a network associated with the merchant in order to receive, from the network, an electronic invoice (e.g., a bill, a tab, etc.) that includes products and/or services that were selected and/or consumed by the user while at the merchant's premises. As further described herein, the autotab application may permit the invoice to be paid using the payment information, stored on the user device, in a manner that does not permit the merchant (e.g., a server, an attendant, a service agent, an attendant, a waiter/waitress, etc.) to access the payment information. The autotab application may enable a receipt to be received from the merchant that identifies the selected and/or consumed products and/or services and information confirming that the payment information was processed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of an example environment <b>100</b> in which systems and/or methods described herein may be implemented. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, environment <b>100</b> may include a user device <b>110</b>, an application server <b>120</b>, a financial server <b>130</b>, and/or a client server <b>140</b> interconnected by a network <b>150</b> and/or private network <b>160</b>. The number of devices and/or networks, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is provided for explanatory purposes only. In practice, there may be additional networks and/or devices, fewer networks and/or devices, different networks and/or devices, or differently arranged networks and/or devices than illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Also, in some implementations, one or more of the devices of environment <b>100</b> may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more of the devices of environment <b>100</b>. For example, application server <b>120</b>, financial server <b>130</b>, and/or client server <b>140</b> may be integrated into a single device. Components of environment <b>100</b> may interconnect via wired connections, wireless connections, or a combination of wired and wireless connections.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">User device <b>110</b> may include any computation or communication device, such as a wireless mobile communication device, that is capable of communicating with network <b>150</b> and/or private network <b>160</b>. For example, user device <b>110</b> may include a radiotelephone, a personal communications system (PCS) terminal (e.g., such as a smart phone that may combine a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities), a personal digital assistant (PDA) (e.g., that can include a radiotelephone, a pager, Internet/intranet access, etc.), a laptop computer, a personal computer, a camera, a personal gaming system, or another type of computation or communication device. In one example implementation, user device <b>110</b> may include a component to scan (e.g., using an optical and/or a radio frequency (RF) scanner) a device (e.g., a bar code, a radio frequency identification device (RFID), etc.) to obtain information. In another example implementation, user device <b>110</b> may include a global positioning satellite (GPS) component that communicates with a GPS constellation to obtain location information associated with user device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet another example implementation, user device <b>110</b> may host an autotab application to perform automatic tab payment operations. User device <b>110</b> may communicate with application server <b>120</b> to download and/or register the autotab application. The autotab application may be used to obtain payment information (e.g., credit card information, such as a credit card number, an expiration date, a billing address, names of authorized users, etc.) from a user of user device <b>110</b>. In another example, the autotab application may obtain account information (e.g., an institution name, a bank account number, a check number, a bank routing code, a password, a username, a personal identification numbers (PIN), etc.) via a communication with a server device (e.g., financial server <b>130</b>) associated with a bank, financial institution, and/or other entity with which the user has an account. The autotab application may process and/or store, within user device <b>110</b>, the payment and/or account information in a manner that does not permit another user to access the payment information.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">User device <b>110</b> may communicate with private network <b>160</b> to perform an automatic tab payment operation. For example, user device <b>110</b> may establish a connection with private network <b>160</b> when the user, of user device <b>110</b>, enters a premises of a merchant associated with client server <b>140</b> associated with private network <b>160</b> and/or comes within range of private network <b>160</b>. In one example, user device <b>110</b> may communicate with client server <b>140</b>, associated with the merchant, via private network <b>160</b>, and may receive information associated with products and/or services associated with the merchant. In one example implementation, the user may select a product and/or service to be purchased, to check a price, and/or to check whether the selected product and/or service is in stock.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">User device <b>110</b> may receive information associated with an invoice (e.g., a bill, a tab, etc.) associated with a selected product and/or service (e.g., a product and/or service offered by the merchant for purchase and/or selected via user device <b>110</b>).

Application server <b>120</b> may, for example, use the information associated with user device <b>110</b> and/or the information associated with the user to register user device <b>110</b> and/or the autotab application. The registration may permit the user to download, at a later point in time, updates to the autotab application and/or to download information associated with products and/or services offered by merchants.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, process <b>600</b> may include receiving set up information via the set up UI (block <b>615</b>). For example, the user may enter set up information into fields associated with the set up UI (e.g., set up UI <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). The user may, for example, enter personal information associated with the user (e.g., a name, a home address, an email address, a telephone number, etc.) into the set up UI. The user may also enter credit card information (e.g., by specifying a credit card type and/or entering a credit card number, an expiration date, a billing address, and/or other credit card information) into the set up UI. The user may, in another example, enter an address associated with a website that corresponds to a bank and/or financial institution at which an account is maintained by the user. The user may also enter security information associated with the user (e.g., a username, a password, etc.), into the set up UI. User device <b>110</b> may receive the set up information that was entered into the set up UI, when the user selects a save button (e.g., save button <b>525</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) associated with the set up UI.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, process <b>600</b> may include obtaining account information based on the set up information (block <b>620</b>). For example, the autotab application may cause user device <b>110</b> to communicate with a server device (e.g., financial server <b>130</b>) that hosts a website that corresponds to a bank and/or financial institution with which the user maintains an account. The autotab application may use the address, obtained from the set up information, to establish the communication with the server device associated with the bank and/or financial institution. The autotab application may send, to the server device, a request for information corresponding to account associated with the user. For example, when sending the request, the autotab application may provide, to the server device, information associated with user device <b>110</b> (e.g., a device identifier, a device address, etc.) and/or information associated with the user (e.g., personal information associated with the user, security information associated with the user, etc.) obtained from the set up information.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The server device may receive the request and may use the information associated with the user and/or user device <b>110</b> to authenticate user device <b>110</b>. Based on an authentication of user device <b>110</b>, the server device may send the information corresponding to the account to user device <b>110</b> and user device <b>110</b> may receive the information corresponding to the account. In one example implementation, the information corresponding to the account may include information associated with a bank account (e.g., a name associated with an institution where the account is maintained, an account number, a billing address, a bank routing number, one or more names of users that are authorized to access the account, etc.). In another example implementation, the information corresponding to the account may include credit card information (e.g., credit card type, credit card number, expiration date, etc.) corresponding to a credit card associated with the user. If, however, the server device is not able to authenticate user device <b>110</b>, then the server device may not provide the information, corresponding to the account, to user device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As yet further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, process <b>600</b> may include processing and/or storing the set up information and generating and/or displaying an autotab icon (block <b>625</b>). For example, the autotab application may process the set up information and/or the information corresponding to the account associated with the user. When processing the set up information and/or the information corresponding to the account, the autotab application may encrypt, scramble, encode and/or otherwise convert the set up information and/or the information corresponding to the account into a format that cannot be accessed, copied, and/or edited by another user or used by any other application other than the autotab application. Alternatively, and/or additionally, the autotab application may store, as payment information, the processed set up information and/or information corresponding to the account in a memory associated with user device <b>110</b>. The autotab application may generate an icon (e.g., autotab icon <b>562</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) associated with the stored payment information and may display the autotab icon on a desktop (e.g., desktop <b>550</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) associated with user device <b>110</b>.</p>

Autotab menu UI <b>700</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, includes fields, data items, and/or buttons <b>705</b>-<b>725</b> for explanatory purposes. In practice, autotab menu UI <b>700</b> may include additional fields, data items, and/or buttons; fewer fields, data items, and/or buttons; different fields, data items, and/or buttons; and/or differently arranged fields, data items, and/or buttons than are described with respect to autotab menu UI <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Registration field <b>705</b> may include an indication of whether user device <b>110</b> is registered with a network associated with a merchant. For example, the autotab application may cause registration field <b>705</b> to display an indicator (e.g., yes) indicating that user device <b>110</b> is registered with a network (e.g., private network <b>160</b>) associated with the merchant (e.g., Alice's Restaurant) or another indicator (e.g., no) when user device <b>110</b> is not registered with the network. Table number (No.) field <b>710</b> may include an indication of a location, station, and/or table identifier, associated with the merchant, that is associated with user device <b>110</b> as a result of registering with the network. Menu data item <b>715</b> may include information relating to a menu associated with the merchant. For example, user device <b>110</b> may receive, from client server <b>140</b> and via the network (e.g., private network <b>160</b>), information relating to a menu associated with the merchant as a result of registering user device <b>110</b>. The autotab application may display the information associated with the menu as menu data item <b>715</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Menu data item <b>715</b> may include menu items data item <b>717</b> and/or menu item prices data item <b>719</b>. For example, menu items data item <b>717</b> may include a list of menu items that identify a variety of cuisine that the merchant may prepare and/or serve upon request, such as appetizers (e.g., Alice's Chicken Wings, etc.), salads (e.g., Alice's House Salad, etc.), entrees (e.g., Alice's Super Burger, etc.), desserts (e.g., Alice's Apple Pie, etc.). Menu item prices data item <b>719</b> may, for example, include prices that correspond to each menu item. Order status field <b>720</b> may identify whether an order has been entered by an attendant. For example, the autotab application may cause order status field <b>720</b> to display an indicator (e.g., yes) indicating that an order, associated with user device <b>110</b>, has been entered by an attendant or another indicator (e.g., no) when the order has not yet been entered by the server. Alert attendant button <b>725</b> may permit the user to notify an attendant in order to obtain service from the service. For example, the user may desire to change an order placed with the server and may alert the server of the changed order by selecting, via autotab menu UI <b>700</b>, alert attendant button <b>725</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">User device <b>110</b> may initiate an automatic tab payment operation when a user, of user device <b>110</b>, enters a premises associated with the merchant. For example, the user may enter the premises associated with the merchant and may connect with (e.g., by synching with) private network <b>160</b> associated with the merchant. The autotab application may send information associated with user device <b>110</b>, location information associated with user device <b>110</b>, and/or information associated with the autotab application (e.g., an application identifier, etc.) to client server <b>140</b>, via private network <b>160</b>, that enables client server <b>140</b> to register user device <b>110</b>. In another example, the user may use user device <b>110</b> to scan a bar code, an RFID tag, and/or some other device associated with a table, within the premises, to obtain information associated with the table and/or an attendant associated with the table. User device <b>110</b> may send the information associated with the table obtained from the scan (e.g., a barcode number and/or information associated with the table) to client server <b>140</b> via private network <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Client server <b>140</b> may register user device <b>110</b> based on the information received from user device <b>110</b> and may open a tab associated with user device <b>110</b> and/or send an indication that user device <b>110</b> is registered.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Alternatively, or additionally, user device <b>110</b> may register with client server <b>140</b> based on a determination that user device <b>110</b> is located within the premises, is located at a particular position within the premises, is being serviced by a particular attendant (e.g., a server, a hostess, a cashier, a service agent, etc.) associated with the merchant, etc. In one example, a location associated with user device <b>110</b> may be based on location information sent by user device <b>110</b> to client server <b>140</b>. In another example, a location of user device <b>110</b> may be identified when the user uses user device <b>110</b> to scan a bar code, an RFID tag, and/or another device associated with a particular position (e.g., a particular table number) and/or a particular attendant associated with the merchant. Client server <b>140</b> may register user device <b>110</b> based on information associated with the location of user device <b>110</b> and may, based on the registration, establish an account, associated with user device <b>110</b>, that corresponds to the particular position and/or an attendant.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, process <b>800</b> may include displaying an autotab menu UI associated with the merchant (block <b>815</b>). For example, client server <b>140</b> may retrieve information relating to products and/or services associated with the merchant (e.g., a restaurant menu, a catalog, etc.) and may send, to user device <b>110</b>, the information relating to the products and/or services. User device <b>110</b> may receive the information and the autotab application may display the information on user device <b>110</b>, via an autotab menu UI (e.g., autotab menu UI <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, process <b>800</b> may include submitting information associated with an order and receiving an indication that the order was placed (block <b>820</b>). For example, a user, of user device <b>110</b>, may review the products and/or services (e.g., menu items) associated with the merchant and may select a product and/or service associated with an order. In one example implementation, an attendant associated with the merchant may submit information associated with the selected product and/or service to client server <b>140</b>. In another example implementation, the user may select the product and/or service by touching the product and/or service via the autotab menu UI. The autotab application may, for example, receive information associated with the selected product and/or service via the autotab menu UI and may send the information associated with the selected product and/or service to client server <b>140</b> via private network <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Client server <b>140</b> may receive the information associated with the selected product and/or service and may send a notification that an order has been received and/or processed. User device <b>110</b> may receive the indication and may display an indication, via the autotab menu UI, that the order has been received and/or processed by client server <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Client server <b>140</b> may send information, associated with the order, to user device <b>110</b>. User device <b>110</b> may receive the information associated with the order and the autotab application may display the information, associated with the order, on user device <b>110</b> via an autotab payment UI (e.g., autotab payment UI <b>730</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). The information associated with the order may include information associated with a date and/or time, information associated with the particular position (e.g., a table number), and/or information associated with the attendant servicing the user (e.g., a name associated with the attendant). The information associated with the order may also, or alternatively, include the selected product and/or service, a respective price associated with each of the selected product and/or service, a value associated with a sum of the respective price associated with each of the selected product and/or service, a value associated with a quantity of tax based on the subtotal and a tax rate, a value associated with the tax rate used to determine the quantity of tax and a value associated with a total price associated with the order. The total price associated with the order may be based on the value associated with the subtotal, the value associated with the quantity of tax, and/or a value associated with a quantity of gratuity that may be entered, by the user, into the autotab payment UI.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As yet further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if an alert is received (block <b>825</b>-YES), then process <b>800</b> may include sending a notification to the network (block <b>830</b>). For example, the user, of user device <b>110</b>, may review the order and may identify a mistake in the order and/or may desire to change the order (e.g., by adding, changing, and/or removing a selected product and/or service) identified in the autotab payment UI. The autotab application may receive an instruction, via the autotab payment UI, to send a notification to client server <b>140</b> indicating that the order is to be changed when the user selects an alert attendant button (e.g., alert attendant button <b>762</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). In one example, client server <b>140</b> may receive the notification and may notify the particular attendant by displaying a notification indicating that the order, associated with the particular position (e.g., table number), is to be changed. The particular attendant may obtain information associated with the change from the user and may submit the information associated with the change to client server <b>140</b>. In another example, client server <b>140</b> may receive the notification and may change the order based on changes to the order identified in the notification.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Based on the changed order, client server <b>140</b> may send information associated with the changed order to user device <b>110</b>. User device <b>110</b> may receive the information associated with the changed order and the autotab application may display the information, associated with the changed order, on user device <b>110</b> via the autotab payment UI (e.g., autotab payment UI <b>730</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As still further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if an alert is not received (block <b>825</b>-NO), then process <b>800</b> may include receiving a gratuity value via an autotab payment UI, and/or determining a total price (block <b>835</b>). For example, the user, of user device <b>110</b>, may review the order and may enter, via the autotab payment UI, a value associated with a quantity of gratuity to be applied to the order. The autotab application may receive the value associated with the gratuity, via the autotab payment UI, and may calculate a value associated with a total price associated with the order based on the value associated with the subtotal, the value associated with the quantity of tax, and/or the value associated with the quantity of gratuity. The autotab application may display, via the autotab payment UI, the value associated with the total price associated with the order.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In another example implementation, the autotab payment UI may include menu items associated with the user as well as menu items associated with another user of another user device <b>110</b>. The user may select the menu items associated with the user and the autotab application may generate and/or display an updated the autotab payment UI based on the selected menu items associated with the user. The user may, in the manner similar to that described above, enter a quantity of gratuity associated with the updated payment UI and the autotab application may update the total price based on the quantity of gratuity associated with the updated payment UI.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In yet another example implementation, when generating the updated autotab payment UI, the autotab application may cause user device <b>110</b> to communicate with the other user device <b>110</b> (e.g., via a point-to-point network, such as Bluetooth network, via an instant messaging protocol via the Internet, etc.) to settle and/or negotiate the order. For example, user device <b>110</b> may send information associated with the selected menu items associated with the user to the other user device <b>110</b>, which may permit the other user to verify that the menu items that are not selected belong to the other user. If the other user rejects one or more menu items that are not selected, the user may negotiate the order by selecting other menu items to be communicated to the other user device <b>110</b> until the bill is settled. When the bill is settled, the user may, in the manner similar to that described above, enter a quantity of gratuity associated with an updated payment UI that permits the autotab application to update the total price. Alternatively, or additionally, the other user may, in the manner similar to that described above, enter a quantity of gratuity associated with another updated payment UI displayed on the other user device <b>110</b> and another autotab application, hosted by the other user device <b>110</b>, may update the total price based on the quantity of gratuity associated with the other updated payment UI.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, process <b>800</b> may include receiving an indication that the bill is to be paid (block <b>840</b>) and sending payment information to be processed (block <b>845</b>). For example, the autotab application may receive an indication that the total price associated with the order is to be paid when the user selects a pay bill button (e.g., pay bill button <b>764</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>) on the autotab payment UI. In another example implementation, the autotab application may receive an indication that the total price associated with the order is to be paid when the user selects an autotab icon (e.g., autotab icon <b>562</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>) and moves the autotab icon to a location on a desktop associated with user device <b>110</b> (e.g., desktop <b>550</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) that coincides with a location within boundaries associated with the autotab payment UI.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Based on the indication that the total price, associated with the order, is to be paid, the autotab application may, for example, retrieve payment information from a memory associated with user device <b>110</b>. The autotab application may process the payment information by decrypting the payment information in a manner that can be received and/or processed by client server <b>140</b> and/or financial server <b>130</b>. For example, the autotab application may send the payment information to client server <b>140</b> via private network <b>160</b>. In another example, the autotab application may send the payment information to financial server <b>130</b> via network <b>150</b> (e.g., the Internet and/or some other network). In this example, financial server <b>130</b> may be associated with, and/or provide access to, a service (e.g., such as PAYPAL&#xae;, etc.) that processes payment information associated with a credit and/or debit card, a bank account withdrawal, an electronic check, and/or other forms of payment. The autotab application may, for example, send the payment information, to client server <b>140</b> and/or financial server <b>130</b>, in a secure manner (e.g., using a secure tunneling protocol, transmitting encrypted payment information, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In another example, implementation, the autotab application may determine that the total price to be paid is greater than a threshold and may display a notification indicating that the total price to be paid is greater than the threshold. In one example, the autotab application may not perform the automatic tab payment operation. In another example, the autotab application may perform the autotab payment operation when an instruction is received, from the user and via the autotab payment UI, to perform the automatic tab payment operation (e.g., an instruction to override the feature that causes a the operation not to be performed).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, process <b>800</b> may include receiving information indicating that payment was processed (block <b>850</b>) and displaying, via an autotab confirmation UI, the information indicating that the payment was processed (block <b>855</b>). For example, client server <b>140</b> may receive the payment information and may send the payment information to financial server <b>130</b> to process the payment information. The payment information may include a credit and/or debit card number, an expiration date, a name associated with an authorized user (e.g., a name associated with the user of user device <b>110</b>), a billing address associated with the authorized user, etc. Financial server <b>130</b> may receive the payment information and/or all or a portion of the information associated with the order and may determine whether the payment information is valid. Based on a determination that the payment information is valid, financial server <b>130</b> may process the payment informant and may send a notification to client server <b>140</b> that the payment information was successfully processed. In another example, if financial server <b>130</b> is unable to validate the payment information, then financial server <b>130</b> may send a notification, to client server <b>140</b>, indicating that the payment information could not be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In another example implementation, user device <b>110</b> may send the payment information to financial server <b>130</b> to be processed. In this example, the payment information may include information associated with the order, which includes information that identifies the merchant with which the order was placed and/or an address associated with client server <b>140</b>. Financial server <b>130</b> may process the payment information and may send a notification to client server <b>140</b> indicating that the payment information was processed or that the payment information could not be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Client server <b>140</b> may receive the notification that the payment was successfully processed and may generate information associated with a payment receipt that corresponds to the order, which indicates that the payment information was successfully processed. Client server <b>140</b> may send the information associated with a payment receipt to user device <b>110</b> which may indicate that the payment information was successfully processed. In another example, if client server <b>140</b> receives a notification that the payment information could not be processed, then client server <b>140</b> may send a notification to user device <b>110</b> indicating that the payment information could not be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">User device <b>110</b> may receive the indication that the payment information could not be processed and the autotab application may automatically send other payment information retrieved from the memory associated with user device <b>110</b> and/or processed in the manner similar to that described above (e.g., with respect to block <b>845</b>). In another example, the autotab application may display a notification for the user to provide the attendant with another form of payment. In yet another example, the autotab application may display a notification that instructs the user to identify which other payment information stored in the memory that the autotab application is to process and/or send to client server <b>140</b> and/or financial server <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">User device <b>110</b> may receive the information associated with the payment receipt that corresponds to the order and may display all or a portion of the information associated with the payment receipt via an autotab receipt UI (e.g., autotab receipt UI <b>770</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>). The autotab receipt UI may indicate that the payment information was processed using the payment information. The autotab receipt UI may include proof of payment (e.g., a transaction number and/or some other proof of payment) associated with the processing of the payment information. The transaction number may be used when the user is reviewing statements associated with the payment information (e.g., a bank statement, credit card statement, etc.) and/or while communicating with another financial server <b>130</b> (e.g., associated with a bank and/or a financial institution associated with the method of payment used to pay for the order). The autotab receipt may also include the method of payment, all or a portion of an number and/or identifier associated with the method of payment (e.g., a credit and/or debit card number, an bank account number, bank routing number, etc.), an expiration date associated with the method of payment, and/or an indication of an amount that was paid as a result of processing the payment information. The autotab receipt UI may further include all or a portion of the information associated with the autotab payment UI.</p>
