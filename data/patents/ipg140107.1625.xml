<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a gaming system and method providing a multiplay game with resultant symbols. The game is associated with a plurality of reel sets each including a plurality of reels. Each reel is associated with one or more symbol display areas. For each reel set, each symbol display area associated with a reel of that reel set is associated with a symbol display area associated with one of the reels of each other reel set. The gaming system independently generates and displays certain of the symbols on the reels of the respective reel sets at the corresponding symbol display areas. If associated symbol display areas display symbols having a designated relationship with one another, the gaming system forms a resultant symbol from those symbols. The gaming system determines any awards based on the resultant symbols and not based on any non-resultant symbols.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gaming systems that provide players awards in primary or base games are well known. These gaming systems generally require a player to place a wager to activate a play of the primary game. For many of these gaming systems, any award provided to a player for a wagered-on play of a primary game is based on the player obtaining a winning symbol or a winning symbol combination and on an amount of the wager (e.g., the higher the amount of the wager, the higher the award). Winning symbols or winning symbol combinations that are less likely to occur typically result in higher awards being provided when they do occur.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For such known gaming systems, an amount of a wager placed on a primary game by a player may vary. For instance, a gaming system may enable a player to wager a minimum quantity of credits, such as one credit (e.g., one penny, nickel, dime, quarter, or dollar), up to a maximum quantity of credits, such as five credits. The gaming system may enable the player to place this wager a single time or multiple times for a single play of the primary game. For instance, a gaming system configured to operate a slot game may have one or more paylines, and the gaming system may enable a player to place a wager on each of the paylines for a single play of the slot game. Thus, it is known that a gaming system, such as one configured to operate a slot game, may enable players to place wagers of substantially different amounts on each play of a primary game. For example, the amounts of the wagers may range from one credit up to 125 credits (e.g., five credits on each of twenty-five separate paylines). This is also true for other wagering games, such as video draw poker, in which players can place wagers of one or more credits on each hand, and in which multiple hands can be played simultaneously. Accordingly, it should be appreciated that different players play at substantially different wager amounts or levels and substantially different rates of play.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various known gaming systems enable a player to wager on and play a plurality of primary or base games simultaneously. In many of these known gaming systems, the award for each played primary game is based on the player obtaining a winning symbol or winning symbol combination and on the amount of the wager placed on that primary game. Certain of these known gaming systems enable a player to place multiple wagers on multiple games and simultaneously display multiple plays of these multiple games. More specifically, these gaming systems enable the player to place a wager amount on each of the multiple games and, for each individual game played, the gaming systems determine any awards based on the generated symbol combinations and the wager amount placed for that game.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a continuing need to provide new and different gaming systems and methods that incorporate new and different ways of playing multiple games simultaneously, thereby increasing player enjoyment, entertainment, and excitement.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a gaming system and method providing a multiplay game with resultant symbols. In certain embodiments, the multiplay game is associated with a plurality of reel sets each including a plurality of reels. Each reel is associated with, and configured to display symbols at, one or more symbol display areas. For each reel set, each symbol display area associated with a reel of that reel set is associated with a symbol display area associated with one of the reels of each other reel set. The gaming system independently generates and displays certain of the symbols on the reels of the respective reel sets at the corresponding symbol display areas. If the symbols displayed at associated symbol display areas have a designated relationship with one another, the gaming system forms a resultant symbol from those symbols. In various embodiments, the gaming system determines any awards based on the resultant symbols and not based on any non-resultant symbols. In certain embodiments, the gaming system makes additional, separate award determinations for the displayed symbols of the first plurality of symbols and the displayed symbols of the second plurality of symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">More specifically, in one embodiment, the multiplay game is associated with a first plurality of symbols, a second plurality of symbols, a first plurality of symbol display areas, and a second plurality of symbol display areas. Each of the first plurality of symbol display areas is associated with a different one of the second plurality of symbol display areas. For a play of the multiplay game, the gaming system generates and displays a plurality of the first plurality of symbols at the first plurality of symbol display areas. The gaming system independently generates and displays a plurality of the second plurality of symbols at the second plurality of symbol display areas. For each of at least one designated one of the first plurality of symbol display areas, if the symbol displayed at that designated one of the first plurality of symbol display areas has a designated relationship with the symbol displayed at the associated one of the second plurality of symbol display areas, the gaming system forms a resultant symbol from those two symbols based on that designated relationship. The gaming system makes an award determination based on any resultant symbols and not based on any non-resultant symbols. In other words, in this embodiment the gaming system considers any resultant symbols but does not consider any symbols that are not resultant symbols when determining any awards. The gaming system provides any determined awards.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, as noted above, the gaming system also makes a first award determination based on the symbols displayed at the first plurality of symbol display areas and not based on the symbols displayed at the second plurality of symbol display areas or any resultant symbols, and a second award determination based on the symbols displayed at the second plurality of the symbol display areas and not based on the symbols displayed at the first plurality of symbol display areas or any resultant symbols. The gaming system provides any awards determined by these award determinations in addition to any awards determined based on any resultant symbols. That is, in such embodiments, the gaming system makes separate, distinct award determinations for each of: (a) the displayed symbols of the first plurality of symbols, (b) the displayed symbols of the second plurality of symbols, and (c) any resultant symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other embodiments, each of the first plurality of symbol display areas is a designated symbol display area. Accordingly, for each of the first plurality of symbol display areas in these embodiments, if the symbol displayed at that symbol display area has a designated relationship with the symbol displayed at the associated one of the second plurality of symbol display areas, the gaming system forms a resultant symbol from those two symbols based on that designated relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It should thus be appreciated that the gaming system and method of the present disclosure incorporate new and different ways to play multiple games simultaneously, thereby increasing player enjoyment, entertainment, and excitement.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Multiplay Game with Resultant Symbols</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a gaming system and method providing a multiplay game with resultant symbols. While the embodiments described below are directed to a primary wagering game, it should be appreciated that the present disclosure may additionally or alternatively be employed as or in association with a bonus or a secondary game. Moreover, while the player's credit balance, the player's wager, and any awards are displayed as an amount of monetary credits or currency in the embodiments described below, one or more of the player's credit balance, the player's wager, and any awards provided to the player may be for non-monetary points or credits, promotional points or credits, and/or player tracking points or credits.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a flowchart of an example process or method <b>100</b> for operating an embodiment of the gaming system of the present disclosure. In various embodiments, process <b>100</b> is represented by a set of instructions stored in one or more memories and executed by one or more processors. Although process <b>100</b> is described with reference to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be appreciated that many other processes of performing the acts associated with this illustrated process may be employed. For example, the order of certain of the illustrated blocks and/or diamonds may be changed, certain of the illustrated blocks and/or diamonds may be optional, and/or certain of the illustrated blocks and/or diamonds may not be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this example, the gaming system is configured to operate a multiplay game associated with a first plurality of symbols and a second plurality of symbols. The gaming system is associated with a first plurality of symbol display areas and a second plurality of symbol display areas. Each of the first plurality of symbol display areas is associated with a different one of the second plurality of symbol display areas. A plurality of the first plurality of symbol display areas are designated symbol display areas. In operation of this example, for a play of the multiplay game, the gaming system generates and displays a plurality of the first plurality of symbols at the first plurality of symbol display areas, as indicated by block <b>102</b>. The gaming system independently generates and displays a plurality of the second plurality of symbols at the second plurality of symbol display areas, as indicated by block <b>104</b>. The gaming system determines whether the symbol displayed at one of the designated symbol display areas (of the first plurality of symbol display areas) has a designated relationship with the symbol displayed at the associated one of the second plurality of symbol display areas, as indicated by diamond <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">If the gaming system determines that the symbol displayed at that designated symbol display area does not have the designated relationship with the symbol displayed at the associated one of the second plurality of symbol display areas, process <b>100</b> proceeds to diamond <b>110</b>, explained below. If, on the other hand, the gaming system determines that the symbol displayed at that designated symbol display area has the designated relationship with the symbol displayed at the associated one of the second plurality of symbol display areas, the gaming system forms a resultant symbol from those symbols based on that designated relationship, as indicated by block <b>108</b>. The gaming system determines whether any designated symbol display areas remain unevaluated, as indicated by diamond <b>110</b>. If the gaming system determines that at least one designated symbol display area remains unevaluated, process <b>100</b> returns to diamond <b>106</b> and repeats diamond <b>106</b> and block <b>108</b> (if necessary) for one of the unevaluated designated symbol display areas.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">If the gaming system instead determines that no unevaluated designated symbol display areas remain, the gaming system makes an award determination based on any resultant symbols and not based on any non-resultant symbols, as indicated by block <b>112</b>. That is, the gaming system considers any resultant symbols but does not consider any symbols that are not resultant symbols when determining any awards. The gaming system provides any determined awards, as indicated by block <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In certain embodiments, when two symbols that have a designated relationship with one another are displayed at associated symbol display areas, the gaming system produces a resultant symbol in the form of another symbol from those two symbols that replaces those two symbols. In one such embodiment, the resultant symbol is visually related to the two related symbols. For instance, the two related symbols are opposite halves of a single resultant symbol, such as a resultant JACKPOT symbol, a resultant WILD symbol, or a resultant BONUS symbol, and when those two related symbols are displayed at associated symbol display areas, the gaming system replaces the two halves of the respective resultant symbol with the resultant symbol. In another such embodiment, the resultant symbol is not visually related to the two related symbols. For instance, the two related symbols are CHERRY symbols, and when those two related symbols are displayed at associated symbol display areas, the gaming system replaces those two CHERRY symbols with a BONUS symbol (or any other suitable visually unrelated symbol).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C illustrate screen shots of an example of one such embodiment. In this example, the gaming system displays (such as on a display device <b>1116</b> or <b>1118</b>, described below) a matrix <b>200</b> including fifteen matrix positions arranged in a 3&#xd7;5 configuration. The gaming system displays a first plurality of symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, <b>210</b><i>c</i>, <b>210</b><i>d</i>, <b>210</b><i>e</i>, <b>210</b><i>f</i>, <b>210</b><i>g</i>, <b>210</b><i>h</i>, <b>210</b><i>i</i>, <b>210</b><i>j</i>, <b>210</b><i>k</i>, <b>210</b><i>l</i>, <b>210</b><i>m</i>, <b>210</b><i>n</i>, and <b>210</b><i>o </i>in the upper halves of the respective matrix positions of matrix <b>200</b> and a second plurality of symbol display areas <b>310</b><i>a</i>, <b>310</b><i>b</i>, <b>310</b><i>c</i>, <b>310</b><i>d</i>, <b>310</b><i>e</i>, <b>310</b><i>f</i>, <b>310</b><i>g</i>, <b>310</b><i>h</i>, <b>310</b><i>i</i>, <b>310</b><i>j</i>, <b>310</b><i>k</i>, <b>310</b><i>l</i>, <b>310</b><i>m</i>, <b>310</b><i>n</i>, and <b>310</b><i>o </i>in the lower halves of the respective matrix positions of matrix <b>200</b>. For instance, in the uppermost and leftmost matrix position of matrix <b>200</b>, the gaming system displays symbol display area <b>210</b><i>a </i>in the upper half of that matrix position and adjacently displays symbol display area <b>310</b><i>a </i>in the lower half of that matrix position.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each of the first plurality of symbol display areas is associated with a different one of the second plurality of symbol display areas. Specifically, in this example, the symbol display areas of the first and second pluralities of symbol display areas that are displayed in a same one of the matrix positions are associated with one another. That is, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>a </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>b </i>and <b>310</b><i>b </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>c </i>and <b>310</b><i>c </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>d </i>and <b>310</b><i>d </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>e </i>and <b>310</b><i>e </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>f </i>and <b>310</b><i>f </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>g </i>and <b>310</b><i>g </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>h </i>and <b>310</b><i>h </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>i </i>and <b>310</b><i>i </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>j </i>and <b>310</b><i>j </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>k </i>and <b>310</b><i>k </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>l </i>and <b>310</b><i>l </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>m </i>and <b>310</b><i>m </i>are associated with one another, symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>n </i>and <b>310</b><i>n </i>are associated with one another, and symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>o </i>and <b>310</b><i>o </i>are associated with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should thus be appreciated that, in this example, associated symbol display areas are displayed adjacent to one another in a single matrix position. While the associated symbol display areas occupy the upper and lower haves of their respective matrix positions in this example, it should be appreciated that the associated symbol display areas may occupy any suitable portions of their respective matrix positions, such as left and right portions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should also be appreciated that a given symbol display area of the first plurality of symbol display areas may be associated with any suitable symbol display area of the second plurality of symbol display areas. For instance, in another embodiment, symbol display area <b>210</b><i>a </i>is associated with symbol display area <b>310</b><i>o. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each of the first plurality of symbol display areas is configured to display one of a first plurality of symbols and each of the second plurality of symbol display areas is configured to display one of a second plurality of symbols. In this example, the first plurality of symbols and the second plurality of symbols are different. More specifically, the first plurality of symbols includes an UPPER HALF JACKPOT symbol and not a LOWER HALF JACKPOT symbol and the second plurality of symbols includes the LOWER HALF JACKPOT symbol and not the UPPER HALF JACKPOT symbol. The UPPER HALF JACKPOT symbol and the LOWER HALF JACKPOT symbol have a designated relationship with one another. When the UPPER HALF JACKPOT symbol is displayed at one of the first plurality of symbol display areas and the LOWER HALF JACKPOT symbol is displayed at the associated one of the second plurality of symbol display areas, the gaming system forms a resultant JACKPOT symbol from those two symbols. The resultant JACKPOT symbol is, in this example, not otherwise obtainable (though in certain embodiments the resultant symbol is otherwise obtainable). That is, neither the first plurality of symbols nor the second plurality of symbols includes the JACKPOT symbol. In this example, none of the other symbols have a designated relationship with one another. It should thus be appreciated that, in this example, when two symbols that have the designated relationship with one another are displayed at associated symbol display areas, the gaming system produces another symbol from those two symbols that replaces those two symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The gaming system displays a plurality of paylines for the multiplay game. Each of the paylines is associated with a different plurality of the symbol display areas. Specifically, in this example, payline A <b>215</b><i>a </i>is associated with symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, <b>210</b><i>c</i>, <b>210</b><i>d</i>, <b>210</b><i>e</i>, <b>310</b><i>a</i>, <b>310</b><i>b</i>, <b>310</b><i>c</i>, <b>310</b><i>d</i>, and <b>310</b><i>e</i>; payline B <b>215</b><i>b </i>is associated with symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>f</i>, <b>210</b><i>g</i>, <b>210</b><i>h</i>, <b>210</b><i>i</i>, and <b>210</b><i>j</i>, <b>310</b><i>f</i>, <b>310</b><i>g</i>, <b>310</b><i>h</i>, <b>310</b><i>i</i>, and <b>310</b><i>j</i>; payline C <b>215</b><i>c </i>is associated with symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>k</i>, <b>210</b><i>l</i>, <b>210</b><i>m</i>, <b>210</b><i>n</i>, <b>210</b><i>o</i>, <b>310</b><i>k</i>, <b>310</b><i>l</i>, <b>310</b><i>m</i>, <b>310</b><i>n</i>, and <b>310</b><i>o</i>; payline D <b>215</b><i>d </i>is associated with symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>g</i>, <b>210</b><i>h</i>, <b>210</b><i>i</i>, <b>210</b><i>o</i>, <b>310</b><i>a</i>, <b>310</b><i>g</i>, <b>310</b><i>h</i>, <b>310</b><i>i</i>, and <b>310</b><i>o</i>; and payline E <b>215</b><i>e </i>is associated with symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>k</i>, <b>210</b><i>g</i>, <b>210</b><i>h</i>, <b>210</b><i>i</i>, <b>210</b><i>e</i>, <b>310</b><i>k</i>, <b>310</b><i>g</i>, <b>310</b><i>h</i>, <b>310</b><i>i</i>, and <b>310</b><i>e</i>. Payline A <b>215</b><i>a</i>, payline B <b>215</b><i>b</i>, payline C <b>215</b><i>c</i>, payline D <b>215</b><i>d</i>, and payline E <b>215</b><i>e </i>are sometimes referred to herein as paylines A, B, C, D, and E for brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The gaming system also displays: a message display <b>240</b>, which displays information, notifications, and/or messages before, during, or after play of the multiplay game; a credit meter <b>250</b>, which displays a player's credit balance in the form of an amount of credits in this example; a wager indicator <b>260</b>, which displays the player's wager for a play of the multiplay game in the form of an amount of credits in this example; and an award meter <b>270</b>, which displays any awards provided to the player in the form of an amount of credits in this example. While in this illustrated example the gaming system indicates the player's credit balance, the player's wager, and any awards provided to the player in the form of amounts of credits, it should be appreciated that such indications may alternatively or additionally be made in the form of amounts of currency.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in this example, a player funds the gaming system by depositing value. The gaming system provides the player with 100 credits, which represent the deposited value. The player subsequently places a wager of 5 credits. Wager indicator <b>260</b> displays the player's wager of 5 credits. Credit meter <b>250</b> displays the player's total remaining credit balance of 95 credits (i.e., the player's initial credit balance of 100 credits minus the player's wager of 5 credits). Message display <b>240</b> displays the following message: &#x201c;WELCOME! YOU DEPOSITED 100 CREDITS AND PLACED A WAGER OF 5 CREDITS. PLEASE WAIT WHILE THE REELS SPIN!&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, upon initiation of a play of the multiplay game, the gaming system generates and displays a plurality of the first plurality of symbols at the first plurality of symbol display areas and independently generates and displays a plurality of the second plurality of symbols at the second plurality of symbol display areas.

In one such embodiment, the resultant symbol includes one of the two related symbols and a modifier (such as a multiplier). In this embodiment, the gaining system uses the modifier to modify any awards won by the player for the play of the multiplay game. In other embodiments, the resultant symbol only includes a modifier. In further embodiments, the resultant symbol includes a modifier and at least one different symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additionally, in certain embodiments, the multiplay game is associated with a plurality of different types of designated relationships that symbols may have with one another.

Specifically, in this illustrated example, the gaming system generates and displays, in pertinent part: UPPER HALF WILD symbol <b>212</b><i>a </i>at symbol display area <b>210</b><i>a</i>, LOWER HALF WILD symbol <b>312</b><i>a </i>at symbol display area <b>310</b><i>a</i>, DOLLAR SIGN symbol <b>212</b><i>g </i>at symbol display area <b>210</b><i>g</i>, DOLLAR SIGN symbol <b>312</b><i>g </i>at symbol display area <b>310</b><i>g</i>, DOLLAR SIGN symbol <b>212</b><i>h </i>at symbol display area <b>210</b><i>h</i>, and DOLLAR SIGN symbol <b>312</b><i>h </i>at symbol display area <b>310</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this example, each of the first plurality of symbol display areas is a designated symbol display area. Accordingly, after generating and displaying the symbols at the symbol display areas the gaming system determines, for each of the first plurality of symbol display areas, whether the symbol displayed at that symbol display area has the first designated relationship or the second designated relationship with the symbol displayed at the associated one of the second plurality of symbol display areas. Message display <b>240</b> displays the following message: &#x201c;PLEASE WAIT WHILE ANY RELATED SYMBOLS ARE FORMED INTO RESULTANT SYMBOLS!&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As explained above, in this example, when associated symbol display areas display the same symbol, the gaming system determines that those symbols have the first designated relationship with one another. Here, the gaming system determines that: DOLLAR SIGN symbol <b>212</b><i>g </i>and DOLLAR SIGN symbol <b>312</b><i>g</i>, respectively displayed at associated symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>g </i>and <b>310</b><i>g</i>, have the first designated relationship with one another; and DOLLAR SIGN symbol <b>212</b>H and DOLLAR SIGN symbol <b>312</b><i>h</i>, respectively displayed at associated symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>h </i>and <b>310</b><i>h</i>, have the first designated relationship with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the gaming system forms a resultant double symbol from each of those sets of two symbols. Specifically, the gaming system forms resultant DOLLAR SIGN-DOLLAR SIGN symbol <b>412</b><i>g </i>from symbols <b>212</b><i>g </i>and <b>312</b><i>g </i>and resultant DOLLAR SIGN-DOLLAR SIGN symbol <b>412</b><i>h </i>from symbols <b>212</b><i>h </i>and <b>312</b><i>h</i>. The gaming system displays resultant double symbol <b>412</b><i>g </i>at resultant symbol display area <b>410</b><i>g </i>(which replaces symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>g </i>and <b>310</b><i>g</i>) and resultant double symbol <b>412</b><i>h </i>at resultant symbol display area <b>410</b><i>h </i>(which replaces symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>h </i>and <b>310</b><i>h</i>). As explained above, in this example, the UPPER HALF WILD symbol and the LOWER HALF WILD symbol have the second designated relationship with one another. Here, the gaming system determines that UPPER HALF WILD symbol <b>212</b><i>a </i>and LOWER HALF WILD symbol <b>312</b><i>a</i>, respectively displayed at associated symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>a</i>, have the second designated relationship with one another. Accordingly, the gaming system forms resultant WILD symbol <b>412</b><i>a </i>from those two symbols. Message display <b>240</b> displays the following message: &#x201c;PLEASE WAIT WHILE THE RESULTANT WILD EXPANDS ALONG THE REEL!&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this illustrated example, since none of the symbols displayed at any other associated symbol display areas have the first or the second designated relationship with one another, the gaming system &#x201c;grays out,&#x201d; &#x201c;crosses out,&#x201d; or otherwise indicates that those symbol display areas do not display symbols that have the first or second designated relationships with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the gaming system also replaces symbols <b>212</b><i>f </i>and <b>312</b><i>f</i>, displayed at symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>f </i>and <b>310</b><i>f</i>, respectively, with resultant WILD symbol <b>412</b><i>f</i>; and symbols <b>212</b><i>k </i>and <b>312</b><i>k</i>, displayed at symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>k </i>and <b>310</b><i>k</i>, respectively, with resultant WILD symbol <b>412</b><i>k</i>. The gaming system displays resultant WILD symbol <b>412</b><i>a </i>at resultant symbol display area <b>410</b><i>a </i>(which replaces symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>a</i>), resultant WILD symbol <b>412</b><i>f </i>at resultant symbol display area <b>410</b><i>f </i>(which replaces symbol display areas <b>210</b><i>f </i>and <b>310</b><i>f</i>); and resultant WILD symbol <b>412</b><i>k </i>at resultant symbol display area <b>410</b><i>k </i>(which replaces symbol display area <b>210</b><i>k </i>and <b>310</b><i>k</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this example, the gaming system makes an award determination based on the resultant symbols and not based on any of the other, non-resultant symbols. Here, the gaming system determines whether the resultant symbols form any of a plurality of winning symbol combinations along paylines A, B, C, D, and/or E. In this example, the gaming system determines: (a) an award of 500 credits for resultant symbols <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>g</i>, and <b>412</b><i>h </i>displayed from left to right at resultant symbol display areas <b>410</b><i>a</i>, <b>410</b><i>g</i>, and <b>410</b><i>h</i>, respectively; along payline D; (b) an award of 500 credits for resultant symbols <b>412</b><i>f</i>, <b>412</b><i>g</i>, and <b>412</b><i>h </i>displayed from left to right at resultant symbol display areas <b>410</b><i>f</i>, <b>410</b><i>g</i>, and <b>410</b><i>h</i>, respectively, along payline B; and (c) an award of 500 credits for resultant symbols <b>412</b><i>k</i>, <b>412</b><i>g</i>, and <b>412</b><i>h </i>displayed from left to right at resultant symbol display areas <b>410</b><i>k</i>, <b>410</b><i>g</i>, and <b>410</b><i>h</i>, respectively, along payline E. That is, the gaming system determined a total award of 1,500 credits for the five instances of the DOLLAR SIGN symbol (resultant WILD symbols <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>f</i>, and <b>412</b><i>k </i>act as the DOLLAR SIGN symbol to maximize the player's award) displayed along paylines B, D, and E. The gaming system displays the 1,500 credit award in award indicator <b>270</b> and updates the player's credit balance indicated by credit meter <b>250</b> to 1,595 credits to reflect the 1,500 credit award. Message display <b>240</b> displays the following message: &#x201c;CONGRATULATIONS, YOU WIN 1,500 CREDITS FOR THE DISPLAYED WILCO-COLLAR SIGN-DOLLAR SIGN-DOLLAR SIGN-DOLLAR SIGN WINNING SYMBOL COMBINATION!&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It should be appreciated that the feature, award, or award opportunity may be any suitable feature, award, or award opportunity in addition to or instead of a reel including stacked wilds, such as one or more of: (a) monetary credits or currency; (b) non-monetary credits or currency; (c) a multiplier for use in the current play of the multiplay game, one or more future plays of the multiplay game, and/or one or more future plays of the a bonus game; (d) one or more free plays of the multiplay game (such as one or more free spins); (e) one or more plays of one or more bonus games other than the multiplay game (such as a free spin of an award wheel); (f) one or more lottery based awards, such as lottery or drawing tickets; (g) a wager match for one or more plays of the multiplay game; (h) an increase in the average expected payback percentage of the multiplay game and/or a bonus game for one or more plays of those games; (i) one or more comps, such as a free dinner, a free night's stay at a hotel, a high value product such as a free car, or a low value product such as a free teddy bear; (j) one or more bonus or promotional credits usable for online play; (k) a lump sum of player tracking points or credits; (l) a multiplier for player tracking points or credits; (m) an increase in a membership or player tracking level; (n) coupons or promotions usable within a gaming establishment and/or outside of the gaming establishment (e.g., a 20% off coupon for use at a convenience store or a promotional code providing a deposit match for use in association with an online casino); (o) an access code usable to unlock content on the internet; and (p) an additional set of reels (i.e., plurality of symbol display areas) for one or more plays of the multiplay game at no additional cost to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In other embodiments, the gaming system does not display associated symbol display areas adjacent to one another in a single matrix position of a displayed matrix. Rather, in these embodiments, the gaming system displays multiple distinct matrices of symbol display areas. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, <b>6</b>C, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A, and <b>9</b>B, in these embodiments the gaming system displays a first matrix <b>2200</b> including a plurality of matrix positions each including one of the first plurality of symbol display areas, a second matrix <b>2300</b> including a plurality of matrix positions each including one of the second plurality of symbol display areas, and a resultant matrix <b>2400</b> including a plurality of resultant symbol display areas.</p>

The descriptions of these example embodiments are not repeated for brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In various embodiments, the gaming system makes a single award determination for any symbols displayed at the first plurality of symbol display areas, the second plurality of symbol display areas, and any resultant symbols. In other words, in these embodiments, the gaming system considers all displayed symbols when determining any awards instead of (or in addition to) making one or more award determinations associated with a subset of the displayed symbols (e.g., an award determination based on any resultant symbols and not based on any non-resultant symbols, an award determination based on the displayed symbols of the first plurality of symbols and not based on the displayed symbols of the second plurality of symbols or any resultant symbols, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In certain embodiments, the gaming system makes additional award determinations associated with each of the first and second pluralities of symbol display areas. That is, in these embodiments, the gaming system makes: (a) a first independent award determination for the symbols displayed at the first plurality of symbol display areas, but not the symbols displayed at the second plurality of symbol display areas or any resultant symbols; (b) a second independent award determination for the symbols displayed at the second plurality of symbol display areas, but not the symbols displayed at the first plurality of symbol display areas or any resultant symbols; and (c) a third independent award determination for any resultant symbols and not for any non-resultant symbols. That is, each of these award determinations are separate and distinct from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be appreciated that the types of designated relationships described above are merely example designated relationships, and that any other suitable relationships between symbols may be designated relationships. While certain designated relationships are based on a related visual characteristic of two symbols (e.g., upper and lower halves of a single resultant symbol, the symbols being the same symbol, and the like), it should be appreciated that certain designated relationships are independent of whether two symbols have a related visual characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For instance, in one embodiment, symbols having the same award values have a designated relationship with one another, regardless of the visual characteristics of those symbols. Thus, in this embodiment, when symbols having the same award value are generated and displayed in associated symbol display areas, the gaming system forms a resultant symbol from those two symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In certain embodiments, designated relationships are determined on a per-spin basis. That is, for each spin, the gaming system determines which symbols have a designated relationship with one another. For instance, for each spin, the gaining system determines (such as randomly) two of a plurality of elements (such as fire, water, wind, and earth) to have a designated relationship with one another. If symbols associated with the two determined elements are respectively displayed at associated symbol display areas, the gaming system forms a resultant symbol from those two symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In various embodiments, only certain types or categories of symbols may have a designated relationship with one another. In one embodiment, only major symbols (e.g., symbols associated with high value winning symbol combinations, such as those associated with a jackpot award), may have a designated relationship with one another. That is, in this embodiment, minor symbols (e.g., symbols associated with no winning symbol combination or with a low value winning symbol combination, such as a those associated with a minimum award) may not have a designated relationship with one another. In other embodiments, however, there are no restrictions as to which types or categories of symbols may have a designated relationship with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It should be appreciated that any quantity of the first plurality of symbol display areas may be designated symbol display areas. It should also be appreciated that any of the symbol display areas of the first plurality of symbol display areas may be designated symbol display areas. In certain embodiments, the quantity of the first plurality of symbol display areas that are designated symbol display areas and/or which specific symbol display areas of the first plurality of symbol display areas are designated symbol display areas is determined based on one or more of: (a) a random determination, (b) a predetermined criteria or order, (c) a probability distribution, (d) player choice, (e) the player's wager, (f) an outcome of a play of the multiplay game, (g) an outcome of one or more of the individual sets of symbol display areas, (h) player coin-in, and (i) a player tracking level or membership status.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In certain embodiments, the gaming system includes more than two pluralities of symbol display areas and more than two pluralities of symbols. Specifically, in certain embodiments, the gaming system includes any suitable number of pluralities of symbols and associated pluralities of symbol display areas. For instance, the gaming system includes a first plurality of symbols and a first plurality of symbol display areas each configured to display one of the first plurality of symbols, a second plurality of symbols and a second plurality of symbol display areas each configured to display one of the second plurality of symbols, a third plurality of symbols and a third plurality of symbol display areas each configured to display one of the third plurality of symbols, and a fourth plurality of symbols and a fourth plurality of symbol display areas each configured to display one of the fourth plurality of symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It should be appreciated that, in various embodiments: (a) the multiplay game may be associated with, and the gaming system may display, any suitable quantity of sets of reels (and associated sets of symbol display areas) in any suitable configuration or arrangement; (b) the multiplay game may be associated with, and the gaming system may display, any suitable quantity of paylines; (c) each of the displayed paylines may be associated with any suitable quantity of the symbol display areas and any suitable combination of the symbol display areas; (d) the gaming system may use any other suitable manner of award determination other than a payline evaluation, such as a ways to win and/or a scatter pay award determination (as described below): (e) the gaming system may employ suitable paytable including any suitable quantity of winning symbol combinations; (f) the gaming system may use any suitable combination of the symbols as a winning symbol combination; (g) the winning symbol combinations may be associated with any suitable credit payouts; (h) the gaining system may utilize any suitable quantity of paytables; and (i) the gaming system may employ any suitable symbols including, for example, any suitable markings or indicia such as letters, numbers, or illustrations or pictures of objects.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It should be appreciated that the present disclosure contemplates providing such a game in a multiplayer or community gaming format in which the gaming system includes a plurality of EGMs each playable by a different player. In one example, two players participate in a free spin bonus game. The first player's EGM is configured to generate and display a first symbol (such as the left half of a key) during the free spin bonus game, and the second player's EGM is configured to generate and display a second symbol (such as the right half of a key) during the free spin bonus game. The first symbol and the second symbol have a designated relationship with one another. If the first player's EGM generates and displays the first symbol during the free spin bonus, the gaming system displays the first symbol on a community display, and if the second player's EGM generates and displays the second symbol during the free spin bonus, the gaming system displays the second symbol on the community display. If the first symbol and the second symbol are simultaneously displayed on the community display, the gaming system: (a) forms a resultant symbol (such as a key symbol), increases a total quantity of collected resultant symbols (such as by one), and removes the displayed resultant symbol. If at least a designated quantity of resultant symbols are collected during the free spin bonus game, the gaming system provides an award (such as a quantity of credits, a progressive award, additional free spins, entrance into another bonus game, or any other suitable award) to the first player and the second player.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In a more general example, a designated percentage of EGMs in a bank (such as half of the EGMs in a bank) are configured to generate and display the first symbol and the remaining EGMs are configured to generate and display the second symbol. If the players of all of the EGMs participate in the free spins bonus game, several resultant symbols may be collected on a given free spin. In another example, the EGM(s) of the player(s) who triggered the free spin bonus are configured to generate and display the first symbol and the remaining EGMs are configured to generate and display the second symbol.</p>

It should be appreciated that one, more, or each of the functions of the central server, central controller, or remote host may be performed by the at least one processor of the EGM. It should be further appreciated that one, more, or each of the functions of the at least one processor of the EGM may be performed by the at least one processor of the central server, central controller; or remote host.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In certain such embodiments, computerized instructions for controlling any games (such as any primary or base games and/or any secondary or bonus games) displayed by the EGM are executed by the central server, central controller, or remote host. In such &#x201c;thin client&#x201d; embodiments, the central server, central controller, or remote host remotely controls any games (or other suitable interfaces) displayed by the EGM, and the EGM is utilized to display such games (or suitable interfaces) and to receive one or more inputs or commands. In other such embodiments, computerized instructions for controlling any games displayed by the EGM are communicated from the central server, central controller, or remote host to the EGM and are stored in at least one memory device of the EGM. In such &#x201c;thick client&#x201d; embodiments, the at least one processor of the EGM executes the computerized instructions to control any games (or other suitable interfaces) displayed by the EGM.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In various embodiments in which the gaming system includes a plurality of EGMs, one or more of the EGMs are thin client EGMs and one or more of the EGMs are thick client EGMs. In other embodiments in which the gaming system includes one or more EGMs, certain functions of one or more of the EGMs are implemented in a thin client environment, and certain other functions of one or more of the EGMs are implemented in a thick client environment. In one such embodiment in which the gaming system includes an EGM and a central server, central controller, or remote host, computerized instructions for controlling any primary or base games displayed by the EGM are communicated from the central server, central controller, or remote host to the EGM in a thick client configuration, and computerized instructions for controlling any secondary or bonus games or other functions displayed by the EGM are executed by the central server, central controller, or remote host in a thin client configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In certain embodiments in which the gaming system includes: (a) an EGM configured to communicate with a central server, central controller, or remote host through a data network; and/or (b) a plurality of EGMs configured to communicate with one another through a data network, the data network is a local area network (LAN) in which the EGMs are located substantially proximate to one another and/or the central server, central controller, or remote host. In one example, the EGMs and the central server, central controller, or remote host are located in a gaming establishment or a portion of a gaming establishment.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In other embodiments in which the gaming system includes: (a) an EGM configured to communicate with a central server, central controller, or remote host through a data network; and/or (b) a plurality of EGMs configured to communicate with one another through a data network, the data network is a wide area network (WAN) in which one or more of the EGMs are not necessarily located substantially proximate to another one of the EGMs and/or the central server, central controller, or remote host. For example, one or more of the EGMs are located: (a) in an area of a gaming establishment different from an area of the gaming establishment in which the central server, central controller, or remote host is located; or (b) in a gaming establishment different from the gaming establishment in which the central server, central controller, or remote host is located. In another example, the central server, central controller, or remote host is not located within a gaming establishment in which the EGMs are located. It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments in which the data network is a WAN, the gaming system includes a central server, central controller, or remote host and an EGM each located in a different gaming establishment in a same geographic area, such as a same city or a same state. It should be appreciated that gaming systems in which the data network is a WAN are substantially identical to gaming systems in which the data network is a LAN, though the quantity of EGMs in such gaming systems may vary relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In further embodiments in which the gaming system includes: (a) an EGM configured to communicate with a central server, central controller, or remote host through a data network; and/or (b) a plurality of EGMs configured to communicate with one another through a data network, the data network is an internet or an intranet. In certain such embodiments, an internet browser of the EGM is usable to access an internet game page from any location where an internet connection is available. In one such embodiment, after the internet game page is accessed, the central server, central controller, or remote host identifies a player prior to enabling that player to place any wagers on any plays of any wagering games. In one example, the central server, central controller, or remote host identifies the player by requiring a player account of the player to be logged into via an input of a unique username and password combination assigned to the player. It should be appreciated, however, that the central server, central controller, or remote host may identify the player in any other suitable manner, such as by validating a player tracking identification number associated with the player; by reading a player tracking card or other smart card inserted into a card reader (as described below); by validating a unique player identification number associated with the player by the central server, central controller, or remote host; or by identifying the EGM, such as by identifying the MAC address or the IP address of the internet facilitator. In various embodiments, once the central server, central controller, or remote host identifies the player, the central server, central controller, or remote host enables placement of one or more wagers on one or more plays of one or more primary or base games and/or one or more secondary or bonus games, and displays those plays via the internet browser of the EGM.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It should be appreciated that the central server, central controller, or remote host and the EGM are configured to connect to the data network or remote communications link in any suitable manner. In various embodiments, such a connection is accomplished via: a conventional phone line or other data transmission line, a digital subscriber line (DSL), a T-1 line, a coaxial cable, a fiber optic cable, a wireless or wired routing device, a mobile communications network connection (such as a cellular network or mobile internet network), or any other suitable medium.

In certain embodiments, one or more of the reels are independent reels or unisymbol reels. In such embodiments, each independent reel generates and displays one symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In various embodiments, one or more of the paylines is horizontal, vertical, circular, diagonal, angled, or any suitable combination thereof. In other embodiments, each of one or more of the paylines is associated with a plurality of adjacent symbol display areas on a requisite number of adjacent reels. In one such embodiment, one or more paylines are formed between at least two symbol display areas that are adjacent to each other by either sharing a common side or sharing a common corner (i.e., such paylines are connected paylines). The gaming system enables a wager to be placed on one or more of such paylines to activate such paylines. In other embodiments in which one or more paylines are formed between at least two adjacent symbol display areas, the gaming system enables a wager to be placed on a plurality of symbol display areas, which activates those symbol display areas.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In various embodiments, the gaming system provides one or more awards after a spin of the reels when specified types and/or configurations of the indicia or symbols on the reels occur on an active payline or otherwise occur in a winning pattern, occur on the requisite number of adjacent reels, and/or occur in a scatter pay arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In certain embodiments, the gaming system employs a ways to win award determination. In these embodiments, any outcome to be provided is determined based on a number of associated symbols that are generated in active symbol display areas on the requisite number of adjacent reels (i.e., not on paylines passing through any displayed winning symbol combinations). If a winning symbol combination is generated on the reels, one award for that occurrence of the generated winning symbol combination is provided. At least U.S. Pat. No. 8,012,011 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008/0108408 and 2008/0132320 describe various examples of ways to win award determinations.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In various embodiments, the gaming system includes a progressive award. Typically, a progressive award includes an initial amount and an additional amount funded through a portion of each wager placed to initiate a play of a primary game. When one or more triggering events occurs, the gaming system provides at least a portion of the progressive award. After the gaming system provides the progressive award, an amount of the progressive award is reset to the initial amount and a portion of each subsequent wager is allocated to the next progressive award. At least U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,766,079; 7,585,223; 7,651,392; 7,666,093; 7,780,523; and 7,905,778 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008/0020846, 2009/0123364, 2009/0123363, and 2010/0227677 describe various examples of different progressive gaming systems.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As generally noted above, in addition to providing winning credits or other awards for one or more plays of the primary game(s), in various embodiments the gaming system provides credits or other awards for one or more plays of one or more secondary games. The secondary game typically enables a prize or payout in to be obtained addition to any prize or payout obtained through play of the primary game(s). The secondary game(s) typically produces a higher level of player excitement than the primary game(s) because the secondary game(s) provides a greater expectation of winning than the primary game(s) and is accompanied with more attractive or unusual features than the primary game(s). It should be appreciated that the secondary game(s) may be any type of suitable game, either similar to or completely different from the primary game.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In various embodiments, the gaming system automatically provides or initiates the secondary game upon the occurrence of a triggering event or the satisfaction of a qualifying condition. In other embodiments, the gaming system initiates the secondary game upon the occurrence of the triggering event or the satisfaction of the qualifying condition and upon receipt of an initiation input. In certain embodiments, the triggering event or qualifying condition is a selected outcome in the primary game(s) or a particular arrangement of one or more indicia on a display device for a play of the primary game(s), such as a &#x201c;BONUS&#x201d; symbol appearing on three adjacent reels along a payline following a spin of the reels for a play of the primary game. In other embodiments, the triggering event or qualifying condition occurs based on a certain amount of game play (such as number of games, number of credits, amount of time) being exceeded, or based on a specified number of points being earned during game play. It should be appreciated that any suitable triggering event or qualifying condition or any suitable combination of a plurality of different triggering events or qualifying conditions may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In other embodiments, at least one processor of the gaming system randomly determines when to provide one or more plays of one or more secondary games. In one such embodiment, no apparent reason is provided for the providing of the secondary game. In this embodiment, qualifying for a secondary game is not triggered by the occurrence of an event in any primary game or based specifically on any of the plays of any primary game. That is, qualification is provided without any explanation or, alternatively, with a simple explanation. In another such embodiment, the gaming system determines qualification for a secondary game at least partially based on a game triggered or symbol triggered event, such as at least partially based on play of a primary game.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In various embodiments, after qualification for a secondary game has been determined, the secondary game participation may be enhanced through continued play on the primary game. Thus, in certain embodiments, for each secondary game qualifying event, such as a secondary game symbol, that is obtained, a given number of secondary game wagering points or credits is accumulated in a &#x201c;secondary game meter&#x201d; configured to accrue the secondary game wagering credits or entries toward eventual participation in the secondary game. In one such embodiment, the occurrence of multiple such secondary game qualifying events in the primary game results in an arithmetic or exponential increase in the number of secondary game wagering credits awarded. In another such embodiment, any extra secondary game wagering credits may be redeemed during the secondary game to extend play of the secondary game.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In certain embodiments, no separate entry fee or buy-in for the secondary game is required. That is, entry into the secondary game cannot be purchased; rather, in these embodiments entry must be won or earned through play of the primary game, thereby encouraging play of the primary game. In other embodiments, qualification for the secondary game is accomplished through a simple &#x201c;buy-in.&#x201d; For example, qualification through other specified activities is unsuccessful, payment of a fee or placement of an additional wager &#x201c;buys-in&#x201d; to the secondary game. In certain embodiments, a separate side wager must be placed on the secondary game or a wager of a designated amount must be placed on the primary game to enable qualification for the secondary game. In these embodiments, the secondary game triggering event must occur and the side wager (or designated primary game wager amount) must have been placed for the secondary game to trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In various embodiments in which the gaming system includes a plurality of EGMs, the EGMs are configured to communicate with one another to provide a group gaming environment. In certain such embodiments, the EGMs enable players of those EGMs to work in conjunction with one another, such as by enabling the players to play together as a team or group, to win one or more awards. In other such embodiments, the EGMs enable players of those EGMs to compete against one another for one or more awards. In one such embodiment, the EGMs enable the players of those EGMs to participate in one or more gaming tournaments for one or more awards. At least U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2007/0123341, 2008/0070680, 2008/0176650, and 2009/0124363 describe various examples of different group gaming systems.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In various embodiments, the gaming system includes one or more player tracking systems. Such player tracking systems enable operators of the gaming system (such as casinos or other gaming establishments) to recognize the value of customer loyalty by identifying frequent customers and rewarding them for their patronage. Such a player tracking system is configured to track a player's gaming activity. In one such embodiment, the player tracking system does so through the use of player tracking cards. In this embodiment, a player is issued a player identification card that has an encoded player identification number that uniquely identifies the player. When the player's playing tracking card is inserted into a card reader of the gaming system to begin a gaming session, the card reader reads the player identification number off the player tracking card to identify the player. The gaming system timely tracks any suitable information or data relating to the identified player's gaming session. The gaming system also timely tracks when the player tracking card is removed to conclude play for that gaming session. In another embodiment, rather than requiring insertion of a player tracking card into the card reader, the gaming system utilizes one or more portable devices, such as a cell phone, a radio frequency identification tag, or any other suitable wireless device, to track when a gaming session begins and ends. In another embodiment, the gaming system utilizes any suitable biometric technology or ticket technology to track when a gaming session begins and ends.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In such embodiments, during one or more gaming sessions, the gaming system tracks any suitable information or data, such as any amounts wagered, average wager amounts, and/or the time at which these wagers are placed. In different embodiments, for one or more players, the player tracking system includes the player's account number, the player's card number, the player's first name, the player's surname, the player's preferred name, the player's player tracking ranking, any promotion status associated with the player's player tracking card, the player's address, the player's birthday, the player's anniversary, the player's recent gaming sessions, or any other suitable data. In various embodiments, such tracked information and/or any suitable feature associated with the player tracking system is displayed on a player tracking display. In various embodiments, such tracked information and/or any suitable feature associated with the player tracking system is displayed via one or more service windows that are displayed on the central display device and/or the upper display device. At least U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,722,985; 6,908,387; 7,311,605; 7,611,411; 7,617,151; and 8,057,298 describe various examples of player tracking systems.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the present embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present subject matter and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.</p>
