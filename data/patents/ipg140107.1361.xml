<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/110,059, filed Apr. 20, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,550,519, which claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/564,024, filed on Apr. 21, 2004, whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to an actinically or thermally curable ink and methods for making colored contact lenses, in particular to colored silicone hydrogel contact lenses.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For cosmetic purposes, contact lenses having one or more colorants dispersed in the lens or printed on the lens are in high demand. These colored contact lenses enhance the natural beauty of the eye, or provide unique patterns on the iris of the wearer, or provide non cosmetic patterns or marks, such as rotation marks, inversion marks, product/brand codes, lot numbers, &#x201c;DEMO&#x201d; lenses, and the like, which are of benefits to wearers, eye-care practitioners and manufacturers. Various methods have been disclosed to make printing inks suitable for printing either hydrophilic (hydrogel) contact lenses or the molds that are then used to make hydrogel contact lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 4,668,240 to Loshaek discloses colored contact lenses produced with a lens polymer that contains one or more of the functional groups &#x2014;COOH, &#x2014;OH, or &#x2014;NH&#x2014;R, wherein R is hydrogen or C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>8 </sub>alkyl. At least a portion of the surface of the lens is coated with a color coat comprising at least one pigment, binder polymer having the same functional groups, and an additional compound having at least two groups per molecule selected from at least one of &#x2014;NCO and epoxy. The Loshaek patent discloses also that the lens polymer may contain one or more of the functional groups &#x2014;NCO or epoxy whereas the binder polymer may contain one or more of the functional groups &#x2014;COOH, &#x2014;OH, or &#x2014;NH&#x2014;R. The lens and binding polymers are then bound to each other by the reaction of the groups &#x2014;COOH, &#x2014;OH, or &#x2014;NH&#x2014;R in the lens or the binder polymer and binding polymers with the groups &#x2014;NCO or epoxy in the binder polymer or the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,857,072 to Narducy, et al. discloses a method for making colored hydrophilic contact lenses. At least a portion of the surface of the lens is coated with a color coat comprising at least one pigment, binding polymer having functional groups, and an additional compound having at least two groups per molecule of &#x2014;NCO. The coated lens is then subjected to conditions that cause the color coat to adhere to the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,010 to Quinn discloses a method for preparation of colored contact lenses similar to that of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,668,240 and 4,857,072 except that an isocyanate compound is not required. Instead, adhesion promoters such as hexamethoxymethylmelamine are used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Patent Application publication No. 2003/0054109 to Quinn, et al. discloses a method for making colored hydrophilic contact lenses. At least a portion of a surface of a lens is coated with a color coat comprising at least one colorant, and a binder polymer having latent crosslinkable pendent groups (e.g., epoxy, hydroxy, alkenyl, isocyanate, peroxy, perester, anhydride, silane, and combinations thereof). The lens is then subjected to conditions that cause the color coat to adhere to the lens. In such method, inks are substantially free of a separate adhesion promoter species such as hexamethylene diisocyanate or hexamethoxymethylmelamine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the methods known in the art have several disadvantages. First, inks described in the prior art are for non-silicone hydrogel lenses and would be undesirable for use with silicone hydrogels. In recent years, silicone hydrogel contact lenses, for example, Focus NIGHT &#x26; DAY&#x2122; (CIBA VISION), become more and more popular because of corneal health benefits provided by their high oxygen permeability and comfort. Inks described in the prior art have properties (e.g., surface energy, oxygen permeability, water content, expansion characteristics, etc.) which may not be compatible with silicone hydrogel lenses, since they are designed for conventional (non-silicone) hydrogels and not for silicone hydrogel lenses. They may have adverse effects to the properties of silicone-hydrogel lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Second, inks described in the prior art may have issues of instability because of reactive functional groups present in adhesion promoter, activators (activating agent or agents), and binder polymers in the inks. Premature reactions may occur between the reactive functional groups, having a negative impact on print quality, ink pot life, and lens adhesion ability of the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Third, inks described in the prior art may need to have an additional agent or a reactive coating to be added during the manufacturing process to promote adhesion of the color coat to a lens. This has all the disadvantages associated with adding an additional ingredient to a manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Fourth, inks described in the prior art may not provide a manufacturer flexibility for curing (gelling) inks or promoting lens adhesion of a color coat. For example, thermal curing is often performed after printing an ink on one of the molding surfaces of a plastic (e.g., polypropylene) disposable mold. Thermally curing of an ink on a plastic disposable mold prior to lens fabrication might distort the mold and result in a lens of unacceptable quality. In addition, thermal curing of an ink might result in thermal oxidative processes involving polypropylene mold surfaces. As such, thermal curing may negatively affect on cure kinetics and lens quality.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, there exist needs for methods of making colored silicone hydrogel contact lenses, and for inks suitable for printing a high-quality color image on a silicone hydrogel contact lens.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention address at least one or more deficiencies of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one aspect, the present invention provides an ink for making colored contact lenses, in particular, colored silicone hydrogel contact lenses. The ink of the invention comprises at least one colorant, a solvent and a binder polymer including ethylenically unsaturated groups and segments derived from at least one silicone-containing vinylic monomer or macromer, wherein the ink is characterized by having capability to be cured actinically or thermally to form a colored coat on a contact lens, wherein the colored coat has good adhesion to the contact lens without being covalently attached to the lens material of the contact lens.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for making a colored silicone hydrogel contact lens, comprising the steps of: (a) providing a contact lens constructed of a silicone hydrogel; (b) applying a color coat to at least a portion of a surface of the lens with an ink comprising at least one colorant and a photo-curable or thermo-curable binder polymer which comprises ethylenically unsaturated groups and segments derived from at least one silicone-containing vinylic monomer or macromer; and (c) curing the ink, thereby causing the color coat to adhere to the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further aspect, the present invention comprises a method for making a colored silicone hydrogel contact lens, comprising the steps of: (a) applying a color coat to at least a portion of at least one of molding surfaces of a lens mold with an ink comprising at least one colorant and a photo-curable or thermo-curable binder polymer which comprises ethylenically unsaturated groups and segments derived from at least one silicone-containing vinylic monomer or macromer, wherein the mold has a lens-forming cavity between the molding surfaces, wherein the colored coat contains a first surface exposed to the interior of the lens-forming cavity and a second surface in contact with the molding surface; (b) dispensing a lens-forming material into the lens-forming cavity of the mold while maintaining substantially the color coat in position; (c) curing the lens-forming material within the lens-forming cavity to form the contact lens, whereby the colored coat detaches from the molding surface and becomes integral with the body of the contact lens.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In still a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a colored contact lens with an image embedded therein. This method comprises the steps of: (a) applying a color coat to at least a portion of at least one of molding surfaces of a lens mold with an ink comprising at least one colorant and a photo-curable or thermo-curable binder polymer, wherein the mold has a lens-forming cavity between the molding surfaces; (b) thermally or actinically curing the colored coat to form a colored film which is not covalently attached to any molding surfaces; (c) dispensing a lens-forming material into the lens-forming cavity of the mold; (d) letting the lens-forming material to soak the colored film for a period of time sufficient so that a portion of the lens-forming material penetrates into space between the colored film and the molding surface while detaching the colored film from the molding surface; (c) curing the lens-forming material within the lens-forming cavity to form the contact lens, whereby the colored film is embedded within the body of the contact lens between the anterior and posterior surfaces of the colored contact lens.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference now will be made in detail to the embodiments of the invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment, can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations as common within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. Other objects, features and aspects of the present invention are disclosed in or are obvious from the following detailed description. It is to be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present discussion is a description of exemplary embodiments only, and is not intended as limiting the broader aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Generally, the nomenclature used herein and the laboratory procedures are well known and commonly employed in the art. Conventional methods are used for these procedures, such as those provided in the art and various general references. Where a term is provided in the singular, the inventors also contemplate the plural of that term. The nomenclature used herein and the laboratory procedures described below are those well known and commonly employed in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">&#x201c;Contact Lens&#x201d; refers to a structure that can be placed on or within a wearer's eye. A contact lens can correct, improve, or alter a user's eyesight, but that need not be the case. A contact lens can be of any appropriate material known in the art or later developed, and can be a soft lens, a hard lens, or a hybrid lens. A contact lens can be in a dry state or a wet state. &#x201c;Dry State&#x201d; refers to a soft lens in a state prior to hydration or the state of a hard lens under storage or use conditions. &#x201c;Wet State&#x201d; refers to a soft lens in a hydrated state.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The &#x201c;front or anterior surface&#x201d; of a contact lens, as used herein, refers to the surface of the lens that faces away from the eye during wear. The anterior surface, which is typically substantially convex, may also be referred to as the front curve of the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The &#x201c;rear or posterior surface&#x201d; of a contact lens, as used herein, refers to the surface of the lens that faces towards the eye during wear. The rear surface, which is typically substantially concave, may also be referred to as the base curve of the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A &#x201c;colored contact lens&#x201d; refers to a contact lens (hard or soft) having a color image printed thereon. A color image can be a cosmetic pattern, for example, iris-like patterns, Wild Eye&#x2122; patterns, made-to-order (MTO) patterns, and the like; an inversion mark that allows a user to handle and insert easily a contact lens; or contact lenses stock keeping units (SKUs), for example, either in forms of numbers or as bar codes. A color image can be a single color image or a multi-color image. A color image is preferably a digital image, but it can also be an analog image.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A colored contact lens can be produced by printing a high-quality color image directly on a contact lens using methods and systems of the invention. A contact lens can be clear before it is printed upon. Alternatively, a contact lens can be tinted prior to being printed upon. That is, a colorant may have been added to that lens using methods that are well known in the art before that lens is printed upon using a printing method of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">&#x201c;Colorant&#x201d; means either a dye or a pigment or a mixture thereof that is used to print a color image on an article.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">&#x201c;Dye&#x201d; means a substance that is soluble in a solvent and that is used to impart color. Dyes are typically translucent and absorb but do not scatter light. Dyes can cover both optical regions of contact lenses and non-optical regions of contact lenses. Nearly any dye can be used in the present invention, so long as it can be used in an apparatus as described below. These dyes include fluorescent dyes, phosphorescent dyes, and conventional dyes.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A &#x201c;pearlescent pigment&#x201d; refers to a class of interference (effect) pigments, which are transparent thin platelets of low refractive index material (e.g., transparent mica platelets) coated with optically thin coating of a high refractive index material (e.g., metal oxide, such as, for example titanium oxide or iron oxide), and which impart color mainly based on the optical principle of thin-film interference. The optically thin coating of metal oxide can be comprised of single or multiple thin layers of metal oxide. Optically thin coatings applied to the platelets contribute interference effects, which allow the appearance to vary depending upon illumination and viewing conditions. The color is determined by the coating thickness, the refractive index and the angle of illumination. Optically thin coatings are also responsible for the rich deep glossy effect due to partial reflection from and partial transmission through the mica platelets. This class of pigment can provide pearly luster and iridescent effects.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one aspect, the present invention provides an ink for making colored contact lenses, in particular, colored silicone hydrogel contact lenses. The ink of the invention comprises at least one colorant, a solvent and a photo-curable or thermo-curable binder polymer including ethylenically unsaturated groups and segments derived from at least one silicone-containing vinylic monomer or macromer.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ink of the invention is actinically or thermally curable to form a colored coat on a contact lens or a molding surface of a mold.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The ink of the present invention also has good adhesion to a contact lens, preferably to a silicone hydrogel contact lens. As used herein, &#x201c;good adhesion to a contact lens or a silicon hydrogel contact lens&#x201d; in reference to a colored coat or an ink means that the colored coat (with a color image) generated on the lens with the ink can pass at least a finger rubbing test, preferably pass the finger rubbing test and a sonication-in-methanol (or other suitable solvent, e.g., such as isopropanol) surviving test.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The finger rubbing test is performed by removing the hydrated contact lens from a packaging solution, e.g., saline, and digitally rubbing the lens between either two fingers or a finger and a palm for up to about 10 seconds. Visible and microscopic (&#x2dc;10&#xd7;) observation of colorant bleeding, smearing, or delamination indicates failure of the rub test.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The sonication-in-methanol (or other suitable solvent, e.g., such as isopropanol) test is performed as follows. A colored contact lens is immersed in 5 ml of, for example, methanol or isopropanol or a suitable solvent, sonicated for about 1 minute and then placed in a vial containing borate buffered saline (BBS). After about 10 seconds, the saline is drained and about 5 ml of fresh BBS is added. After equilibrating for about 5 minutes in the BBS, the lens is inspected for signs of adhesion failure (e.g., colorant bleeding, smearing, or delamination).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Without limiting this invention to any particular mechanism or theory, it is believed that the ink binders of the invention can form interpenetrating networks (IPN's) with the lens material of a silicone hydrogel lens. Adhesion of an ink of the invention to the lens by IPN formation does not require the presence of reactive functional groups in the lens polymer. A color image can be printed directly with an ink of the invention on a preformed silicone hydrogel contact lens to produce a colored contact lens. The printed ink is allowed to penetrate at least partially into the lens material of a contact lens and then cured (cross-linked). The curing can be activated by UV radiation or heat. The binder polymer in the ink is crosslinked in the presence of the lens material of the silicone hydrogel to form IPNs.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Alternatively, a color image can be printed first with an ink of the invention on a mold for making a contact lens and the printed ink is cured to form a colored film. Then, a lens-forming material is dispensed in the mold. The lens-forming material is allowed to penetrate into the cured ink and then be cured to form a colored contact lens onto which the color image is transferred from the mold. The lens material (polymer or polymers) of the colored contact lens is crosslinked in the presence of a polymer (i.e., crosslinked binder polymer in the ink). Preferably, after the step of dispensing the lens-forming material in the mold having the colored film and before the step of curing the lens-forming material in the printed mold, the colored film on the mold is soaked with the lens-forming material for a period of time long enough so that a portion of the lens-forming material penetrates into space between the colored film and the molding surface while detaching the colored film from the molding surface. And then, the lens-forming material in the mold is cured to form a colored contact lens with the colored film embedded in the body of the lens between the anterior and posterior surface of the lens. This will result in a smoother surface and greater comfort as compared to a lens in which the print is directly on the lens surface.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Factors which might influence print quality and adhesion of ink to lenses include but are not limited to molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, composition of the binder polymer, lens composition, solvent type and content in both the lens and the ink. Solvents that swell the lens material are expected to enhance penetration of the binder polymer into the lens. Furthermore, the quantity and particle size characteristics of pigment in inks can also effect print quality and adhesion. It is understood that the printed ink and the lens-forming material can be cured simultaneously in the mold. Inks and lens-forming materials that are amenable to rapid cure are most favorable for such processes (simultaneous curing) since rapid cure kinetics will minimize swearing or loss of ink patterns. Process conditions and the type of printing process employed is also expected to influence print quality and possibly adhesion of ink to a lens. In the case of pad printing, factors such as printing speed, type of rubber in print pads, durometer of print pads, type of clich&#xe9; (e.g. metal, ceramic, plastic) and type of ink cup (e.g. open or closed) are all expected to have some influence on print quality.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, adhesion between lenses and ink could occur by mechanisms other than IPNs. Where lens materials contain certain types of functionality, direct linkage (bond formation) between binder polymer and lens polymer is possible. For example, lens polymer that contains UV-curable groups (vinyl functionality) would enhance direct linkage of photo-curable ink binder to the lens polymer. Nucleophilic addition reactions would also provide another mode of linking ink binder to lenses. For example, lenses that contain nucleophilic groups (e.g. R&#x2014;SH) could undergoe Michael addition reactions with pendant methacrylate groups in binder polymer. Alternatively binder polymer containing nucleophilic groups (e.g. RSH, NHR*<sub>2</sub>, R=Alkyl, R*=H, Alkyl) could undergo Michael addition reactions with lens polymer that contains groups such as acrylate or methacrylate. Such reactions would bond the ink to the lens. Furthermore, binder polymer containing nucleophilic groups could undergo reactions with lens polymer that contains electrophilic groups such as epoxy, anhydride, alkyl halide and isocyanate. Alternatively one could bind ink to lenses by having electrophilic groups in the ink binder polymer and nucleophilic groups in the lens polymer. Curable inks could also be made be incorporating both nucleophilic and electrophilic functionality into to binder polymer. For example, one could prepare a curable silicone hydrogel ink binder by copolymerizing DMA with TRIS, glycidlymethacrylate, monomethacrylated polydimethylsiloxane and 2-(dimethylamino)ethylacrylate. Under appropriate conditions, the dimethylamino functional groups will react with epoxy functionality in the resulting binder polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a preferred embodiment, the ink of the present invention has a good transferability from a mold to a contact lens. A &#x201c;good transferability from a mold to a contact lens&#x201d; in reference to an ink means that a color image printed on a molding surface of a mold with the ink can be transferred completely onto a contact lens cured in that mold. The ink will also have good transferability from a clich&#xe9; to a print pad and from a print pad to a lens mold or lens. The composition of the ink, solvent type, binder composition, molecular weight of binder polymer, molecular weight distribution of binder polymer, print pad (type of rubber and printing speed), and the nature of the lens and lens mold surfaces will have an impact on print quality. For example, in processes where printing speed is relatively slow and an inked clich&#xe9; is exposed to air for relatively long cycle time it will be desirable to have inks in solvents with relatively high boiling points. The high boiling point solvents will minimize premature drying of inks in clich&#xe9;s.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The ink of the present invention typically comprises a solvent, a colorant, and a photo-curable or thermo-curable binder polymer including ethylenically unsaturated groups and segments derived from at least one silicone-containing vinylic monomer or macromer.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A solvent can be water, an organic or inorganic solvent, a mixture of several organic solvents, or a mixture of water and one or more water soluble or water miscible organic solvents. Any known suitable solvents can be used, so long as they can dissolve the binder in the ink of the invention and aid in the stability of the colorant. Exemplary solvents include, without limitation, water, acetone, alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, 2-ethyoxyethanol, etc.), glycols, ketones, esters, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl formamide, acetophenone, methylene dichloride, dimethyl sulfoxide, gamma-butyrolactone, ethylene dichloride, isophorone, o-dichlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, diacetone alcohol, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, 2-nitropropane, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene carbonate, cyclohexanol, chloroform, trichloroethylene, 1,4-dioxane, ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, chlorobenzene, nitroethane, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, butyl acetate, 1-butanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, nitromethane, toluene, ethanol, diethylene glycol, benzene, diethyl ether, ethanolamine, carbon tetrachloride, propylene glycol, hexane, ethylene glycol, and formamide.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A colorant can be a dye, or preferably a pigment. In general, dyes may not provide a highly opaque print that pigment can provide. Preferably, a colorant in an ink of the invention comprises at least one pigment. A colorant also may be a mixture of two or more pigments, which in combination provides a desired color, since any color can be obtained by merely mixing two or more primary colors together, As defined herein, &#x201c;primary colors&#x201d; mean cyan, yellow, magenta, white, and black. A colorant may also be a mixture of at least one pigment and at least one dye. A person skill in the art will know how to select colorants.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Non-Pearlescent Pigment(s) are preferably about 5 microns or smaller in size. Larger particles of a pigment can be ground into smaller particles.

Exemplary preferred methods of reducing a pigment's particle size include high speed mixers, Kady Mills (rotor stator dispersion device), colloid mills, homogenizers, microfluidizers, sonalators, ultrasonic mills, roll mills, ball mills, roller mills, vibrating ball mills, attritors, sand mills, varikinetic dispensers, three-roll mills, Banbury mixers, or other methods well known to those of skill in the art. In the case of pearlescent pigments it is important during processing to minimize platelet breakage and maintain a sufficient level of dispersion. Pearlescent pigments require gentle handling during mixing and they should not be ground, or subjected to prolonged mixing, milling or high shear since such operations can damage the pigments. Particle size distribution, shape and orientation strongly influence final appearance. Milling, high shear mixing or prolonged processing of pearlescent pigments should be avoided since such operations might lead to delamination of metal oxide coated layer, fragmentation of platelets, platelet agglomeration and platelet compaction. Delamination of metal oxide, compaction, fragmentation and agglomeration will reduce pearlescent effects.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Schemes 1-7 illustrate two stage processes for preparing preferred photo-curable or thermo-curable binder polymer of the invention. In the first stage, a copolymerization reaction is initiated by heat in a polymerizable composition which includes a solvent (e.g, ethylacetate), a thermal initiator (e.g., AIBN), a chain transfer agent (e.g., mercaptoethanol), a hydrophilic vinylic monomer devoid of functional groups (e.g. DMA), a vinylic monomer having at least one functional groups (e.g. HEMA, MAA, or glycidylmethacrylate), an alkoxysilane monomer (e.g. TRIS), and monomethacrylated polydimethylsiloxane. It is understood that the copolymerization can be initiated with either heat or UV light. In the second stage of the process, the silicone-containing polymer is converted to a photo-curable or thermo-curable binder polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The ink of the invention can further comprise polymerizable components such as DMA, TRIS, and PDMS-MA (monomethacryloxypropyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane) in order to enhance its compatibility with silicone hydrogels.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The ink of the invention can also be cured with the aide of a thermal initiator or preferably a photoinitiator. Any suitable photoinitiators can be used in the ink formulations. Examples of photoinitiators include but are not limited to Irgacure 2959, Irgacure 907, Irgacure 500, Irgacure 651, Irgacure 369, Daracure 1173, and Daracure 4265. In addition, combinations of initiators can be used. Pigments in ink formulations can block or reduce the amount of UV light that reaches photo-curable groups in ink formulations thereby reducing cure speed. Photo-initiators that have a broad UV absorption spectrum can be used to help alleviate such problems. For example Irgacure 907 and Irgacure 369 have strong UV absorption in longer UV regions and are effective in curing dark inks. Irgacure and Darcure initiators are available from CIBA specialty chemicals. Additional initiators include VAZO-52, VAZO-64, VAZO-67, and VAZO 88. Photosensitizers can also be added to an ink to facilitate photocuring of the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The kinetics of ink curing can be tuned by varying the amount and type of ethylenically unsaturated groups in the binder polymer. For example, increasing the amount of methacrylate groups in the binder polymer will decrease the time required for an ink to gel under a given set of cure conditions. The reactivity of a binder polymer with a given amount of ethylenically unsaturated groups can be increased by using acrylate groups rather than methacrylate groups.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">By changing the amount of ethylenically unsaturated groups in a binder polymer, one can also control the modulus of a cured ink (i.e., a colored coat or film) on a silicone hydrogel contact lens. For example, decreasing the amount of ethylenically unsaturated groups in a binder polymer will allow the ink modulus to be lowered. This feature will allow some degree of control over effects of a cured ink upon the modulus of a colored silicon hydrogel contact lens. Other properties of the ink can be tuned by adjusting the ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components in the binder polymer formulation. Such adjustments allow for a better property match between the ink and lens, for example, such as swelling characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The ink of the invention can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of surfactant, humectant, antimicrobial agents, antioxidant agents, anti-coagulating agents, and other additives known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an ink of the invention comprises: a solvent in an amount of from about 10% and 99% by weight, preferably from about 20% and 95% by weight, more preferably from about 30% and 80% by weight; a photocurable or thermocurable binder polymer in an amount of from about 1% to about 90% by weight, preferably from about 10% to about 80% by weight, more preferably from about 25% to about 75% by weight; a colorant in an amount of from about 0.0 to about 25% by weight, preferably from about 0.05% to about 20% by weight, more preferably from about 0.1% to 15% by weight; and a polymerization initiator in an amount of from about 0 to about 5% by weight, preferably from about 0.02% to about 2.5% by weight, more preferably from about 0.05% to 2.0% by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Although the inks disclosed here are designed for use with silicone hydrogel lenses, they could be used with non-silicone hydrogels of appropriate composition (e.g. low water content formulations).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Inks of the invention have several unique features. First, they are photo-curable or thermal curable (thermo-curable). Such feature can provide manufacturer flexibility in designing a manufacturing process of colored silicone hydrogel contact lenses. Second, curing kinetics of inks can be controllable by varying photo-initiator structure, the amount of ethylenically unsaturated groups in a binder polymer and the type of ethylenically unsaturated groups (e.g. methacrylate cures slower than acrylate) in the binder polymer. Third, inks of the invention can be used to make lenses with multiple prints, because a printed ink can be photocured at a relatively fast rate and no significant down-time would occur between two prints. Inks used to produce lenses with multiple prints can be cured simultaneously or separately as needed. Fourth, inks of the invention would not have a significantly adverse effects upon the oxygen permeability of a colored silicone hydrogel contact lens.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">This invention is also directed to methods for making colored silicone hydrogel contact lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for making a colored silicone hydrogel contact lens, comprising the steps of: (a) providing a contact lens constructed of a silicone hydrogel; (b) applying a color coat to at least a portion of a surface of the lens with an ink comprising at least one colorant and a photo-curable or thermo-curable binder polymer which comprises ethylenically unsaturated groups and segments derived from at least one silicone-containing vinylic monomer or macromer; and (c) curing the ink, thereby causing the color coat to adhere to the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In a further aspect, the present invention comprises a method for making a colored silicone hydrogel contact lens, comprising the steps of: (a) applying a color coat to at least a portion of at least one of molding surfaces of a lens mold with an ink comprising at least one colorant and a photo-curable or thermo-curable binder polymer which comprises ethylenically unsaturated groups and segments derived from at least one silicone-containing vinylic monomer or macromer, wherein the mold has a lens-forming cavity between the molding surfaces, wherein the colored coat contains a first surface exposed to the interior of the lens-forming cavity and a second surface in contact with the molding surface; (b) dispensing a lens-forming material into the lens-forming cavity of the mold while maintaining substantially the color coat in position; (c) curing the lens-forming material within the lens-forming cavity to form the contact lens, whereby the colored coat detaches from the molding surface and becomes integral with the body of the colored contact lens.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Where an ink is applied first to a molding surface of a mold to form a colored coat on the molding surface, the ink can be cured prior to dispensing of a lens-forming material into the printed mold. Alternatively, the ink can be cured simultaneously with the lens-forming material in the lens-forming cavity of the printed mold to form the colored contact lens. In the case of printing molds, the ink on the printed mold would be transferred to the lens after the lens-forming material is cured in the printed mold.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">An ink can be applied to a contact lens or a molding surface of a mold according to any printing technologies, such as, for example, pad transfer printing (or pad printing), or inkjet printing. It is understood that other types of printing technologies could also be used to print lenses and or molds.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In pad-transfer printing, a color image is placed or printed on a pad transfer device and the image on the pad transfer device is transferred to another surface, such as a polymer or lens (U.S. Pat. No. 3,536,386 to Spivack; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,582,402 and 4,704,017 to Knapp; U.S. Pat. No. 5,034,166 to Rawlings et al., herein incorporated by reference in their entireties). A typical example of this printing follows. An image is etched into metal to form a clich&#xe9;. The clich&#xe9; is placed in a printer. Once in the printer, the clich&#xe9; is inked by either an open inkwell doctoring system or by a closed ink cup sliding across the image. Then, a silicone pad picks up the inked image from the clich&#xe9; and transfers the image to the contact lens. The silicone pads are made of a material comprising silicone that can vary in elasticity. The properties of the silicone material permit the inks to stick to the pad temporarily and fully release from the pad when it contacts a contact lens or a mold. Appropriate pad-transfer printing structures include, but are not limited to, Tampo-type printing structures (Tampo vario 90/130), rubber stamps, thimbles, doctor's blade, direct printing, or transfer printing as they are known in the art. Inks for pad printing operations will preferably have one or more of the following characteristics: viscosity lower than about 50,000 cps, preferably lower than about 5000 cps and most preferably below 1500 cps, particle size less than about 5 &#x3bc;m (for non-pearlescent pigment), surface tension from about 20 mN/m to about 60 mN/m; prolonged stability (i.e., stable for about 4 hours, preferably at least 8 hours, more preferably 24 hours, even more preferably at least 7 days, most preferably at least three weeks); an appropriate color level (visible by eye); good adhesion to medical devices; and good transfer from a mold to a medical device made in the mold. The physical stability of an ink could differ from its chemical stability. For example, pigments might settle from the ink (physical phenomenon) yet the ink may not have undergone any significant chemical reaction. For such situations the ink can be restored to a useable state by simply stirring or remixing. Other means of slowing or eliminating settling of pigment include but are not limited to use of additives, altering pH, in-line mixing, refrigeration, altering particle size of pigments, and coating pigment of pigment particles.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">It should be understood that the inks and binder polymers of the invention can be used not only in pad printing operations but also in ink jet printing operations. However, formulation adjustment would need for ink jet printing operations. For ink jet applications, the ink of the invention has one or more of the following characteristics: a viscosity lower than about 50 centipoise (cps), preferably lower than about 15 cps; most preferably below 15 cps; a surface tension of from about 20 mN/m to about 60 mN/m; a particle size of less than about 5 &#x3bc;m; prolonged stability (i.e., stable for at about 4 hours, preferably at least 8 hours, more preferably at least 24 hours, even more preferably at least 7 days, most preferably at least three weeks); an appropriate color level (visible by eye); uniform drop formation (i.e., no &#x201c;coffee stain&#x201d; or &#x201c;donut&#x201d; effects); jet stability (i.e., ease of formation of individual drops); good adhesion to medical devices; good transfer from a mold to a medical device made in the mold; and stability of ink in inkjet nozzles (minimal drying or crusting effects).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">&#x201c;Coffee stain appearance&#x201d; or &#x201c;coffee stain effect&#x201d;, as used herein, means that a color dot on a contact lens or a mold has a peripheral edge having a dark color and the interior area having light color.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">&#x201c;Donut appearance&#x201d; or &#x201c;donut effect&#x201d;, as used herein, means that a color dot on a contact lens or a mold has a light-colored or colorless central zone surrounded by a dark-colored annular zone.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In still a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a colored contact lens with an image embedded therein. This method comprises the steps of: (a) applying a color coat to at least a portion of at least one of molding surfaces of a lens mold with an ink comprising at least one colorant and a photo-curable or thermo-curable binder polymer, wherein the mold has a lens-forming cavity between the molding surfaces; (b) thermally or actinically curing the colored coat to form a colored film which is not covalently attached to any molding surfaces; (c) dispensing a lens-forming material into the lens-forming cavity of the mold; (d) letting the lens-forming material to soak the colored film for a period of time sufficient so that a portion of the lens-forming material penetrates into space between the colored film and the molding surface while detaching the colored film from the molding surface; (c) curing the lens-forming material within the lens-forming cavity to form the contact lens, whereby the colored film is embedded within the body of the contact lens between the anterior and posterior surfaces of the colored contact lens.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The colored film is soaked with the lens-forming material preferably for at least 5 minutes, more preferably for at least 10 minutes and even more preferably for at least 20 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In this aspect of the invention, any ink suitable for making colored contact lenses as long as it can be cured chemically, thermally or actinically (e.g., UV radiation) to form a colored film on the mold. An ink can comprise at least one colorant, a binder polymer, an adhesion promoter, and optionally a diluent. Preferably, the ink is an ink of the invention described above.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In accordance with this aspect of the invention, a binder polymer comprises latent crosslinkable groups selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl group &#x2014;OH, amino group &#x2014;NHR (wherein R is hydrogen or C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>8 </sub>alkyl), carboxylic group &#x2014;COOH, epoxy group, amide group &#x2014;CONHR, isocyanate group, peroxy group, perester group, anhydride group, alkoxysilane group, silanol group, acetoxysilane group, silane group, halosilane group, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Alkoxysilanes, acetoxysilanes, silanes, or halosilanes form silanols upon exposure to moisture, namely under moisture-activated crosslinking (curing). The silanols react with each other to form siloxane bonds. Therefore, binder polymer chains containing pendant silanol groups (or precursors) can combine to form crosslinks through the formation of siloxane linkages. Being moisture activated, the crosslinks would form during hydration of the polymer. The preferred latent crosslinkable pendant groups are halosilane and alkoxysilane, with alkoxysilane being the most preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Halosilanes can form siloxane bonds by being exposed to alkoxy silane, metal oxides (e.g., calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, copper oxide, etc.) and alcohol+carboxylic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Alkoxysilanes can combine with each other to form siloxane bonds. Crosslinking and curing of silicones is well known (see W. Noll, Chemistry and Technology of Silicones, Academic Press, Inc., London).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In addition, alkoxysilanes also form siloxane bonds when exposed to silanols, acetoxysilanes, carboxylic acids, and acids such as HCl. Hydrolytic and non-hydrolytic reactions in which siloxane bonds are formed could be used to introduce crosslinks into the color coating once it is applied to the lens. When water is applied to the lens during the hydration step, crosslinking reactions are initiated, thereby causing the color coat to adhere to the lens.</p>
