<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit of European patent application EP 10 400035.1 filed on Aug. 2, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a fuselage structure made of composite material, particularly aircraft doors of composite material and especially it relates to passenger doors of an aircraft with the features of the preamble of claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">(2) Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">During a flight at cruising altitude an air excess pressure of 0.6 bar inside a fuselage of an aircraft relative to the surrounding is provided on behalf of the comfort of the passengers. The excess pressure inside the fuselage is withheld by a skin formed of panels attached to an inner frame structure such as beam elements of the fuselage. The excess pressure on the skin of the fuselage exerts a severing effect of the skin from the inner frame structure of the fuselage. Aircraft doors as part of the fuselage are exposed to the same severing effects. Aircraft doors have to be highly reliable with respect to pressure resistance (typ. 10 pwr-9/flighthour). In case of an emergency landing aircraft doors have to open highly reliable (typ. 10 pwr-7/flighthour).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is known to mount aircraft doors of composite material by riveting the panels to the beam elements of the frame structure of such an aircraft door. The rivets carry out and distribute the loads generated by internal pressure and deformations due to flight loads. Such rivets increase the manufacturing cost and the combination &#x201c;rivets-composites&#x201d; increase maintenance issues.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide for highly reliable fuselage structure made of composite material with low weight and low production costs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention is solved with a fuselage structure made of composite material with the features of claim <b>1</b>. Preferred embodiments of the invention are presented in the subclaims.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the invention a fuselage structure made of composite material, particularly a passenger door of an aircraft is provided with at least one panel and an inner frame structure mounted to each other. The panel is formed of at least one layer or preferably at least one group of layers of composite material. The inner frame structure is provided with at least one beam with at least at one of its respective ends a flange suitable for adhesive engagement with the at least one panel. At least one group of layers of composite material of the panel is in form locking engagement with this flange of the beam. The invention allows highly reliable aircraft doors of composite material with low weight and low production costs by transferring loads from inner excess pressure by means of form lock supplemental to adhesive mounting between panels of the skin and inner structural elements such as beams or frames of a fuselage. Expensive and heavy rivets can be avoided according to the inventive concept. All kinds of fiber reinforced plastics as well as additional adhesive layers (e.g. film adhesives) may be applied for bonding the respective layers in addition to form lock. A one-shot technology in e. g. Resin Transfer Molding could be chosen for optimized low weight and low production costs of the inventive aircraft door.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention at least one group of layers of composite material of the panel and the flange of the beam are overlapping each other for the form locking engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention at least one end of the at least one beam is T-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention at least one group of layers of composite material of the panel is interrupted for the form locking engagement with the flange of the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention at least one panel is provided with two groups of layers of composite material or with an extra group of layers inside of the two groups of layers of composite material with the inner layers of composite material of the panel being interrupted for the interlocking engagement with the flange of the beam. The extra inner group of layers of composite material inside the two groups of layers of composite material of the panel may preferably be used for reinforcement of the connections between the panel and the beams of the inner frame structure and in order to prevent peeling effects.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention the at least one panel is provided with sandwich elements apart from the areas of contact between the at least one panel and the at least one beam. The sandwich elements extend along sections of the panels to reinforce the panels.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention the at least one beam is provided with respective even outer surfaces and an even inner surface mounted to the outside of the outer composite layers being interrupted with a cut-out to provide overlapping parts for form lock with the even inner surface of the flange. The flange is provided at its even outer surface with additional composite layers to maintain stability and stiffness of the outer skin assembly.</p>
