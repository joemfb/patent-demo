<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to communications systems, and in particular to providing interoperability and enhanced functionality for network applications in a communications environment.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are a multitude of different network applications that provide various services for mobile communications subscribers, including voice, data, text messaging, push-to-talk (PTT), along with many other types of services. These network applications are usually designed independently of each other and often by different entities, so they commonly use their own protocols and proprietary data formats. Because of the resulting incompatibilities, these different network applications rarely interoperate. And if they do, it is only in very limited ways. Presently, different network applications rarely interoperate unless they are specifically programmed to do so or unless there is a specific apparatus designed to allow each of the network applications to communicate in a language the other understands.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The problem also exists with network applications that provide similar services but for different service providers or on different platforms (such as CDMA or GSM). For example, one network application may implement a PTT service for one service provider while another network application implements a different PTT service for a different service provider. Because these PTT applications use different protocols and different data formats (e.g., different codecs), there is no way for them to communicate. Hence, users of one PTT service cannot communicate with users of the other PTT service.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To solve the problem of incompatibility between network applications, communications service providers have developed specialized gateways that convert between the protocols of two network applications. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of a gateway <b>110</b> that allows a network application running on one application server <b>120</b>-A to interoperate with a network application running on another application server <b>120</b>-B via their respective networks <b>140</b>-A and <b>140</b>-B. The gateway <b>110</b> receives information from a first application server <b>120</b>-A in a first protocol used by that network application, and the gateway <b>110</b> then converts that information into a second protocol used by the second network application on the application server <b>120</b>-B. The gateway <b>110</b> also provides the reverse conversion for communications from application server <b>120</b>-B to application server <b>120</b>-A. In this way, the gateway <b>110</b> emulates each network application on behalf of the other, thereby allowing the two network applications to interoperate. Clients <b>130</b>-A using one network application may thus communicate with clients <b>130</b>-B using a second network application, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">But this gateway approach is not very scalable, since a new gateway must be designed for each pair of network applications to interoperate. For example, if a third network application were added to the network system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there would have to be two new gateways specially designed&#x2014;one for interoperability between the new network application and each of the existing network applications. This problem grows as network applications are added. In the general case, if there are N network applications in a system, the next (N+1)<sup>th </sup>network application would require N new gateways for interoperability with each of the existing N network applications. Accordingly, as each new network application is introduced, the number of new gateways that must be added increases, thereby increasing the complexity and cost of each new network application. Scalability thus presents a significant obstacle in the quest for interoperability among network applications in a communications environment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem of the existing communication architecture is that introducing new applications often requires modification of the network application itself, so enhancing functionality of the network applications is difficult. Typically, the application data and other content used to provide services by each network application are encoded in the application's own special format. To provide an enhanced service that uses the network application data, the provider would have to know the format and protocols used by the network application to extract the application data for any useful purpose. And even if these were known, a special enhancement application would have to be added and customized for each network application that is to have the functionality enhancement, which again presents a scalability problem similar to the one described above.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, what is needed is an architecture for communications networks that exposes the data and content used by particular network applications so that the data and content are available for other uses, such as for use by other network applications and/or for providing functionality enhancements.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Rather than emulate each network application, as in the gateway approach, embodiments of the invention allow interoperability among multiple network applications by abstracting the protocols and data formats used by the network applications into an interoperability framework. The interoperability framework modularizes the components needed for interoperation and abstracts data and content from the underlying protocols and data formats used by the network applications. By exposing the data and content used by the network applications, the interoperability framework enables various network applications to share the data so that it can be used by the other applications. This allows the network applications to interoperate, and it also allows the functionalities of particular network applications to be enhanced without requiring the network applications themselves to be modified.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the interoperability domain includes a resource control engine that controls which features of the services can interoperate and resolves any resource contention issues based on contextual information. Various interoperability adapters extract the content or data used by the corresponding network application, tag the data, and provide the data to the interoperability domain via the resource control. When receiving information from a network application, the resource control directs the shared data into a shared resources repository (which may be implemented, e.g., as a shared memory or a direction to a path to where the data can be found). In this way, metadata used by each network application are stored in the interoperability domain may, where the resource control handles the sharing of the shared resources among the network applications as needed for interoperability.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The interoperability adapters may also receive data from the interoperability domain, where the data are intended for a network application or client with which the adapters are associated. Accordingly, the adapters convert the data into an appropriate format and pass the data according to the desired routing. For example, when the interoperability adapters receive information from the shared resources, they may bind the data into a data stream for that network application in the protocol used by the network application. In this way, the interoperability adapters allow communication in either direction between the protocol used by the particular network application and the common format of the interoperability domain.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition to interoperability, embodiments of the invention allow for functional enhancements to be added to the network applications without needing to change the network applications themselves. This can be done, for example, by generating new functional modules that act upon the data in the shared resources used by a particular network application. In this aspect of such an embodiment, the interoperability enabled by the system is between an existing network application and a new functional module, rather than between multiple network applications.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, access to the shared resources and routing of the data are controlled based on context information, which may describe the state of the network, the services, the network application, the client, or any other aspects of the system.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Overview of Interoperability Domain</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an arrangement for enabling interoperation among multiple network applications. In the system shown, one or more network applications may reside on an application server <b>120</b>. Different application servers (e.g., <b>120</b>-A and <b>120</b>-B) may be operated by the same or by different service providers to provide different network applications for their subscribers, and the various network applications may be configured for use with the same or with different platforms (e.g., cellular phones, personal computers, or any other devices capable of electronic communication). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, application server <b>120</b>-A provides a first network application for clients <b>130</b>-A, and application server <b>120</b>-B provides a second network application for clients <b>130</b>-B.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Network applications may comprise code, logic, and combinations thereof, and they may reside on one or more systems in a communications network infrastructure. A network application performs communications functionalities that implement a service on a communications network. Examples of network applications include voice applications (e.g., cellular, VoIP, PTT, and other voice services), messaging applications (such as email, SMS, MMS, IM, voicemail, and other asynchronous communication services), and Web service applications (e.g., weather, mapping, and other information retrieval services).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The network applications may be accessed by a subscriber using a client <b>130</b> in communication with an associated application server <b>120</b> via a communications network <b>140</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the connections are shown as being through interoperability adapters <b>200</b>; however, the clients <b>130</b> may be able to communicate with each other in peer-to-peer fashion or with the application server <b>120</b> via a network <b>140</b>. A client <b>130</b> may comprise hardware and/or software elements that reside in a communication device and can be used to execute a specific function or set of functions. Used together, the client <b>130</b> and application server <b>120</b> may provide a network service to a subscriber, such as voice calling, push-to-talk (PTT) messaging, text and multimedia messaging, and many other types of services offered in a communications environment.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a typical communication device on which a client <b>130</b> resides, use of the device's capabilities enables the user to take advantage of various services, such as voice calling, messaging, and data services. Network applications typically implement communications services, which are typically products that a user subscribed to and is charged for use thereof, often by metering the user's access to the services. A service may be implemented by a collection of functions, applications, and/or other services that can be called and executed in any order. Usually accessed through a user interface, the behavior of a service typically depends on the user input and possibly other events.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Although one set of clients <b>130</b>-A are shown accessing one application server <b>120</b>-A while another set of clients <b>130</b>-B are accessing another application server <b>120</b>-B, any of the clients may have access to either or both of the application servers <b>130</b>-A and <b>130</b>-B so that their subscribers may enjoy the network application associated therewith. For example, the application servers <b>120</b>-A and <b>120</b>-B may provide different communications services for the same set of subscribers (e.g., voice and text messaging for a particular service provider), or they may provide similar or different services for different sets of subscribers (e.g., competing IM services for different service providers).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments of the invention include one or more interoperability adapters <b>200</b> for each network application. Although the interoperability adapters <b>200</b> are shown as a single functional block, they may be implemented in any combination of modules or as a single module running on the same system. The interoperability adapters <b>200</b> may physically reside on any hardware in the network, and since they may be provided as distinct functional modules, they may reside on different pieces of hardware. If in portions, some or all of the interoperability adapters <b>200</b> may be embedded with hardware, such as on a client device in the form of embedded software or firmware within a mobile communications handset. In addition, other interoperability adapters <b>200</b> may be implemented in software running on general purpose computing and/or network devices, such as a software program running on the application server <b>120</b>. Accordingly, any or all of the interoperability adapters <b>200</b> may be implemented with software, firmware, or hardware modules, depending on the design of the communication network. Moreover, there need not be a one-to-one relationship between network applications and the interoperability adapters <b>200</b>. A set of interoperability adapters <b>200</b> may be associated with multiple network applications just as multiple adapters <b>200</b> may be provided for a single network application.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">On a functional level, the interoperability adapters <b>200</b> associated with a particular network application enable the communication of data between the network application and an interoperability domain. With a particular network application, the data and content are encoded in an application-specific protocol and/or provided in other application-specific data formats. For example, data about a subscriber's presence may be contained as a bit sequence in a header of a particular data packet, while media content such as a voice signal may be encoded using a particular audio codec. To abstract this data into the interoperability domain and thereby expose it for use with other applications, the interoperability adapters <b>200</b> extract the data, tag the data with any relevant information about the data, and provide the data to the shared resources <b>210</b> in the interoperability domain. The data provided to the shared resources <b>210</b> may comprise content used by the network application (such as a file attachment to an email) and/or metadata about the content (such as a destination address for the email). The shared resources <b>210</b> may be stored in a data repository that includes a shared memory, or the shared resources <b>210</b> can be implemented by establishing a path to where the shared resources <b>210</b> can be found.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the interoperability adapters <b>200</b> are designed to support the full capabilities of their associated network applications to extract as much data as possible therefrom. The interoperability adapters <b>200</b> may therefore be designed not in view of existing needs, but with a view towards to additional data that might be required for interoperation with potential future network applications and enhancements. As a result, the interoperability adapters <b>200</b> may adapt to changing system configurations so that they need not be redesigned as new functionalities and network applications emerge. In addition to keeping the system up to date, this facilitates the development of enhanced functionalities by third parties, which may desire to use data from a particular network application not originally envisioned by the developers of the interoperability adapters <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Access to the shared resources <b>210</b> via the interoperability domain may be provided to one or more other network applications. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example, network application B may use data extracted from network application A and stored in the shared resources <b>210</b>. This allows the two network applications to interoperate in some functional way without needing to know the particular data formats used by the other. Accordingly, the interoperability adapters <b>200</b> associated with network application B are able to repackage or otherwise bind data in the general format from the interoperability domain into a data stream usable by the network application B. Functionally, this is the converse of the extraction process described above for exposing a network application's data for use by others. Access to and routing of the data may be based on control modules in the interoperability domain, which may apply contextual rules <b>215</b>. Various embodiments of the adapters and the functional control modules that can be used to implement an interoperability domain are described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Network Implementation of Interoperability System</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a system that enables an interoperability domain for two or more network applications. As described above, the interoperability system is provided in a communications environment in which subscribers may access services using a client <b>130</b> running on, for example, a communications device. A subscriber may access a network application provided by application server <b>120</b>-A using client <b>130</b>-A, while the same or a different subscriber may access another network application provided by application server <b>120</b>-B using client <b>130</b>-B. These network applications may involve communication between multiple clients <b>130</b> over networks <b>140</b>-A and/or <b>140</b>-B (e.g., text messaging), or the network applications may involve communication between a single client <b>130</b> and the associated application server <b>120</b> (e.g., a mapping application).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the interoperability adapters <b>200</b> described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are implemented by a plurality of adapters, which include a client application adapter <b>230</b>, a network application adapter <b>235</b>, a network context adapter <b>240</b>, an application adapter <b>250</b>, and a resource adapter <b>260</b>. In combination, these perform the data extraction and tagging and the data binding functionalities described above for the interoperability adapters <b>200</b>; however, they are divided into multiple distinct adapters in this implementation. Dividing the functionalities among a number of adapters allows the functions to be performed in different physical locations, which may be more efficient to reduce the bandwidth needed to transmit data over the communication networks <b>140</b>. For example, extracting metadata at the application server <b>120</b> may require less bandwidth to transmit back to the interoperability domain than if the entire data stream were transmitted to the interoperability domain for extraction there. Also, the adapters may need to reside on different devices to obtain context information therefrom. For example, a client application adapter <b>230</b> may obtain information about the status of a handset device on which the client application adapter <b>230</b> is running.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Since the adapters are used to extract data from and bind data into the data format used by a particular network application, a set of adapters may be provided for each of the network applications for which interoperability is desired. However, any or all of the adapters <b>200</b> may be commonly associated with multiple network applications, thereby servicing multiple applications. As described above, the adapters may reside physically on different computing devices in the communications network.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the client application adapter <b>230</b> is a software service agent designed for each particular client <b>130</b>. The client application adapter <b>230</b> is configured to integrate content from the network application and the interoperability domain into a format that is optimized for the client application <b>130</b>. The client application adapter <b>230</b> identifies application data (e.g., messaging or content) that is generated or received by client applications and is needed for interoperability or interaction with other applications or systems. The client adapter <b>230</b> then forwards the data and metadata as appropriate. For example, the client application adapter <b>230</b> forwards incoming data and metadata to the client <b>130</b> and forwards outgoing data and metadata towards the interoperability domain. In this way, the client application adapter <b>230</b> provides a link from the client application <b>130</b> to the network application and interoperability domain functions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When forwarding data to the interoperability domain, the client application adapter <b>230</b> may create a label (i.e., metadata) identifying the client application from which the data was extracted and the type of data being routed to the interoperability domain. The data is then tagged with this generated label, and both are forwarded to the interoperability domain to be stored in the shared resources <b>210</b>. The client adapter <b>230</b> may also be configured to monitor the client <b>130</b> and forward any pertinent events or other contextual information to the interoperability domain. This client context information may be used for various purposes, as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The client application adapter <b>230</b> may be co-resident with its associated client application <b>130</b>, or it may reside in the communication path of the client application <b>130</b>. In one embodiment, the client application adapter <b>230</b> is integrated as part of the client application <b>130</b>. The client application <b>130</b> may be the client component of a client-server application, or it may be one peer application in a peer-to-peer application.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the network application adapter <b>235</b> resides on the application server <b>120</b> and is configured to communicate with the network application running thereon. The network application adapter <b>235</b> is configured to identify certain application data that should be routed to the interoperability domain (e.g., application messaging or content, and metadata associated therewith). The network application adapter <b>235</b> is also configured to delivers messages and other content from the interoperability domain to the appropriate network application and in the appropriate format for that network application. The application adapter <b>250</b> thus works in conjunction with the other adapters to provide a link between the interoperability domain and the network and client applications.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The network application associated with the network application adapter <b>235</b> may be the server component of a client-server application or a component application of the overall application that resides in the network (e.g., a network directory that is a separate component of a communication application).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the application adapter <b>250</b> is a software service agent that is configured to capture any data from the network application (such as application messaging or content) to be routed to the interoperability framework for sharing with other network applications. When forwarding data to the interoperability domain, the application adapter <b>250</b> may create a label (i.e., metadata) identifying the network application from which the data was extracted and the type of data being routed to the interoperability domain. The data is then tagged with this generated label, and both are forwarded to the interoperability domain to be stored in the shared resources <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Various mechanisms are possible for capturing the data from the network application. In one embodiment, the network application subscribes to the interoperability domain and therefore can be configured to forward certain data to the application adapter <b>250</b> without direct intervention or request from the application adapter <b>250</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the application adapter <b>250</b> is configured to intercept messages sent to and from the network application via the network <b>140</b>. The application adapter <b>250</b> may then apply an algorithm to capture any data that is desired to send to the interoperability domain. In another embodiment, the application adapter <b>250</b> may be implemented as embedded program code that cooperates with the network application on the application server <b>120</b> and explicitly identifies messages and other data that should be sent to the interoperability domain. Once the desired data is obtained by the application adapter <b>250</b>, it is converted into a general format that can be understood by the interoperability domain.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Another function of the application adapter <b>250</b> is to deliver shared data from the interoperability domain to the network application. In this direction of data flow, the application adapter <b>250</b> binds the data into a format usable by the network application, possibly using any available metadata about the content and any relevant context information. The application adapter <b>250</b> may also be configured to monitor the network <b>140</b> and/or the network application and forward pertinent events and other contextual information to the interoperability domain.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The application adapter <b>250</b> may reside physically as software on the application server <b>120</b>, the client devices used by each subscriber, and/or any other computing device in communication with these elements. Because the application adapter <b>250</b> may be designed by third parties that developed the associated network application, the network adapter <b>250</b> can be made relatively simple. A simple design eases development and is possible where the adapter <b>250</b> is merely configured to filter, tag, and forward certain application data.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the interoperability system also includes an application adapter control <b>255</b>, coupled to the application adapter <b>250</b>, for managing the mappings between the network application (including the client <b>130</b> and the application server <b>120</b>) and the resource control <b>220</b> of the interoperability domain. In this way, the application adapter control <b>255</b> identifies the appropriate routing of data destined for the interoperability domain, and it routes data from the interoperability domain to the appropriate system for use with a network application.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The application adapter control <b>255</b> is configured to cause the data to and from the interoperability domain to be routed according to the mappings that it manages. This routing is between resources in the network application domain and the shared resources <b>210</b> in the interoperability domain. The routing may be influenced by metadata associated with the data being routed. For example, the application adapter control <b>255</b> may use the metadata itself to adjust the routing, or it may use contextual information (e.g., provided by an external context engine) to assist in making routing decisions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, the application adapter control <b>255</b> itself acts as a router for the application adapter <b>250</b>. In another embodiment, the application adapter control <b>255</b> updates the application adapter <b>250</b> with the direct routes according to the mapping. Alternatively, the application adapter control <b>255</b> may update a separate application routing function to maintain the appropriate mapping.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The application adapter control <b>255</b> may also identify which network application functions are to be interoperable. For example, the application adapter control <b>255</b> may maintain a list of the applications, protocols, codecs, and the like supported by a particular network application.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the application adapter control <b>255</b> is a context engine that manages the mappings based on contextual information about elements in the interoperability system. This contextual information may include any information about the system that is available to the application adapter control <b>255</b>. For example, the contextual information may include presence status of subscribers on the network, where the application adapter control <b>255</b> maps data for use with one network application if a subscriber is present (e.g., a voice call application) and to another if the subscriber is not (e.g., to a voicemail application). The application adapter control <b>255</b> may further maintain state and any other session information that may be required for one or more data connections between the network application domain and the interoperability domain.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the interoperability system also includes a network context adapter <b>240</b>. The network context adapter <b>240</b> monitors network conditions that may impact or influence application communications and provides this information to the interoperability domain. For example, depending on whether the client <b>130</b> is connected to the network <b>140</b> via a high-bandwidth connection or a low-bandwidth connection, the interoperability domain may use this information to adjust the bitrate of streaming video from a videoconference. The network context adapter <b>240</b> may monitor the network conditions directly or by inference. The network context adapter <b>240</b> resides in the network <b>140</b> that is being used by the client application, possibly in the communication path of the client applications.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">These adapters at the network application side communicate with the resource adapter <b>260</b> to provide and obtain data from the interoperability domain. The resource adapter <b>260</b>, in one embodiment, is a software service agent that provides an interface between the network applications and the shared resources <b>210</b>. The functions of the resource adapter <b>260</b> may include providing any content or protocol manipulation needed for interoperability. Accordingly, the resource adapter <b>260</b> is configured to extract the shared data from the context of the application adapter <b>250</b>, which may be in a more application-specific form even though accessible, to a more general context used in the interoperability domain. In this way, the resource adapter <b>260</b> and the application adapter <b>250</b> act in conjunction to provide a complete interface between the network application and the interoperability domain.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Various divisions of the responsibilities are possible between the application adapter <b>250</b> and the resource adapter <b>260</b>. As described above, content provided from the application adapter <b>250</b> may be tagged with network application information and or protocols used to encode certain content; however, actual protocol conversions or decoding may not be performed by the application adapter <b>250</b>. Instead, the resource adapter <b>260</b> may use the information in the tags to determine what, if any, decoding or translations are necessary. This division of the functions puts more of the computationally intensive functions on the resource adapter <b>260</b>. As such, it may be favored where the resource adapter <b>260</b> resides on a computing device that has high processing power relative to the devices on the network.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To perform any necessary translation operations, the resource adapter <b>260</b> may use shared computational resources, or it may leverage on native functions that were a part of an existing service. In one embodiment, the resource adapter <b>260</b> is coupled to or includes one or more built-in translators <b>265</b>, which provide translation from a specific protocol or encoding system to one more suitable for sharing within the interoperability domain. For example, the translator <b>265</b> may perform transcoding from a narrowband codec to a generic wideband codec (e.g., from EVRC to G.722.x), or from proprietary protocols into generic protocols (e.g., from iDEN to SIP). This may help to reduce latency delays and degradation of the shared data.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the interoperability domain, the raw content that is to be shared across multiple network applications is stored as shared resources <b>210</b>. The shared resource <b>210</b> may be implemented as one or more logical paths and/or as one or more storage devices for the shared data. In one embodiment, the shared resources <b>210</b> include the common data and metadata that are shared between interoperating network applications and the functional entities that facilitate the interoperability. In some embodiments, content or data from one network application may be immediately transmitted to another network application, so it may not need to be stored with shared resources <b>210</b>. Because the content in the shared resources <b>210</b> has been extracted into the general context of the interoperability domain, the content is independent from the underlying network applications while preferably maintained with as much fidelity as is reasonable.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Any common or persistent information that is not meant to be quickly passed through the interoperation domain system may be stored by the resource control <b>220</b> in a common repository. For example, state or contextual information, or other persistent information, may be maintained in this common repository. In addition, functional elements that manipulate shared content from its original state (e.g., transcoding logic and protocol interworking logic) may be stored in this common repository and then used (e.g., by a resource adapter <b>260</b>) when needed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The resource control <b>220</b> maps and manages the resource adapters <b>260</b> so that incoming and outgoing data and content are mapped to particular directories or &#x201c;pools&#x201d; of shared data in the shared resource <b>210</b>. By allocating the data shared among various network applications, the resource control <b>220</b> can decide which network applications have access to which others' data. In that way, the resource control <b>220</b> determines which network applications can interoperate using the interoperability domain. In one embodiment, the resource control <b>220</b> comprises a context engine that implements the mapping of network applications to the shared resources <b>210</b> according to a set of contextual rules <b>215</b>. The resource control <b>220</b> may maintain a description of the capabilities of the interoperability domain and provides that information to the resource adapters <b>260</b> as needed. Information that the resource control <b>220</b> may maintain for this purpose may include protocols and network applications supported, mechanisms to add new capabilities, and mechanisms to advertise capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, the contextual rules <b>215</b> include the logic and rule sets used to determine how the network applications should interoperate. The contextual rules <b>215</b> may be fixed, or they may vary over time and depend on contextual information acquired from various elements throughout the system, such as contextual information about a network or about a device. The contextual information may be obtain from many different mechanisms, such as being statically configured with fixed rules determined by a system operator or being dynamically generated based on logical inferences that may require human intervention. Using the contextual rules <b>215</b>, the resource control <b>220</b> may dynamically define which features are interoperable and establish control and priority definitions.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">System Operation</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, the interoperability system enables users of communication services that employ different network applications to communicate. An example of the process is provided here with reference to the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Although explained in the context of a data communication from a network application, it can be appreciated that the process can be from a client application and can be destined to another client application or a network application on the same or a different network.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this example, a network application running on application server <b>120</b>-A sends a communication signal to a client <b>130</b>-B or to another network application <b>120</b>-B in a different network domain, where the communication signal includes content needed for interoperability. The network application on application server <b>120</b>-A can send the communication signal explicitly to its associated application adapter <b>250</b>, or the application adapter <b>250</b> can monitor the network <b>140</b>-A for the communication signal. The application adapter <b>250</b> (alone, or in combination with the other interoperability adapters) extracts the data needed for interoperability and labels or tags the data with metadata. This metadata may identify the application, the data itself, and/or any other pertinent information about the network application or its environment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The application adapter control <b>255</b> uses the metadata to route the data and any metadata needed for interoperability to the appropriate resource adapter <b>250</b>. If the interoperability information is destined for a specific client <b>130</b>, the metadata for the client <b>130</b> may also be forwarded. The resource adapter <b>260</b> that receives the data and metadata uses the metadata from the application adapter <b>250</b> to determine any additional interoperability-specific metadata to include based on the application metadata. For example, if content has been transcoded, the metadata may identify the original and transcoded formats. If the data needs to be modified for maximum interoperability, the translator <b>265</b> may be applied for an additional modification.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The resource control <b>220</b> uses the metadata provided from the resource adapter <b>260</b> to create the shared resource <b>210</b> in an optimal form for the content of the data. The resource control <b>220</b> then maps the resource adapters <b>260</b> that are associated with the source and the destination to the shared resource <b>210</b>. The resources control <b>220</b> may also ensure optimal use of any translator resources. With the appropriate mapping between the source and destination resource adapters <b>260</b>, the data and metadata can be communicated through the interoperability domain via the shared resource <b>210</b>, which contains the content of the interoperable data in the generalized context of the interoperability domain.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With this mapping in place, the resource adapter <b>260</b> associated with the destination receives the data from the shared resources <b>210</b>, formats the data into an appropriate form, provides any necessary metadata, and forwards the data and metadata to the destination indicated by the metadata. The application adapter control <b>250</b> associated with the destination may provide destination routing support (e.g., assisting in multiple interoperable sessions destined for same client). The application adapter <b>250</b> that receives the data then binds the data into a signal for use by the native network application, and then forwards that signal to the destination network or client application.</p>
