No. 8,303,629 on Nov. 6, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, and which claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/210,581 filed Mar. 19, 2009.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to devices and methods that permit fixation and stabilization of the bony elements of the skeleton of a patient. The devices permit adjustment and maintenance of the spatial relationship(s) between neighboring bones. Depending on the specifics of the embodiment design, the motion between adjacent skeletal segments may be limited or completely eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Spinal degeneration is an unavoidable consequence of aging and the disability produced by the aging spine has emerged as a major health problem in the industrialized world. Alterations in the anatomical alignment and physiologic motion that normally exists between adjacent spinal vertebrae can cause significant pain, deformity, weakness, and catastrophic neurological dysfunction.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Surgical decompression of the neural tissues and immobilization of the vertebral bones is a common option for the treatment of spinal disease. Currently, vertebral fixation is most frequently accomplished by anchoring bone screws into the pedicle portion of each vertebral body and then connecting the various screw fasteners with an interconnecting rod. Subsequent rigid immobilization of the screw/rod construct produces rigid fixation of the attached bones.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A shortcoming of the traditional rod/screw implant is the large surgical dissection required to provide adequate exposure for instrumentation placement. The size of the dissection site produces unintended damage to the muscle layers and otherwise healthy tissues that surround the diseased spine. A less invasive spinal fixation implant would advantageously minimize the damage produced by the surgical exposure of the spine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In U.S. Pat. No. 7,048,736, Robinson et al teach the use of interspinous process plate to fixate adjacent vertebrae. As disclosed, the device is used to supplement orthopedic implant and for bone graft material placed into the intervertebral disc between the attached vertebra. Thus the device functions to immobilize the vertebrae until bone fusion occurs but, in itself, does not provide a compartment for bone graft placement within the posterior aspect of the spine. Since bone graft material must be placed in order to achieve vertebral fusion, the device must be used in conjunction with bone graft material that is placed at a secondary site of the attached vertebra bones, such as within the disc space, between adjacent transverse processes, and the like. This is a significant disadvantage and prevents use of the Robinson device by itself to both immobilize and fuse the vertebral bones.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The growing experience with spinal fusion has shed light on the long-term consequences of vertebral immobilization. It is now accepted that fusion of a specific spinal level will increase the load on, and the rate of degeneration of, the spinal segments immediately above and below the fused level. As the number of spinal fusion operations have increased, so have the number of patients who require extension of their fusion to the adjacent, degenerating levels. The rigidity of the spinal fixation method has been shown to correlate with the rate of the degenerative progression of the adjacent segments. In specific, implantation of stiffer instrumentation, such as rod/screw implants, produced a more rapid progression of the degeneration disease at the adjacent segment than use of a less stiff fixation implant.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This application discloses several exemplary devices that attach onto the spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae and address the limitation and shortcomings of prior devices and methods. In one embodiment, a device comprises an implant immobilizes the attached vertebrae through a minimally invasive surgical approach while providing a compartment within the implant for the placement of bone graft or bone graft substitute. The bone graft material then fuses the spinous processes and/or lamina portion of bone of the vertebral bone to which the device is attached. In another embodiment, the implant permits movement of the attached bone within a defined range of motion. The device is capable of preventing aberrant anterior and/or posterior spondylolisthesis as well as limiting the extent of flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotation of the attached vertebral. Spinous process fixation provides good segmental immobilization through a minimally invasive surgical approach.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other exemplary embodiments, the implant is anchored to the pedicle portion of at least one vertebral bone to provide superior bone fixation. In another embodiment, a bone anchor is placed through the pedicle of the inferior vertebra, across the disc space above the inferior vertebra, and into the lower boney surface of the upper vertebral bone. The implant employs a fastener that can be placed as free-standing device, or it can then be anchored to or interconnected with a fixation device that is anchored onto at least one spinous process. Further, a fastener may be used in this way through each of the two pedicles that are located on each side of the vertebral midline.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, an implant or orthopedic device is adapted to fixate the spinous processes of vertebral bones. The implant includes at least one bone engagement or abutment member located on each side of a spinous process of a first vertebra and a second vertebra, wherein the abutment members are adapted to forcibly abut the side of each spinous process. The implant has a locking mechanism that is adapted to rigidly immobilize at least a first abutment member on one side of the spinous process with at least a second abutment member on the other side of the spinous process (i.e., across the vertebral midline in the mid-sagittal plane from the first abutment member) using an interconnecting member (such as, for example, a rod, plate, etc) that crosses the vertebral midline. The locking mechanism is capable of reversibly transitioning between a first state, wherein the orientation between at least one abutment member and the interconnecting member is changeable in at least one plane and a second state, wherein the orientation between at least one abutment member and the interconnecting member is rigidly affixed. The implant further includes a compartment within at least one abutment member that is adapted to contain bone graft material, which can be bone graft, bone graft substitute, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an aspect, there is disclosed an orthopedic implant for the fusion of adjacent bony segment. The implant comprises a first member and a second member opposed to the first member, wherein the first and second member define a space therebetween sized to receive a bone. The first and second members have opposed surfaces each surface having at least one spiked protrusion for capturing a bone therebetween. At least one of the members defines an internal compartment adapted to contain a bone graft material, the compartment communicating with at least one bore hole in the at least one member for communicating the bone graft material with the captured bone. The bone graft material in the compartment extends from a first side of the first captured bone to a first side of a second captured bone, wherein the first side of the first and second captured bones are also the sides penetrated by the spike protrusions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, an orthopedic device configured to attach onto a spinous process of a first vertebral bone is disclosed. In one embodiment, the device comprises a first body comprising (i) a bone abutment surface configured to abut an ipsilateral side of the spinous process, and a second surface configured to oppose the bone abutment surface, (ii) a second body comprising a bone abutment surface configured to substantially face the bone abutment surface of the first body, and to abut a contralateral side of the spinous process, and a second surface configured to oppose the bone abutment surface, (iii) an interconnecting member configured to movably couple the first body and the second body, and (iv) a locking feature comprising an unlocked state and a locked state, the locked state configured to limit movement between the interconnecting member and at least one of the first body and the second body. At least one aperture is configured to extend from an opening of the bone abutment surface of the first body to an opening of the second surface of the first body, the aperture being sized to permit bony fusion between the ipsilateral side of the spinous process and a bone forming material positioned within a cavity configured to abut the second surface of the first body. The cavity is configured to permit placement of at least a portion of the bone forming material after attachment of the orthopedic device onto the spinous process of the first vertebral bone.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another aspect, a method for stabilization of a first vertebral bone and a second vertebral bone is disclosed.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to promote an understanding of the principals of the disclosure, reference is made to the drawings and the embodiments illustrated therein. Nevertheless, it will be understood that the drawings are illustrative and no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, Any such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated embodiments, and any such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates perspective and orthogonal views of a pair of vertebral bones. The vertebrae are represented schematically and those skilled in the art will appreciate that actual vertebral bones may contain features that are not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a perspective view of a bone implant system <b>105</b> in an assembled state. The system <b>105</b> includes several components, including at least two body members <b>110</b> and an elongated interconnecting member, such as a rod <b>112</b> or plate, that interconnects the body members <b>110</b> in a spaced relationship with the space between the body members <b>110</b> sized and shaped to receive a portion of a vertebral body, such as a spinous process. (The system <b>105</b> is described herein in the exemplary context of being used with a rod <b>112</b> but it should be appreciated that a plate or other interconnecting member may be used in place of the rod <b>112</b>.)</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Each body member <b>110</b> has a corresponding locking member <b>122</b> that couples to the respective body member <b>110</b> as described below. In addition, each locking member <b>122</b> has a corresponding locking nut <b>123</b> that can be threaded onto the locking member <b>122</b> and used to apply a downward locking force onto the respective member <b>110</b> and the rod <b>112</b> to immobilize the member <b>110</b>, rod <b>112</b>, and locking member <b>122</b> relative to one another, as described more fully below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the system <b>105</b> with the interconnecting rod <b>112</b> detached. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the system <b>105</b> in an exploded state. It should be appreciated that the use of terms herein such as &#x201c;upward&#x201d;, &#x201c;downward&#x201d;, &#x201c;front&#x201d; and &#x201c;back&#x201d; are with reference to the orientation shown in drawings and are not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An exemplary embodiment of the body member <b>110</b> is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows various orthogonal views of the body member <b>110</b> while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> show plan views of the body member <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows the body member <b>110</b> with internal lines and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows the body member <b>110</b> without internal lines. The illustrated embodiment of the system <b>105</b> includes a pair of body members <b>110</b>, each of which is a mirror image of the other.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>A, and <b>6</b>B, each body member <b>110</b> is an elongated body having outer walls that define a cavity that is at least partially enclosed by the outer walls. The body members are sized and shaped to be positioned next to and abut a spinous process of a vertebral body. In particular, each body member <b>110</b> includes a first side wall <b>1102</b>, a second side wall <b>1104</b> opposed to the first side wall, a front wall <b>1106</b> and a back wall <b>1108</b> opposed to the front wall <b>1106</b>. The walls <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b>, and <b>1108</b> define an inner cavity <b>1109</b>. The upper and lower boundaries of the inner cavity <b>1109</b> may be at least partially open, as depicted, or completely closed by additional walls. The cavity <b>1109</b> is adapted to open onto the space outside of member <b>110</b> through at least one aperture of the walls <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b>, and/or <b>1108</b> and/or through the upper and lower boundaries of the cavity <b>109</b>. That is, in an embodiment, the cavity <b>1109</b> is not a completely closed cavity. Thus, the walls <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b>, and/or <b>1108</b> may include one or more holes, apertures, or openings that provide communication between the cavity <b>109</b> and a location outside of the body member <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The cavity <b>1109</b> is adapted to receive and contain a bone graft material (which can be bone graft, bone graft substitute, or a combination thereof) so that, when the system is implanted in the spine, the contained bone graft material can contact at least one vertebral bony surface through the aforementioned aperture of the walls or through the upper lower boundaries of the cavity <b>109</b> that surround cavity <b>1109</b>. The bone graft material may then form a fusion mass with that bony surface.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the side wall <b>1102</b> of each body member <b>110</b> includes a channel <b>11022</b> that is sized and shaped to accept a corresponding locking member <b>122</b>. The other side wall <b>1102</b> also includes a complementary channel <b>11042</b>. The locking member <b>122</b> is sized and shaped so that it can be inserted onto a respective body member <b>110</b> over the channels <b>11022</b> and <b>11042</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>A, and <b>6</b>B, the wall <b>1102</b> includes one or more cut outs or seats <b>11024</b> sized and shaped to accept an instrument that can compress each of the two body members <b>110</b> toward and into the side bony aspect of a vertebral spinous process once the system <b>105</b> is coupled to a vertebral body. The seat <b>11024</b> does not necessarily extend through the full thickness of wall <b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The wall <b>1104</b> of each body member <b>110</b> includes one or more protrusions <b>11044</b> that are adapted to forcibly penetrate and fixate onto a bony surface of a vertebral bone onto which member <b>110</b> is forcibly applied. The protrusions have a shape, such as a pointed shape, that is configured to facilitate penetration into and fixation with the bony surface. One or more full thickness bore holes <b>11046</b> may extend through the wall <b>1104</b> of each body member <b>110</b> so that bone graft material contained in cavity <b>1109</b> can pass through the hole(s) <b>11046</b> and contact at least a portion of the vertebral bony surface that is in contact with the wall <b>1104</b> and thereby form a fusion mass with the vertebral bone.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As mentioned, the upper and lower boundaries of the cavity <b>1109</b> may be at least partially open (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The open upper and lower boundaries provide access to the cavity <b>109</b> to facilitate the placement of the bone graft material into cavity <b>1109</b>. The open upper and lower boundaries may also serve as means through which bone graft material contained in cavity <b>1109</b> may come into contact with the adjacent vertebral bone. Further, in an embodiment, either the upper and/or lower boundaries of the cavity <b>1109</b> may contain a closed portion that encloses the upper or lower boundary. For example, the body member <b>110</b> may include a lower wall <b>11092</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) that entirely or at least partially encloses the lower boundary of the cavity <b>1109</b> so as to limit contact between the graft material contained in cavity <b>1109</b> and structures that are preferably protected from bone graft contact. Such structures may include the dural surface of the spinal nerve column or spinal nerve. The lower wall <b>11092</b> may serve other functions, as discussed more fully bellow.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An exemplary embodiment of a locking member <b>122</b> is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. Each locking member has a pair of opposed, upwardly extending side walls <b>1222</b> that form a space therebetween. The space between the side walls is sized and shaped to complement the shape of the channels <b>11022</b> and <b>11042</b> on the body member <b>110</b>. In this manner, the locking member <b>122</b> can be slid or otherwise coupled onto a corresponding body member <b>110</b> in the region of the channels <b>11022</b> and <b>11042</b>. The region of the locking member <b>122</b> below the side walls <b>1222</b> includes a protrusion <b>1226</b> that is contoured or shaped to form a seat that is sized and shaped to receive the rod <b>112</b>, as described more fully below. The seat has a rounded surface that may complement the shape of the rod <b>112</b> so that the rod <b>112</b> can be firmly seated onto the seat. In addition, the lower region of the side walls <b>1222</b> form ledges that overhang the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The ledges and protrusion <b>1226</b> collectively form a space/seat in which the interconnecting rod can be captured and/or immobilized relative to the locking member <b>1222</b>. The protrusion <b>1226</b> may include one more features adapted to accept a spherical portion of the interconnecting rod. For example, an indentation <b>12262</b> may be positioned on the protrusion for receiving a spherical portion of the interconnecting rod. The indentation may be sized and shaped to receive any of a variety of shaped portions of the rod not limited to a spherical portion.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the interior surface of the side walls <b>1222</b> may have threads <b>1224</b> that threadingly mate with a corresponding locking nut <b>123</b>. This permits the locking nut <b>123</b> to be threaded downward into the space between the side walls <b>1222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The assembled system <b>105</b> is now further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The two body members <b>122</b> are positioned in a spaced apart relationship and coupled to one another via the rod <b>112</b>. That is, the rod <b>112</b> is seated onto the seats formed by the protrusions <b>1226</b> on the lower portion of the locking members <b>122</b>. Each of the locking members <b>122</b> is positioned on a respective body member <b>110</b> such as over the channels <b>11042</b> and <b>11022</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Thus, the locking members <b>122</b> are attached to the body members while the rod <b>112</b> is seated on the locking members <b>122</b> such that a space is defined between the body members <b>110</b> to collectively form the system <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The body members <b>110</b>, locking members <b>122</b>, and rod <b>112</b> can all be locked and immobilized relative to one another using the locking nuts <b>123</b>. In particular, each locking nut is advanced downward into a locking member <b>122</b> such that the locking nut provides a downward force onto the body member <b>110</b>, at least a portion of which is positioned between the locking nut <b>123</b> and rod <b>112</b>. With downward advancement of nut <b>123</b>, a lower or an inferior surface of the locking nut <b>123</b> is moved toward, and forced against, the upper edge(s) of the respective body member <b>110</b>. The upper edge(s) may include each of the first side wall <b>1102</b> and/or the second side wall <b>1104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The locking member <b>122</b> is thus forced upward relative to member <b>110</b> and the interconnecting rod <b>112</b> is forcibly constrained between ledge <b>1226</b> of the locking member <b>122</b> and the surface of the lower wall <b>11092</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B) of the cavity <b>1109</b>. In this way, each of the body members <b>110</b> is immobilized relative to the interconnecting rod.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While rod <b>112</b> is depicted as having a spherical portion <b>1122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, a rod having a spherical end (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>) may be alternatively used. Further, a straight or curvilinear rod without a spherical protrusion, a plate, or an interconnecting member of any applicable geometric configuration may be alternatively used to interconnect the body members <b>110</b>. As can be seen in FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B, the spherical portion of rod <b>112</b> interacts with the indentation <b>12262</b> in the seat of locking member <b>122</b> and also with the lower surface of the wall <b>11092</b> of the member <b>110</b>. This interaction allows the interconnecting rod <b>112</b> to be oriented and fixed in any one of a variety of positions (including non-orthogonal positions) relative to the body member <b>110</b> to which it is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a method of implanting and using the system <b>105</b>. In use, the system is positioned posterior to the spinous processes, SP<b>1</b> and SP<b>2</b>, of the vertebral bones to be immobilized. (Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the system <b>105</b> is positioned above the posterior aspect of the vertebral bones. Thus, the system <b>105</b> is actually shown in a position that is anatomically posterior to the vertebral spinous processes, SP<b>1</b> and SP<b>2</b>.) At this point in the implantation of the system <b>105</b>, each of the locking nuts <b>123</b> is sufficiently loose so that each body member <b>110</b> can move relative to the interconnecting member <b>112</b>. The system <b>105</b> is then moved so that each body member <b>110</b> rests adjacent to a side of each of the spinous processes SP<b>1</b> and SP<b>2</b> of the two vertebral bones to be immobilized. That is, the body members will be positioned on either side of at least one spinous process such that a spinous process is positioned between a pair of body members <b>110</b>. Each body member <b>110</b> is then forced towards (that is, medial) the spinous processes positioned between the body members so that the protrusions <b>11044</b> of each second side wall <b>1104</b> of each body member <b>110</b> is forced into the side of the spinous process that is adjacent to it. In other words, the body members <b>110</b> are forced toward one another and also toward the spinous processes positioned between the body members <b>110</b> such that the protrusions penetrate the sides of the spinous processes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The body members <b>110</b> are forced towards one another by the action of at least one driver instrument (in an embodiment, the driver instrument may be shaped like pliers) that is preferably adapted to interact with and compress each body member <b>110</b> toward one another. The driver instrument may interact with at, at least, one of indentations/cut outs <b>11024</b> of side wall <b>1102</b> of each body member <b>110</b>. While at least one driver instrument maintains compression across the opposing body members <b>110</b> (and maintain a force that pushes the body members <b>110</b> toward one another), each of the locking nuts <b>123</b> is advanced downward toward the body members, as described above. The locking nuts <b>123</b> are advanced until all members (body member <b>110</b>, locking member <b>122</b>, and rod <b>112</b>) of the system <b>105</b> are immobilized relative to one another. The driver instrument(s) is removed and each cavity <b>1109</b> (of the body members <b>110</b>) is packed with bone graft material. Note that the bone graft material is then be placed in contact with the lateral wall of the spinous process, or forced out the lower surface of cavity <b>1109</b> and placed into contact with the posterior aspect of the vertebral lamina (VL), or both. (In the implanted state, the vertebral lamina are situated anatomically anterior to the implant.) The implanted system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">There is now described an additional embodiment wherein a bone screw assembly may be anchored into the pedicle portion of the vertebral bone and used as an additional point of device fixation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> shows an embodiment of an assembled bone screw assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> shows the bone screw assembly in an exploded state. The illustrated screw assembly is for example and those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a large number of bone screws that are presently known, and/or yet to be known, may be alternative used in this application.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, the exemplary embodiment of the bone screw assembly includes a bone screw having a head and a shank. The head of the bone screw can be seated in a receiver assembly of the bone screw assembly. The receiver assembly includes an outer housing and an inner housing that collectively form a seat for the head of the bone screw. The bone screw assembly further includes a locking nut assembly that includes an upper member that is positioned above the head of the bone screw, a washer member and a locking nut. The upper member has a pair of outwardly extending arms that fit between upwardly extending prongs of the inner and outer housings of the housing assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In use, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, at lease one bone screw assembly is placed into a pedicle portion of the vertebral bone. A screw assembly may be placed into the pedicle portion of each of the two pedicles of the lower (i.e., inferior) vertebral bone of the pair of vertebrae to be immobilized. In use, each bone screw may be positioned into the pedicle portion of the vertebral bones using any trajectory that permits proper screw placement. In a preferred embodiment, at least one bone screw is placed into the pedicle portion of the lower vertebral bone through a bone entry point that rests immediately inferior to the inferior articulating process of the upper (i.e., superior) vertebral bone of the pair of vertebrae to be immobilized. In this way, the inferior articulating process of the upper vertebral bone abuts the superior surface of the bone screw and prevents further extension of the upper vertebra relative to the lower vertebra. (Note that a facet joint is anatomically comprised of the articulation between the inferior articulating process (IAP) of an upper (superior) vertebral bone and the superior articulating process (SAP) of a lower (inferior) bone. These definitions of anatomical structures are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They are described in more detail in <i>Atlas of Human Anatomy</i>, by Frank Netter, third edition, Icon Learning Systems, Teterboro, N.J. The text is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.)</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An elongated interconnecting rod is used to interconnect the screw assemblies. A system <b>105</b> is placed with body members <b>110</b> on each side of the spinous process (as described above) and coupled onto the rod as described above. (Alternatively, the interconnecting rod can be implanted with system <b>105</b> assembled and then lowered onto the screw assemblies.) After the placement of all instrumentation, the locking nuts <b>123</b> and the locking nut assembly <b>52</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) of the bone screws assemblies are then locked and all members of the system <b>105</b> and bone screw assembly are immobilized. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> shown an assembled construct. This provides a significant increase in the immobilization power of the system <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another embodiment, multi-level fixation can be performed with serial implantation of multiple systems <b>105</b>. The stepped configuration of each system <b>105</b> permits the placement of more than one system <b>105</b> on a single spinous process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the fixation of three adjacent vertebral bones using two systems <b>105</b>. While the systems <b>105</b> are shown attached to bone screws as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, the systems <b>105</b> may be alternatively used without a bone screw anchor, as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows use of the system <b>105</b> wherein one vertebral bone does not have a spinous process that will permit device fixation. This situation can occur when, for example, the system <b>105</b> is used to immobilize the L<b>5</b> and S<b>1</b> vertebral bones. In that application, the S<b>1</b> spinous process is often too small to accommodate the fixation of a portion of body member <b>110</b>. In an additional embodiment, the situation can also arise when one of the vertebral bones had undergone a prior laminectomy. In either situation, the system <b>105</b> placed such that the body members <b>110</b> are affixed to the spinous process of a first vertebra and the pedicle portion of a second vertebra, wherein the attachment to the pedicles is preferably performed through the use of pedicle bone screws. That is, the system <b>105</b> is attached to pedicle screws via the rod <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">By way of illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows that the lamina and spinous process of the inferior vertebra bone V<b>1</b> have been removed. The lamina <b>207</b> and spinous process <b>209</b> of the upper vertebra V<b>2</b> remains intact. While the protrusions <b>11044</b> of each body member <b>110</b> over the inferior vertebra bone V<b>1</b> are shown as not contacting one another, in actual application the protrusions <b>11044</b> from each body member <b>110</b> over the removed lamina may abut at least a portion of the wall <b>1104</b> of the other member <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> show an additional embodiment of the system <b>105</b> that may be used with a bone screw. In this embodiment, the bone screw <b>214</b> transverse the pedicle portion of a first vertebral bone, crosses the disc space between the first and second vertebral bones and enters the inferior surface of the second vertebral bone. While the bone screw is shown being detached from the system <b>105</b>, it may be alternatively comprised of a bone screw assembly that can fixate onto the interconnecting rod (similar to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, a bone screw is used to cross the disc space and fixate the two vertebral bones. This fixation compliments the posterior fixation provided by the system <b>105</b> and thus provides fixation of the two vertebral bones that is both anterior and posterior to the spinal canal.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an alternative embodiment, a fastener or bone screw may be similarly positioned into the pedicle of the inferior vertebra. The fastener then transverses the pedicle, crosses the disc space between the two vertebrae and enters the inferior aspect of the upper vertebra. The fastener may be further adapted to move the top vertebral bone relative to the lower vertebral bone. After re-positioning of the two vertebral bones, a system <b>105</b> may be then applied to the posterior aspect of the two vertebrae. These devices and methods of use are particularly useful to re-align, at least partially, vertebral bones that may be mal-aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates an embodiment wherein a bone screw or fastener <b>310</b> is positioned through the pedicle of the inferior vertebra V<b>1</b>, across the disc space between the two vertebrae and into the inferior aspect of the upper vertebra. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of the fastener <b>310</b>. The fastener includes a first threaded elongated segment <b>3102</b> and a second threaded elongated segment <b>3104</b> that are attached to one another in an assembled state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> shows an assembled fastener wherein the two device segments <b>3102</b> and <b>3104</b> are attached with at least one link member <b>3106</b>. The link members <b>3106</b> are elongated members that attach at opposite ends to the device segments <b>3102</b> and <b>3104</b> in a pivoting manner. The fastener <b>310</b> is implanted while in the configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>. In this configuration, the link members <b>3106</b> are pivoted outward such that the segments <b>3102</b> and <b>3104</b> are moved further away from one another. After placement, the fastener is transitioned into the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref> wherein the link members <b>3106</b> are pivoted inward such that the segments <b>3102</b> and <b>3104</b> are moved toward away one another. The instrumentation needed to place the fastener into bone is not shown, but may be a simple driver that engages head <b>3101</b>. While not shown, the mechanism and/or instrumentation needed to transition the fastener from the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> into the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref> may include any of the mechanism/instruments known in the art movement of a member <b>3104</b> relative to a member <b>3102</b>. For example, it is contemplated that a small internal threaded screw is positioned within proximal member <b>3102</b>. The engagable head of the small internal screw rests within head <b>3101</b> and the internal screw has a trajectory within the interior of the screw <b>310</b> that is eccentrically positioned along the long axis of member <b>3102</b>. The trajectory of the small internal screw is schematically shown by A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>. To transition the screw <b>310</b> from the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, the small screw is engaged and threadedly advanced so as to forcibly abut the member <b>3106</b> within the interior of screw <b>310</b> at or about point X (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>). With advancement of the small internal screw, member <b>3106</b> is forcibly rotated about a fixation pin <b>31066</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates how, with transition to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, the fastener <b>310</b> can produce the posterior movement of the upper vertebra V<b>2</b>, as well as an increase in the distance between the vertebra across the disc space. The fastener can also produce an increase in segmental lordosis, wherein the lordotic curvature of the lumbar spine is reformed, with a change to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>. While the link members <b>3106</b> are shown as being substantially equal in length, they may alternatively be non-equal so at produce desired movement of the bones (such as additional lordosis) with configuration change of the fastener. After reducing the bones as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the system <b>105</b> may be attached to the spinous processes of the vertebral bones in order to immobilize the vertebrae in this position. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. While bone screw <b>310</b> is illustrated as a singular bone screw with the movable feature discussed above, it may alternatively contain a proximal housing assembly that is adapted to accept an interconnecting rod. A example of a screw assembly is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The illustrated screw assembly is for example and those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a large number of bone screws that are presently known, and/or yet to be known, may be alternative used in this application.</p>
