<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) from Provisional Patent Application No. 60/668,293, filed Apr. 4, 2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The examples of this invention relate generally to digital wireless communications systems and devices and, more specifically, relate to mobile station (MS) operation in a Multimedia Broadcast/Multimedia Service (MBMS) mode of operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">MBMS is a unidirectional Point-to-Multipoint (P-t-M) multicast/broadcast service in which data is transmitted from a single source entity to a group of users in a specific area. MBMS may comprise a selection of unidirectional point-to-multipoint and bi-directional point-to-point transmissions of multimedia data (e.g. text, audio, picture, video) from a single source entity to a multiplicity of users in a service area. As used herein a Service Area for a given MBMS service is understood to be a geographical area (i.e., set of cells) where the service is made available. The goal of MBMS is therefore to allow the provision of multiple instances of a point-to-point (P-t-P) service with a single transmission over the radio interface as a radio multicast.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reference with regard to MBMS can be made to a document: 3GPP TS 23.246, V.6.4.0 (2004-09) &#x201c;Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS); Architecture and Functional Description&#x201d; (Release 6), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The MBMS has two modes of operation: Broadcast mode and Multicast mode. One significant difference between the two modes is that in Broadcast mode all MBMS users in the service area are targeted, whereas in Multicast mode it is possible to address only a subset of the MBMS users in the service area. Typically, before receiving the service the multicast mode requires the user to subscribe to a multicast group.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The reception of a MBMS multicast service is enabled by certain procedures which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which duplicates <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in sub-clause 4.4.1, &#x201c;Multicast Mode&#x201d;, of the above-referenced 3GPP TS 23.246, V.6.4.0 (2004-09) document.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An example for the phases of MBMS broadcast service provision is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which duplicates <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in sub-clause 4.4.3, &#x201c;Broadcast Mode&#x201d;, of the above-referenced 3GPP TS 23.246, V.6.4.0 (2004-09) document.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A description is now provided of a conventional release of MBMS resources and a leaving or termination procedure. As is stated in sub-clause 8.1.4.4 of 3GPP TS 44.060, &#x201c;Radio Link Control/Medium Access Control (RLC/MAC) protocol; Stage 3&#x201d;, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, only the network can initiate the release of a MBMS radio bearer. More specifically, it is stated that the &#x201c;network may initiate the normal or abnormal release of an MBMS radio bearer by transmitting a PACKET TBF RELEASE message to the mobile station(s) on the PACCH&#x201d; (Packet Associated Control Channel). The TBF is a Temporary Block Flow. In the same sub-clause is stated that the MS shall always stay in broadcast/multicast receive mode when it is receiving any MBMS bearer(s). More specifically, it is stated that: &#x201c;If the mobile station in broadcast/multicast receive mode is not receiving any other MBMS radio bearers, it shall enter packet idle mode and apply the DRX mode procedures as specified in sub-clause 5.5.1.5, otherwise it shall remain in broadcast/multicast receive mode.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This requirement must be followed whether the user wishes to receive or to not receive any MBMS service(s). In the case that the user does not wish to receive any MBMS service(s), the MS still receives a MBMS service in the downlink, and may even be required to send feedback in the uplink if commanded by the network.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the above-referenced 3GPP TS 23.246, V.6.4.0 (2004-09) document, with a &#x201c;leaving&#x201d; procedure a subscriber leaves (i.e., stops being a member of) a multicast group, i.e., the user no longer wishes to receive Multicast mode data of a specific MBMS bearer service. One may consider the leaving procedure to represent a solution, from the perspective of the MS, to stop receiving the MBMS bearer service. However, the conventional leaving procedure is not suitable for MBMS service/sessions(s) that are repeated frequently, since its use results in a considerable amount of signaling in both the radio access and core networks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to normal General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) behavior in a mobile-originated release when a downlink TBF has been allocated, the MS simply leaves the channel, such as in a cell re-selection case. However, this type of behavior is not acceptable for use with MBMS since, for example, the MS may be in a feedback mode of operation where the network is expecting to receive an uplink transmission from the MS.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of the situation just described several undesirable results can occur, such as unnecessary MS battery consumption, increased signaling load in the network, and a decreased subscriber service satisfaction.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One non-limiting purpose of the exemplary embodiments is to address the problems discussed above, and to present a solution to the problems inherent in the MS stopping (terminating) the receiving of a MBMS service bearer. The exemplary embodiments of this invention can be employed to advantage during the MBMS notification and data transfer procedures, as generally outlined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown as a non-limiting example a wireless network <b>10</b> that includes a network node, such as a Base Station Subsystem (BSS) <b>10</b>A, having at least one wireless (radio frequency RF) transceiver and antenna <b>10</b>B for transmitting on the downlink (DL) to a mobile node, also referred to as a mobile station (MS) <b>20</b>. The transceiver and antenna <b>10</b>B also receives on the uplink (UL) a transmission from the MS <b>20</b>. The network node (e.g., the BSS <b>10</b>A) is assumed to include at least one data processor (DP) <b>11</b>A coupled to a memory <b>11</b>B, such a semiconductor memory. The memory <b>11</b>B stores a computer program to operate the DP <b>11</b>A in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention, as discussed in further detail below. The MS <b>20</b> is assumed to include at least one suitable antenna and wireless transceiver <b>20</b>A, as well as at least one data processor (DP) <b>20</b>B coupled to a memory <b>20</b>C, such a semiconductor memory. The memory <b>20</b>C stores a computer program to operate the DP <b>20</b>A in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention, as described in further detail below. The MS <b>20</b> may also include a suitable user interface (UI) <b>20</b>D, such as one having a visual display and a user entry means, such as a keypad, a keyboard and/or a touch sensitive display screen and/or voice activation. The network <b>10</b> is assumed to be capable of operation with the MS <b>20</b> in the MBMS mode discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In general, the various embodiments of the MS <b>20</b> can include, but are not limited to, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) having wireless communication capabilities, portable computers having wireless communication capabilities, image capture devices such as digital cameras having wireless communication capabilities, gaming devices having wireless communication capabilities, music storage and playback appliances having wireless communication capabilities, Internet appliances permitting wireless Internet access and browsing, as well as portable units or terminals that incorporate combinations of such functions.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In general, the exemplary embodiments of this invention may be implemented by computer software executable by the DP <b>11</b>A of the network node <b>10</b>A, by the DP <b>20</b>B of the MS <b>20</b>, or by hardware, or by a combination of software, hardware and/or firmware. The memories <b>11</b>B, <b>20</b>C may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment and may be implemented using any suitable data storage technology, such as semiconductor-based memory devices, magnetic memory devices and systems, optical memory devices and systems, fixed memory and removable memory as non-limiting examples. The DP <b>11</b>A and DP<b>20</b>B may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment, and may include one or more of general purpose computers, special purpose computers, microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs) and processors based on a multi-core processor architecture, as non-limiting examples.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In view of at least system simplicity considerations it would be reasonable to restrict the MS <b>20</b> originated stopping of the receipt of a MBMS service bearer only to the data transfer procedure, as the network <b>10</b> initiated release of a MBMS radio bearer is currently specified. From the UI <b>20</b>D design point of view, however, it may not be possible to notify the user that a given session has been started until the MS <b>20</b> has correctly received a MBMS ASSIGNMENT message with a TMGI (Temporary Mobile Group Identity), a Session Id (when available), the MBMS_BEARER_ID and the P-t-M channel description parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Another approach may specify an option in the UI <b>20</b>D where the user sets his/her preference to receive an MBMS service so that stopping receipt of a MBMS bearer may be done automatically, and without user intervention during the notification procedure. With this approach the user has performed the joining procedure, but for some reason wishes not to receive an MBMS service. This behavior is especially beneficial in the MBMS broadcast mode, since by using it some often repeated advertisements or sessions can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The exemplary embodiments of this invention may be employed to advantage to stop (terminate) receiving a MBMS service bearer, and to more specifically stop the receipt of a certain session of a given MBMS bearer. It should be noted that in the case of the MBMS bearer the leaving procedure may be preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Described now is an example of a MS <b>20</b> originated stopping of the receipt of a MBMS service bearer via signaling, while in the notification or data transfer procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Described first is the case where the MS <b>20</b> is not in the feedback mode.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">During the MBMS data transfer procedure, when the MS <b>20</b> is not in the feedback mode, upper layers of the MS <b>20</b> software may request to stop the receipt of a MBMS radio bearer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts how the signaling can be performed in the MS <b>20</b> originated manner. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the RACH is the Random Access Channel and the AGCH is the Access Grant Channel. The packet access to stop receiving the MBMS radio bearer is initiated by the MS <b>20</b> by sending a (PACKET) CHANNEL REQUEST message on (P)RACH or on the MPRACH, if allocated, with an access cause of &#x201c;Single Block MBMS Access&#x201d; for requesting a single uplink block (Step <b>4</b>A).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Upon reception by the network <b>10</b> of a (PACKET) CHANNEL REQUEST message with the access cause &#x201c;Single Block MBMS Access&#x201d;, the network <b>10</b> sends an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message on AGCH (or a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message on a Packet Access Grant Channel (PAGCH)) for allocating one uplink block to the MS <b>20</b> (Step <b>4</b>B).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Upon reception by the MS <b>20</b> of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT (respectively PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT) message corresponding to one of its (PACKET) CHANNEL REQUEST messages that allocates one uplink radio block for MBMS access, the MS <b>20</b> sends in this radio block an MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message to the network <b>10</b> including its TLLI, the TMGI, Session Id of the session and, in accordance with examples of this invention, a Stop Receiving MBMS Radio Bearer parameter (Step <b>4</b>C). In case the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message is not correctly received on the network <b>10</b> side, the network <b>10</b> may repeat the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message on AGCH (or PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message on PAGCH), allowing the MS <b>20</b> to re-send the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Originally the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message was specified for counting purposes, since its use allows the network <b>10</b> to estimate in a given cell the number of MSs <b>20</b> that are interested in a particular session. Thus, the newly defined Stop Receiving MBMS Radio Bearer parameter may be included within the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message, although it could be included in another message as well.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Upon reception by the network <b>10</b> of the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message that includes the Stop Receiving MBMS Radio Bearer parameter, the network <b>10</b> sends a PACKET TBF RELEASE message that contains a newly defined TBF_RELEASE_CAUSE value, and the TLLI parameter of the MS <b>20</b> (Step <b>4</b>D). The TLLI is used to differentiate the requesting MS <b>20</b> from the other MSs also receiving the MBMS radio bearer. In its conventional use the PACKET TBF RELEASE message releases the entire MBMS radio bearer, and not just the TBF.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is also within the scope of the examples of this invention to define a new message, or to use another currently existing message to acknowledge that the network <b>10</b> has received the Stop Receiving MBMS Radio Bearer indication from the MS <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A non-limiting example showing modifications to the PACKET TBF RELEASE message, in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention, is depicted in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Described now is the case where the MS <b>20</b> is in the feedback mode.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">During a MBMS data transfer procedure, with the MS <b>20</b> in the feedback mode, the upper layers of the MS <b>20</b> may request to stop receiving an MBMS radio bearer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts how the signaling can be accomplished in a MS-originated manner when block retransmission is used based on the MS <b>20</b> feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">During the MBMS session, when downlink MBMS data is sent on a Packet Data Channel (PDCH, at Step <b>5</b>A), the MS_ID is used by the network <b>10</b> in order to address a specific MS <b>20</b> of the group of MSs, and is used by MS <b>20</b> on the uplink in order to allow the network <b>10</b> to identify the MS <b>20</b> among all of the MSs involved in the particular MBMS session. Each MS <b>20</b> addressed with a MS_ID may periodically be requested to send a MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention there is included a new Stop Receiving MBMS Radio Bearer parameter in the MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message sent by the MS <b>20</b> (Step <b>5</b>B).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Upon reception by the network <b>10</b> of the MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message, the network sends PACKET TBF RELEASE message that contains a new TBF_RELEASE_CAUSE value, and the TLLI parameter of the MS <b>20</b> (Step <b>5</b>C). The TLLI is used to differentiate the MS <b>20</b> from the group of the MSs receiving the MBMS radio bearer. Currently with the PACKET TBF RELEASE message it is only possible to release the entire MBMS radio bearer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is also within the scope of the exemplary embodiments of this invention to define a new message, or to use another currently existing message to acknowledge that the network <b>10</b> has received the Stop Receiving MBMS Radio Bearer indication from the MS <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A non-limiting example showing modifications to the PACKET TBF RELEASE message, in accordance the exemplary embodiments of this invention, are depicted in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It should be noted that the period for requesting MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACKs from the MS <b>20</b> is a function of the network <b>10</b> implementation and, therefore, it should be possible for the MS <b>20</b> to use the exemplary embodiments described above also when the feedback mode is used by the MS <b>20</b>, to avoid any problem that may be caused by a long polling period. In addition, the ACK/NACK message name, and the message content, may vary.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The advantages made possible by the use of the exemplary embodiments of this invention can include, but need not be limited to, a reduction in MS <b>20</b> battery consumption, additional freedom of use of MBMS services for the user, and improved control of radio resources on the network <b>10</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">What follows are non-limiting examples of how the foregoing MS-20 originated stopping of a MBMS radio bearer may be implemented. Reference may be had to the above-referenced 3GPP TS 44.060 document, sub-clause 11.2.26 &#x201c;Packet TBF Release&#x201d;, and compare same to the following modifications thereto (note the text in bold font) in accordance with the examples of this invention.
