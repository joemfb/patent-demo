<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many types of input devices are available for performing operations in a computing system, such as buttons or keys, mice, trackballs, joysticks, touch sensor panels, touch screens, or the like. Touch screens may come in a variety of forms, such as a touch sensor panel, which may include a clear or transparent panel with a touch-sensitive surface and a display device, which may include a display positioned partially or fully behind the touch panel so that the touch-sensitive surface may cover at least a portion of the viewable area of the display device. Touch screens generally allow a user to perform various functions by touching (e.g., physical contact) the touch sensor panel or by near-field proximity to it. In general, a computing system may register the touch event and may be capable of performing one or more actions based at least in part on registration of the touch event.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Touch screens, or devices that may incorporate, or be compatible with, touch screen technology, seem to be increasingly popular. Their popularity with consumers may be partly attributable to their relative ease or versatility of operation, as well as their declining price. In addition, touch screens may also be increasingly popular due, in part, to their generally decreasing overall size, their reliability, or their robustness. A corollary to these characteristics may be that, from a manufacturer's perspective, costs associated with producing devices including touch screens, or producing devices including touch screens with characteristics which are believed to be desirable for consumers, have decreased or become less onerous. Accordingly, there generally is a desire to continue to develop approaches or techniques believed to be desirable for consumers or end-users in terms of cost, performance or a combination thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the following description of embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which it is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments of claimed subject matter. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be used, for example, changes or alterations, such as structural changes, may be made. All embodiments, changes or alterations are not departures from scope with respect to intended claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">This disclosure relates generally to a passive touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment integrated with or in direct physical contact with an organic light emitting diode (OLED) structure embodiment in a module or integrated circuit (IC) embodiment. In this context, a touch actuated sensor configuration may refer to a configuration of touch sensors, including a surface, in which touch sensors of the configuration are responsive to direct physical contact with (e.g., touching) or close proximity to the surface of the configuration or a portion thereof. It is noted also that the terms touch actuated sensor configuration, touch activated sensor configuration, touch sensor panel and touch sensor configuration may be used interchangeably throughout this specification. Likewise, in this context, a passive touch actuated sensor configuration may refer to a touch actuated sensor configuration in which it is not required that additional energy, regardless of form, be supplied to the overall touch sensor configuration or system for touch sensors of the configuration to be responsive.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an example embodiment, a touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment may include an array of touch sensors integrated with an array of OLED pixels in a module or in an integrated circuit (IC). Here, the detection of a touch event by one or more touch sensors may be sensed by sense circuitry and processed or otherwise interpreted. The interpreted touch data may result in a processor or other circuit electrically activating pixels of the array to change the display, as described in more detail below. OLED structures may provide potential advantages over possible alternative display technologies, depending at least in part on the particular application. For example, OLED structures typically do not employ light valves or similar technology.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Turning to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view illustrating an example of a hand held device embodiment <b>100</b>. It is noted that claimed subject matter is not limited in scope to a hand held device. This is simply one example embodiment. Rather, claimed subject matter may be employed in connection with any one of a host of possible devices, including a computing system, a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, or a set top box, just to name a few examples. However, for purposes of illustration and without limitation, in this example embodiment, a plan view of hand held device embodiment <b>100</b> is shown, including a touch sensitive or touch actuated or touch-activated surface <b>110</b> and a housing <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A touch surface, such as surface <b>110</b>, may, in this context, sometimes also be referred to as a touch sensitive surface or a touch activated surface. In general, a touch sensitive surface may include a clear or transparent substrate with a configuration of sensors typically, but not necessarily, in contact with the substrate. A touch actuated sensor configuration may also be positioned in front of a display so that a touch sensitive surface covers at least a portion of a viewable area of the display. As indicated previously, for this particular embodiment, and as shall be explained in greater detail, an OLED structure embodiment may be employed here to provide a viewable area. The arrangement of this particular embodiment, for example, may allow a user to make selections or move a cursor, such as by touching a portion of a touch sensitive surface positioned in front of a display with an object (e.g., a finger), or by placing the object in close proximity to the surface. In general, a touch sensitive surface may recognize and electronically register a touch or other direct physical contact or a near-touch with the touch sensitive surface via touch sensors connected to processing components or circuitry within the hand held device, for example, capable of processing such actions, gestures or surface contacts. Therefore, a computing system including circuitry or processors, for example, may interpret the registered touches or near-touches and perform an action based at least in part on processing by the computing system. Of course, as used herein, the term computing system may refer to a specific or special purpose computing system. For example, in this instance, a computing system to process touch events or the like is described.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view illustrating the example hand held device embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in greater detail. This particular embodiment, without limitation, illustrates hand held device embodiment <b>100</b> including an array of capacitive touch sensors <b>130</b> under a surface of a display (e.g., touch glass). For this particular embodiment, as suggested previously, an array of capacitive touch sensors may form a touch sensitive surface over at least a portion of a viewable area of a display screen. Again, in this particular embodiment, the viewable area may be provided by an OLED structure embodiment that shall be described in more detail later. It should be understood that this general illustration of an array of capacitive touch sensors <b>130</b> and hand held device <b>100</b> is merely a schematic depiction to aid the understanding of one of ordinary skill in the art. Hand held device <b>100</b>, housing <b>120</b>, and array of capacitive touch sensors <b>130</b>, for example, are not illustrated to scale&#x2014;particularly capacitive touch sensors <b>130</b>. Furthermore, while a possible configuration using a particular sensing technology, here capacitive, is illustrated schematically, claimed subject matter is not limited to employing only capacitive touch sensor technology. Accordingly, many different configurations, touch sensing technologies, or various manufacturing processes may be employed without any departure from or with respect to claimed subject matter scope. It is, therefore, understood that any or all configurations, technologies, or processes, or the like, are intended to fall within the scope of claimed subject matter. What is provided herein are simply illustrative examples thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As suggested previously, many different sensing approaches or technologies may be used in conjunction with a touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment integrated with an OLED structure embodiment. For example, a touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment may utilize, but is not limited to, touch actuated sensing technologies which may employ resistive, optical, surface acoustic, or capacitive technology, or any combinations thereof, just to a name a few. While for particular embodiments, disclosed herein, a capacitive touch actuated sensor configuration is illustrated in detail, it is of course understood that any or all other approaches or techniques may also or alternatively be utilized in connection with an OLED structure embodiment integrated with a touch sensor configuration embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a touch actuated sensor configuration may utilize capacitive sense technology. For this particular embodiment, a configuration of touch sensors having respective touch sensing locations may be formed. For example, one or more electrical structures may include a pattern of conductive traces (e.g., drive and sense lines) arranged in a manner so as to sense a change in capacitance which may be occasioned by an object, such as a finger, touching, contacting or hovering over a touch sensitive surface of a configuration that may include an array of touch sensors at particular touch points or touch locations. For example, an array of touch sensors may be formed from a pattern of conductive traces. As an object approaches a touch sensitive surface, one or more touch sensors of the configuration at particular touch sensing points or locations may experience a change in capacitance occasioned by proximity to the object. By detecting a change in capacitance at one or more touch sensing points or locations, and by noting the particular location or position associated with the change in capacitance, a sensing circuit may detect and register one or more touch events, such as, for example, an image of touch. After being detected and registered, touch events may be processed or otherwise used to at least in part control operation of an electronic device, such as for one or more operations of hand held device <b>100</b>, by way of example. It is noted that throughout this specification, with respect to the operation of a touch sensor, the terms sensing points, sensing locations, touch point, touch locations or the like are used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although a variety of particular embodiments are possible, configurations or arrangements for use in a touch actuated sensor configuration may include &#x201c;self&#x201d; capacitive or &#x201c;mutual&#x201d; capacitive configurations. In a &#x201c;self&#x201d; capacitive configuration, for example, capacitance may be measured relative to some reference, such as a ground or ground plane. In a &#x201c;mutual&#x201d; capacitive configuration, capacitance between drive and sense lines may be measured. Accordingly, &#x201c;self&#x201d; or &#x201c;mutual&#x201d; capacitive configurations may have similar or common aspects with respect to structural or electrical arrangements employed as well as dissimilar aspects with respect to structural or electrical arrangements employed, as described immediately below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a &#x201c;mutual&#x201d; capacitance sensing arrangement or configuration embodiment, for example, sensing locations may be formed by a crossing of patterned conductors formed from spatially separated conductive lines or traces. In one particular embodiment, conductive traces may lie in substantially parallel planes, the conductive traces of a particular plane being referred to here as being substantially co-planar, the substantially parallel planes in this particular embodiment otherwise being relatively close in proximity. Furthermore, substantially co-planar conductive traces may be oriented to be substantially parallel. However, conductive traces from different planes may be oriented so as to be substantially perpendicular in direction. That is, substantially co-planar conductive traces lying in a first plane having a first orientation or direction may be substantially perpendicular to substantially co-planar conductive traces lying in a second or in another plane having a second orientation or direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, in one embodiment, drive lines may be formed on a first layer in a first direction and sensing lines may be formed on a second layer in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction such that drive and sense lines may &#x201c;cross&#x201d; one another at various touch sensing locations, albeit the drive lines being on a different layer of the configuration than the sense lines. It is noted herein that for the purposes of this patent application, the term &#x201c;on&#x201d; is not intended to necessarily refer to directly on. For example, a second layer may be formed on a first layer without the two layers being in direct physical contact. Thus, there may, continuing with the example, be additional layers or other material between these first and second layers. Notwithstanding the examples provided above, it should be understood that other non-perpendicular (e.g., non-orthogonal) orientations of the traces in the two planes are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A variety of other arrangements or configuration embodiments are also possible to provide a capacitance sensing arrangement or configuration, although claimed subject matter is not intended to be limited to any particular one. For example, conductive traces may be formed on different sides of a substrate. Conductive traces that may include shapes such as diamonds that cross in the manner discussed above may also be formed on one side of a substrate with an insulating separation, such as a dielectric, separating the traces at crossover locations. Conductive traces may also be formed on different substrates with the substrates being oriented so that the conductive traces lie in different substantially parallel planes while being on different layers. Employing a separation between drive and sense lines, in this particular embodiment, may result in capacitive coupling or capacitively coupled nodes between sense and drive lines at common locations or crossing locations that otherwise lie in different substantially parallel planes, as described above. In such an embodiment, these capacitively coupled locations may form an array of touch sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another example, an array of touch sensors may be formed from conductive traces and shapes such as patches and columns formed on the same layer on the same side of a substrate in a single-sided ITO (SITO) configuration, for example. In a SITO configuration, the drive lines may be formed from a row of patches of conductive material that may be connected through conductive traces and metal in the border areas of the panel. The sense lines may be formed as columns or connected patches of conductive material. Other SITO configurations are also possible. Therefore, claimed subject matter is not limited in scope to this particular description. In some SITO embodiments, electrical activation or stimulation of a drive line may result in mutual capacitance between adjacent drive and sense line patches or columns, for example. A finger or other object may result in a change in this mutual capacitance that may be detected by sensing circuits. Of course, these are merely example embodiments, and claimed subject matter is not intended to be limited in scope to these or any other particular embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A &#x201c;self&#x201d; capacitive configuration embodiment, in contrast, may measure capacitance relative to a reference ground plane. Also, a self capacitive embodiment typically employs an array or other arrangement of conductive patches or pads, such as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) pads or patches. It is noted, without limitation, that ground plane may be formed on the back side of a substrate, on the same side as an array of conductive pads or patches, but separated from the patches or pads, or on a separate substrate. We likewise note that claimed subject matter is not limited in scope to ITO. Rather, any transparent conductive material, such as, for example, ZTO, may likewise be employed or any combinations thereof. In a self-capacitance touch sensor configuration embodiment, self-capacitance of a sensor relative to the reference ground may be changed due at least in part to the presence of an object, such as a finger. In some self-capacitance embodiments, self-capacitance of conductive column traces, for example, may be sensed independently, and self-capacitance of conductive row traces may also be sensed independently.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition to different sensing approaches that may be used in conjunction with a touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment, there may also be different arrangements for a touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment. Some of these arrangements may depend at least in part on the manner or the processes utilized to form a touch actuated sensor configuration or a touch sensitive surface. For example, different arrangements may vary as to sensor or sensing point location as well as relative orientation of a touch surface to one or more of the touch sensors or sensing points. However, any or all arrangements are intended to be within the scope of claimed subject matter and, therefore, may be utilized with a host of possible touch actuated sensor configuration embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An aspect of an embodiment in which a touch actuated sensor configuration is integrated with an OLED structure relates to a process for manufacture or fabrication. For example, a touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment may be fabricated on one side of a substrate and an OLED structure embodiment may be fabricated on one side of another substrate in separate processes. The touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment and the OLED structure embodiment may be combined into a single module or IC so that the touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment and the OLED structure embodiment contact one another. Furthermore, in such an embodiment, one or more respective touch sensors of the touch actuated sensor configuration may be electrically connected to the OLED structure via a conductive paste, although claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in this respect. Other approaches are also available and intended to be included within claimed subject matter so that the touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment and the OLED structure embodiment may be physically, and in some embodiments, electrically connected, as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Again, it is noted here that for this particular embodiment of an integrated module or integrated circuit (IC), for example, the touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment and the OLED structure embodiment may be fabricated by separate processes. Furthermore, in the particular embodiment, after fabrication, the touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment and the OLED structure embodiment may be physically, and in some embodiments, electrically connected. In one particular embodiment, for example, a conductive paste may be employed to form the electrical connections. It is noted that a variety of conductive pastes or other conductive materials may be employed and claimed subject matter is not limited in scope to a particular conductive paste; however, examples include a paste that may include a polymer or an adhesive and a conductive material, such as silver or gold. Likewise, typically a process may be employed to cure the conductive paste. As examples, heat may be applied, pressure may be applied, radiation may be applied, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">One potential advantage of employing separate processes to fabricate the touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment and the OLED structure embodiment may be that OLEDs tend to be sensitive to high temperature or high pressure processes. On the other hand, high temperature or pressure processes typically are employed in the fabrication of a touch sensor configuration. Thus, employing separate fabrication processes may permit fabrication in a manner that is less likely to damage the OLED structure embodiment. Likewise, a process for curing a conductive paste typically involves less temperature or less pressure than a process to fabricate a touch actuated sensor configuration, again reducing the likelihood of damage to an OLED structure. Another potential advantage may be the ability to increase module or IC yield. For example, the touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment and the OLED structure embodiment may be tested after fabrication, but before being integrated. This may produce higher yields than otherwise might result.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart or flow diagram illustrating an example process embodiment <b>300</b> for producing a touch sensor configuration embodiment. In the discussion below, reference is also made to a schematic diagram of a touch sensor configuration embodiment <b>400</b> as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also includes a flow chart or flow diagram illustrating an example process embodiment <b>320</b> for producing an OLED structure embodiment; however, that portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is discussed in more detail later. It should be understood that the process flow embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are provided as examples or illustrations. Therefore, it is further noted that some blocks may be omitted, additional blocks may be added to the flow, alternative blocks may be employed, or completely different fabrication processes involving a flow of different blocks may be utilized. Any and all other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For this touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment, beginning at block <b>301</b>, a substrate, such as a &#x201c;motherglass,&#x201d; may be prepared for processing, from which a number of individual substrates may be produced, although it should be understood that cingulated substrates may also be used. Reference now is made here to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which is a cross-sectional side view diagram of a touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment <b>400</b>. Therefore, this configuration embodiment includes motherglass <b>401</b>, as shown. Typical materials which may be used as a substrate include materials having properties such as being relatively inert to subsequent processing, not being opaque to radiation, or providing electrical insulation. For example, suitable materials for a substantially transparent substrate may include glass, plastic, ceramic, metallic, organic or inorganic materials, or any combination thereof. Likewise, at least some of these example materials may also be flexible or rigid.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Chemical strengthening may be performed on the &#x201c;motherglass,&#x201d; as shown by block <b>302</b>, which may involve employing a nitric acid bath at a high heat, resulting in compressive forces or stresses at the surface layer of the glass and tensile stresses at the inside core of the glass. Various coatings may be employed, illustrated at block <b>303</b>, such as an anti-glare coating, which may include particle-embedded silicon dioxide, an anti-reflective coating, a black mask coating on selected regions, or an application of an overcoat layer. These various coating or layers may be applied using a variety of techniques, which may include printing, roller coating, or sputtering followed by etching of unwanted areas, as non-limiting examples. Of course, in some embodiments, such coatings may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A clear or transparent overcoat may be formed, which may include a clear or transparent polymer curable with ultraviolet (UV) light. This is illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by overcoat <b>402</b>. This coating may smooth over black mask areas, such as <b>403</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, in some embodiments. Likewise, this coating may in some embodiments form a substantially planar surface for subsequent Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) sputtering or conductive material (e.g., metal) patterning at block <b>304</b>. As suggested, ITO or other conductive material may be sputtered, or otherwise applied or deposited, and patterned, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by <b>404</b>. Depending at least in part on the particular configuration, conductive lines or conductive pads or patches may be patterned. At block <b>305</b>, an insulator may be formed over the patterned ITO or other conductive material, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by <b>405</b>. An insulator may have dielectric properties. For example, insulator <b>405</b> may be formed so that a second layer of ITO or other conductive material may be later formed, although claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Additionally, at block <b>305</b>, a photoresist may be employed. The photoresist may subsequently be patterned for the formation of vias, as indicated at block <b>306</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, illustrates via <b>407</b>. A photoresist may be employed, among other things, to protect various structures underlying the photoresist from subsequent processing or manufacturing operations, such as metal sputtering, as only one example. Subsequent processing may be commenced in particular locations by removing photoresist at those locations, as indicated at block <b>307</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At block <b>308</b>, depending on the particular embodiment, a second ITO or conductive material layer, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by <b>406</b>, and additional conductive traces (e.g., metal), illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by <b>408</b>, may be formed using lithography, selective deposition using a stencil mask, blanket deposition, or other techniques, to create row or column traces, for example. The patterning of metal and an ITO or conductive material layer may be done with a photoresist, a single photo-exposure and one or two etching operations, as examples. The dielectric insulator previously formed may thus permit the ITO or conductive material layers to exhibit mutual capacitance at crossover points resulting in touch sensors at these locations. Alternatively, in an embodiment employing single layer ITO (SITO), ITO patches or pads on a single layer may form the touch sensors, with mutual capacitance formed across adjacent (or nearby) drive and sense regions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is noted that a host of manufacturing processes or operations may be involved in fabrication of a particular touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment, such as to fabricate additional layers, for example, that have not been mentioned specifically here. Nonetheless, at block <b>309</b>, scribing, separating or various other finishing processes may be performed as desired. Thus, for example, the &#x201c;motherglass&#x201d; may produce individual parts for subsequent processing. In addition, individual parts may undergo further processing, such as mechanical or chemical polishing, grinding, shaping, or cleaning, to provide examples.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The example process embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and the example touch sensing configuration embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, represent merely one approach. As suggested previously, for example, sensors or sensor locations may be formed on a single side of a single substrate, on opposite sides of a single substrate, or on one side of two different substrates. Furthermore, single ITO (SITO) or double ITO (DITO) layers of patterned ITO may be employed to form touch sensor or touch sensor locations. Again, any or all arrangements are intended to be within the scope of claimed subject matter and, therefore, may be utilized with a host of possible touch actuated sensor configuration embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Depending at least in part on a particular application and a particular embodiment, the number of touch sensors or their configuration may vary considerably. For example, these may vary based, at least in part, on a desired resolution or sensitivity for a particular embodiment. Similarly, these may also vary depending at least in part on a desired transparency. Likewise, an array of touch sensors may be arranged in a Cartesian or rectangular coordinate system. As one example embodiment, drive lines may be formed as horizontal rows, while the sense lines may be formed as vertical columns (or vice versa), thus forming a plurality of touch sensors that may be considered as having distinct x and y coordinates. This approach is depicted, albeit simplified, in example hand held device <b>100</b> at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In another approach, an array of ITO pads or patches may be arranged in a Cartesian or rectangular coordinate system. Likewise, a polar coordinate system embodiment may be employed. For example, conductive traces may be arrayed as a plurality of concentric circles with another set of conductive traces being radially extending lines. Conductive patches or pads may be similarly arranged, thus forming a plurality of touch sensors that may be considered as having distinct radius and angle coordinates. Furthermore, touch sensor configurations may also be formed so that sensors are arranged in any number of dimensions and orientations, including but not limited to, diagonal, concentric circle, three-dimensional or random orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Returning to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, conductive pads or patches forming touch sensors may also be electrically connected to various integrated circuits (ICs). Here again, there may be a variety of approaches or techniques to connect one or more ICs. Accordingly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a side view is provided to depict a simplified high-level touch sensor configuration embodiment. Here, conductive traces or conductive pads may be routed to an edge of the substrate so that a flexible printed circuit (FPC), such as <b>409</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or other type of circuit, such as an IC, may be bonded to an area of the substrate. In this particular embodiment, an FPC or an IC may be connected to a configuration of touch sensors using an anisotropic conductive film (ACF) or paste, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by <b>410</b>, although claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Likewise, in some embodiments, an arrangement of touch sensors may be electrically connected to one or more drive circuits or one or more sense circuits. As one possible example, without limitation, a sense circuit may be operable to detect changes in capacitance indicative of a touch or near touch and transmit electrical signals representative thereof (e.g., an array of capacitance signal values corresponding to a plurality of touch sensor locations in a configuration of touch sensors) to a processor. However, in some embodiments, a sensing circuit may include the capability to process or in some form pre-process the capacitance signal values so that at least partially processed signal values may be provided for additional processing to another component, such as a processor or the like. In this context, a processor may include, for example, a controller or microcontroller, a digital signal processor, a microprocessor or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) containing processor capabilities, to provide several processor examples. Likewise, virtually any number of processors or ICs may be employed, depending, for example, at least in part on the particular application or the particular embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, a drive circuit may apply a voltage or current drive signal (e.g., a periodic signal) to one or more drive lines in the touch sensor panel. A relationship between this drive signal and a signal appearing at touch sensor locations may be a function of capacitive coupling, which may be affected by an object in contact with or in proximity to a touch sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an example process flow embodiment for producing an OLED structure embodiment is illustrated. As suggested previously, any or all approaches or techniques applicable to fabrication of an OLED structure embodiment may be encompassed within the scope of claimed subject matter. Therefore, the approaches, techniques or processes described are provide as illustrations and are not intended to limit the scope of claimed subject matter in any way. In the discussion below, reference shall also be made to the OLED structure embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This particular embodiment of an OLED structure may be referred to as an anode-common structure; though, as just mentioned, the scope of claimed subject matter may include any or all variations of OLEDs, including, but not limited to, cathode-common structures, dual-plate OLED (DOD) structures, active or passive matrix OLED structures, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At block <b>310</b>, a substrate, such as substrate <b>501</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, may be prepared for fabrication of an array or configuration of driving transistors, for example. Although claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in this respect, here, the driving transistors may include thin-film transistors (TFTs). At block <b>311</b>, a transistor, such as TFT <b>502</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, may be formed on the substrate. Fabrication of transistors is a reasonably well understood technology and, therefore, will not be discussed at length here.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At block <b>312</b>, an insulating layer, such as insulator <b>503</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, may be formed over the transistors. This insulating layer may assist in lessening electrical interferences, such as parasitic interference, for the TFTs or other electrical components that may be fabricated within the structure embodiment. At block <b>313</b>, a planarization layer, such as <b>504</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, may be fabricated and form a substantially planar surface for subsequent deposition, patterning or other fabrication processes. At block <b>314</b>, a via, such as via <b>505</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, may be formed and filled with conductive material, such as metallization, for example, as illustrated by block <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At block <b>316</b>, a layer of organic light emitting (OLE) material may be applied or deposited over the metallization, forming anode <b>506</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Another metallization layer, in this embodiment forming a cathode <b>508</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, may be formed over OLED layer <b>507</b>. In this discussion the fabrication process has been simplified so as to avoid obscuring claimed subject matter. A host of manufacturing processes or operations may be involved in fabrication of a particular OLED structure embodiment, such as to fabricate additional layers, for example, that have not been mentioned specifically here. At block <b>318</b>, one or more finishing operations may be performed, such as encapsulation, planarization, or various other techniques or approaches typically utilized in the fabrication of an OLED structure embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a side view of a schematic diagram of one embodiment <b>600</b> of a passive touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment integrated with an OLED structure embodiment. It is noted that a variety of alternate module or IC embodiments are possible, as discussed in more detail below. In this particular embodiment, however, a passive touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment having a glass substrate <b>601</b> includes touch sensors formed on one side of the glass substrate. In this embodiment, the side of the substrate on which the touch sensors are formed is the side least remote from the OLE material <b>602</b> of the OLED structure embodiment. Thus, the glass substrate forms a touch sensitive surface <b>603</b> while also providing protection for the OLED structure embodiment. In the particular embodiment, an SITO sensor configuration, formed by ITO pads or patches <b>604</b>, for example, is employed, with an insulation layer <b>605</b> insulating and protecting the pads or patches for this particular embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It should be understood, however, that claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. For example, alternatively, and as explained previously, a DITO sensor configuration may be employed. In such an embodiment, a touch sensor configuration may be formed on one side of a substrate, here a glass substrate, for example, with the other side providing a touch sensitive surface and providing protection for an OLED structure embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The OLED structure embodiment of module embodiment <b>600</b> may include a passivation layer <b>606</b>. Therefore, in this example embodiment, direct contact between the passive touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment integrated with the OLED structure embodiment may occur between passivation layer <b>606</b> and insulation layer <b>605</b>. Likewise, the OLED structure embodiment may include metallization layers <b>607</b> and <b>608</b> sandwiching OLE material <b>602</b>. Insulation material may be provided where appropriate to fill gaps in the structure embodiment between the portion of the structure including an array of OLED pixels to form the OLED display and the portion of the structure including an array of transistors to drive the OLED pixels. Here, as illustrated for example by TFT <b>609</b>, the driving transistors comprise TFTs. In this particular context, the term OLED pixel or display pixel refers to a structure that includes a red pixel, a green pixel and a blue pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, control signals, power and ground typically employed to operate an OLED structure are provided through one or more flexible printed circuits (FPCs; not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Furthermore, in some embodiments, drive and sense lines for the passive touch actuated sensor configuration may be routed on or off a sensor configuration using one or more FPCs (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). In such embodiments, two FPCs may be employed, one for an OLED structure, and one for a passive touch actuated sensor configuration. However, in other embodiments, drive and sense lines may be routed through an OLED structure. For example, in such embodiments, conductive material, such as patches of conductive paste may be utilized to provide separate electrical connections for drive and sense lines, for example. Although claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in this respect, in this manner, as one example, a single FPC may be coupled to an OLED structure to provide signals to and from the OLED structure and the passive touch actuated sensor configuration. One advantage in this example, of course, is reducing an FPC.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Arrows shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> correspond to directional of views as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, to route drive signals onto the passive touch actuated sensor configuration and onto certain drive ITO patterns <b>604</b>, and to route sense signals from other sense ITO patterns off the passive touch actuated sensor configuration, metallization <b>611</b> may be formed in border areas of substrate <b>601</b> in a passive touch actuated sensor configuration, for example. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, metallization <b>611</b> may include a number of individual traces representing different drive or sense lines for the ITO pads or patches. As mentioned above, patches of conductive paste <b>610</b> or other conductive material (illustrated for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may be used to electrically connect metallization <b>611</b> on the passive touch actuated sensor configuration to metallization <b>612</b> on the OLED structure. Metallization <b>612</b> may be electrically connected to a FPC attached to the OLED structure to route drive or sense signals on or off module, for example. Metallization <b>612</b>, which is connected to metallization <b>611</b> through paste <b>610</b>, is not directly connected to cathode <b>608</b>, despite the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As described in the next paragraph, and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example, there may be another metallization area for connecting power or ground to the cathode <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> due to the side view, a different metallization may be employed to electrically couple to cathode <b>608</b> in this example embodiment. This metallization may also be electrically connected to the FPC attached to the OLED structure to route either power or ground onto the module and bias the cathode. Of course, this is merely one example embodiment and claimed subject matter is not limited in scope to this particular layout or approach.</p>

Here, for example, metallization <b>611</b> depending at least in part on the particular embodiment, may route to ITO patches <b>604</b> formed as part of a single drive line, although it is understood that a drive line may be formed from other structures as well (e.g., continuous rows, diamond shapes, pyramid shapes, and the like). ITO patches <b>604</b> connect to metallization <b>611</b> (not shown) and metallization <b>611</b> is to be electrically connected to metallization <b>614</b> via conductive paste. In contrast, metallization <b>613</b>, depending at least in part on the particular embodiment, may route to ITO patches <b>604</b> formed as part of a single sense line, although it is understood that a sense line may be formed from other structures as well (e.g., continuous columns, diamond shapes, pyramid shapes, and the like). Likewise, ITO patches <b>604</b> connect to metallization <b>613</b> (not shown) and metallization <b>613</b> is to be electrically connected to metallization <b>614</b> via conductive paste.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a top view of the OLED structure embodiment including metallization <b>614</b> and <b>612</b>, which may be coupled to a FPC. Metallization <b>614</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> does not appear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for a similar reason explained with respect to metallization <b>613</b>. As noted previously and illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in this particular example, metallization <b>614</b> and <b>612</b> do not electrically contact cathode <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Yet another embodiment in accordance with claimed subject matter may include two substrates. The first substrate of the two substrates may include, on a first of two sides, a first layer comprising passive touch actuated sensors. The second of the two substrates may include, on a first of two sides, a first layer comprising driving thin-film transistors and a second layer comprising an OLE material sandwiched between metallization sub-layers. For this particular embodiment, the first and second layers of the second substrate may be mutually adjacent and arranged so that at least some of the thin-film transistors of the first layer are capable of electrically driving at least a portion of the OLE material sandwiched between metallization sub-layers. Likewise, the two substrates may be oriented so that the second side of the first substrate is most remote from the second side of the second substrate; that is, these may form the outer surfaces of the module or IC, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this particular embodiment, passive touch actuated sensors of the first layer on the first substrate may be electrically connected to a least remote metallization sub-layer of the OLED structure. As explained for previous embodiments, the passive touch actuated sensors of the first layer on the first substrate are thus capable of being electrically coupled to a power source or to ground, such as via a metallization sub-layer, such as a thin-film transistor layer on the second substrate, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition to the embodiments just discussed, a variety of additional module or IC embodiments are possible and included within the scope of claimed subject matter. For example, an embodiment may include more than one substrate included within a touch actuated sensor configuration embodiment. Thus, a touch sensor configuration may be sandwiched between two glass substrates, with one forming a protective outer cover glass while the other substrate includes ITO pads or patches formed on it. Whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates touch sensors on the surface of substrate <b>601</b> least remote from OLE material <b>602</b>, the touch sensors may also be on the surface of a substrate most remote from the OLE material, if desired, since a protective outer cover glass is also provided. Likewise, a DITO touch sensor configuration may be employed that is similarly sandwiched between glass substrates with an insulating layer within the configuration to separate the ITO layers. A host of other arrangements are also possible and claimed subject matter is not intended to be limited to any particular arrangement. All arrangements or embodiments are intended to be within the scope of claimed subject matter.</p>
