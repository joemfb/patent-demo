<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A harvesting machine includes a harvesting header with a header frame, a flexible cutterbar assembly attached to the header frame along the length thereof and configured to cut a crop, a plurality of laterally spaced apart support arms, a conveyor assembly, and a cutterbar drive. The support arms are pivotally coupled to the frame for swinging movement about a laterally extending axis so that the flexible cutterbar assembly is operable to flex along the length thereof in response to changes in terrain as the header is advanced. The cutterbar drive includes a drive element and a forward gearbox drivingly connected between the drive element and the cutterbar assembly. The forward gearbox is supported on an outer support arm.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a harvesting header. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention concern a harvesting header with a flexible cutterbar and flexible draper conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A traditional grain harvesting implement or machine, such as a self-propelled combine, is used to harvest a variety of grains, such as wheat, soybeans, and rice. Combines typically include a harvesting header that cuts the crop and gathers the crop material into a feeder house for threshing and other operations. For some grains, such as wheat, the sickle of the header can be spaced from the ground during the cutting operation. For other grains, the sickle must be positioned close to the ground, often with the header in sliding contact with the ground, in order to collect most of the grain. Flexible headers are used to follow the natural contours of the field while cutting the grain.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional grain harvesters are problematic and suffer from various undesirable limitations. For instance, flexible headers that include a flexible cutterbar are ineffective at receiving all of the severed crop material when following the ground contour at a high speed. Prior art flexible headers are also deficient because they fail to convey all of the received cut crop material to the feeder house. Furthermore, harvesters with flexible headers ineffectively control the header height, particularly when the header is in sliding contact with the ground. Yet further, prior art flexible headers become damaged when operating in close proximity to the ground, particularly when the terrain has a significant contour.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The drawing figures do not limit the present invention to the specific embodiments disclosed and described herein. The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon clearly illustrating the principles of the preferred embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the harvesting header selected for illustration comprises a flexible header <b>40</b> and a header height sensing system <b>41</b>. The harvesting header preferably forms part of a harvesting combine. The header <b>40</b> is configured for cutting and collecting a crop by being advanced in a generally forward direction D so that the crop can be fed to a feeder house (not shown) and further processed by other components (not shown) of the harvesting machine to produce grain. However, at least some aspects of the present invention could be used in other machines, such as a swather or mower.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The illustrated header <b>40</b> broadly includes a header frame <b>42</b>, draper arm assemblies <b>44</b>, end tilt arm assemblies <b>46</b>, cutterbar assembly <b>48</b>, and draper assembly <b>50</b>, which includes side drapers <b>52</b> and center draper <b>54</b>. The header <b>40</b> also includes a central collecting auger <b>55</b> spaced rearwardly of the center draper <b>54</b> and a reel (not shown) that extends the length of the header frame <b>42</b> and is operable to direct upstanding crop into the header <b>40</b>. The illustrated cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> and draper assembly <b>50</b> are preferably flexible so that the header <b>40</b> is configured to closely follow an undulating ground contour. However, for some aspects of the present invention, the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> could be substantially inflexible, i.e., where the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> is rigidly mounted relative to the header frame <b>42</b>. Similarly, there are aspects of the present invention where one, more or all of the drapers <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> could be substantially inflexible relative to the header frame <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the header frame <b>42</b> preferably includes an upper beam assembly <b>56</b> extending across the entire width of header <b>40</b>, and a lower beam assembly <b>58</b> that likewise extends across the full width of header <b>40</b>. The header frame <b>40</b> further includes a number of upright channels <b>60</b> that interconnect beam assemblies <b>56</b>,<b>58</b> along the back of header <b>40</b> at spaced locations thereacross. Yet further, the header frame <b>40</b> includes an end frame member <b>62</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) and upright rear panels <b>64</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</figref>) attached along the front side of channels <b>60</b>. The rear panels <b>64</b> cooperatively define an upright rear wall of the header <b>40</b>, with a centrally located opening <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) being defined by the rear wall and serving as a crop outlet from header <b>40</b> to the feeder house (not shown) of the harvester machine upon which header <b>40</b> is mounted. Thus, the opening <b>66</b> is spaced between left and right sides of the header <b>40</b>, when the header <b>40</b> is viewed from behind, and the opening <b>66</b> is preferably centrally located on the header <b>40</b>.</p>

The illustrated supporting arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> are configured to be selectively pivotal to provide flexible and non-flexible header configurations as will be discussed.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>, each of the end tilt arm assemblies <b>46</b> is pivotally mounted adjacent to opposite ends of the header frame <b>42</b> and is supported for selective pivotal movement. As discussed above, the arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> are attached to and cooperatively support the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b>. The illustrated cutterbar <b>68</b> is flexible and supports the sickle assembly <b>72</b>. In particular, the sickle assembly <b>72</b> comprises a split sickle that includes a pair of flexible sickle bars <b>106</b> and knives <b>108</b> that are attached to and spaced along the length of the flexible sickle bars <b>106</b>. The sickle assembly <b>72</b> also includes knife guards <b>110</b> attached to the cutterbar <b>68</b>, with the sickle bars <b>106</b> and knives <b>108</b> being operable to slide in a reciprocating manner relative to the cutterbar <b>68</b> and flex with the cutterbar <b>68</b>. The sickle bars <b>106</b> preferably reciprocate in opposite directions relative to one another. However, it is within the scope of the present invention for the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> to include a single continuous sickle bar. Again, the cutterbar <b>68</b> also supports the spaced-apart skid plates <b>70</b> that extend below the cutterbar <b>68</b> and are configured to engage the ground and thereby cause flexing movement of the cutterbar <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-14</figref>, the header <b>40</b> further includes a pair of cutterbar drive assemblies <b>112</b> that are attached to respective ones of the end tilt arm assemblies <b>46</b> and serve to power the sickle assembly <b>72</b>. The cutterbar drive assembly <b>112</b> broadly includes a gear drive <b>114</b>, a telescopic drive shaft <b>116</b>, universal joints <b>118</b>, and a forward gear box in the form of epicyclic drive <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The epicyclic drive <b>120</b> includes a gearbox with input and output shafts <b>122</b>,<b>124</b>, with the output shaft <b>124</b> being drivingly attached to a corresponding one of the sickle bars <b>106</b>. The epicyclic drive <b>120</b> serves to offset the inertial forces of the sickle during its abrupt acceleration and deceleration at opposite ends of its path of travel. While the illustrated epicyclic drive <b>120</b> is preferred, for at least some aspects of the present invention, another type of drive could be used to transfer power to the sickle bar <b>106</b> without departing from the scope of the present invention. Additional details of the preferred epicyclic drive <b>120</b> are disclosed in issued U.S. Pat. No. 7,121,074, issued Oct. 17, 2006, entitled BALANCED EPICYCLIC SICKLE DRIVE, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The epicyclic drive <b>120</b> is attached to the drive bracket <b>76</b> so as to be fixed to the end tilt arm assembly <b>46</b> and be pivotal about a laterally extending axis therewith. The gear drive <b>114</b> includes input and output shafts <b>126</b>,<b>128</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and is mounted to the header frame <b>42</b> with bracket <b>130</b>. The telescopic drive shaft <b>116</b> is drivingly connected to the input shaft <b>122</b> of drive <b>120</b> and the output shaft <b>128</b> of drive <b>114</b> with universal joints <b>118</b>, with the telescopic drive shaft <b>116</b> extending through an opening in the tilt arm <b>74</b>. The input shaft <b>126</b> of gear drive <b>114</b> is powered by a power take-off shaft (not shown) of the harvesting machine. In this manner, the illustrated shaft-driven cutterbar drive assembly <b>112</b> powers the sickle assembly <b>72</b>. For at least some aspects of the present invention, another type of transmission, e.g., a belt drive, or hydraulic drive, for transmitting power to the epicyclic drive <b>120</b> and to the sickle assembly <b>72</b> may be used instead of the preferred shaft drive of the illustrated embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The illustrated drive assembly <b>112</b> is preferably attached to and partly supported on the end tilt arm assembly <b>46</b>, with the epicyclic drive <b>120</b> and telescopic drive shaft <b>116</b> being configured to pivot with the end tilt arm assembly <b>46</b>. In particular, the universal joints <b>118</b> permit relative pivotal movement between the epicyclic drive <b>120</b> and the gear drive <b>114</b>. Furthermore, the telescopic drive shaft <b>116</b> permits relative lateral movement between the drives <b>114</b>,<b>120</b>. Although the illustrated drive assembly <b>112</b> is preferably attached to the end tilt arm assembly <b>46</b>, it is also within the scope of the present invention where the drive assembly <b>112</b> is attached to an inboard pivotal arm, such as one of the draper arm assemblies <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, the end skid <b>78</b> of the end tilt arm assembly <b>46</b> is spaced apart from the adjacent skid plate <b>70</b>. In this manner, the end tilt arm assembly <b>46</b> is operable to shift relative to the inboard adjacent draper arm assembly <b>44</b> while the adjacent arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> cooperatively support the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b>. Thus, the arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> are configured to substantially independently pivot with the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> when the header <b>40</b> is advanced over uneven terrain.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The illustrated orientation and configuration of the cutterbar drive assembly <b>112</b> preferably provides a substantially smooth constant rotational velocity of the output shaft <b>124</b>.

The output shaft <b>128</b> of the gear drive <b>114</b> rotates at a uniform rotational velocity and drives the universal joint <b>118</b>, which drives the drive shaft <b>116</b>. However, due to the angle between the output shaft <b>128</b> and the drive shaft <b>116</b>, it has been found that the universal joint <b>118</b> drives the drive shaft <b>116</b> at a non-uniform rotational velocity. In the illustrated embodiment, the input shaft <b>122</b> of the epicyclic drive <b>120</b> is angled relative to the drive shaft <b>116</b> at an angle &#x3b1; and the output shaft <b>128</b> of the gear drive <b>114</b> is angle relative to the drive shaft <b>116</b> at an angle &#x3b2; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). However, it has been determined that the illustrated arrangement of drives <b>114</b>,<b>120</b> and drive shaft <b>116</b>, with the illustrated angles &#x3b1;,&#x3b2; therebetween, the use of a universal joint <b>118</b> between the drive shaft <b>116</b> and drive <b>120</b> unsubstantially cancels out any non-uniformity in the rotational velocity so that the output shaft <b>124</b> provides a uniform rotational velocity. The cutterbar drive assembly <b>112</b> pivots so that the angle &#x3b1; lies within an angular range. Preferably, the angle &#x3b2; generally falls within that angular range so that the rotational velocity of the output shaft <b>124</b> remains substantially uniform as the cutterbar drive assembly <b>112</b> is operated.</p>

The side draper belt <b>138</b> is rotatably mounted to surround the rollers <b>132</b>,<b>134</b> and the corresponding draper arm assemblies <b>44</b>, with the side draper belt <b>138</b> presenting opposite endmost margins defined by the rollers <b>132</b>,<b>134</b>. Furthermore, the side draper belt <b>138</b> presents upper and lower runs, with the upper run extending over the belt support panels <b>136</b> so that the panels <b>136</b> restrict the upper run from sagging. The lower run of the side draper belt <b>138</b> extends below the panels <b>136</b>. The outboard roller <b>134</b> is powered by a drive (not shown), with the outboard roller <b>134</b> driving the side draper belt <b>138</b> so that an upper run of the side draper belt <b>138</b> moves inwardly toward the center draper <b>54</b>. While the illustrated embodiment includes left and right side drapers <b>52</b>, it is within the scope of the present invention, for at least some aspects of the present invention, where an alternative conveyor mechanism is used.

The arm position signal is also associated with the generally vertical position of a portion of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> adjacent a forward end of the arm assembly <b>44</b>,<b>46</b>. As the arm assembly <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> swings upwardly or downwardly, the linkage <b>176</b> causes the sensor arm <b>178</b> to swing accordingly, with the arm position signal, i.e., the voltage output, of the potentiometer <b>172</b> changing accordingly. In this manner, the potentiometer <b>172</b> is operable to sense movement of the adjacent portion of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> as the header <b>40</b> moves over uneven terrain.</p>

Preferably, the resistors <b>184</b> are 470 k-ohm resistors, the resistors <b>186</b> are 1 k-ohm resistors, the diodes <b>188</b> are 1N4004 diodes, and the operational amplifiers <b>190</b> are TS924IN op amps. The selector circuit <b>180</b> also includes selector diodes <b>192</b> electrically coupled to the output of respective buffer circuits <b>182</b> and each electrically coupled to the input of another operational amplifier <b>194</b>. The selector circuit further includes pull-up resistors <b>196</b> and feedback diode <b>198</b>. Preferably, the diodes <b>192</b> are 1N4004 diodes, the operational amplifiers <b>194</b> are TS924IN op amps, and the resistors <b>196</b> are 220 k-ohm resistors. The module <b>170</b> also includes a potentiometer circuit <b>200</b> that is preferably coupled to all of the potentiometers <b>172</b>, via common nodes <b>202</b>,<b>204</b>. The circuit <b>200</b> includes a zener diode <b>206</b> and capacitors <b>208</b>,<b>210</b>. Preferably, the capacitor <b>208</b> is a 0.1 microfarad capacitor and the capacitor <b>210</b> is a 10 microfarad capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The illustrated arrangement of selector diodes <b>192</b> cooperatively provide a selected voltage signal to the operational amplifier <b>194</b> that is substantially the same as the lowest of the output signals received from corresponding potentiometers <b>172</b> by the corresponding buffer circuits <b>182</b>. The operational amplifier <b>194</b> provides an output signal of the corresponding selector circuit <b>180</b> that is substantially the same as the selected voltage signal. In this manner, the selector circuit <b>180</b> selects the lowest one of analog voltage signals provided by the respective potentiometers <b>172</b> and provides a corresponding selected analog output signal at selector output <b>211</b>. However, it is also within the scope of the present invention where the circuit provides another signal, e.g., where the circuit selects the highest one of the voltage signals and provides a corresponding signal output. Furthermore, the circuit could provide another signal, e.g., a digital signal, that corresponds to a selection of one of the voltage signals provided by the potentiometers <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The illustrated potentiometers <b>172</b> preferably provide an input voltage to the module <b>170</b> that ranges from about 0.5 volts to about three (3) volts based on the position of the arm assembly <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> and the corresponding vertical position of the adjacent portion of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b>. In particular, the potentiometers <b>172</b> provide a voltage of about three (3) volts corresponding to the arm assembly <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> being in the lowermost arm position and about 0.5 volts corresponding to the arm assembly <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> being in the uppermost arm position. Again, the illustrated cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> has a range of generally vertical travel of about eight (8) inches when the arms swing between the uppermost and lowermost positions. Therefore, vertical movement of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> through that range of travel causes the potentiometers <b>172</b> to range between about 0.5 volts to about 3 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The module <b>170</b> provides selected signal outputs that correspond to the position of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b>. In particular, potentiometers <b>172</b><i>a</i>,<b>172</b><i>b </i>are operable to sense the position of a left side section of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> and potentiometers <b>172</b><i>c</i>,<b>172</b><i>d </i>are operable to sense the position of a right side section of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b>. Furthermore, the selector circuits <b>180</b> each provide a selector signal associated with the highest position of the arms corresponding to respective potentiometers <b>172</b>. In this manner, the selector circuits <b>180</b> each provide a single cutterbar position signal associated with the highest vertical position of that section of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The potentiometers <b>172</b>, module <b>170</b>, and header height adjustment system cooperate so that the controller of the harvesting machine automatically raises the header <b>40</b> when at least one of the arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> pivots above a predetermined angular position. Preferably, the header height adjustment system controls the header <b>40</b> in response to the cutterbar position signals received from the module. Preferably, when a voltage of one of the potentiometers <b>172</b> goes below a threshold level of about 1.5 volts, which voltage corresponds to the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> being positioned approximately four (4) inches from the uppermost position, the controller preferably raises the header <b>40</b>. However, for some aspects of the present invention, the output from the module <b>170</b> could be used for other purposes, such as triggering a warning indicator for an operator.</p>

The crop-retaining rib <b>220</b> preferably endlessly extends adjacent to the leading belt margin <b>214</b> so that the rib <b>220</b> is spaced between the margin <b>214</b> and the slats <b>218</b>. However, it is also within the ambit of the present invention where the side draper belt <b>138</b> is alternatively configured to carry crop material. For instance, the side draper belt <b>138</b> could include a plurality of crop-retaining ribs <b>220</b>, or the rib <b>220</b> could be formed in segments to present discrete rib sections.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The side draper belt <b>138</b> is rotatably received onto the rollers <b>132</b>,<b>134</b> so as to define upper and lower belt runs <b>222</b>,<b>224</b>, with the upper belt run <b>222</b> operable to move toward the center draper <b>54</b>.

The central guard <b>226</b> and an endmost belt guard <b>243</b> also include sections <b>234</b>,<b>236</b>,<b>238</b>, with the central guard <b>226</b> including tabs <b>242</b>, and the endmost belt guard <b>243</b> including a tab <b>240</b> on one end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The belt guards <b>228</b> are configured to be attached to the cutterbar <b>68</b> by fasteners that extend through holes in the flange section <b>234</b>.

Furthermore, the front tab <b>242</b> of the other belt guard <b>228</b> is positioned underneath the upright section <b>236</b> of the one belt guard <b>228</b>. In this manner, each pair of mated belt guards <b>228</b> have mating ends that cooperatively form an interlocking joint so that the mating ends each restrict relative up-and-down movement of the other mating end. However, the interlocking joint preferably permits relative angular movement between mated pairs of belt guards <b>228</b> and also permits a limited amount of relative lateral movement between mated pairs of belt guards <b>228</b> in the direction along the leading belt margin <b>214</b>. In addition, the illustrated pairs of mated belt guards <b>228</b> preferably are configured so that uppermost surfaces presented by the overhanging sections <b>238</b> are substantially flush with one another and thereby minimize any resistance to crop flow provided by the belt guards <b>228</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-30</figref>, center draper <b>54</b> serves to collect severed crop material from the side drapers <b>52</b> and carry the material in a rearward direction toward the opening <b>66</b> and toward the feeder house of the harvesting machine. The center draper <b>54</b> broadly includes a draper chassis <b>244</b>, front and rear rollers <b>246</b>, belt support <b>248</b>, and center draper belt <b>250</b>. The draper chassis <b>244</b> includes a pair of side plates <b>252</b> that are pivotally mounted to corresponding channels <b>60</b> and pivot about pivot axis <b>254</b>. The draper chassis <b>244</b> further includes a floor panel <b>256</b> that is connected to and extends along a bottom margin of the side plates <b>252</b>. Thus, the side plates <b>252</b> and floor panel <b>256</b> cooperatively pivot about the pivot axis <b>254</b>. The illustrated draper chassis <b>244</b> preferably presents a lateral width, measured from one side plate <b>252</b> to the other, of at least about five (5) feet and, more preferably about 6 feet, but it is also within the scope of the present invention where the draper chassis <b>244</b> is larger or smaller than the illustrated embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The floor panel <b>256</b> also presents a forward margin <b>258</b> that is secured to the corresponding skid plates <b>70</b> with multiple fasteners. In particular, the fasteners each include a rearwardly extending finger that is spaced upwardly from the skid plate <b>70</b> to present an elongated slot, with the finger being attached at a forward end thereof with fasteners. The forward margin <b>258</b> is slidably received within the slot to create a sliding joint that permits relative fore-and-aft sliding movement between the floor panel <b>256</b> and the skid plates <b>70</b> and restricts relative vertical movement therebetween. The draper chassis <b>244</b> also includes a counterbalance mechanism <b>260</b> for supporting the center draper <b>54</b> as will be discussed further.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The rollers <b>246</b> are rotatably mounted between the side plates <b>252</b> by mounting the rollers <b>246</b> on respective shafts <b>262</b> and by mounting the shafts <b>262</b> onto bearings (not shown) secured in the side plates <b>252</b>. The belt support <b>248</b> is attached to the side plates <b>252</b> and is spaced between the rollers <b>246</b>. The center draper belt <b>250</b> comprises an endless belt with a belt body and a plurality of crop-engaging slats <b>264</b>. The center draper belt <b>250</b> presents upper and lower runs <b>266</b>,<b>268</b>. The lower run <b>268</b> extends below the belt support <b>248</b> and the upper run <b>266</b> extends above the belt support <b>248</b>, with the belt support <b>248</b> being operable to restrict sagging of the upper run <b>266</b>. The draper belt <b>250</b> is driven by the rear shaft <b>262</b>, which is powered by a drive (not shown) so that the upper run <b>266</b> is configured to normally move in a rearward direction and the lower run <b>268</b> is configured to normally move in a forward direction. However, it is also within the scope of certain aspects of the present invention where the belt rotation direction is reversed so that the upper run <b>266</b> moves forwardly and the lower run <b>268</b> moves rearwardly (such that crop is conveyed by the lower run). While the illustrated center draper <b>54</b> is preferably centrally located relative to the rest of the header <b>40</b>, it is also within the scope of the present invention where the center draper <b>54</b> is located toward one side of the header <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the counterbalance mechanism <b>260</b> serves to support the center draper <b>54</b> by counteracting the weight of the center draper <b>54</b> about the pivot axis <b>254</b>. The counterbalance mechanism <b>260</b> includes a lever <b>270</b>, mounting lug <b>272</b>, rod <b>274</b>, and compression spring <b>276</b>. The lever <b>270</b> is attached to a rear end of the corresponding side plate <b>252</b> and extends rearwardly through the opening <b>66</b>. The mounting lug <b>272</b> is attached to an inner wall of the adjacent channel <b>60</b> and is spaced below the lever <b>270</b>. Adjacent a lower end thereof, the rod <b>274</b> is secured to the mounting lug <b>272</b> and extends up through a rear end of the lever <b>270</b> and through the spring <b>276</b>. A stop <b>278</b> is secured adjacent to an upper end of the rod <b>274</b>, with the spring <b>276</b> being captured between the rear end of the lever <b>270</b> and the stop <b>278</b>. Thus, the spring <b>276</b> is operable to bias the lever <b>270</b> in a generally downward direction. The generally downward spring force provided by the spring <b>276</b> counteracts the weight W of the center draper <b>54</b> so that the spring <b>276</b> reduces the load that the center draper <b>54</b> applies to the skid plates <b>70</b> and to the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The center draper <b>54</b> collects severed crop material from the side drapers <b>52</b> by being generally spaced below the side drapers <b>52</b>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-29</figref>, the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> further includes an elongated brace <b>280</b> that comprises a substantially uniform length of angle iron. However, it is also within the scope of the present invention to use another structure with some vertical dimension to resist bending of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> caused by gravity or other loads. For instance, the brace <b>280</b> could include an L-shaped beam made from a material other than steel, or a beam having another cross-sectional shape, e.g., a box shape, that serves to rigidify the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b>. The brace <b>280</b> is positioned to lie on top of the flange section <b>234</b> of central guard <b>226</b> and engage the upright section <b>236</b>. Fasteners secure the brace <b>280</b> and central guard <b>226</b> to the cutterbar <b>68</b> and thereby define an inflexible length <b>282</b> of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> between ends of the central guard <b>226</b>. In other words, the brace <b>280</b> and central guard <b>226</b> cooperatively restrict the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> from bending along the inflexible length <b>282</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The center draper <b>54</b> includes laterally outermost side margins that are spaced so that the inflexible length <b>282</b> extends between the margins. The center draper <b>54</b>, particularly the rollers <b>246</b>, flex to only a minimal degree along the length of the cutterbar <b>68</b>. Therefore, because the illustrated cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> is preferably rigid along the inflexible length <b>282</b>, the front roller <b>246</b> and the inflexible length <b>282</b> cooperatively maintain a substantially uniform spacing between a forward end of the draper belt <b>250</b> and the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> so that the cutterbar <b>68</b> and center draper <b>54</b> generally move together with one another. In this manner, the inflexible length <b>282</b> permits the center draper <b>54</b> to travel over uneven terrain without parts of the center draper <b>54</b>, such as the draper belt <b>250</b>, contacting the side drapers <b>52</b> and without the center draper <b>54</b> damaging itself.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Center Crop Deflector for Draper Header</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-30</figref>, the center draper <b>56</b> also includes a center crop deflector <b>284</b> that is substantially unitary and is operable to direct crop material from the side drapers <b>52</b> so that crop flow from one side draper <b>52</b> to the other is restricted. The center crop deflector <b>284</b> includes a substantially flat plate with front and rear deflector portions <b>286</b>,<b>288</b> and also includes a lower flange <b>290</b>. The rear deflector portion <b>288</b> preferably presents a height <b>292</b> of at least about one (1) inch so that the rear deflector portion <b>288</b> resists bending relative to the front deflector portion <b>286</b>. The rear deflector portion <b>288</b> also presents a portion length <b>294</b> in the range of about one (1) inch to about six (6) inches. The rear deflector portion <b>288</b> preferably presents upper and lower edges <b>296</b>,<b>298</b> that are substantially linear. The front deflector portion <b>286</b> presents an upper edge <b>300</b> that includes a lower section <b>302</b> that is substantially linear and a curvilinear transition section <b>304</b> defined between the lower section <b>302</b> and the upper edge <b>296</b> of the rear deflector portion <b>288</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The flange <b>290</b> of the center crop deflector <b>284</b> is attached to the forward margin <b>258</b> of the floor panel <b>256</b>, with the front deflector portion <b>286</b> extending forwardly up to the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> and the rear deflector portion <b>288</b> extending over the draper belt <b>250</b>. Preferably, the rear deflector portion <b>288</b> extends over the draper belt <b>250</b> a length less than half the length of the upper run <b>266</b>. More preferably, the length of extension over the draper belt <b>250</b> ranges from about one (1) inch to about six (6) inches. Also, the upper edge <b>296</b> of the rear deflector portion <b>288</b> is preferably spaced above the draper belt <b>250</b> a distance <b>306</b> in the range of about three (3) inches to about five (5) inches. It has been determined that the illustrated length of extension over the draper belt <b>250</b> and the height of the upper edge <b>296</b> relative to the draper belt <b>250</b> permits the center crop deflector <b>284</b> to direct the severed crop material while providing minimal restriction to material flow in the aft direction. In addition, the lower edge <b>298</b> is preferably spaced above the draper belt <b>250</b> a distance less than about 1.5 inches so that the center crop deflector <b>284</b> is restricted from contacting the draper belt <b>250</b> while sufficiently restricting crop material from flowing from one side draper <b>52</b> to the other. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that such untoward crop flow is particularly problematic when cutting with only one side of the header <b>40</b>. For instance, when cutting crop only on the left side of the header <b>40</b>, the left side draper <b>52</b> will convey crop material toward the center draper <b>54</b>. Because the right side draper <b>52</b> is conveying little or no crop material toward the center draper <b>54</b>, the crop material from the left side meets little resistance when reaching the center draper <b>54</b> and can continue to flow past the center draper <b>54</b> and into the right side draper <b>52</b>. Therefore, the center crop deflector <b>284</b> serves to provide sufficient resistance so that material deposited from one side draper <b>52</b> is restricted from flowing entirely across the center draper <b>54</b> to the other side draper <b>52</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Operation</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In operation, the illustrated harvesting header is operable to be advanced by the harvesting machine in a field to cut the crop and collect the severed crop material for disposal into a feeder house of the harvesting machine. As the header is advanced in the forward direction, the crop divider <b>146</b> of the end tilt arm assembly <b>46</b> defines a crop cutting path of the header and pushes crop along the sides of the path in an inboard direction. At the same time, the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> operates to sever the crop and the reel (not shown) pushes the severed crop material onto the drapers <b>52</b>,<b>54</b>. Severed crop material located on the side drapers <b>52</b> is carried inwardly toward and deposited onto the center draper <b>54</b>. In particular, both left and right side drapers <b>52</b> are operable to carry any crop material inwardly, with the center crop deflector <b>284</b> being operable to restrict crop flow from one of the side drapers <b>52</b> to pass over to the other side draper <b>52</b>. Crop material on the center draper <b>54</b> is carried in a rearward direction toward the collecting auger <b>55</b> and is then deposited through the opening <b>66</b> and into the feeder house.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The harvesting header is operable to cut and collect crop material in either the flexible header configuration or the non-flexible header configuration by configuring the arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> in corresponding arm pivoting and rigid arm configurations. The arms are placed in the rigid arm configuration by positioning the corresponding quick-release pin <b>98</b> into the locked location. With all of the arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> in the rigid configuration, the header is placed into the non-flexible header configuration. In the non-flexible configuration, the header can be advanced through the field so that the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> and drapers <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> substantially do not flex relative to the header frame <b>42</b>. Furthermore, any contact between the ground and the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> will cause substantially no flexing movement of the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> or the drapers <b>52</b>,<b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Similarly, the arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> can be placed in the arm pivoting configurations by positioning the quick-release pin <b>98</b> into the unlocked location. The flexible header configuration is achieved by configuring all of the arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> in the arm pivoting configuration. In the flexible header configuration, the header can be advanced through the field so that the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> and drapers <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> are operable to flex relative to the header frame <b>42</b> between lowermost and uppermost positions. Any contact between the ground and the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> will cause the cutterbar assembly <b>48</b> and at least one of the drapers <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> to flex upwardly relative to the header frame <b>42</b>, provided that the adjacent arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> have not already reached the uppermost position. When the arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> pivot upwardly beyond a predetermined arm movement threshold between the lowermost and uppermost positions, a controller of the harvesting machine senses the threshold condition and raises the header in response to the condition until the arm assemblies <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> pivot downwardly below the threshold. The flexible header configuration is particularly suited for cutting crop close to the ground where some intermittent contact occurs between the header and the ground.</p>

The unlocked locations <b>416</b>,<b>418</b> provide two distinct lowermost arm positions that correspond with distinct ranges of angular arm movement. Thus, the unlocked location <b>418</b> permits a full range of angular arm movement of the end tilt arm <b>404</b>, while unlocked location <b>416</b> permits a range of movement that is about half of the full range of angular arm movement provided by location <b>418</b>. The locked location <b>414</b> serves to provide an uppermost arm position that corresponds with a locked arm position, with substantially no range of angular arm movement being permitted. Preferably, each of the support arms of the illustrated header <b>400</b> has a similar stop arrangement that provides similar locked and unlocked locations.</p>
