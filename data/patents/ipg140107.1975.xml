<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for producing a continuous, three-dimensional, closed semi-finished product made of fiber composite from at least one planar, flat fibrous preform. The method is characterized in that the flat fibrous preform is initially placed flat and aligned to produce a load-bearing fiber orientation and subsequently formed into a three-dimensional structure. In a final step, the three-dimensional structure is then closed to form a closed semi-finished product.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a method for producing a continuous, three-dimensional, closed semi-finished product made of fibre composite from a planar, flat, fibrous perform as recited in claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is known that shell-shaped components in aerospace applications are always constructed and reinforced with strut and rib structures, or sandwich elements.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">If such structures have been manufactured using a carbon fibre construction method, each reinforcing element is formed from a web material, cut to a size corresponding to the respective component, and then individually processed further with manufacturing equipment to yield the component.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the past, this method led to the development of the braiding process, which in turn enables the creation of closed semi-finished tubular products. However, these semi-finished tubular products that are manufactured by braiding, and the reinforcing elements that are produced from them, do not allow design engineers any &#x201c;design freedom&#x201d;, they are expensive to make, and present handling difficulties during fabrication. The difficulty of ensuring that fibres are aligned to provide optimum load conditions represents a significant obstacle to the more widespread application of this technology.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the context of the disadvantages outlined above, the object of the present invention is to suggest a production method for the continuous, three-dimensional, closed semi-finished product made of fibre composite, that enables a semi-finished product, to be used for example in producing a reinforcing structure for a shell-like construction, to be manufactured simply, inexpensively, and in such manner that optimum load conditions are assured.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This object is solved by the features of claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The dependent claims <b>2</b> to <b>10</b> describe advantageous refinements of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method according to the invention for producing a continuous, three-dimensional, closed semi-finished product made of fibre composite from a planar, flat, fibrous preform consists of the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a) laying the planar, flat, fibrous perform flat;</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">b) aligning the planar, flat, fibrous perform to ensure optimum load-bearing orientation of the fibres in the flat, fibrous preform;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">c) forming the planar, flat, fibrous perform into a three-dimensional structure, and</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">d) closing the three-dimensional structure to create the semi-finished product made from fibre composite material.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the method according to the invention, fibre architectures in planar form that are used for producing the semi-finished products are already compacted to their final thickness but are still flexible enough to be manipulated, so the manufacturing process may be kept simple and inexpensive. In particular, it is possible to ensure that the fibres are aligned simply for optimum load-bearing orientation and characteristic. A further advantage is that no additional production equipment for preparing the preforms are necessary in the production process.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The new, closed semi-finished product produced thereby may either be used to make a complete component in further perform assembly processes, or processed further in a pulltrusion process.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The three-dimensional structure is preferably closed by sewing. Closing the three-dimensional structure by sewing is particularly advantageous since this is not only easily manageable as a manufacturing step, it also enables the joint location to be simply configured in various ways.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To ensure that the semi-finished goods of fibre composite are structured to offer optimum load-bearing characteristics, steps a) and b) are repeated several times, that is to say, additional layers of the planar, flat fibre perform are laid on top of a first layer of a planar, flat semi-finished product made from the fibre composite, and these are then also aligned according to the requirements of the component. The planar, flat fibre performs that are placed on top of each other in this way may also be configured in different ways. That is to say, a layer of a different, second, planar, flat fibrous perform is deposited on top of the first layer of the first planar, flat fibrous perform. Thus, for example, fibrous performs also produced by different production methods (weaving, knitting, sewing, stitching, etc.) might be used to create a special layer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">These fibrous perform layers that are now arranged one on top of the other are preferably joined to each other to yield a three-dimensional structure before they are formed. The effect of joining is that it prevents any undesirable slippage of the layers during the forming step.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the method according to the invention, the layers of fibrous performs lying on top of each other are joined by sewing.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The material used for sewing to close the three-dimensional structure and/or for sewing to join the layers to each other is preferably a stretchable and/or rigid and/or meltable thread material. Depending on the use of the materials described above as the thread, it is a simple matter to modify the joint location or join between layers. For example, using a stretchable thread material for sewing to close the three-dimensional structure renders the closed structure more flexible in its subsequent application.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Sewing is preferably carried out using a feed-off-the-arm stitcher or a 3D stitching robot. This ensures fast, precise seaming.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one embodiment of the invention, the planar, flat, fibrous perform layers are formed in a pleating process. The profile of the closed semi-finished product created thereby may be circular, but may also be rectilinear with tight radii, or similarly shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the method according to the invention, the three-dimensional, closed semi-finished product made from fibre composite material undergoes a heating process upon completion of step d). This has proven to be particularly advantageous when a meltable thread is used for sewing both to close the web material and to join the layers together. For example, if a meltable thread is used to join the various fibrous preform layers that are lying on top of each other, this&#x2014;unmelted&#x2014;thread is distributed throughout the structure after the layers have been closed to form a three-dimensional structure. The subsequent heating process and the associated melting of the thread material advantageously creates a continuous join that permeates the entire closed structure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a further embodiment of the method according to the invention, the three-dimensional, closed semi-finished product made from fibre composite material is draped over a core upon completion of step d).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further advantages, features, and possible applications of the present invention will be apparent from the following description in conjunction with the embodiments illustrated in the drawing.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a more a less diagrammatic cross section of a three-dimensional semi-finished product in the form of a reinforcing structural profile, designated overall by reference number <b>10</b>. Reinforcing structure profile <b>10</b> is constructed from several layers of planar, flat fibrous performs and has an essentially square cross sectional area.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The fibre architecture and nature of the planar, flat fibrous performs have been selected such that each of the lateral surfaces <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> of reinforcing structural profile <b>10</b> has a precisely defined layer composition.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Having been aligned and adjusted to yield the desired fibre architecture, and formed to produce the essentially square cross section as shown, the structure in this case was closed using a continuously operating feed-off-the-arm stitcher. The stitches <b>20</b> created serve to stabilise the material and enable it to be processed further in the dry state.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The &#x201c;tube&#x201d; created thereby may for example be draped over a core in a subsequent step. In this context, the seam continues to lend the textile pre-product flexibility and drapability.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">However, the positions of the individual side walls are positioned precisely by the seam. The dry tube may be cut to the size required for the core material that is to be assembled. Other aids, e.g. draping tools or trimming templates may thus be dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> both represent an essentially planar shell structure, having the form of a helicopter floor panel, which is to be reinforced.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is apparent that the use of a semi-finished product manufactured according to the method of the invention will enable all struts and ribs to be introduced. The individual &#x201c;strips&#x201d; thus represent unit elements, which may be cut to size to match the construction and local nature of the floor (anchor points, tank ring, cover for load hook, etc.), placed on a core and hardened. Solid core materials may then be inserted (between the ribs) for exact positioning.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the example shown, longitudinal ribs <b>24</b> and transverse ribs <b>26</b> are provided as reinforcement on a cover layer <b>22</b>. Reference number <b>28</b> indicates additional reinforcing patches for local reinforcement, and reference number <b>30</b> indicates an exemplary arrangement of the profiles to form a reinforcing group, e.g. a frame for a load hook.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After the individual reinforcing elements and other functional groups have been positioned, the component is infiltrated and hardened in a vacuum infusion technique.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to create the &#x201c;carbon fibre floor&#x201d; sandwich panel, the top or bottom shell is also bonded to a cover layer <b>32</b> in an infiltration process.</p>
