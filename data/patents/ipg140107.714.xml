<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2006-0108949, filed Nov. 6, 2006, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a washing machine having balancers, and more particularly, to a washing machine, which reduces the vibration of a tub generated by the partial disposition of laundry in a dehydrating operation, and a method of controlling the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, washing machines, usually drum washing machines, are apparatuses that wash laundry by power generated when laundry is lifted and then dropped. A conventional drum washing machine includes a tub installed in a housing, which forms the external appearance of the washing machine, to contain water, a drum rotatably installed in the tub containing laundry, and a motor generating a driving force for rotating the drum.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such a drum washing machine, when the drum is rotated at a high speed in a dehydrating operation under a condition that the laundry is not uniformly distributed in the drum, but is clustered on a specific part of the drum, the drum is eccentrically rotated on a rotary shaft and collides with the tub, thus generating vibration and noise. When repeated, parts of the washing machine including the drum and the tub are out of order or life spans of the parts are shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the above problems, Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 1999-0038279 discloses a washing machine having balancers, which are provided on front and rear ends of a drum so as to reduce the vibration of a tub caused by the eccentric rotation of the drum.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each of the balancers of the washing machine disclosed by the above Publication comprises a race installed on the front or rear end of the drum maintaining the dynamic balance of the drum when the drum is rotated at a high speed, balls made of steel and installed in the races such that they can move freely, and a viscous oil filling the inside of the race for adjusting the momentum of the balls. The race is formed by bonding ring-shaped upper and lower plates.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, when the drum is rotated under a condition that the drum cannot maintain its dynamic balance due to the unbalanced eccentric structure of the drum and the partial disposition of laundry in the drum, the balls made of steel compensate for the imbalance of the drum, thus allowing the drum to maintain the dynamic balance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Each of the balancers of the conventional washing machine has a multi-race including at least two race parts, an inner race part and an outer race part, preventing the excessive vibration of the tub generated when the balls reach a balancing position, and the viscous oils having different viscosities and the balls having different sizes respectively filling the race parts, thus having high production costs. Further, the constitution of the races preventing the excessive vibration of the tub is not determined by precise calculation, but only reduces the probability of the vibration of the tub. Thus, the possibility of generating excessive vibration of the tub still remains. Accordingly, in order to further reduce the probability of the excessive vibration of the tub, a larger number of race parts are required.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, one aspect of the invention is to provide a washing machine having balancers and a method of controlling the same, in which the number of rotations of a motor is maintained to a designated number of rotations, before the excessive vibration of a tub occurs, for a designated time until balls in the balancers reach a balancing position in order to prevent the excessive vibration of the tub before the balls reach the balancing position, thus reducing the excessive vibration of the tub.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another aspect of the invention is to provide a washing machine having balancers and a method of controlling the same, in which the number of rotations of a motor is maintained to a designated number of rotations, before the excessive vibration of a tub occurs, for a designated time so as to pass a point, at which the excessive vibration of the tub occurs, each of the balancers employing a single race, instead of a multi-race, so as to reduce production costs, and the excessive vibration of the tub is prevented by a control operation, instead of a probability, so as to effectively reduce the excessive vibration of the tub.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additional aspects and/or advantages will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The foregoing and/or other aspect, are achieved by providing a method of controlling a washing machine having balancers, comprising: sensing a rotational speed of a motor; determining whether or not the sensed rotational speed of the motor reaches a designated rotational speed comprising comparing the sensed rotational speed of the motor with the designated rotational speed; and controlling the motor such that the rotational speed of the motor is maintained at the designated rotational speed when it is determined that the sensed rotational speed of the motor reaches the designated rotational speed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The sensing of the number of rotations of the motor comprises sensing the number of rotations of the motor driven for performing a dehydrating operation of the washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The designated number of rotations is lower than a number of rotations generating the excessive vibration of the tub in a dehydrating operation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The number of rotations generating the excessive vibration of the tub is the number of rotations of the motor at a point, at which the tub is excessively vibrated due to a difference of rotational speeds between a drum and balls in the balancers before the balls reach a balancing position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The controlling of the motor such that the number of rotations of the motor is maintained to the designated number of rotations comprises maintaining the number of rotations of the motor to a designated number of rotations prior to at a point, at which the tub is excessively vibrated, generated in a dehydrating operation of the washing machine so as to pass the point.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The method may further comprise increasing the number of rotations of the motor, after the controlling of the motor such that the number of rotations of the motor is maintained to the designated number of rotations.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The increasing of the number of rotations of the motor comprises maintaining the number of rotations of the motor to the designated number of rotations for a designated time, and then increasing the number of rotations of the motor to a dehydrating rpm for performing a dehydrating operation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The increasing of the number of rotations of the motor comprises increasing the number of rotations of the motor to a dehydrating rpm for performing a dehydrating operation by checking a variation of the vibration of the tub due to a difference of rotational speeds between a drum and balls in the balancers while the number of rotations of the motor is maintained to the designated number of rotations.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The foregoing and/or other aspects are also achieved by providing a washing machine, comprising: a motor; a plurality of balancers; a number sensing unit sensing the number of rotations of the motor per minute; and a control unit comparing the sensed number of rotations of the motor per minute with a designated rotational speed per minute, and controlling the motor such that the number of rotations of the motor is maintained at the designated rotational speed when the sensed rotational speed of the motor reaches the designated rotational speed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The number sensing unit senses the number of rotations of the motor driven for performing a dehydrating operation of the washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The designated number of rotations is predetermined to be lower than a number of rotations generating the excessive vibration of the tub in a dehydrating operation of the washing machine, by the control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The number of rotations generating the excessive vibration of the tub is the number of rotations of the motor at a point, at which the tub is excessively vibrated due to a difference of rotational speeds between a drum and balls in the balancers before the balls reach a balancing position.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The control unit controls the motor such that the number of rotations of the motor is maintained to a designated number of rotations prior to at a point, at which the tub is excessively vibrated, generated in a dehydrating operation of the washing machine so as to pass the point.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The control unit maintains the number of rotations of the motor to the designated number of rotations for a designated time, and then increases the number of rotations of the motor to a dehydrating rpm for performing a dehydrating operation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The control unit increases the number of rotations of the motor to a dehydrating rpm for performing a dehydrating operation by checking a variation of the vibration of the tub due to a difference of rotational speeds between a drum and balls in the balancers while the number of rotations of the motor is maintained to the designated number of rotations.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiment of the present invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The embodiment is described below to explain the present invention by referring to the annexed drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view of a washing machine having balancers in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a washing machine having balancers in accordance with the present invention comprises a tub <b>20</b> installed in a housing <b>10</b> forming the external appearance of the washing machine containing washing water, a drum <b>30</b> rotatably installed in the tub <b>20</b> containing laundry, and a door <b>40</b> hinged to one side of the opened front surface of the housing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A water supply valve <b>12</b> supplying washing water to the tub <b>20</b> and a detergent supply device <b>14</b> supplying a detergent to the tub <b>20</b> are installed above the tub <b>20</b>. Further, a drain pump <b>16</b> discharging the washing water contained in the tub <b>20</b> to the outside of the housing <b>10</b> after the washing of the laundry is completed is installed below the tub <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A rotary shaft <b>51</b> is extended from the rear surface of the drum <b>30</b> through the rear surface of the tub <b>20</b>, and a motor <b>50</b>, to which the rotary shaft <b>51</b> is connected, is installed at the outside of the rear surface of the tub <b>20</b>. Accordingly, when the motor <b>50</b> is driven, the rotary shaft <b>51</b> is rotated, thus rotating the drum <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A plurality of dehydration holes <b>30</b><i>a </i>are formed through the circumferential surface of the drum <b>30</b>. In a washing operation, the washing water contained in the tub <b>20</b> is supplied to the inside of the drum <b>30</b> through the dehydration holes <b>30</b><i>a </i>so that the laundry contained in the drum <b>30</b> can be washed with the washing water, in which the detergent dissolves, and in a dehydrating operation, the washing water is discharged to the outside of the housing <b>10</b> through the dehydration holes <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the drain pump <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A plurality of lifters <b>30</b><i>b </i>are disposed in the lengthwise direction in the drum <b>30</b>. In the washing operation, when the drum <b>30</b> is rotated at a low speed, the lifters <b>30</b><i>b </i>lift laundry, which is wet, upwardly from the bottom of the drum <b>30</b> and then drops the laundry to the bottom, thus allowing the laundry to be effectively washed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, in the washing operation, the rotary shaft <b>51</b> is rotated alternately in opposite directions by the motor <b>50</b>, and thus the drum <b>30</b> is rotated at a low speed, thereby washing the laundry. Further, in the dehydrating operation, the rotary shaft <b>51</b> is rotated in one direction of the motor <b>50</b>, and thus the drum <b>30</b> is rotated at a high speed, thereby dehydrating the laundry.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the dehydrating operation, when the drum <b>30</b> is rotated at a high speed, the center of gravity of the drum <b>30</b> does not coincide with the center of rotation of the drum <b>30</b>, or the laundry in the drum <b>30</b> is not uniformly distributed but is clustered on a specific part. In this case, the drum <b>30</b> is eccentrically rotated on the rotary shaft <b>51</b>, and cannot maintain its dynamic balance.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In order to prevent the above dynamic imbalance of the drum <b>30</b>, balancers <b>60</b> stabilizing the rotation of the drum <b>30</b> are respectively installed at the front and rear ends of the drum <b>30</b>, thus allowing the drum <b>30</b> to be rotated at a high speed under a condition that the center of gravity of the drum <b>30</b> coincides with the center of rotation of the drum <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the drum of the washing machine of the embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of the drum, in an assembled state, of the embodiment of the washing machine of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the drum <b>30</b> includes a cylindrical body <b>31</b>, front and rear portions of which are opened, provided with the dehydration holes <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the lifters <b>30</b><i>b</i>, a front member <b>32</b> connected to the opened front portion of the body <b>31</b> and provided with an opening <b>34</b>, through which laundry is put into or taken out of the body <b>31</b>, and a rear member <b>33</b>, to which the rotary shaft <b>51</b> rotating the drum <b>30</b> is connected, connected to the opened rear portion of the body <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A ring-shaped recess <b>35</b> having an approximately U-shaped section and opened forward containing the balancer <b>60</b> is formed in the edge of the front member <b>32</b>, and a ring-shaped recess (not shown) having an approximately U-shaped section and opened backward for containing the balancer <b>60</b> is formed in the edge of the rear member <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the front member <b>32</b> and the rear member <b>33</b> are inserted into the rims of the front and rear ends of the body <b>31</b>, and are connected to the body <b>31</b> with screws or by other methods.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The balancers <b>60</b> are installed in the recess <b>35</b> of the front member <b>32</b> and the recess (not shown) of the rear member <b>33</b>. Each of the balancers <b>60</b> includes a ring-shaped single race, and a plurality of balls <b>61</b> made of, for example, steel, which are installed in the race and have a balancing function, and a viscous oil (not shown) filling the race adjusting the moving speed of the balls <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The balls <b>61</b> are installed in the race such that the balls <b>61</b> can move in the circumferential direction. When the dynamic imbalance of the drum <b>30</b> occurs, the balls <b>61</b> move in the circumferential direction to a position, which is symmetrically opposite to the position of the drum <b>30</b> where the dynamic imbalance of the drum <b>30</b> occurs, thus reducing the vibration of the drum <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a control diagram of the washing machine of the embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the washing machine of the embodiment of the present invention includes a signal input unit <b>100</b>, a vibration sensing unit <b>110</b>, a control unit <b>120</b>, a driving unit <b>130</b>, and a number sensing unit <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The signal input unit <b>100</b> allows a user to input operation data, such as a washing course, which is selected by the user according to the material of laundry, (for example, a delicate washing course or a standard washing course), a washing temperature, a dehydrating rpm, and the addition of a rinsing course, to the control unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The vibration sensing unit <b>110</b> senses the vibration of the tub <b>20</b>, which varies while the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> is maintained at a designated number of rotations per minute (W-RPM, approximately 160&#x2dc;270 rpm) before the excessive vibration of the tub <b>20</b> occurs (the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> when the excessive vibration of the tub <b>20</b> occurs (A-RPM) is approximately 270 rpm) until the balls <b>61</b> reach a balancing position (opposite to the position where laundry (W) is partially disposed in the drum <b>30</b>), in order to prevent the excessive vibration of the tub <b>20</b> before the balls <b>61</b> reach the balancing position in a dehydrating operation. Thereby, a signal waveform of a vibration frequency, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The vibration frequency of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> exhibits a signal waveform generated by modulation due to a difference between the rotational speed (RPM<b>1</b>) of the drum <b>30</b> and the rotational speed (RPM<b>2</b>) of the balls <b>61</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The control unit <b>120</b> may be, for example, is a microcomputer, which controls the washing machine according to the operation data input from the signal input unit <b>100</b>. The control unit <b>120</b> controls the motor <b>50</b> such that the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> is maintained at a designated number of rotations per minute (W-RPM) for a designated time (a time calculated based on a time to reach a number of rotations per minute generating the excessive vibration of the tub <b>20</b> from the designated number of rotations per minute) so as to pass a point of the excessive vibration of the tub <b>20</b> in the dehydrating operation, and then to increase the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> to rotate the drum <b>30</b> at a high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The driving unit <b>130</b> drives the water supply valve <b>12</b>, the drain pump <b>16</b>, and the motor <b>50</b> according to driving control signals of the control unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The number sensing unit <b>140</b> senses the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> and inputs the sensed number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> to the control unit <b>120</b> detecting the rotational speed (RPM<b>1</b>) of the drum <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Hereinafter, a method of controlling the above-described washing machine and functions and effect of the washing machine and the method of controlling the same will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of controlling a washing machine having balancers to reduce excessive vibration of a tub in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">First, whether or not the washing machine is performing in a dehydrating operation is determined (S<b>200</b>). When it is determined that the washing machine is performing in the dehydrating operation, the control unit <b>120</b> drives the motor <b>50</b> through the driving unit <b>130</b>, and a dehydrating rotation of the drum <b>30</b> is started by the driving of the motor <b>50</b> (S<b>210</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the dehydrating rotation of the drum <b>30</b> is started by the driving of the motor <b>50</b>, the rotational speed of the drum <b>30</b> is increased. In an initial rotating stage, since the viscous oil (not shown) filling the balancers <b>60</b> cannot push up the balls <b>61</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a difference between the rotational speed (RPM<b>1</b>) of the drum <b>30</b> and the rotational speed (RPM<b>2</b>) of the balls <b>61</b> occurs. Due to the above difference between the rotational speed (RPM<b>1</b>) of the drum <b>30</b> and the rotational speed (RPM<b>2</b>) of the balls <b>61</b>, there is a resonance point, at which the tub <b>20</b> is excessively vibrated before the balls <b>61</b> reach the balancing position.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Accordingly, in the dehydrating operation, the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> is maintained to the constant number of rotations per minute (W-RPM) prior to the number of rotations per minute (A-RPM) of the resonance point, i.e., the point, at which the tub <b>20</b> is excessively vibrated, until the balls <b>61</b> reach the balancing position. Thereby, the point at which the tub <b>20</b> is excessively vibrated, is passed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In more detail, when the dehydrating rotation of the drum <b>30</b> is started, the number sensing unit <b>140</b> senses the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b>, and inputs the sensed number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> to the control unit <b>120</b> (S<b>220</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Thereafter, the control unit <b>120</b> compares the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> sensed by the number sensing unit <b>140</b> with a designated number of rotations per minute (W-RPM), which is stored, and determines whether or not the sensed number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> reaches the designated number of rotations per minute (W-RPM) (S<b>230</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As a result of the determination, when the sensed number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> reaches the designated number of rotations per minute (W-RPM), the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> is maintained, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (S<b>240</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph illustrating control of the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> to reduce excessive vibration of the tub <b>20</b> in the washing machine of the embodiment of the present invention. The number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> is maintained at the designated number of rotations per minute (W-RPM) before the excessive vibration of the tub <b>20</b> occurs, thus waiting until the balls <b>61</b> reach the balancing position.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the balls <b>61</b> reach the balancing position by maintaining the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> at the designated number of rotations per minute (W-RPM).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">While the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> is maintained at the designated number of rotations per minute (W-RPM), the signal waveform, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, can be obtained with a component sensing a variation of speed or vibration of the tub <b>20</b> (for example, the vibration sensing unit).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The vibration frequency of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> exhibits a signal waveform generated by modulation due to a difference between the rotational speed (RPM<b>1</b>) of the drum <b>30</b> and the rotational speed (RPM<b>2</b>) of the balls <b>61</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the vibration of the tub <b>20</b> does not exceed a designated reference value, and the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> in which the modulation due to a difference between the rotational speed (RPM<b>1</b>) of the drum <b>30</b> and the rotational speed (RPM<b>2</b>) of the balls <b>61</b> is easily found is set.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The control unit <b>120</b> measures a time for maintaining the number of the motor <b>50</b> at the designated number of rotations per minute (W-RPM), and determines whether or not the measured time exceeds a designated time (t<b>1</b>) (S<b>250</b>). When it is determined that the measured time exceeds the designated time (t<b>1</b>), the dehydrating operation is performed while increasing the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> to a dehydrating RPM (S<b>260</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Here, the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> may be maintained at the designated number of rotations per minute (W-RPM) for the designated time (t<b>1</b>) predetermined by the control unit <b>120</b>, and be increased again. Further, the control unit <b>120</b> may continuously check the signal waveform of the vibration frequency, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and increase the number of rotations per minute of the motor <b>50</b> before a lowermost signal point at which the vibration frequency reaches the lowermost value.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thereafter, when the dehydrating operation is completed (S<b>270</b>), the driving of the motor <b>50</b> is stopped (S<b>280</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Although the embodiment of the present invention describes the dehydrating operation for reducing the excessive vibration of the tub <b>20</b>, the present invention is not limited thereto. That is, the present invention may be applied to any operation, in which the vibration of the tub <b>20</b> occurs before the balls <b>61</b> of the washing machine having the balancers <b>60</b> reach the balancing position.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As apparent from the above description, the embodiment of the present invention provides a washing machine having balancers preventing the excessive vibration of a tub before balls reach a balancing position and a method of controlling the same, in which the number of rotations per minute of a motor is maintained to a designated number of rotations per minute, before the excessive vibration of the tub occurs, for a designated time so as to pass a point, at which the excessive vibration of the tub occurs, each of the balancers does employs a single race, instead of a multi-race, so as to reduce production costs, and the excessive vibration of the tub is prevented by a control operation, instead of a probability, so as to effectively reduce the excessive vibration of the tub.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Although embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in this embodiment without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.</p>
