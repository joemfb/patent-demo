<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Next, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described based on the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> show an image forming apparatus <b>10</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The image forming apparatus <b>10</b> has an image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>. An image forming part <b>120</b> to form an image on a print sheet used as a recording medium and a paper feeding device <b>160</b> to supply the sheet to the image forming part <b>120</b> are provided in in the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>. Further, a conveyance passage <b>180</b> is formed in the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>. Further, the image forming apparatus <b>10</b> has a document reading device <b>300</b> to read a document, a discharge part <b>400</b> on which a print sheet on which an image has been formed is discharged, a buffer device <b>500</b>, an operation panel <b>700</b> used as an operation part for operation of the image forming apparatus <b>10</b>, and a data input terminal <b>20</b> to input image data from an external device such as a personal computer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The image forming apparatus <b>10</b> forms an image on a print sheet based on image data read with the document reading device <b>300</b>, and forms an image on a print sheet based on image data inputted from the data input terminal <b>20</b>. Further, the image forming apparatus <b>10</b>, which is connectible to e.g. a telephone line, forms an image on a print sheet based on image data inputted via e.g. a telephone line. Further, the image forming apparatus <b>10</b> transmits image data read with the document reading device <b>300</b> via e.g. a telephone line, and transmits data inputted from the data input terminal <b>20</b> via e.g. a telephone line.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>, a supply opening/closing part <b>80</b>, used as an opening/closing part opened/closed to the side of the operation panel <b>700</b>, is attached to a front side (left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) surface. The supply opening/closing part <b>80</b> is attached using a hinge <b>86</b> so as to be opened/closed with respect to the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>. Further, an opening <b>82</b> is formed toward the front side is formed in the supply opening/closing part <b>80</b>. Further, a paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> used as an opening/closing part opened/closed to the side of the operation panel <b>700</b> is attached in the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>. The paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> is attached to the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b> using the hinge <b>86</b> as in the case of the supply opening/closing part <b>80</b>. When the opening <b>82</b> of the supply opening/closing part <b>80</b> is opened/closed and the opening <b>82</b> is opened/closed, the front side of the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b> is opened/closed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the both supply opening/closing part <b>80</b> and the paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> can be closed with respect to the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the supply opening/closing part <b>80</b> can be closed with respect to the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b> and the paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> can be opened with respect to the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b> (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Further, the supply opening/closing part <b>80</b> and the paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> can be integrally opened with respect to the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a rotation center <b>88</b> of the supply opening/closing part <b>80</b> and the paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> is positioned on the center C<b>2</b> side from a center C<b>1</b> of the operation panel <b>700</b> in the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>. Accordingly, in comparison with a case where the rotation center <b>88</b> is positioned on the opposite side to the center C<b>2</b> side of the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b> from the center C<b>1</b> of the operation panel <b>700</b>, or a case where the rotation center <b>88</b> is positioned so as to overlap the center C<b>1</b> of the operation panel <b>700</b> in a vertical direction, the area of installation of the image forming apparatus <b>10</b> is reduced when the paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> is opened and when the supply opening/closing part <b>80</b> and the paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> are opened.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, in the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>, an edge <b>39</b> of the bottom surface <b>38</b> on the operation panel <b>700</b> side is positioned on the center C<b>2</b> side of the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b> from the center C<b>1</b> of the operation panel <b>700</b>. Accordingly, in comparison with a case when the edge <b>39</b> is positioned on the opposite side to the center C<b>2</b> side of the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b> from the center C<b>1</b> of the operation panel <b>700</b> or when the edge <b>39</b> is positioned to overlap the center C<b>1</b> of the operation panel <b>700</b> in the vertical direction, the area of installation of the image forming apparatus <b>10</b> is reduced in a status where the supply opening/closing part <b>80</b> and the paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> are closed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, in the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>, the area of the bottom surface <b>38</b> projected on a mounting surface <b>800</b> is smaller than the area of the upward surface <b>34</b> projected on a mounting surface <b>800</b>. Accordingly, in comparison with a case when the area of the bottom surface <b>38</b> projected on the mounting surface <b>800</b> is larger than the area of the upward surface <b>34</b> projected on the mounting surface <b>800</b> or when the area of the upward surface <b>34</b> projected on the mounting surface <b>800</b> and the area of the bottom surface <b>38</b> projected on the mounting surface <b>800</b> are the same, the area of installation of the image forming apparatus <b>10</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The data input terminal <b>20</b> is arranged in e.g. a front side surface of the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The image forming part <b>120</b> has a photoreceptor drum <b>122</b> used as an image holder, a charging device <b>124</b> to charge the surface of the photoreceptor drum <b>122</b>, a latent image forming device <b>126</b> to form a latent image on the surface of the photoreceptor drum <b>122</b> by emitting light on the surface of the photoreceptor drum <b>122</b> charged with the charging device <b>124</b>, a developing device <b>128</b> to develop the latent image formed with the latent image forming device <b>126</b> on the surface of the photoreceptor drum <b>122</b> using a developer, a transfer device <b>130</b> to transfer a developer image formed by development with the developing device <b>128</b> on the surface of the photoreceptor drum <b>122</b> to a print sheet, a cleaning device <b>132</b> to clean the developer remaining on the surface of the photoreceptor drum <b>122</b> after the transfer with the transfer device <b>130</b>, and a fixing device <b>140</b> to fix the developer image, transferred to the sheet with the transfer device <b>130</b>, to the sheet. A developer contained in a developer container <b>144</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to be described later is supplied to the developing device <b>128</b> using a developer conveyance device (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The paper feeding device <b>160</b> has e.g. one sheet container <b>162</b> and a feed roller <b>164</b> to feed a sheet contained in the sheet container <b>162</b>. To set a print sheet in a predetermined or larger size in the sheet container <b>162</b>, the paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> is opened, and when such print sheet is set, the rear end side of the print sheet protrudes from the image forming apparatus main body <b>30</b>, and the protruded part of the print sheet is supported with the paper-feed opening/closing part <b>84</b> from the lower side in the gravitational direction.</p>
